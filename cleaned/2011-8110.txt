REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS DURING APPENDIX B. STATISTICAL TABLES RELATING TO INCOME EMPLOYMENT AND PRODUCTION ____________ * For a detailed table of contents of the Council s Report see page iii economic report of the president economic report of the president To the Congress of the United States : As we begin a new year the country is still emerging from the worst recession in generations. Across the nation millions lost their jobs their businesses and their sense of security about the future. Many have had to put off their plans for a better life : going to college buying a new home or retiring after a long career At the same time we ve seen encouraging signs that the recovery is beginning to take hold. An economy that had been shrinking for a year is now growing again. After two years of job losses our economy added more than one million private sector jobs in Yet as we all are too well aware the recovery is not happening fast enough. Millions of Americans our neighbors friends family members are still looking for jobs. This means that the most immediate task must be to get our fellow Americans back to work by accelerating economic growth and job creation by the private sector That s why at the end of last year I signed into law a measure to prevent taxes from rising on middle-class families and to create new incentives for businesses to create jobs. This bipartisan compromise cut payroll taxes for million workers prevented a $ tax increase from going into effect on the typical working family and extended important tax credits to help families make ends meet and send their kids to college The law also extended unemployment insurance preventing million Americans from losing their benefits as they look for new work and gave businesses two powerful incentives to invest and create jobs. These were percent expensing of investment expenditures and an extension of the research and experimentation tax credit I proposed an up-front investment in building new roads rails and runways to upgrade our infrastructure and create new jobs. And last month I laid out a commonsense approach to regulation that is pragmatic Economic Report of the President | based on evidence and driven by data that will help lay the groundwork for economic growth and job creation while continuing to protect our health safety and environment. In addition my Administration has moved aggressively to open markets abroad and boost exports of American goods and services These steps will help the economy this year. But it is also essential that we take stock and look to the future to what kind of America we want to see emerge from this crisis and take shape for the generations of Americans to come We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time. We know what we have to do to win the future. We need to out-innovate out-educate and out-build the rest of the world. We have to make America the best place on Earth to do business. We need to rein in deficits after a decade of rising debt and reform our government. This is the way to robust and widely shared prosperity The first step in winning the future is encouraging American innovation. That is ultimately driven by free enterprise. But public support also plays an essential role in encouraging innovative research and development. It holds incredible promise for our future. That is why throughout history our government has provided cutting-edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need. This is what planted the seeds for the Internet. This is what helped make possible breakthroughs like computer chips and GPS Two years ago I set a goal for America : that we needed to reach a level of research and development we haven t seen since the height of the Space Race. And this year my budget helps us meet that goal. We ll invest in biomedical research information technology and especially clean energy technology an investment that will strengthen our security protect our planet and create countless new jobs for our people We ve begun to reinvent our energy policy. We re telling America s scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy we ll fund the Apollo Projects of our time. We re doing this through investments in innovation hubs across America. These are teams of scientists focused on one difficult problem. We re also supporting the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy modeled on a successful defense agency that has developed cutting-edge technologies for decades In addition clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they re | Economic Report of the President selling. So in my State of the Union I called on Congress to join me in setting a new goal : by percent of America s electricity will come from clean energy sources The second part of our strategy is education. Over the next ten years nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school degree. And yet as many as a quarter of our students aren t even finishing high school. The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations. And so the question is whether all of us as citizens and as parents are willing to do what s necessary to give every child a chance to succeed Of course our schools share this responsibility. When a child walks into a classroom it should be a place of high expectations and high performance. Yet too many schools in our country don t meet this threshold test That s why we launched a competition called Race to the Top. Race to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation For less than one percent of what we spend on education each year it has led over states to raise their standards for teaching and learning Next because an increasing number of jobs require more than a high school diploma higher education must be within reach of every American. So we ve ended the taxpayer subsidies that went to banks to act as a middleman in the student loan process and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students. And this year we will work to make permanent our tuition tax credit worth $ for four years of college. We are also revitalizing America s community colleges which will help us reach the goal I set two years ago : by the end of the decade America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world The third step in winning the future is rebuilding America. To attract new businesses to our shores we need the fastest most reliable ways to move people goods and information from high-speed rail to high-speed internet. That is why over the last two years we have begun rebuilding for the 21st century a project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hard-hit construction industry We will put more Americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges. We will make sure this is fully paid for attract private investment and pick projects based on what s best for the economy not politicians Within years our goal is to give percent of Americans access to highspeed rail which could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car. Routes in California and the Midwest are already underway Economic Report of the President | And within the next five years we will also make it possible for business to deploy the next generation of high-speed wireless coverage to percent of all Americans All these investments in innovation education and infrastructure will make America a better place to do business and create jobs. But to help our companies compete we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success To help businesses sell more products abroad we set a goal of doubling our exports by My Administration has worked to knock down barriers our exporters face and advocated for U.S. exporters abroad resulting in signing important deals to sell more American goods and services to China and India. And in December we finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least American jobs. This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor Democrats and Republicans and I ve asked Congress to pass it as soon as possible. Finally we are also pursuing agreements with Panama and Colombia and continuing our Asia Pacific and global trade talks To reduce barriers to growth and investment I ve ordered a review of government regulations. When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses we will fix them. But I will not hesitate to create or enforce commonsense safeguards to protect the American people. That s what we ve done in this country for more than a century from child labor laws to protections for our air and water. It s why last year we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another financial crisis. And it s why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients The final step in winning the future is to make sure we aren t buried under a mountain of debt. We are living with a legacy of deficit-spending that began almost a decade ago. And in the wake of the financial crisis some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing save jobs and put money in people s pockets That is why in my Budget I ve proposed that government live within its means while investing in the future. I have promised to veto any bill that contains earmarks. I ve proposed freezing annual domestic spending for the next five years. This would reduce the deficit by more than $ billion over the next decade and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was President | Economic Report of the President Yet at the same time we can not solve our fiscal problems on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens. And it would also be a mistake to cut the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education which are so critical for our future prosperity. The fact is priorities like education innovation and infrastructure have traditionally commanded bipartisan support. There are no inherent ideological differences that should prevent Democrats and Republicans from improving our economy We are all Americans and we are all in this race together we can focus on what is necessary for America to win the future For as difficult as the times may be the good news is that we know what the future could look like for the United States. We can see it in the classrooms that are experimenting with groundbreaking reforms and giving children new math and science skills at an early age. We can see it in the wind farms solar plants and advanced battery plants that are opening across America. We can see it in the laboratories and research facilities all over this country that are churning out discoveries and turning them into new start-ups and new jobs Our job is simply to harness the potential that exists all across this country and this economic report lays out the policies that will help our nation succeed by doing exactly that. In the subsequent chapters we will look at the progress that has been made over the past year. In addition this report will lay out many of the policies that will foster growth and make our economy more competitive. That is our great challenge today. And I am absolutely confident it is one we will meet the white house february Economic Report of the President | the annual report of the council of economic advisers letter of transmittal Council of Economic Advisers Washington D.C.

Contents | C H A P T E R FROM CRISIS TO RECOVERY AND GROWTH T he recession that began at the end of was both the longest and the worst since the Great Depression more than years ago. By some measures such as the total jobs lost it was as deep as the past three recessions combined It was a breathtaking moment of free fall in the private sector. Capital markets collapsed. Credit to businesses froze. Banks failed. Foreclosures soared. National output fell at rates not seen in decades. And millions of people lost their jobs Policymakers in the Administration Congress and the Federal Reserve responded with aggressive concerted actions to stop the crisis Although there will likely be debates over the impact of each of those responses for decades to come few can dispute that the economic climate has improved substantially from the darkest days at the end of and the beginning of in large part because of these actions. And the Nation s economy did not fall into depression As gross domestic product ( GDP ) has been recovering and as the private sector has added more than million jobs since the beginning of economic policy has shifted from crisis to recovery and fostering growth This year the Economic Report of the President puts its primary focus on the particular moment in which the Nation now finds itself a moment when the most important priority is reestablishing the primacy of broadbased growth to ensure the well-being of the American people and to keep America the premier economy on Earth Without question growing our way out of the hole left by the crisis will take a determined effort across industries states and localities and the Federal Government. Data from many countries over many years document how painful the emergence from a deep financial crisis can be. The challenges today have been heightened by the need to confront multiple pressures many of which are lingering effects of the crisis itself : financial woes in Europe continued weakness in the U.S. housing market depleted state and local government budgets and the need to improve the Nation s long-term fiscal situation. And yet the American economy has now been growing for more than a year and a half. The private sector as of this writing has added jobs for consecutive months. The economy must grow faster but certainly this is movement in the right direction The challenge will be to shift the focus of the U.S. recovery away from the boom-and-bust cycles of the recent past toward more sustainable growth. In particular from to the two overwhelming drivers of growth were increased consumer spending and investment in residential real estate. Each was unsustainable. Consumption spending grew faster than income and the personal saving rate fell dangerously close to zero The bursting of the housing bubble left millions of vacant homes and lowered home prices such that investment in the housing sector is still struggling to recover Figure Unsustainable Expansion : Recent Boom vs. Past Booms Share of contributions to growth Personal consumption expenditures Residential investment Exports Business fixed investment Note : The figure shows the share of contribution to GDP growth from : Q1 to : Q4 minus the share of contribution to growth from : Q2 to : Q1 Source : Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts Figure shows how imbalanced the early 2000s were relative to normal expansions in the second half of the 20th century. It illustrates the share that personal consumption residential investment exports and | Chapter nonresidential business fixed investment contributed to GDP growth during the five years following the business cycle peak in : Q1 relative to the past averages. Consumption and residential investment were dramatically outsized contributors to GDP growth during the recent boom compared to the past. Business investment and exports were dramatically undersized U.S. nonresidential investment and exports during were weak not only relative to our own history but also relative to other major economies. Figure shows that U.S. nonresidential investment barely grew at all over those years. Nonresidential investment grew faster in other G-7 countries than in the United States and grew even faster in a broader set of advanced economies Figure U.S. Investment Growth Lagged Other Major Economies Growth ( percent ) United States Other G-7 All other advanced OECD Note : Cumulative growth in real gross private nonresidential fixed capital formation Sources : OECD Economic Outlook no. Annex Table ; CEA calculations Figure shows the cumulative growth of exports from the United States during compared with export growth in other highincome economies and other major exporters. Clearly U.S. export growth in the early 2000s was weak relative to export growth in other major economies The Nation can do better and the Administration has outlined a plan to enable it to do so. It is important to remember that the recent consumption and residential booms were aberrations. The goal now is to return to more sustainable sources of growth where nonresidential business investment and exports take a more central role. To help business investment reclaim this role as a key driver of growth the Administration has made extensive From Crisis to Recovery and Growth | efforts to encourage businesses to invest at home through tax policy credit policy and the public investments that make the United States an attractive place to do business. With the momentum of the recovery building among our trading partners the Administration also believes that we should turn to greater exports as an important source of growth going forward Figure U.S. Export Growth Lagged Other Top Exporters Growth ( percent ) United States Other advanced top exporters Other advanced and emerging top exporters Notes : Cumulative growth in exports of goods and services This analysis of the top exporters excludes Belgium due to lack of data prior to Sources : World Bank World Development Indicators ; CEA calculations The United States established itself as the premier economic power in the world based on the energy and ingenuity of its people and the Administration will continue to reinforce this foundation of our growth educating workers investing in science and building the infrastructure that American companies need to succeed. As the President says with the policies in place to support innovation and sustained economic growth the United States will win the future. This Economic Report follows these themes in greater detail and also examines other key aspects of the economy as described below The Year in Review and the Years Ahead Coming out of the deepest recession since the 1930s the economy completed its sixth consecutive quarter of recovery by the end of as described in Chapter Real GDP grew percent during the four quarters of up from percent a year earlier. During stress in financial | Chapter markets eased the stock market gained percent and the economy added million private sector jobs Recent growth in consumer spending reflects improvements in sentiment in the stock market and in banks willingness to lend to consumers thus easing many of the adverse shocks received during the recession. The increase in consumer spending has been achieved without a significant decline in the personal saving rate Housing prices have stabilized but construction activity and most aspects of the housing market remain weak about one-quarter of mortgages are under water and the foreclosure rate remains high Equipment and software investment grew rapidly during but investment in business structures did not. Cash flow is strong. The inventory investment contribution to real GDP growth has moderated. Export growth has been strong Government policy has supported the recovery during and and the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act the compromise tax framework signed into law by the President on December will help the economy in The position of state and local governments however remains difficult. At the same time long-run fiscal responsibility is crucial and the Administration has taken a number of steps to reduce deficits in coming years Private sector employment grew in each of the final months of and the unemployment rate fell during The Recovery Act the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act and the Education Jobs and Medicaid Assistance Act all helped to increase employment The Administration s economic forecast reflects the view that the U.S economy is operating substantially below its potential level as indicated by the elevated unemployment rate. Although the Administration estimates that the potential growth rate of real GDP is percent it believes that real GDP can grow faster over the next six years as the gap between actual and potential GDP declines. Reflecting this above-trend growth the Administration projects that the unemployment rate will continue to fall over time The Foundations of Growth As the United States begins to shift from crisis to recovery and growth the Nation needs to make critical investments in innovation infrastructure and skills. Chapter details Administration policies in these areas that are designed to deliver rapid sustained and broad-based economic growth and quality jobs in the years ahead From Crisis to Recovery and Growth | The historical rise in American standards of living in broad measures of income per person in health and longevity and in the variety of goods and services that Americans consume demonstrates the power of long-run trends over short-run economic cycles in determining Americans economic prosperity. Physical capital ( investment ) human capital ( skills ) and innovation are the primary sources of economic growth but have been neglected for years. To foster innovation the Administration is proposing critical investments in basic research intellectual property rights antitrust enforcement research tax credits entrepreneurship and national priority areas such as biotechnology and nanotechnology health information technology and clean energy. These investments work to ensure that the private sector the Nation s engine of innovation is not saddled by market failures but can forcefully and efficiently drive America s economic growth. Chapter also discusses the role of infrastructure including 21st-century transportation electricity and information networks as a critical platform for growth Emphasizing the core importance of skills to U.S. economic growth and to the quality jobs of today and tomorrow Administration policy focuses on enhancing early childhood education elementary and secondary schooling higher education and job training. These efforts not only help U.S. citizens live up to their potential and compete in a global economy but also work to reverse the Nation s rising wage inequality and declining rates of educational attainment relative to other countries The World Economy The world economy saw sustained progress toward economic recovery in but growth during the recovery has been unevenly distributed between advanced and emerging economies As part of a broader shift toward growth in the United States that relies more on exports and investment the President has set a goal of doubling nominal U.S. goods and services exports in five years : from $ trillion in to $ trillion a year by the end of Through the first three quarters of exports increased by percent relative to the same period in representing a significant step toward that goal. A sizable portion of that growth came from increasing exports to emerging markets Chapter details the ways in which a changing world economy will affect this goal as well as the U.S. role in the world economy The President s National Export Initiative has identified several areas in which U.S. trade policy can complement the forces already at work in the evolving global economy to help achieve this export goal. The Administration is committed to a trade policy that opens new markets for U.S. exporters by reducing foreign government imposed tariffs and nontariff barriers. The | Chapter Administration is also actively enforcing commitments taken on by its trading partners and assisting U.S. exporters with gaining access to trade credit and streamlining the exporting process Health Reform A signature effort of the Administration has been to ensure the security and affordability of health insurance coverage while extending coverage to millions of uninsured Americans. The Affordable Care Act which President Obama signed into law in March is the latest chapter in nearly a century-long history of efforts to ensure comprehensive health insurance coverage for more Americans coupled with major steps in the quest for high value in health spending. For decades the policy problem posed by tens of millions of uninsured Americans has overshadowed the underlying economic challenge of how to control costs while preserving the high quality of the American medical care system. In addition to implementing policies to cover the uninsured the Affordable Care Act introduces a framework for moving the medical care system toward high-value care Chapter describes how the Affordable Care Act controls costs and improves quality by strengthening physician and hospital incentives to improve the quality of care and provide care more efficiently. These delivery system reforms are paired with reforms that create new coverage options through competitive state marketplaces for insurance ensure access to affordable coverage through the provision of tax credits for small businesses and individuals and put in place individual and employer responsibility requirements. Over the next decade these reforms are expected to expand coverage to million Americans make health care more affordable and improve the quality of care. The Affordable Care Act is also fiscally responsible. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the law will reduce projected deficits by $ billion during and by more than $ trillion in the subsequent decade Energy Policy Energy plays a critical role in the economy and Chapter outlines key steps the Administration is taking to transition the Nation toward cleaner sources of energy that have the potential to support new industries exports and high-quality jobs ; to improve air quality and reduce the dangers of climate change ; and to enhance America s energy security and international competitiveness As an initial step the Recovery Act directed over $ billion in public investment and tax incentives to increasing renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power weatherizing homes and boosting R&D for new From Crisis to Recovery and Growth | technologies. Looking forward the President has proposed a Federal Clean Energy Standard to double the share of electricity produced by clean sources to percent by a substantial commitment to cleaner transportation infrastructure and has increased investments in energy efficiency and clean energy R&D These programs are interconnected in important ways. They are all motivated by the fact that the national benefits from clean energy go beyond its immediate producers or consumers. The programs focus on different parts of the clean energy supply chain innovation manufacturing generation and use and thus complement one another. And in the end the Administration s clean energy programs are linked by the goal that in coming years Americans will breathe cleaner air enjoy better health face reduced risks from climate change and work and do business in an economy based on a safer and more secure energy supply Supporting America s Small Businesses America s small businesses are an essential building block to economic growth and prosperity in part because entrepreneurs create a disproportionate share of net new jobs in the U.S. economy. Chapter examines the heavy toll the recession took on small businesses dramatically reducing the availability of credit and capital needed to add capacity hire more workers and develop new products. In response to these challenges the Administration has taken several important steps most notably through the Recovery Act the Small Business Jobs Act and the Startup America initiative to increase the flow of credit and capital to small business The Administration has enacted tax cuts for small businesses to support America s entrepreneurs. It has also enacted policies to make health insurance more affordable for small businesses and entrepreneurs and to facilitate small business exports to new markets overseas. Taken together these efforts have improved the outlook for American small business and created a stronger environment for entrepreneurship | Chapter Conclusion The past year has seen crucial improvement in the American economy. Although the recession generated devastating job losses and an output decline of historic proportions the economy is no longer on the brink of a depression. Growth has resumed jobs are returning and unemployment is falling. Now is the time to chart the course for an economy that will provide jobs new and revitalized industries and rising living standards for Americans. This Report lays out the central elements of the path forward From Crisis to Recovery and Growth | C H A P T E R THE YEAR IN REVIEW AND THE YEARS AHEAD F ollowing the deepest recession since the Great Depression the U.S economy completed its sixth consecutive quarter of recovery at the end of The recovery began in the second half of and the first half of but real gross domestic product ( GDP ) then decelerated around midyear before growth quickened again to percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter of ( Figure ) Private sector employment also decelerated during the summer before picking up in the fourth quarter With the financial crisis now well behind us and considerable slack remaining in employment and resources the U.S. economy has tremendous potential to grow without reigniting inflation Figure Real GDP Growth by Quarter Percent change ( annual rate ) Q4p : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 Note : Q4p indicates preliminary data for : Q4 Sources : Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts Developments in and the Near-Term Outlook Consumption and Saving Consumer spending composes about percent of GDP and as is typical has been less volatile than the overall economy during this recession and recovery. Consumption made up about percent of the decline in GDP during the recession and about percent of the recent rebound Movements in this important component of spending reflect changes in consumer sentiment household wealth and income credit availability government income support programs and taxes Measures of consumer sentiment fell to their lowest levels of the recession from November through February and rebounded sharply through May Confidence slipped a few points around midyear and then was roughly stable through October before picking up toward the end of the year. Nevertheless sentiment remains well below pre-recession levels Figure Consumer Sentiment and the Stock Market Consumer sentiment index Stock market index Total stock market index ( Wilshire ) Dec-2010 Consumer sentiment U. of Michigan Jan-2011 Note : Grey areas represent recessions Sources : Wilshire Associates Incorporated ; Thompson Reuters ( University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers ) Stock market fluctuations closely parallel those of consumer sentiment ( Figure ) with a few notable exceptions such as during when sentiment started falling a year earlier than the stock market did Nevertheless sentiment and the stock market have shown similar rebounds during the recovery recapturing by December percent and | Chapter percent ( respectively ) of their recessionary decline since the December business-cycle peak. Thus although sentiment and the stock market sometimes move independently both have supported the growth in consumer spending Figure Consumption and Net Worth Relative to Disposable Personal Income ( DPI ) Consumption/DPI ratio Years of disposable income Net worth-to-DPI ratio ( right axis ) Consumption-to-DPI ratio ( left axis ) : Q4 Net housing wealth-to-DPI ratio ( right axis ) Stock market wealth-to-DPI ratio ( right axis ) Note : Wealth components for : Q4 were estimated by the CEA Sources : Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts ; Federal Reserve Board ; CEA calculations After consumer sentiment a second prime determinant of consumer spending is household wealth ( also called net worth ) As can be seen in Figure the consumption rate ( the share of disposable income consumed ) tends to fluctuate with the wealth-to-income ratio. A one dollar drop in wealth appears to reduce annual consumer spending by two to four cents The decline in the wealth-to-income ratio from its average to its low point in the first quarter of amounted to years of income. ( In other words household wealth declined by the amount of income earned in years. ) This was the deepest decline since compilation of these data began in Of this year-of-income decline years of income was lost from stock market wealth and about year from housing wealth ( net of mortgage debt owed ) ( Components of wealth aside from stock market wealth and housing wealth edged down slightly relative to income. ) Since : Q1 the wealth-to-income ratio has recovered about year of income with the rebound entirely due to stock market gains as housing and the other forms of wealth have edged a bit lower relative to disposable income. After netting out this rebound the drop in wealth from through end-of-year The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | has been about years of income. A decline in wealth of this magnitude can be expected to set off an adjustment process that raises the saving rate by about percentage points. With the saving rate having risen from an average of percent during to percent in the adjustment of personal saving to the lower level of household net worth is now in line with the fundamentals taking the historical relationships as a guide.1 Another influence on consumer spending is the willingness of financial institutions to lend to households. Households prepare for lean times by saving out of regular income or by planning to draw on bank credit such as credit cards. When bank credit becomes less readily available some households react by saving more so that they can build up their buffer stocks and other households who had been planning to draw on their credit lines become unable to do so because credit is not available. The sharp decline in banks willingness to lend during the recession ( Figure ) is among the reasons why the saving rate increased. During however the Federal Reserve s Senior Loan Officers Survey shows that banks became somewhat more willing to lend to consumers Figure Banks ' Willingness to Lend to Consumers Willingness : Q4 Note : Willingness = the net percentage of domestic respondents reporting increased willingness to make consumer installment loans Source : Federal Reserve Board Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices The model was described in the Economic Report pp. | Chapter Various income support programs have also likely influenced consumer spending during the past year. Extended unemployment benefits and emergency unemployment benefits totaled $ billion in and $ billion in up from $ billion in These benefits stabilized consumer spending relative to the path that it would have taken otherwise Consumer spending has also been sustained by other policies such as the Making Work Pay ( MWP ) tax credit which provides up to $ ( $ for working married couples ) for those with earned income up to $ ( $ for couples ) and progressively less for those with income above these limits. For the economy as a whole MWP lowered tax liabilities ( and boosted disposable income ) by roughly $ billion and $ billion in calendar years and respectively. For MWP is being replaced by provisions of the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act enacted by Congress at the end of ( discussed more fully later in this Chapter ) Provisions included a percentage point one-year reduction in the payroll tax that funds Social Security reducing tax liabilities by about $ billion. In addition the new law supports consumer spending by continuing the extension of unemployment insurance through This new law was proposed legislated and signed after the Administration economic forecast was finalized and so its effects are not included in that forecast Although purchases of durable goods such as motor vehicles and household appliances are regarded as consumption in the national income and product accounts they can also be considered a form of investment because they are long-lasting and provide services for the duration of ownership. Consumer durable purchases are typically more volatile than other purchases declining faster than overall consumption during a cyclical downturn and growing faster than overall consumption during cyclical recovery periods ( for example durable goods purchases grew at an percent annual rate during the four quarters of ) Rapid growth of durables purchases may pull down the saving rate temporarily at some point during the early part of the recovery Developments in Housing Markets As shown in Figure the CoreLogic home price index a comprehensive and closely watched measure of existing home prices dropped percent from the peak of the housing market in April to the trough in March following the bursting of the housing bubble that built up between and The United States had never before suffered such a sharp drop in national house prices. Although house prices fell about percent in nominal terms during the Great Depression general price levels The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | at that time fell percent. As a result the real house price decline during the Great Depression was only about percent. During the current episode the overall inflation rate has slowed but not turned negative making the recent decline in house prices far larger in real terms than that during the Depression Figure House Prices Index ( January = ) Nov-2010 Sources : First American CoreLogic National House Price Index including distressed sales ; CEA calculations House prices have generally stabilized since March fluctuating around a roughly flat trend line. Nonetheless house prices have been volatile over the past year because of unusual market conditions such as the large supply of distressed homes on the market and the short-term impetus to demand from temporary tax credits for homebuyers. Among the factors that continue to keep sales and starts below their long-run trend levels are modest income growth slower household formation and tighter mortgage underwriting standards as well as heightened uncertainty among potential homebuyers and the large shadow inventory of foreclosed and other distressed properties on ( or soon to be on ) the market The bursting of the housing bubble has posed serious challenges to homeowners. Houses are typically leveraged assets ( that is financed with debt ) ; according to the Census Bureau s American Housing Survey about percent of owner-occupied houses carry a mortgage. Leverage amplifies the effects of price changes on household net worth because price changes affect asset values while leaving outstanding debt unchanged. Because mortgage | Chapter debt does not change when house prices fall declines in prices cause even larger declines in home equity ( that is the house value less total mortgage debt ) For example the owner of a $ house with an $ mortgage would have $ in home equity. If prices fell percent the house would be worth $ and home equity would fall to $ a percent decline in equity from a percent decline in prices. The higher the leverage the larger will be the decline in home equity for a given decline in the value of the house. For that reason the percent decline in house prices led to a percent decline in home equity resulting in a loss of about $ trillion in net housing wealth over three years. For many of the most highly leveraged households in particular those who bought their homes near the peak of the market with no or low down payments the decline in the value of their home was larger than their equity meaning that their houses were worth less than their mortgages. Many of these underwater borrowers subsequently defaulted on their mortgage payments often because they could not keep up with payments after losing income during the recession and could not sell their homes for enough to cover the mortgage debt. Although home prices in many parts of the country have stabilized about a quarter of homeowners with mortgages remain underwater. Total negative equity is estimated to be roughly $ billion. In the states with the highest shares of households underwater Nevada Arizona Florida Michigan and California a third or more of homeowners with mortgages have negative equity ( in Nevada the share is about two-thirds ) These homeowners are the most likely to default on their loans : according to CoreLogic the rate of foreclosure initiation rises steadily as negative equity increases reaching about percent for homeowners whose homes are worth less than half their mortgage balance As Figure shows although the foreclosure rate fell in it remains extraordinarily high by historical standards. The rate has stayed high partly because of long lags in the foreclosure timeline ( a bank may take months or even years to resell a house after its original owner defaults on the mortgage ) and partly because falling house prices exacerbated the recession leading to job losses that fed back into more foreclosures. Problems with foreclosure paperwork that came to light last fall have contributed to the slower rate of new foreclosures as lenders take extra time to verify that foreclosures are properly documented The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | Figure Share of Mortgages in Foreclosure Percent : Q3 : Q3 : Q3 : Q3 : Q3 Source : Mortgage Bankers Association National Delinquency Survey The Obama Administration as well as the previous Administration and the Federal Reserve took extraordinary policy actions in response to the enormous damage done by the collapse of housing markets. In September to keep the flow of new mortgage credit open the Treasury placed the government-sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship and committed sufficient capital to allow them to keep funding new mortgages. The Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) also ramped up its lending substantially offering new mortgages to many households who could otherwise not obtain them. At the height of the boom the combined market share of the GSE FHA and Veterans Administration loans was about percent of new originations ; today the share is about percent. Meanwhile from early through the first quarter of the Federal Reserve purchased $ trillion and the Treasury more than $ billion of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae Freddie Mac and the Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ) on the open market helping to push mortgage rates to record low levels. Many households were thus able to refinance their mortgages and reduce their monthly payments Nonetheless weakness in the housing market has remained resulting in continued foreclosures. The Administration s housing programs including the Home Affordable Refinance Program ( HARP ) the Housing Affordable Modification Program ( HAMP ) and funds allocated to state and | Chapter local housing finance agencies in the hardest-hit areas have helped many borrowers achieve more affordable mortgages but the housing market remains under stress in many areas hampering the economic recovery Business Fixed Investment Overall nonresidential investment grew at a rapid percent annual rate during the four quarters of but its two main components diverged sharply. Equipment and software investment grew percent while investment in nonresidential structures fell percent More than a third of the growth in equipment and software investment during was in information-processing equipment and software which grew percent. A bit less than a third was in transportation equipment which grew percent ( with most of the strength in motor vehicles ) Investment in industrial equipment also grew notably percent ( accounting for more than an eighth of equipment and software investment growth ) Within the nonresidential structures category investment in buildings fell in but that decline was partially offset by rapid growth of investment in structures for petroleum and natural gas drilling ( percent at an annual rate ) Declines in the buildings component were widespread from health care facilities to office buildings shopping centers factories and power generation plants. Because of the long lead time required investment in structures tends to lag cyclical turning points Overall business investment may be poised to grow rapidly because firms now appear to have plenty of internal funds. Corporate profits have rebounded almost to their pre-recession level. As a result corporate cash flow a measure of internal funds available for investment that includes undistributed profits and depreciation has also risen substantially during the recovery. Ordinarily nonresidential investment exceeds corporate cash flow ( Figure ) and the corporate sector as a whole must borrow to finance its investments. ( Noncorporate entities are also responsible for some investment. ) But because of the corporate sector s recent strong growth net corporate cash flow today is in the unusual position of exceeding investment. A large share of these investable funds has been channeled to financial investments rather than to new physical capital as can be seen by the rising level of liquid assets held by nonfinancial corporations The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | Figure Business Fixed Investment and Cash Flow Percent of potential GDP : Q3 Nonresidential fixed investment Cash flow : Q4 Liquid assets held by nonfinancial corporations : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 Notes : Potential GDP is a CBO estimate. Cash flow is from the National Income and Product Accounts and nonfinancial liquid assets are plotted using their three-quarter moving averages Sources : Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts ; Federal Reserve Board ( Flow of Funds L.102 ) ; Congressional Budget Office Another contribution to investment growth is the forecast increase in real GDP growth in because the level of investment is often related to the growth rate of GDP. Also spurring investment during will be the provision of the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act allowing full expensing for tax purposes of equipment investment put in place during the year Business Inventories Inventory investment played a large role in the initial stages of recovery. Inventory investment that is the change in inventories is one of the components of GDP so the change in inventory investment ( the change in the change in inventories ) affects the growth of GDP. Inventory investment was increasingly negative in the first and second quarters of ( the light blue bars in Figure ) and the inventory contribution to GDP growth was negative ( the blue bars ) Inventory investment started to rise in the third quarter of from a negative value to a less-negative one and that rise contributed positively to GDP growth through the third quarter of During the first three quarters of inventory investment | Chapter Figure Inventory Investment and its Contribution to Real GDP Growth Percent or percentage points ( annual rate ) Inventory investment as a share of GDP Contribution to real GDP percent change Q4p : Q1 : Q3 : Q1 : Q3 : Q1 : Q3 Notes : Inventory investment as a share of GDP is computed as x [ real inventory investment / real GDP ( ) ] Q4p indicates preliminary data for : Q4 Source : Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts ; CEA calculations contributed an average of percentage points at an annual rate to real GDP and accounted for more than half of the period s real GDP growth Inventory investment commonly accounts for a high share of growth during the early stages of recovery By the third quarter this recent increase in inventory investment had raised the stock of inventories returning it to a more normal level relative to sales. The sharp fourth-quarter rise in final sales ( percent at an annual rate according to preliminary data ) exceeded the rise in production and inventory investment dropped off sharply subtracting more than percentage points from GDP. Although inventories remain lean with respect to sales they are less so than they were earlier in the recovery ( Figure ) so that inventory investment may play a smaller part in GDP growth over the next year than it did during the past two years The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | Figure Manufacturing and Trade Inventories Months ' supply Trillions of dollars Inventory level ( right axis ) Nov Inventory-to-sales ratio ( left axis ) Jan-04 Jan-06 Jan-08 Jan-10 Note : The real inventory level is from the National Income and Product Accounts and the inventory-to-sales ratio is from the Census Bureau Sources : Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts ; Census Bureau Government Outlays Consumption and Investment The Federal budget deficit on September the end of fiscal year was $ trillion down about percent from $ trillion the year before. As a share of GDP the deficit fell from about percent in FY to percent in FY With the recovery beginning to take hold Federal receipts rose about percent during while spending fell about percent. Corporate tax receipts in particular increased nearly percent as taxable profits rose. Despite their pickup in corporate tax receipts are still about half what they were in FY a measure of the depth of the budget hole created by the recession. Receipts from individual income taxes and payroll taxes continued to fall in FY in part because of lower labor market activity linked to the recession and in part because of tax cuts for households implemented as part of the Recovery Act of The Recovery Act was enacted when U.S. real GDP was contracting at an annual rate of more than percent and employment was falling by more than jobs a month. The Recovery Act s spending provisions tax cuts and aid to states and individuals were designed to cushion the fall in demand caused by the financial crisis and the subsequent decline in consumer and business confidence household wealth and access to credit As of the third quarter of the Council of Economic Advisers ( CEA ) estimates that the Recovery Act has raised the level of GDP relative to what | Chapter it otherwise would have been by percent and raised employment relative to what it otherwise would have been by between million and million jobs.2 According to the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) net Federal outlays arising from the financial crisis including the Troubled Assets Relief Program ( TARP ) Federal deposit insurance payouts and Treasury payments to the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were $ billion lower in than in because of lower spending and additional repayments of TARP loans. Repayments by banks under TARP accounted for a large share of the additional receipts. In the Administration estimated that TARP would cost $ billion. These estimates have steadily decreased and following recent developments such as repayments from the insurance company AIG and sales of governmentowned shares of stock in General Motors and Citigroup the President s Budget estimates TARP s deficit cost will be $ billion. Recent estimates from the CBO are even lower. By contrast short-term recession-related spending increased during ; spending on defense and entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare also rose though at a slower pace than its average over the past five years. Overall spending fell from about percent of GDP in to percent in Excluding short-term expenditures spending relative to GDP was about percent in roughly the same as its average over the past years Deficits are expected to decline quickly over the coming years as the recovery picks up short-term countercyclical measures wind down and the Administration s proposed budget cuts occur. As shown in Figure the Administration projects that the deficit as a share of GDP will fall from percent in FY to percent in FY and to percent in FY Nonetheless major long-term fiscal challenges remain. Even before the financial crisis and ensuing recession the long-run budget outlook was problematic in part because a series of policy choices over the past decade had reduced projected revenue while increasing projected spending. At the same time trying to balance the budget all at once would be counterproductive because the recovery of the private sector is still fragile and would likely be imperiled by a sharp and immediate fiscal contraction The Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act passed in December extended tax cuts for all Americans for two years. As a result of the new law families will not see their taxes increase in and as had been scheduled. It also introduces a percentage point payroll tax cut that will provide about $ billion of See CEA ( 2010b ) The CEA uses two methods of estimating the impact of the Recovery Act on employment. The multiplier approach yields million jobs while the statistical projection approach yields million The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | tax relief to working Americans in In addition the new law continues the extension of unemployment insurance so that workers who lost their job through no fault of their own will continue to receive support through Together the tax cuts and additional unemployment insurance payments will boost consumption. The new law also introduces strong incentives to firms to invest in by allowing them to expense the full cost of their equipment investment Figure Deficit as a Share of GDP Percent Sources : Office of Management and Budget Budget of the U.S. Government ( ) ; Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts In the absence of new tax legislation the simultaneous expiration of the Making Work Pay tax cuts and of the tax cuts enacted between and would have reduced real GDP growth over the four quarters of by percentage points according to the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) The positive impact of the new law exceeded what most private forecasters had been expecting for fiscal policy leading them to increase their estimates of growth. At the same time the package is constructed to be temporary ( including one- and two-year provisions ) so that its effect on the long-term deficit is minimal Still the need for medium- and long-term fiscal consolidation is clear. For the medium term President Obama has announced an ambitious goal of cutting the deficit in half by To help meet that target the Administration has proposed a number of new initiatives to help restore fiscal discipline including a five-year freeze on nonsecurity discretionary spending a two-year freeze on Federal wages a slowdown in the growth | Chapter of defense spending and eliminating earmarks from the appropriations process. These proposals build on a number of steps that the Administration has already taken to reduce deficits in coming years the most important of which is enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of If the cost-control provisions of the law are followed over the next several decades they will have a profound effect on the budget. A second critical step was the enactment of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act which requires Congress to offset most spending increases with tax increases or reduced spending elsewhere an important move toward fiscal responsibility. In addition economic growth will affect the long-run ratio of debt to GDP. Steps to spur that growth are discussed in depth in Chapter State and Local Government The operating deficit of state and local government has improved during the recovery but remains precarious because of the severity of the downturn. In addition while funds from the Recovery Act helped to support state and local revenues during and that support is scheduled to diminish. The continuing distress is evident from the jobs that the sector lost between August the peak of state and local employment and December The state and local sector s direct contribution to real GDP growth was negative during the four quarters of and remained so through the first quarter of Its GDP contribution was close to zero during the final three quarters of State and local tax revenues reached a low point in the second quarter of but then grew percent for the five quarters through the third quarter of recovering $ billion or most of their nominal decline during the preceding four quarters. Almost half of the recovery in tax receipts ( $ billion ) came from corporate taxes a source that usually provides only about percent of state and local tax revenues. Sales and property taxes by contrast grew more slowly than the overall economy. Federal grants-in-aid ( mostly for Medicaid and education ) generally increased during and because of the Recovery Act which provided a cumulative $ billion in such grants through : Q3 Current state and local government expenditures which include transfers to individuals as well as government consumption have grown slowly since the business-cycle trough in the second quarter of at a percent annual rate through the third quarter of compared with a percent growth rate of nominal GDP. The combination of restrained spending growth a recovery in tax revenues and increased Federal transfers moved the current operating position of state and local governments from a maximum deficit of $ billion at an annual rate in the third quarter of to a surplus of $ billion in the third quarter of The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | Real investment by state and local governments ( which is not part of current expenditures ) fell over the four quarters of and the first quarter of but edged up in the second and third quarters of The gain in investment spending likely reflects the recent increase in capital transfers for transportation under the Recovery Act During and state and local governments will have to make tough budget decisions. The sector is likely to show little spending growth as Federal transfers diminish and past declines in house prices restrain growth in the property tax base which accounts for about a third of tax collections One point of relative strength in the near term however is state and local construction spending ( for example on roads and bridges ) as the longerlived portions of the Recovery Act investments are translated into public infrastructure capital Real Exports and Imports Real exports grew percent during the four quarters of a rebound following a percent contraction in and no change in The rebound coincides with a general recovery of non-U.S. GDP beginning in mid-2009 ( Figure ) In addition to its sensitivity to the economic strength of our trading partners U.S. export performance also reflects movements in relative prices across countries. The broad index of the real value of the dollar rose during the recession compounding the effect of falling world demand but has generally fallen since March depreciating a total of percent during the months of Figure U.S. Exports and World GDP Index : Q1 = : Q4 U.S. real exports : Q3 World GDP excluding the U.S Sources : Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts ; country sources ; CEA calculations | Chapter Shrinking exports subtracted from GDP growth in each quarter between : Q3 and : Q2 but real exports have added to GDP in every quarter since including adding percent to real GDP growth over the four quarters of In the coming years a combination of strong growth in many key export markets should allow for continued growth in real exports ( see Chapter for a detailed discussion of the recovery of U.S. exports ) Real imports grew percent during the four quarters of Although they grew faster than real exports they had also fallen more steeply than real exports during ( percent ) and ( percent ) The pattern in real imports parallels but is sharper than the general shape of the contraction and rebound in overall U.S. personal consumption spending Because imports tend to be concentrated more in goods than is overall consumer spending real imports move more closely with goods consumption which is cyclically sensitive than with consumption overall. And because business equipment investment includes imported capital goods real imports track this cyclically sensitive series as well Labor Market Trends The recession s impact on the labor market was severe and it will take time before the labor market regains full strength. Figure illustrates the pattern of employment ( excluding jobs associated with the decennial Census ) from its peak for each of the previous three recessions. The figure Figure Path of Non-Census Employment in the Past Three Recessions Percent change in employment from peak Months since employment peak Sources : Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Employment Statistics ; CEA calculations The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | shows that the first several months of job losses associated with the recession ( the dashed line ) followed a pattern almost identical to those of the two previous recessions those of and Beginning in summer however job losses became more severe resulting in a much longer and deeper recession.4 By the time President Obama took office in January the economy was shedding more than jobs a month and employment reached its trough in February Between the peak of employment in January and the trough the economy lost million nonfarm jobs almost as many as were lost in the past three recessions ( and ) combined adjusting for growth in the size of the economy. Job losses as a share of the economy were the largest the United States has experienced in years Despite these historic employment losses sustained albeit modest job growth began relatively quickly after the recession officially ended. Figure compares the path of non-Census employment following this recession with those of the previous two recoveries normalized to the level of employment at the official end date of each recession. As can be seen job losses Figure Path of Non-Census Employment Since the End of the Recession Percent change in employment from end of recession Months since end of recession Sources : Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Employment Statistics ; CEA calculations Figures and show non-Census jobs. The Census hired and subsequently laid off more than half a million temporary workers in These month-to-month changes affect headline numbers but are less reflective of labor market fundamentals. Thus we exclude Census jobs from this employment series The official end date of the recession was June a full months after the recession officially began. In contrast both the and recessions officially lasted months | Chapter continued after the end of each recession with the most recent recovery continuing to experience the deepest losses. However in the recovery from the recession ( dashed line ) non-Census job growth began months into the recovery and continued in each month through December ( the 18th month after the end of the recession ) By comparison the recovery ( light blue line ) was somewhat delayed experiencing no net job creation until months into the recovery. In sharp contrast the recovery ( dark blue line ) continued to lose jobs throughout the comparable time period and sustained job growth did not begin until months after the official end date of the recession. Thus while the recession lasted longer and job losses were much deeper than in either the recession of or recovery in the labor market began sooner Beyond these trends also saw improvements along other margins of labor adjustment. Generally speaking one would expect the workweek and the use of temporary help to grow before total employment begins to grow because firms can lengthen the workweek and use temporary help to increase labor input without having to bear the fixed costs such as benefits associated with hiring a permanent worker. During the recession the workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees lost hour However it gained back nearly two-thirds of that loss in the next months reaching hours in July and maintained that level throughout the second half of the year. This gain is important because a hour gain for employed workers is roughly equivalent in terms of labor input to an increase in employment of more than jobs. Likewise temporary help services which lost about jobs during the recession began to grow toward the end of and saw strong gains in The industry has now gained back more than half its losses Most important private sector employment has grown in every month since March of adding a total of million jobs during and recording the strongest private sector job growth since Total nonfarm employment fared nearly as well adding more than jobs during though this job growth was tempered by a loss of jobs in local government However it is clear that the economy still has a long way to go before it fully recovers. Recessions resulting from a financial crisis tend to be deeper than other types of recessions and recovery from them is more difficult ( Reinhart and Reinhart ; Reinhart and Rogoff ) State and local governments continue to face substantial budget shortfalls that have led to cuts in public sector employment. The national unemployment rate which fell percentage point from its peak to December remains elevated with more than million people in long-term unemployment ( defined as having The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | been jobless and searching for work for weeks or more ) as of December Further although the number of job seekers per job opening had fallen to in December ( from a high of more than ) it remains unacceptably high Policy Responses to Support the Labor Market. The Administration s first major step in addressing the severe contraction of the labor market was the Recovery Act which kept the employment situation from getting substantially worse. In fact the CEA has previously estimated that in the absence of the Recovery Act non-Census employment growth would not have begun until the third quarter of ( or roughly months from the official end date of the recession ; see Figure ) which would have placed the current recovery more in line with the slower employment responses of the previous two recessions In addition in March of President Obama signed the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment ( HIRE ) Act which cuts payroll taxes for employers hiring workers who have been unemployed for at least days The law contains two key provisions. First it exempted employers from paying their share of Social Security taxes ( percent of wages ) on qualified workers hired from February to December and offset these losses to the Social Security Trust Fund with general fund revenues ; this provision of the law ended in Second for each hire that is retained for at least one year the law gives the employer a general business tax credit equal to percent of that employee s yearly wages up to a maximum of $ According to the Department of the Treasury from February to November of an estimated million workers who had been unemployed for eight weeks or longer were hired qualifying their employers for the HIRE Act payroll tax exemption In August in response to the continuing job losses in state and local government the President signed the Education Jobs and Medicaid Assistance Act which provided $ billion to states to prevent layoffs of teachers. According to CEA estimates this critical assistance supported teacher jobs during the academic year The unemployment rate is a prominent but incomplete measure of labor market well-being If workers are encouraged or discouraged by labor market conditions they may enter or exit the labor force moving the unemployment rate in the opposite direction of the economy s momentum. However thus far in the recession and recovery other measures of labor underutilization ( for example the employment-to-population ratio or measures including those working part-time for economic reasons ) have shown patterns similar to the unemployment rate | Chapter In addition the Administration made several efforts over the past year to help small businesses and promote entrepreneurship. The measures included passing numerous tax cuts for small business signing the Small Business Jobs Act and launching Startup America in early These policies are discussed in detail in Chapter All of these policy responses were designed to put jobless Americans back in the workplace as quickly as possible both for their own well-being and also for that of the nation as a whole. The labor market growth seen thus far is encouraging especially compared with the recoveries following the and recessions but obviously is only a start. More robust job creation is needed Prices Price inflation as measured by the consumer price index excluding food and energy ( known as the core CPI ) moved lower in dropping to percent from percent during the two preceding years. The GDP price index excluding food and energy edged up slightly to a still-low percent. ( The GDP price index is the broadest index of what is produced in the United States including investment exports and government services in addition to consumer goods and services. ) There have been higher rates of inflation at some early stages of goods processing but restrained growth of unit labor costs arising from a combination of low capacity utilization elevated unemployment and strong productivity growth have overwhelmed other influences as commodities are processed and moved down the supply chain toward the final consumer Further these commodity and materials prices make up only a small share of overall goods prices. Labor costs now make up about percent of costs in the nonfarm business sector and labor costs per unit of real output fell in and The Administration s inflation forecast reflects three balancing forces : persistent downward pressure on inflation from the high levels of economic slack a further expected pickup in economic growth and fairly stable inflation expectations. The Administration s projected rise in CPI inflation to percent in moves in the direction expected by the consensus of professional forecasters The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | Financial Markets From December through December stock market values rose and yields on Treasury notes fell but the movements were volatile in both cases. Long-term interest rates fell during these months also with some notable fluctuations Stock market values as measured by the Standard and Poor s Composite Index rose percent in following a percent gain in Despite the back-to-back gains the index at year s end was still percent below its October peak. Corporate profits rose rapidly in and and the gains in the stock market have not kept up with the gains in earnings. As a consequence the price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P had fallen by year s end to about slightly below the average of the years through Indicators of financial stress improved dramatically during and changed little during the months of The spread between the 3-month interbank lending rates and 3-month Treasury bill rates was only basis points ( or percentage point ) by December considerably below its average of basis points. Similarly the spread between AA- and B-rated corporate bonds had fallen to only percentage points somewhat below its average of percentage points. Also during banks eased standards on commercial and industrial loans Yields on 10-year Treasury notes in December were percent down from percent in December Ten-year yields rose early in the year but fell more than a full percentage point from April to October likely reflecting slow economic growth and a flight to quality triggered by concerns abroad. Falling inflation expectations may also have been a factor in the mid-year decline as suggested by the premium paid for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities ( TIPS ) During the last two months of long-term rates reversed part of their earlier decline. Despite the uptick at year s end yields on 10-year Treasury notes were still at the low end of their historical range. Real rates ( that is after subtracting inflation expectations ) were also low as indicated by the TIPS market where rates around the 10year horizon were about percent When the Administration s economic forecast was finalized in midNovember the projected path for 91-day Treasury bills over the next two years was calibrated from rates in the market for federal funds futures which suggested that rates would remain extremely low in and then edge up slightly in | Chapter Table Administration Economic Forecast Real Nominal GDP GDP ( chaintype ) GDP Conprice sumer index price ( chain- index type ) ( CPI-U ) Nonfarm payroll Interest Interest employUnrate rate ment employ91-day 10-year ( average ment Treasury Treasury monthly rate bills notes change ( percent ) ( percent ) ( percent ) Q4-to-Q4 thousands ) Percent change Q4-to-Q4 ( actual ) Level calendar year Notes : Based on data available as of November Interest rate on 91-day T-bills includes secondary market discount basis.

The overall trend of economic data toward the end of has been encouraging.

Policy must move beyond the short-run demands of the business cycle to support the broader economic environment that ensures rapid broad-based and sustained economic growth bringing Americans greater income higherquality jobs and longer and healthier lives At the core of the Nation s economic growth is our capacity to innovate educate and build. Innovation drawing on a long tradition of American ingenuity has made American workers and businesses world leaders in productivity. With private sector investments in the lead U.S marketplaces provide the test beds in which new ideas are proven and the means by which successful ideas spread. At the same time the creation and diffusion of new ideas require essential public inputs in education infrastructure and the national innovation system which all work together to sustain and accelerate U.S. economic growth. This chapter considers the foundations of that economic growth and the public policies that will ensure America s continuing economic success The Importance of Economic Growth Rapid and sustained economic growth is a defining feature of U.S history. Figure shows the rise of real U.S. income per person from the Industrial Revolution in the early 19th century to the present. Adjusted for inflation income per person in was double its level in Income per person in was double its level in and income per person in even after a decade of the Great Depression was double its level in All told average income per person in the United States today is times what it was in ( Maddison ) Income does not rise in every year and it can fall sharply but over the longer run the upward trend clearly dominates short-run cycles. The experience of the American economy in the past two years has been especially difficult but Figure also makes clear that if America can capitalize on its long-run legacy of growth then the Nation can expect to grow beyond its current challenges and reach new economic heights Figure Progress in U.S. Real Income Per Person Since dollars ( log scale ) Sources : Maddison ( ) ; Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts Beyond the summary measure of income per person the progress in American standards of living can be seen in how we live our lives and how long those lives are. Life expectancy in the United States in the early to mid-1800s was approximately years. Fifteen percent of children did not survive their first year of life and over percent did not reach their fifth birthday in many American cities ( Haines ) Today life expectancy is and infant mortality has fallen by a factor of In the early 1800s primary school was the height of most Americans educational attainment Telegraphs and telephones had not been invented let alone e-mail and wireless communications. There were no automobiles no airplanes. There were no washing machines dishwashers air conditioners or electric refrigerators. Indeed there was no electrification no light bulbs radios televisions computers or Internet and none of the associated services that Americans now enjoy | Chapter Overall the economic growth imperative is clear. The improvements in income health and the variety and quality of products Americans consume all demonstrate the remarkable increase in prosperity the United States has enjoyed throughout its history. If the United States continues the same sustained growth rate it has averaged since Americans can look forward to real incomes that are twice as high per person by and five and a half times higher in with new opportunities higher-paying jobs better educations and healthier longer lives Sources of Economic Growth Any assessment of the appropriate role of growth policy starts with an analysis of how economic growth works that is how economies increase their output per person. Most directly economists analyze the sources of growth by asking how the inputs workers use increase their output per unit of time. Economics offers three key ingredients for growth First physical capital inputs such as machines tools and infrastructure make workers more productive. For example investments in telecommunications equipment allow information to be exchanged rapidly making wide arrays of workers from emergency personnel to business managers more productive. One source of growth then is this physical capital deepening investments that increase the amount of physical capital per worker Second skill formation makes workers more productive. Investments in skill formation or human capital include general education but also education specific to certain occupations such as engineering medicine and law as well as training to use certain types of machines and tools. For example investment in training telecommunications engineers pays off in improved communication services. Thus another source of growth is this deepening of human capital investments that raise the skills of workers Third growth in advanced economies like the United States ultimately depends on technological progress interpreted broadly to mean the creation and diffusion of new ideas. To continue the communications example the advent of the telephone transformed people s ability to communicate but once fixed-line telephones had spread across America increasing the number of telephones per person had no such transformational power Further progress awaited the invention of better communications technologies the fax machine the mobile telephone the Internet which have spurred additional investment in capital and further increased worker productivity. Technological progress drives capital deepening and creates new avenues to increased prosperity The Foundations of Growth | The foundational role of underlying technological progress can be inferred by considering the advance of major sectors of the U.S. economy For example advances in transportation were made possible by the invention and diffusion of numerous technologies including engines trains automobiles and airplanes. People and goods can now cross the country in six hours instead of months. This improvement was achieved through the invention of ever more advanced technologies. Box considers an additional example the advance of human health at greater length Unfortunately there are cracks in the foundations of America s growth that need to be addressed. The Nation s innovation system relies largely on the private sector but also depends on critical public inputs. For example basic scientific breakthroughs in engineering genetics chemistry and many other fields underpin commercial innovation but provide little or no direct profit themselves so basic scientific research relies heavily on public support. Yet publicly funded research and development fell steadily from the early 1960s until recently Box : Technological Progress and the Advance of Health Improvements in health have been possible through numerous medical advances. Polio smallpox diphtheria and other debilitating or deadly viruses have been checked by vaccines. Bacterial infections following the discovery of penicillin in are now treated by a wide range of antibiotics. Advances in controlling infection bleeding and pain made modern surgery possible allowing surgeons to save and improve lives. Meanwhile advances in the understanding of anatomy molecular and cell biology genetics chemical synthesis nuclear physics and other areas have produced cascades of innovations for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. From laser eye surgery to X-ray MRI and ultrasound imaging technologies to effective chemotherapies for particular cancers and pharmaceuticals that manage blood pressure insulin levels asthma and many other chronic conditions human health technologies have taken enormous leaps Health improvements raise workers productivity and increasing longevity can both extend working lives and encourage higher education. These mechanisms work to enhance economic growth. But much of the benefit of improved health whether the decline in infant mortality or the direct enjoyment of longer lives can not be measured simply by tracking income per person. Thus the benefits brought by these technological advances stand largely in addition to the 25-fold increase in U.S. per capita income since | Chapter Meanwhile U.S. investments in infrastructure no longer lead the world either in traditional physical infrastructure or in new information networks. American households rank only 14th among advanced countries in the adoption of high-speed Internet for example and average advertised download speeds in the United States rank 24th. Failure to provide American workers and businesses with efficient modern infrastructure raises costs and disrupts the marketplace making it increasingly difficult for the American economy to provide world-leading productivity and innovation In skill formation the United States once led the world in the proportion of college graduates. It now ranks ninth in this measure among adults aged to Meanwhile the quality of the Nation s primary and secondary education substantially lags other countries especially in science and mathematics. These educational challenges are among the factors associated with stagnating wages among less-educated workers and with widening wage inequality and they are further associated with unequal access to important goods and services including health care. Furthermore these challenges present obstacles to American workers and businesses seeking the highproductivity high-wage jobs in the 21st-century global economy Making America more competitive and growing the economy is a preeminent goal of the Obama Administration. The rest of this chapter identifies the path forward focusing on critical public policies and investments in the Nation s innovation system and infrastructure and in the skills of individual Americans that support rapid broad-based and sustained increases in America s prosperity Innovation and Economic Growth Innovation the introduction of new or improved goods services or practices into the economy depends critically on private sector interest Businesses operating in a competitive market system have numerous advantages in the creation and implementation of useful new ideas ( Box ) At the same time the social rewards to innovation often exceed the private rewards to the original innovator so the private sector may fall short in providing innovations and economic growth ( Box ) The Obama Administration is working to shore up the foundations of our national innovation system through critical public investments that will accelerate our future prosperity The Foundations of Growth | Box : The Power of Market-Based Innovation Good ideas come from many quarters and from surprising directions so their nature and source are fundamentally hard to foresee The market system draws on American ingenuity from the ground up relying on those individuals with close proximity to particular goods services or practices to develop the next-generation idea. Innovation can come from established firms which developed the transistor laser and smartphone for example and from entrepreneurs who led the creation of airplanes personal computers and Internet search engines Markets provide the crucible in which innovations are tested then improved or discarded. Ultimately it is buyers consumers and other firms who decide whether a new or improved good or service is worth paying for. The market system with its price signals about costs and consumer demand helps businesses direct their innovative efforts to high-value areas Once an idea is successfully demonstrated in the market the market system invites other innovators to build on these ideas. For example the laser turned out to have applications in surgical devices and manufacturing tools in computer printers barcode scanners and DVD players far beyond those its early creators imagined. Early and uncertain visions of a large market for personal computers were realized only through a torrent of marketplace innovations across a vast array of established and entrepreneurial firms The market system also works to spread the best ideas because competitive pressures favor the expansion of those firms with the most efficient methods and most desirable products. Flexible capital and labor markets pivot scarce resources toward the best ideas constantly reinventing the American economy Basic Research Basic scientific research typically has little direct commercial return so its costs are not easily borne by firms. Yet downstream commercial innovation is dependent on achievements in basic science. The biotechnology industry builds on Watson and Crick s discovery of the structure of DNA The Web-based innovations and storefronts of the new economy build on government and university development of the Internet. Americans draw on achievements in basic science throughout their daily lives in driving a car using an electronic device taking modern medications talking on a telephone or finding information online | Chapter Box : The Social Gains from Innovation The social gains from innovation typically extend well beyond the profits earned by the innovative enterprise. Telephones light bulbs subway trains dishwashers antibiotics lasers computers Web browsers and smartphones for example all offer large and ongoing social gains for Americans that far outstrip any commercial return to the original innovators. There are several reasons for this tendency. First users will pay for an innovation only if its benefits exceed its price. These benefits in excess of the price the consumer surplus mean that much of the innovation s immediate value will accrue to the users rather than to the innovator. Second the innovating business will face pressures to lower prices as other businesses imitate the successful innovation especially once any intellectual property rights expire transferring the innovation s value more fully to the user. Finally a successful innovation often launches additional innovations the benefits of which are not captured by the original innovator and additionally spill over to users Given that these users are workers or consumers the social gains from innovation largely accrue through rising labor compensation new workforce opportunities and the higher quality and increasing variety of Americans consumption. On average the private firm may capture only a small percentage of the social gain from innovation Thus all Americans have an important stake in the innovation system At the same time because technological advances can be biased toward educated workers investments in human capital become critical to ensure that the gains from workplace innovations remain widely shared as discussed at the end of this chapter Given the importance of basic research coupled with its low private return the American innovation system relies on public support of university and government researchers who work to develop scientific breakthroughs and make these breakthroughs publicly available. This open science model for basic research expands collective knowledge and allows anyone with a good idea to tap these advances. Whether discovering fundamental properties of nature developing understandings of disease that open new pathways for treatment or creating the breakthroughs in nanotechnology that may revolutionize modern manufacturing basic science will continue to create new foundations for future progress In the Obama Administration put in place the largest funding increase in basic science in U.S. history with an $ billion contribution The Foundations of Growth | from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. More broadly the Administration is committed to doubling the long-term funding for three key basic science agencies the National Science Foundation the Department of Energy s Office of Science and the National Institute of Standards and Technology laboratories. With these commitments and others the Administration is working towards those frontiers that promise new industries and new growth. In clean energy and electric vehicles nanotechnology advanced manufacturing biotechnology wireless communications and other promising fields the Administration is deploying resources to create fundamental breakthroughs at the beginning of the innovation pipeline These priority areas are discussed further below Intellectual Property Rights Effective protection of intellectual property rights including patents and copyrights is an essential role of government in encouraging innovation. Innovation typically requires substantial investments in the labor and materials necessary to create develop and test a new idea and then see it through to the marketplace. If others can steal the idea once it is proven undermining the ability of the creator to recoup the costs of the innovative investment then the incentive to innovate is reduced. Intellectual property rights address this problem by giving the innovator a limited-duration right to exclude others use thus helping to ensure that the private sector has the incentives to make innovative investments. In President Lincoln s words the patent system adds the fuel of interest to the fire of genius. Intellectual property rights are particularly important to industries that make substantial investments in research and development ( R&D ) and R&D-intensive industries are leaders in driving U.S. growth and competitiveness. For example among U.S. industries that produce internationally tradable goods and services industries with above-average R&D levels generated more than twice the output and sales per employee accounted for about percent of exports and accounted for five of the six U.S. industries that generated a trade surplus during the period ( Pham ) Recognizing the importance of intellectual property the Obama Administration is determined to improve the function of the patent system The United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) currently faces a backlog of patent applications and the average delay between patent application and patent grant has risen to months. These delays are untenable for businesses especially entrepreneurial businesses which often rely on licensing their patents to generate revenue. The Obama Administration has begun to implement a five-year plan to improve the quality and timeliness of patent issuance. This strategic plan includes steps to redesign the agency s | Chapter information technology infrastructure reform the reward system for patent examiners and hire additional examiners while a new pilot program is also opening the USPTO s first branch office. The Administration is also seeking legislative authority to give the USPTO greater capacity to meet its ever-increasing workload and improve patent quality. Legislative priorities include letting the USPTO set and keep its patent fees so that it can expand its operations to meet its workload and allowing post-grant review which can help limit errors in patent issuance and thus reduce costly litigation and market uncertainty The Administration is also working aggressively to protect against copyright and patent infringement. The Nation s first Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator working within the Executive Office of the President has released a Joint Strategic Plan to coordinate U.S. government actions to combat unauthorized use of intellectual property both domestically and internationally and is facilitating voluntary cooperative efforts by the private sector to reduce infringement. The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security have increased law enforcement activity including shutting down Web sites trafficking in infringing content prosecuting theft of innovative trade secrets and coordinating global law enforcement sweeps against counterfeit drugs. In addition the United States Trade Representative has negotiated the first international enforcement agreement the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement to limit global trade in counterfeited goods and pirated copyrighted works Antitrust and the Innovative Marketplace The U.S. antitrust agencies evaluate the extent to which a merger between existing competitors can reduce the degree of competition in a market. In situations where firms actively innovate to improve their position vis- -vis their competitors the agencies must consider whether those innovations would still be pursued should the merger go forward. Given the importance of innovation to economic growth sound merger enforcement policy aims to promote innovation by approving mergers that are likely to create efficiencies and potentially spur innovation while preventing mergers that may inhibit innovation through a reduction in competition In August the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission issued new Horizontal Merger Guidelines which describe the merger enforcement policies of the two agencies. The new guidelines include for the first time a section explaining how the agencies assess whether a merger is likely to inhibit innovation by for example reducing a firm s incentive to continue a product development effort or initiate new product development The Foundations of Growth | The Research and Experimentation Tax Credit Even with well-functioning intellectual property rights and markets and with public support for basic scientific research commercial innovation incentives still tend to fall short of the social benefits. The Research and Experimentation ( R&E ) tax credit is therefore an important tool to enhance private sector innovation incentives and accelerate economic growth. In the R&E tax credit supported corporations and individual taxpayers with $ billion in credits. Recent studies find that research tax credits translate dollar-for-dollar into increases in current research spending especially over the longer run as businesses develop their research enterprises ( Hall and Van Reenen ; Bloom Griffith and Van Reenen ) Unfortunately because the R&E credit is temporary and must be renewed periodically uncertainty about the credit s availability reduces its incentive effect especially in planning projects that will not be initiated and completed before the credit s expiration The Obama Administration has proposed to expand simplify and permanently extend the R&E tax credit. The proposal will expand the credit by approximately percent making a commitment of $ billion over the next years which represents the largest commitment in the tax credit s history. The Administration also proposes to make the credit easier to use providing a simple percent credit rate to businesses and to make the credit permanent ensuring that businesses can count on the credit as they plan research investments that span multiple years Entrepreneurship The United States has long recognized the role of entrepreneurship in tapping American ingenuity to develop new products and solve problems Small firms typically produce more patents per dollar of R&D than do large firms. New businesses are also engines of job growth with small firm births creating million U.S. jobs between and Yet entrepreneurs face special challenges. Raising funds is difficult for firms that are new and have little collateral or no established reputation even if they have a great idea Moreover disclosing ideas in pursuit of funding can risk losing the idea to established firms. Should a startup be capable of financing the initial innovative investment long administrative delays in patent issuance typically delay licensing opportunities and may cause the startup to fail Government support for entrepreneurship can help ensure that good ideas from all sources enter markets thereby boosting economic growth. For example the Small Business Innovation Research ( SBIR ) program which is managed by the Small Business Administration and supported by federal | Chapter agencies assists small entrepreneurial businesses to compete for federal research and development awards. A recent report shows that during the 10-year period ending in businesses participating in the SBIR program frequently accounted for more than of R&D Magazine s top hightechnology products of the year. The Administration s new Startup America initiative will facilitate entrepreneurship across the country investing $ billion in capital for entrepreneurs improving the regulatory environment for young businesses and increasing connections between entrepreneurs and high-quality business mentors. Meanwhile on a different dimension the Affordable Care Act will remove obstacles to entrepreneurship by enabling Americans to start and join new businesses without giving up access to health coverage both by allowing workers with preexisting conditions to maintain their health insurance and by allowing Americans under age to remain on their parents insurance. Chapter considers small business challenges and Administration policies in greater detail National Priority Areas For national priorities where innovation is critical but market failures impede progress government can help spur technological advances Priority areas include developing clean energy sources using information technology to improve health care and reduce costs and nurturing the bio- and nanotechnology revolutions. The Administration is harnessing mechanisms from basic research to government procurement to help spark American ingenuity in these areas driving economic growth and building the future industries that can provide American workers with quality jobs in the future global economy In clean energy the Department of Energy s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy ( ARPA-E ) has awarded nearly $ million to more than research projects that seek fundamental breakthroughs in energy technologies. The Administration s fiscal year Budget will more than double total funding to date for ARPA-E. It will also double from three to six the number of Energy Innovation Hubs bringing innovative thinkers from different disciplines together to create research breakthroughs on tough problems. One new Energy Innovation Hub will focus on improving batteries and energy storage with applications to advanced vehicles. Overall the FY Budget will significantly expand R&D investments in critical electric vehicle components while transforming the existing $ tax credit for electric vehicles into a rebate available to all consumers at the point of sale. Building on existing initiatives like the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing loan program which has invested over $ billion to support three electric car factories in California Delaware and Tennessee these initiatives are working to meet the President s goal of putting million The Foundations of Growth | advanced vehicles on the road by Meanwhile Department of Energy tax credits have leveraged gigawatts of private sector investments in wind solar and geothermal technologies and the U.S. Navy is driving demand for new fuels by committing to convert half of the fuel used for powering its planes ships and vehicles to alternative fuels by In health care advances in information technology can help prevent medical errors ; improve delivery of care for patients doctors and nurses ; lower costs ; and create data platforms to encourage further innovation The Administration is making investments to accelerate the adoption of electronic health records develop standards for secure exchange of health information over the Internet and promote mobile and Web-based health technologies. The Strategic Health IT Advance Research Projects ( SHARP ) program is funding potentially game-changing advances to overcome obstacles to the adoption of health information technology The Administration has been making critical investments in biotechnology nanotechnology and advanced manufacturing. Through the Recovery Act the Administration has invested in sequencing complete human genomes more than a 50-fold increase over the genomes sequenced before Recovery Act funding creating new capacity for understanding many diseases while also driving down DNA sequencing costs. The National Nanotechnology Initiative is developing a strategic plan to coordinate federal investments in nanotechnology fields including investments to promote health energy materials electronics and other applications. The FY Budget also increases investments at key science agencies to catalyze breakthroughs for advanced manufacturing applications and provides funding to initiate the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Consortia Program a public-private partnership that will help spur innovation in manufacturing systems and shorten the time needed for innovations to reach the market Infrastructure and Economic Growth Public investments in infrastructure reduce production and trade costs enhance capital and labor mobility and provide platforms to stimulate innovation. During the 1900s America s infrastructure investments focused on the Nation s transportation systems and public utilities including electrification which provided a platform for the birth of major new industries and better opportunities for the American workforce. Today as demand continues to grow and existing infrastructure decays significant and renewed investment in our transportation and electricity systems is required | Chapter The 21st century also calls for critical investments in the information and communication technology ( ICT ) infrastructure including broadband Internet and wireless spectrum investments that increasingly underpins the economy and provides abundant opportunities for further innovation and growth. Telecommunications investments have historically predicted substantial growth among advanced countries and rapid adoption of ICT was associated with faster U.S. growth during the early Internet years. Of the world s largest ICT companies today have their home in the United States ; these companies generated total revenues of more than $ trillion in Additionally ICT accounts for about percent of U.S venture capital spending a key element in transforming innovative ideas into commercial applications ( OECD ) Annual private investment in information processing equipment and software in the United States doubled between and growing times faster than other U.S private fixed investment Roads Railways and Runways The United States has a rich history of government investment in transportation infrastructure leading to long-term economic benefits. The interstate highway system represents one example. Research has shown that well-designed infrastructure investments can raise economic growth productivity and land values while also providing significant positive spillovers to economic development energy efficiency public health and manufacturing In September President Obama announced a plan to renew and expand America s transportation infrastructure and increase government efficiency in making infrastructure investments. The plan includes a $ billion investment to renew miles of depreciating roads construct and maintain miles of passenger rail and rehabilitate miles of runways. Overall the FY Budget seeks a six-year surface transportation reauthorization package totaling $ billion more than a percent increase above the previous six-year package. The Administration is also seeking to modernize the transportation infrastructure to help people and goods move efficiently and keep American markets competitive. For example the FY Budget provides $ billion over the next six years for passenger rail including the development of a high-speed rail system that will be accessible by percent of Americans within years and $ billion for the Next Generation Air Transportation System a multiyear effort to improve efficiency safety and capacity of the Nation s aviation infrastructure The Foundations of Growth | The President s infrastructure plan also calls for the creation of a National Infrastructure Bank to leverage private capital and select projects of greatest national significance. The infrastructure bank to be funded at $ billion over six years would depart from the Nation s traditional infrastructure decisionmaking process and instead weigh projects of national and regional significance against each other and fund those judged to have the greatest return to American taxpayers Electricity Infrastructure Successful electrification across the United States in the early 1900s provided a general purpose technology upon which many further innovations would build from lighting and household appliances to radio and television to computers and information technology. With rising carbon pollution and growing worldwide demand for scarce energy resources the U.S. electricity infrastructure now faces new challenges. The Administration is currently taking numerous steps to modernize the Nation s electric grid and provide cleaner more efficient and more secure energy sources largely through Smart Grid projects and transmission infrastructure financing The National Institute of Standards and Technology is coordinating Smart Grid standards and the Recovery Act provided $ billion for related Smart Grid investments. By providing a two-way flow of information a Smart Grid promises to enable homes and businesses to manage electricity consumption based on need and price thus reducing their utility bills. For example energy usage and billing data can be provided nearly in real time to the consumer through smart meters or other technologies. Such data services can enable smart thermostats and smart home appliances to adjust their energy cycles based on price signals. Smart Grid technologies also include those that enable the broader electricity transmission infrastructure to operate more reliably and effectively preventing brown-outs and other disruptions that can undermine the efficiency of the electric grid. Overall Smart Grid technologies promise to lower consumer costs increase the reliability of the electric grid and facilitate the adoption of other innovative technologies such as renewable energy resources and electric vehicles Smart Grid investments alone are not expected to alleviate fully the need for increased high-voltage transmission capacity. The Recovery Act also increased the borrowing authority of the power marketing agencies within the Department of Energy by $ billion to finance new transmission investments that can accommodate increased generation to meet future energy demand enhance grid reliability and integrate location-constrained renewable energy resources. Taken together investments in Smart Grid and electricity distribution and transmission will help modernize the Nation s | Chapter electric grid making electricity delivery to U.S. citizens more efficient secure and reliable Information Networks In less than a decade broadband ( or high-speed ) Internet access has transformed the American economy. The explosion in business-tobusiness ( Figure ) business-to-consumer and government-to-consumer e-commerce has dramatically reduced transactions costs by reducing geographic and time constraints. Households can comparison shop register their cars and pay their bills online saving time and money. Many workers can save hours of commuting time through telecommuting. More generally broadband has expanded the ability to communicate ideas and information a key to faster problem solving and innovation. The great potential for high-speed low-cost information networks to trigger continued economic growth lies in their role as a general purpose technology that businesses and households can use in creative ways some not yet imagined to further transform their productive capacities Figure E-Commerce Share of Business-to-Business Manufacturing Shipments Percent Sources : Census Bureau Annual Survey of Manufacturers and the Economic Census In about percent of Americans aged and older had broadband at home. By the share had grown to about percent.1 Despite this tremendous progress evidence suggests that the United States trails behind a substantial number of other advanced countries in broadband Smith Similar adoption rates are found in other studies ; see Department of Commerce The Foundations of Growth | adoption. One international comparison of broadband subscriptions per inhabitants shows the United States ranking 14th ( Figure ) ( OECD ) Figure Broadband Adoption across OECD Countries Subscriptions per inhabitants DSL Cable Fibre/LAN Other OECD average OECD average Netherlands Denmark Switzerland Korea Norway Luxembourg Iceland France Sweden Germany United Kingdom Canada Belgium United States Finland Japan New Zealand Australia Austria Spain Italy Ireland Portugal Greece Hungary Czech Republic Poland Slovak Republic Chile Mexico Turkey Source : OECD Information Technology Outlook ( ) Jobs increasingly require Internet skills but while percent of schools are connected to the Internet more than percent of teachers say slow or unreliable Internet access presents obstacles to their use of technology in the classroom ( FCC ) Additionally broadband adoption is relatively low among certain groups of Americans including poor households African American and Hispanic households and rural households ( Department of Commerce ) As broadband becomes essential to learning working and improving productivity these gaps in broadband adoption create a digital divide in the opportunities available to different groups of Americans To expand broadband Internet availability and strengthen this critical platform for the Nation s economic growth the Administration has awarded $ billion through the Recovery Act. These funds in part support the National Telecommunications and Information Administration s Broadband Technology Opportunities Program which is deploying middle-mile infrastructure in areas with nearly million households and million businesses bringing broadband to approximately institutions including schools libraries health care facilities and public safety entities. These funds also support the Rural Utilities Service s Broadband Initiatives Program | Chapter which is bringing broadband access to approximately million households businesses and community anchor institutions like hospitals and schools in rural America Spectrum policy is another critical component in managing the Nation s information infrastructure. More and more Americans are connecting wirelessly to broadband Internet services using computers smartphones and e-book readers and increasing numbers of smart machines such as smart parking meters and remote patient health monitoring systems rely on wireless infrastructure. Smartphone penetration among Americans increased almost threefold between and by one measure a trend that has multiplied wireless data traffic. The rapid expansion of wireless technologies may contribute substantially to future American productivity and economic growth but additional gains will require allocating more electromagnetic spectrum for commercial and government use On behalf of the American people the Federal Government manages the rights to electromagnetic spectrum a scarce national resource. Today the United States has provided just over megahertz of spectrum for mobile communication. Experts believe that the United States will require hundreds of megahertz more of spectrum in coming years yet only megahertz are in the pipeline for commercial use. The Administration has committed to developing megahertz of additional wireless spectrum and ensuring that spectrum is allocated to its highest-value uses Freeing additional spectrum to avoid spectrum crunch is essential to nurturing the next generation of high-speed wireless services and further innovations that businesses and entrepreneurs are beginning to deploy However more spectrum alone will not guarantee secure and interoperable systems that can support critical applications such as public safety or the extension of these essential wireless platforms to Americans living in remote rural areas. The Administration has budgeted over $ billion to catalyze deployment of a nationwide interoperable public safety wireless network to invest in research solutions to overcome wireless technology obstacles and to help businesses extend the next generation of wireless services to percent of all Americans including those in remote rural areas Skills and Economic Growth Ensuring that future economic growth is rapid sustained and broadly based requires investments in Americans skills. Education is the pathway to higher-income jobs and the growing industries of the 21st century Education is also needed to train the next generation of researchers and innovators who will drive future technological progress. For both reasons The Foundations of Growth | Americans skills are critical to future economic prosperity. The Obama Administration is working to ensure that our educational system is internationally competitive comprehensive and innovative in preparing our workforce for an increasingly knowledge-intensive economy The rapid technological changes of the 20th century not only enhanced productivity and created new industries but also increased demand for skilled labor ( Goldin and Katz ) Higher education is the key to many modern occupations and over the years Americans have correspondingly raised their educational attainment with average years of schooling at age rising years between and But American gains in educational attainment are slowing. Average schooling duration in the final quarter of the 20th century increased at only about one-third of its previous pace Compared with other countries American educational attainment also appears to be falling behind While growth in educational attainment has slowed the demand for skilled workers continues to increase. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the fastest-growing occupations in the United States require at least a bachelor s degree with others requiring either an associate s degree or a postsecondary vocational certificate or award. Moreover over the past years the return to a college education has also risen further suggesting that increasing demand for high-skilled workers is outstripping their supply. Figure shows wage and salary income by degree attainment from to In workers with a bachelor s degree or more earned more than twice as much as those with only a high school diploma while those with some college or an associate s degree earned percent more. These wage premiums have risen percentage points and percentage points respectively since Although not shown in the figure the returns to postgraduate education have risen even more steeply. In the mid-1960s those with postgraduate degrees earned about percent more than high school graduates ; by this wage premium had more than tripled to percent While earnings of workers who have attended college have risen the annual income of those with only a high school degree or less has fallen since the 1970s even before the declines during the recent recession. High school dropouts have fared the worst among all workers with earnings falling percent in real terms since These workers currently earn percent less than high school graduates. This trend mirrors a broader pattern of rising wage and income inequality in the United States with gains from economic growth concentrated in some segments of the population. In the past years real income for the top percent of all households has grown by percent while incomes for households in the bottom half of the distribution have been essentially flat. By contrast in other periods of economic | Chapter growth such as that from World War II to the mid-1970s advances in labor income were spread roughly evenly throughout the wage distribution ( Goldin and Katz ) A leading hypothesis about the causes of rising income inequality over the past years points to technological advances that have increased the demand for high-skilled workers while the supply of these workers has not accelerated to meet the demand ( Katz and Murphy ) Institutional factors such as declines in unionization and the real minimum wage may also have played a role in increased wage inequality ( DiNardo Fortin and Lemieux ) Figure Average Wage and Salary Income by Educational Group Total wage and salary income ( dollars ) Bachelor 's degree or higher Associate 's degree or some college High school graduates Less than high school Notes : Calculations are for full-time workers aged who worked weeks in the calendar year. Before education groups are defined based on the highest grade of school or year of college completed. Beginning in groups are defined based on the highest degree or diploma earned. Incomes are deflated using the CPI-U Source : Bureau of Labor Statistics March Current Population Survey Further the overall data on educational attainment mask large disparities by race and socioeconomic status. Whereas percent of non-Hispanic whites aged to hold a postsecondary degree only percent of African Americans and percent of Hispanics do. In addition children from highincome households are almost four times as likely to obtain a postsecondary degree by age as those from low-income families Finally achievement lags in science technology engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) fields all areas that show high wage returns to training and underpin future innovation. Recent test results in primary and secondary education suggest that American schoolchildren are lagging The Foundations of Growth | behind in math and science. The Programme for International Student Assessment survey for example showed that American students placed 17th of developed countries in science and 25th in math.2 President Obama recognizes that education is not only a driver of growth but also the surest way for individuals to share in the gains from growth. The challenge in developing a world-leading workforce involves both increasing educational attainment and enhancing the quality of education in this country. That is why the President has established a goal for the United States to resume world leadership in college degree attainment by To reach this goal the Nation must raise its college completion rate from percent to percent. That requires million additional young people to graduate from America s colleges and universities over the next years The Administration has put forward a two-pronged strategy that first seeks to ensure that higher education is accessible and affordable to all individuals and second promotes innovative reform to ensure educational quality. The Administration s strategy gives states incentives to innovate toward comprehensive education reform as well as to adopt college- and career-ready standards of achievement. Effective education requires support from cradle to career. Reforms are needed at every level to produce a strong and competitive workforce Early Childhood Education The years before kindergarten are among the most significant in shaping a child s foundation for learning and school success. Research shows that high-quality early learning programs help children arrive at kindergarten ready to succeed in school and in life reducing achievement gaps that first appear at early ages. Disadvantaged students who have access to such programs realize positive gains in their cognitive social emotional and language skills ( Cunha et al. ) Investments in early childhood education can improve academic attainment reduce the need for special education and increase future graduation rates. Early childhood education also has been shown to reduce future crime and teenage pregnancy for disadvantaged children. Furthermore investments in high-quality early childhood learning programs have been shown to be extremely cost-effective with lasting returns to society as high as percent per year ( Belfield et al. ) Recognizing the benefits of early childhood learning the Administration s FY Budget proposes to establish a new competitive Early Learning Challenge Fund ( ELCF ) States would compete for grant Results of the most recent National Assessment for Educational Progress show that although American students have improved in math over the past years only percent of 12th graders are proficient or better in math | Chapter aid from this fund by establishing systems of early learning that set high standards and ensure that more children enter kindergarten with the skills necessary for success. The fund would promote evidence-based evaluation of programs strategies for families and parents to assess the quality of early learning programs and the creation of age-appropriate curricula and assessment systems Elementary and Secondary Education Just as early childhood education is important to prepare children for primary education the K system is crucial to prepare students for college and the workplace. Too many students leave high school with inadequate academic preparation. In the school year one in five first-year college students took remedial courses a costly situation for both the student and society. The need for remedial work is also a warning sign that the student is more likely to drop out without completing his or her degree ( Adelman ) The task of improving college and labor market preparedness thus begins well before a student reaches college or the labor market The Administration is committed to fostering innovation that will improve educational outcomes. The Recovery Act created Race to the Top the largest-ever federal competitive investment in school reform. Race to the Top is designed to spur state and local reforms in K education by allowing states to innovate and formulate their own solutions. The program provides competitive grants to encourage and reward states that have taken action to improve teacher quality adopt college- and career-ready standards incorporate better data into decisionmaking and improve student achievement in low-performing schools Encouraged by the Race to the Top initiative states worked together to create a voluntary set of college- and career-ready standards which establish a shared set of clear educational guidelines for language arts and mathematics education. As of December states and the District of Columbia had adopted these standards. Many states also pledged to undertake a variety of innovative measures including allowing more charter schools and promoting the use of better student achievement data to inform teacher evaluations. In August nine states and the District of Columbia were named Phase winners of Race to the Top joining Phase winners Delaware and Tennessee. The program will benefit all of America s students whether or not they live in a state that was awarded a grant. By providing incentives for all states to institute reforms the program has spurred reform across the country. Thirty-four states have changed state education laws or policies to make them more conducive to reform that The Foundations of Growth | will provide higher-quality instruction and give students in low-performing schools access to the education that they deserve Another focus of the Administration s reform efforts is improving low-performing schools. As established in the Recovery Act School Improvement Grants provide a total of $ billion to transform the lowestperforming schools so that disadvantaged students receive the instruction and resources they need to succeed in the college or career of their choice Already more than schools are participating in this program The theme of giving states incentives to undertake reforms adopt national standards of achievement and improve the lowest-performing schools is embodied in the Administration s Blueprint for Reform in K released in March Building on the success of Race to the Top the Blueprint seeks to bring innovative strategies and meaningful standards to all states. This plan will fix No Child Left Behind s accountability system with a new federal framework built around five key priorities : implementing college- and career-ready standards placing effective teachers and leaders in every school providing equity and opportunity for all students rewarding states and school districts that excel and promoting innovation and continuous improvement. Recognizing the importance of finding and supporting local solutions the Blueprint proposes federal funding to support state and local school district efforts in tackling these goals. The FY Budget proposes consolidating dozens of redundant programs from No Child Left Behind providing resources to help schools focus on results. The Blueprint s framework is centered on rewarding success and providing greater flexibility to local actors in developing school improvement plans In today s global economy it is essential that all students be prepared academically for whatever career path they choose. The Administration has specifically targeted improving education in STEM subjects to maintain a skilled innovative workforce in these growing fields ( Box ) In addition the Obama Administration dramatically increased funding for the Teacher Incentive Fund which supports efforts to develop and implement performance-based teacher and principal compensation systems in high-need schools. In September grants were awarded to school districts and state education departments that had developed rigorous transparent and fair teacher and principal evaluation systems as measured by both higher achievement for students and classroom observations | Chapter Box : STEM Education and Educate to Innovate Training in science technology engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) fields is an important pathway to high-quality jobs and STEM education is also critical to producing future innovators who will develop new products and ideas. Recognizing the importance of teachers in K education and especially in STEM fields the President has set a goal of training an additional effective STEM teachers over the next years. The Administration s proposed FY Budget includes $ million devoted to this task The Administration s Educate to Innovate campaign focuses specifically on improving children s education in STEM fundamentals in the classroom and beyond. Key elements of the campaign are harnessing public-private partnerships that build support around science and math teachers connecting kids to the wonder of invention and discovery and raising the profile of science through initiatives like the White House Science Fair. The Educate to Innovate campaign hopes to increase STEM literacy ; move American students to the top of the international pack in STEM performance ; and expand awareness especially among underrepresented groups of STEM career opportunities As part of this campaign the President announced the launch of Change the Equation in September This nonprofit organization was formed by the business community in response to the President s spring call to action at the National Academy of Sciences for all Americans to join in elevating STEM education as a national priority. In its first year of operation Change the Equation will work with member companies to spread effective STEM education programs to sites across the country. It will also create a scorecard to assess the condition of STEM education in all states building a baseline from which to measure progress in coming years. Furthermore Change the Equation will identify and share principles for effective business involvement in STEM education helping its member companies judge and improve the effectiveness of their own programs through robust self-evaluation tools The immediate goal of Change the Equation is to replicate within one year successful privately funded programs in high-need schools and communities. These programs include robotics competitions and improved professional development for math and science teachers. With leadership from the President and the private sector a membership of more than CEOs and funding of $ million for its first year of operations Change the Equation is well positioned to promote its three key goals : great teaching inspired learners and a committed Nation The Foundations of Growth | Advancements in education technology have the potential to improve K education by personalizing the learning experience and reducing the time needed for students to gain new knowledge. The Administration supports several programs as well as the launch of an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Education which will promote education technology innovations. With broadband cloud computing digital devices and software these technologies can spread widely and allow both the identification and adoption of best practices Higher Education American universities remain a renowned strength of the Nation s educational system ( Box ) To reach the President s goal of leading the world in college completion by and to provide the skilled workforce needed for the economy to thrive the Administration has prioritized making the college and university system accessible and affordable to all The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act ( HCERA ) signed in March helps build a more reliable and effective financial aid system by making all federal loans Stafford loans PLUS loans and consolidation loans available directly to students ending subsidies once paid to thirdparty administrators. By saving $ billion in subsidies over the next years the direct loan program allows for deficit reduction and for greater investments in college affordability To make college more affordable to low-income students the Administration also has greatly expanded the Pell Grant program. In addition to Recovery Act support for the Pell Grant program HCERA invests more than $ billion in Pell Grants raising the maximum Pell award from $ in to $ in and to an estimated $ in Pell Grants can be applied toward traditional college expenses as well as to vocational and adult education programs The impact of these efforts is already evident with nearly million Pell Grant recipients in the academic year. That is more than double the figure from years earlier and is percent above the level. Furthermore the average award of $ is percent larger than the average award in In addition the American Opportunity Tax Credit ( AOTC ) established in the Recovery Act provides up to $ a year for college tuition and related expenses for American families. The AOTC is refundable thereby also reaching lower-income families. The tax credit increased tax incentives for higher education by more than percent and benefited million students and their families in In December the President signed an extension of the AOTC through the end of and he has proposed making it permanent | Chapter Box : America s Universities : Leading the World Despite the relative decline in educational attainment in the United States America s universities remain the strongest in the world According to the Times Higher Education rankings for the United States boasts of the top universities in the world. In addition American institutions remain the most popular destination for foreign graduate and undergraduate students. Of students traveling out of their country of residence for tertiary education percent go to the United States more than the combined share of those who go to the next two most popular countries the United Kingdom and Germany. The remarkable diversity of America s graduate programs has been shown to increase innovation and research productivity ( Stuen Maskus and Mobarak ) making these programs even more attractive to both domestic and international students Universities play the dual role of creating new ideas and training high-skill workers and American universities lead the world on this front. Since percent of Nobel Prize winning research has been performed in the United States mostly at universities. The diversity of the Nation s colleges and universities is a great strength : percent of the U.S. Nobel Prize winners since were foreign born and percent of these immigrants received their graduate degrees in the United States Furthermore American universities give students world-class training for the high-skill jobs of the future. University students in the United States have the opportunity to learn from the world s leading scientists and scholars ensuring that the best new ideas enter the American workforce. Preparing the American workforce for the 21st century depends on taking innovative ideas from the laboratory to the workforce and universities provide that bridge Federal efforts to increase financial aid particularly the Pell Grant program are the primary reason that net tuition ( tuition minus grant aid ) has fallen at all types of colleges and universities over the past five years even as published tuition has risen substantially. To make higher education more accessible to all students the HCERA provides $ billion over the next decade to strengthen Minority-Serving Institutions ( including Historically Black Colleges and Universities ) nationwide. These schools play a key role in educating low- and middle-income students enrolling nearly percent of the Nation s million minority undergraduate students and accounting for nearly one-third of all degree-granting institutions in higher education These steps will ensure that minority students are given every chance to earn The Foundations of Growth | degrees and to enter ( or return to ) the workforce with the skills they need to succeed Job Training In addition to traditional education pathways job training programs provide vital opportunities for workers to gain new skills well suited to today s economy. Skill upgrading can be especially important for displaced workers whose skills might otherwise erode while they search for new job opportunities. Training is provided by a diverse set of institutions including proprietary ( for-profit ) schools four-year colleges community-based organizations labor unions and public vocational and technical schools. Studies have documented that well-designed training and adult education programs can improve participants labor market outcomes increasing earnings and the probability of employment ( CEA ) These improvements appear to be especially strong in training programs with a targeted focus on specific sectors such as technical or high-growth sectors and in programs that operate with a high level of employer involvement ( Maguire et al. ) The Skills for America s Future initiative encourages and promotes these types of partnerships ( Box ) The Administration has acted to promote career training for displaced workers giving them the new skills they need to meet the demands of a competitive economy. HCERA provides $ billion to fund the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training Grant Program which provides grants to institutions of higher education to improve and expand programs suited to help workers affected by trade Under the program competitive funds will be made available to community colleges over the next four years to help increase completion of degrees certificates and other industry-recognized credentials. In addition the Affordable Care Act passed in March makes investments in workforce training in the high-growth field of health care providing funding to train additional doctors dentists physicians assistants and much-needed nurses Finally the Administration has called on Congress to reauthorize and modernize the Workforce Investment Act ( WIA ) The aim is to fuel the development and replication of effective practices in job training adult education and vocational rehabilitation. The Recovery Act provided nearly $ billion for WIA programs including $ million for adult employment and training activities nearly $ billion to train displaced workers and $ million for a program of competitive grants for worker training and placement in the high-growth sectors of health care and clean energy. About percent of workers receiving job training through WIA programs attend community colleges putting those institutions on the front lines of training America s workforce for the jobs of tomorrow | Chapter Box : Skills for America s Future In October President Obama announced the creation of the Skills for America s Future ( SAF ) initiative to foster collaborative efforts between the private sector community colleges labor unions and other institutions with a commitment to scaling up meaningful and measurable solutions. The goal is to build a nationwide network of stakeholders who will work to maximize workforce development strategies job training programs and job placement SAF will identify and highlight characteristics of successful training programs that can be replicated and scaled up to reach more workers and institutions. The initiative already has the commitment of private sector leaders along with innovative institutions to advance these efforts. Actively engaging private employers with expertise and knowledge of required credentials as well as local labor market conditions is critical to the success of training programs. Building and encouraging collaborative efforts between private employers and public community colleges and other institutions is one of the cornerstones of the Skills for America s Future initiative In conjunction with SAF the President also established the Skills for America s Future Task Force cochaired by top-level Administration policymakers to coordinate federal efforts to ensure that the private sector is well poised to work with and leverage federal training and education efforts Conclusion Throughout its history the United States has demonstrated a remarkable capacity to innovate and generate substantial increases in American standards of living. With the private sector in the lead and appropriate public investments where markets fall short Americans will continue to see rapid broad-based and sustained economic growth. The Obama Administration is making investments in our national innovation system infrastructure and skills to provide the right foundations for prosperity. These foundations will ensure that year after year America s greatest resource its people can build a brighter future The Foundations of Growth | C H A P T E R THE WORLD ECONOMY L ike the U.S. economy the world economy moved toward recovery in with positive economic growth reestablished in most regions and rebounding world trade. Emerging-market economies made substantial contributions to world growth demonstrating their increasing importance to the world and U.S. economies. International policy coordination continued to play an important role : two leaders summits of the Group of Twenty ( G-20 ) were held in and significant agreements were reached on important global challenges such as ensuring a strong sustainable and balanced global recovery and setting core elements of a new financial regulatory framework including bank capital and liquidity standards The world economy however must not only recover but also shift away from its pre-crisis pattern of growth that was too dependent on U.S consumption. Global imbalances narrowed significantly during the crisis Now a fundamental challenge is to restore growth without restoring the old growth model and patterns of demand that led to those imbalances Even without the economic crisis however the world economy would be undergoing substantial change. China has grown from the sixth- to the second-largest economy in just a decade and the Group of Seven ( G-7 ) advanced countries share of the world economy continues to shrink as numerous emerging markets grow onto the world stage. These changes are generating shifts in world production and trade but the growth of emerging markets need not portend a de-industrialization of advanced economies or a fall in the standard of living of Americans. The United States is home to many of the most innovative firms in the world universities that attract more students than any other country and the most productive workers of any major economy. In addition output per capita is higher in the United States than in any of the other G-7 nations and much higher than in any emerging economy. These shifts do require however that the United States evolve to meet both new opportunities and new challenges. The same forces described in Chapter on long-run growth innovation education and infrastructure investment coupled with a smart trade policy are crucial to the evolving role of the U.S. economy in the world The United States both as part of the economic recovery and as part of its engagement with the global economy must increase its exports over time. Substantial import growth in rapidly growing regions around the world helped drive U.S. exports at a fast pace in moving the United States closer to the Administration s goal of doubling exports by the end of Emerging-market economies are playing a growing part in U.S. trade relationships and that role will only strengthen in the coming years. Robust enforcement of market access agreed to in previous trade accords new trade agreements to guarantee access to these important emerging markets and encouragement of balanced growth around the world will all help spur faster export growth. A range of additional policy initiatives advocacy export credit and improvements in the U.S. transportation and supply chain infrastructure can also contribute to export growth Status of the World Recovery The world economy in faced its most wrenching economic crisis in a generation. The recovery from that crisis has been quite rapid in many regions leading to a rebound in world economic growth and trade Many challenges remain however. Regions are growing at different paces and many countries are facing some combination of slow growth a need for fiscal consolidation or complications from rising prices or increased capital inflows. Fortunately institutions like the G-20 which were platforms for increased economic cooperation during the crisis have been able to continue to play a positive role in the world economy Crisis Fading But Challenges Remain The world economy has experienced both a remarkable setback and rebound in the past three years. The global contraction in the second half of and first quarter of was sharp but relatively short-lived. By the second quarter of the world s growth rate ( the weighted average of the growth rate of countries real gross domestic product or GDP ) was positive and by the third quarter the average growth rate had returned to its levels. The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) projects that for the four quarters of the world economy grew more than percent and will continue at that pace in ( IMF ) | Chapter Although average growth coming out of the crisis has been rapid it has not been evenly distributed as Figure demonstrates. The financial market shocks of the recession were concentrated in the advanced economies and those economies have rebounded more slowly. Most emerging-market economies rebounded quickly ; some in fact never saw a contraction just a slowdown in their rapid growth. In the first half of real GDP in the emerging-market countries of the G-20 grew percent on average ( at an annual rate ) compared with percent for the G-7 countries ( growth slowed slightly in both groups in the third quarter ) The IMF projects that substantially faster emerging-market growth will persist predicting growth of percent in emerging and developing economies in and compared with roughly percent in advanced economies Figure Real GDP Growth Percent ( annual rate ) Emerging G-20 G-7 : Q3 : Q2 : Q2 : Q2 : Q2 : Q2 Sources : Country sources ; CEA calculations It is not surprising to see advanced economies grow more slowly than emerging ones. Emerging markets tend to have faster population growth and hence a growing labor supply and can converge toward advanced economies through rapid productivity growth as they upgrade the education of their workforce and the technology they use. Still a gap of roughly The G-20 is made up of major economies plus the European Union. The G-7 includes the largest advanced economies of that group ( by size of economy the United States Japan Germany the United Kingdom France Italy and Canada ) The remaining members of the G-20 are Australia and South Korea along with major emerging-market nations : Argentina Brazil China India Indonesia Mexico Russia Saudi Arabia South Africa and Turkey. Throughout this chapter division of countries into emerging and advanced is based on IMF definitions The World Economy | percentage points in the growth rates of emerging and advanced economies is unusually large. Such a gap existed in the years immediately preceding the crisis but between and the gap was much narrower : emerging and developing economies grew at an average of percent whereas the average for advanced economies was percent Several serious challenges to sustained global growth remain. The unemployment rate in many advanced nations is still unacceptably high. As Figure shows the unemployment rate in the euro area is still at its peak and the U.S. rate is trending down only very slowly. At the same time many advanced economies face substantial fiscal deficits. The U.S. Federal fiscal deficit in was percent of GDP the euro-area deficit was percent and Japan s was percent. Over the next few years those deficits will have to come down. They will likely fall significantly because of the business cycle ( deficits tend to shrink as economies recover ) but further fiscal consolidation will be needed over time. Maintaining sufficient growth to lower the unemployment rate while simultaneously implementing credible mediumterm fiscal consolidation will be a challenge in many countries. Further some euro-area countries have faced pressure from financial markets in the form of rising yields on their debt forcing them to lean toward faster consolidation. Because the advanced economies are operating below capacity their inflation rates have been low. Core rates were close to percent in the United States and the euro area and deflation continued in Japan. Thus far central banks have maintained an accommodative monetary policy stance with the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan adding new quantitative easing measures in and the Bank of England and the European Central Bank keeping policy rates low In contrast rising inflation is a concern in emerging-market countries where growth has been faster. The 12-month change in consumer prices in China breached percent ( above the percent target for and China is now reported to have raised its target to percent for ) ; wholesale price inflation in India rose above percent during the spring and summer of ; and inflation rates began to creep up in in many other emergingmarket countries. Many central banks have raised policy rates or taken other action to calm inflation. The contrast between fast growth with rising interest rates in the emerging world and slower growth with lower interest rates in advanced economies has put pressure on capital flows and exchange rates. After depreciating during the crisis the currencies of emergingmarket nations of the G-20 appreciated percent on average over the first months of on a real trade-weighted basis and capital flows into these countries increased as well.2 Thus far emerging nations have responded Net portfolio investment flows into emerging-market G-20 countries turned negative at the peak of the crisis but rebounded in and | Chapter with a varying mix of currency appreciation currency intervention and capital controls. Total foreign exchange holdings by emerging and developing countries rose by roughly $ billion in the first three quarters of ( more than double the amount in the first three quarters of after adjusting for valuation changes ) reflecting increased currency intervention aimed at slowing or preventing appreciation Figure Unemployment Rate Percent Euro area Dec-2010 United States Japan Jan-2007 Jan-2008 Jan-2009 Jan-2010 Sources : Country sources ; CEA calculations While overall world growth has rebounded another crucial challenge to the world economy is to make up for the output lost during the recession. By the end of June the world economy had recovered to the level of output before the recession but world GDP remains considerably below the output trend it was on before the crisis struck. Research suggests that financial recessions are long and deep and whether the output lost is completely recovered is an important issue.3 For the world economy to return to its previous output trend several years of above-average growth will be necessary Reinhart and Rogoff ( ) demonstrate that financial recessions are longer and deeper than other kinds of recessions but the authors do not comment on whether the output loss is permanent. IMF ( ) argues that on average countries do face a medium-term output loss and thus never recover to the pre-crisis trend level but that study ( which looked at earlier recessions ) found wide variation in outcomes with the top quarter of countries more than percent above their pre-crisis output trend seven years after a banking crisis. In addition a variety of methodological choices may bias the IMF results toward finding a permanent loss. Other work finds that most countries recover all output lost in a financial recession over the medium term ( see for example Cecchetti Kohler and Upper ) The World Economy | The Rebound in World Trade A particular difficulty during the recession was the collapse in world trade. Even countries with little connection to the financial aspects of the recession were nonetheless affected as demand for imports plummeted and financing conditions for export credit tightened ( Baldwin ) Trade fell even faster than GDP : the unprecedented collapse of world trade during the last quarter of and the first quarter of saw an almost simultaneous precipitous decline of exports and imports across all major regions of the world Trade has recovered more quickly than GDP has : exports and imports picked up during the second and third quarters of and continued the V-shaped recovery in advancing significantly ahead of expectations In October the IMF expected real world trade ( adjusted for prices ) to grow just percent in Only months later the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development projected a percent increase In April the IMF forecast a percent increase and in the fall of both institutions expected over percent growth for the year Figure Import Volume Indexes Index ( : Q1 = ) Emerging Asia Latin America Japan Euro area United States : Q1 : Q3 : Q1 : Q3 : Q1 : Q3 : Q1 : Q3 Sources : CPB World Trade Monitor ; CEA calculations Important regional differences mark both the contraction in trade during the recession and the expansion of imports and exports during the recovery. Figure shows the import volume ( adjusted for prices ) and Figure the export volume of various regions relative to their levels in the first quarter of Asia s emerging economies experienced a sharp decline | Chapter of imports and exports but they were among the quickest to recover and were the first in to reach their pre-crisis levels. Japan whose exports plunged nearly percent from peak to trough in the crisis also rebounded in closing the year with exports less than percent below the precrisis peak. Japan s imports fell by only half as much as its exports and they too were recovering but had not attained their pre-crisis levels by the end of Figure Export Volume Indexes Index ( : Q1 = ) Emerging Asia Latin America United States Japan Euro area : Q1 : Q3 : Q1 : Q3 : Q1 : Q3 : Q1 : Q3 Sources : CPB World Trade Monitor ; CEA calculations The export decline in the United States was similar to that in the euroarea countries but U.S. exports have recovered more quickly. U.S. imports initially declined more sharply than those in the euro area but they also have rebounded substantially. Among all of the major regions of the world the euro area has had the slowest resumption in import growth Finally despite the substantial progress in the V-shaped trade recovery as of the third quarter of none of these economies had yet achieved the level of trade that had been projected to take place had precrisis trends continued in the absence of the trade collapse Global Policy Coordination During the crisis world leaders established the G-20 as the premier international body for international economic coordination. The G-20 whose members account for nearly percent of world GDP continued to The World Economy | play a pivotal role in holding two leaders summits as well as finance ministers and deputies meetings along with continual staff work At the leaders summit in Pittsburgh in under U.S. leadership the G-20 committed to work toward strong balanced sustainable global growth. In Toronto in June leaders made commitments to boost demand where needed and to strengthen public finances and financial systems. In Seoul in November they agreed to undertake macroeconomic policies to ensure ongoing recovery and sustainable growth including making exchange rates more market-determined and adopting other policies to temper global imbalances The G-20 also followed up on significant commitments to reform the international financial system and its institutions. Through the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision nations around the globe negotiated a new framework for banking supervision that is intended to improve the ability of the global financial system to absorb shocks and reduce the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy. The framework involves raising capital standards broadening the coverage of supervision introducing global liquidity standards and promoting the buildup of capital buffers in good times G-20 nations also followed through on their commitment to change the governance structure of the two major international financial institutions : the IMF and the World Bank. The governance structure of these two organizations was heavily weighted toward advanced countries and each is now being changed to incorporate more leadership from major emergingmarket countries including changes to quota shares and board seats Finally policy coordination has continued as various financial difficulties have appeared throughout the year. The focus of much of the concern during has been on sovereign debt in Europe. First central banks including the Federal Reserve coordinated to ensure sufficient liquidity across markets. More importantly in May European leaders worked with the IMF to create a European Financial Stabilization mechanism with up to $ trillion committed to stabilizing the debt markets for various euro-area nations. The funds were first used in Greece to provide a necessary backstop as that country tried to rebalance a precarious fiscal situation. Toward the end of the year the mechanism was used to backstop Ireland as it struggled with the costs of its banking system | Chapter The Evolution of the World Economy The world economy has begun a transformation. Rapidly growing emerging-market countries and some advanced countries with high savings will need to provide more demand to the world economy and countries that are borrowing too much will need to save more. Changes are already taking place in the composition of U.S. exports as services play a larger role but there will likely be continuity as well as the United States maintains its exports of products that rely on sound legal institutions an innovative economy and the high skills and productivity of U.S. workers. More of those products though are likely to be headed toward rapidly growing emerging markets a change that will be essential if the U.S. economy is to meet the Administration s goal of doubling exports in five years Global Imbalances As the G-20 actions show world leaders have recognized that more balanced growth is essential to the world economy. The United States had a large current account deficit before the crisis and the Administration has been clear that the United States must find a more balanced growth model one that involves more exports and investment. The trade balance or net exports represents the bulk of the current account ( net income on overseas assets and unilateral transfers such as foreign aid and remittances make up the rest ) At the same time the current account represents the net lending of a country to the rest of the world because if a country exports less than it imports it must either borrow or sell foreign assets to pay for that consumption from abroad The issue of global imbalances is a problem not just for the United States but for all nations. A single country s saving behavior can affect saving and investment around the globe. A large deficit for example can take up too much world savings and crowd out borrowing in other countries Conversely a current account surplus means a country is not contributing as much to world demand as it is to world supply and may be lowering world interest rates and encouraging deficits in other countries. Surpluses become particularly contentious when global output is below potential output. Thus the macroeconomic behavior and outcomes of different countries are linked.4 Before the crisis when the United States was too reliant on consumption other countries around the world were also too reliant on U.S consumption and exports to the United States Current account deficits or surpluses are not always a bad thing. Where many productive opportunities exist a country may borrow to invest more than its savings allow and may therefore want a deficit ; alternatively a country may temporarily have an excess of savings. However large persistent surpluses or deficits can be a sign of more structural imbalances in an economy The World Economy | The United States accounts for roughly one-quarter of the world economy and consumption has historically accounted for roughly twothirds of the U.S. economy. Thus one might normally expect percent of world aggregate demand growth to come from U.S. consumers. But emerging and developing economies often grow faster than more mature economies. Thus a larger portion of world growth would be expected to come from emerging economies than their share of the world economy would warrant From to though U.S. consumption played an outsized role in the world economy with roughly percent of the growth in the world economy coming from growth in U.S. consumption. This level was simply not sustainable. During this period U.S. consumption rose to percent of the U.S. economy personal saving fell to very low levels and U.S business equipment and software investment growth lagged behind GDP growth. At the same time the fiscal position of the U.S. Federal Government moved from substantial surpluses at the end of the 1990s to substantial deficits in the mid-2000s. These deficits also contributed to lower national saving. Such macroeconomic behavior had important implications for the world economy. The rapid growth in consumption and decline in saving ( both personal and government ) meant that the United States increasingly borrowed from the world and had a growing current account deficit At the same time that consumption was outpacing income in the United States many other countries had export growth well in excess of GDP growth. Falling transport prices and the rise of globally integrated production supply chains mean that the production of a single good may generate far more recorded exports and imports than the value of the final good itself To illustrate consider a smartphone whose various parts may be traded across many borders at different stages of production before final assembly and sale of the phone. Each time a component crosses a border to move to the next stage of processing it counts as an import for one country and an export for another. As a result the total value of exports and imports for various countries from that one phone will likely exceed the total final value of the phone leading to faster export growth than GDP growth when one more phone is made. From to exports grew faster than GDP in nearly every major economy. Of the largest exporters though the United States had the lowest rate of export growth percent compared with an average of percent among the other top exporters. Even among other advanced countries the average was percent. The United States still exports more goods and services than any other country in the world but over the past decade it relied too much on domestic consumption to drive | Chapter growth and not enough on the rest of the world. As a result its export growth lagged and its lead shrunk significantly Some countries such as India and Brazil opened up to the world economy and saw both their exports and imports rise substantially over the decade before the crisis. Their exports as a share of GDP increased but they were not dependent on external demand for growth because they were both selling to and buying from the world. Yet other countries experienced the mirror image of the U.S. model of the 2000s. Rather than imports and consumption rising faster than incomes exports and savings increased so that both exports and the trade surplus continued to grow as a share of their economies. These surplus countries thus effectively funded the borrowing of deficit countries and provided less demand support to the world economy From to China s current account rose from a surplus of percent of GDP to percent while Germany s moved from a deficit to a percent surplus. While Germany s surplus rose other countries in the euro area ( France Greece Italy Portugal and Spain ) experienced rising deficits Figure shows that as the decade of the 2000s wore on the global imbalances worsened. The U.S. deficit and the Chinese and German surpluses grew not just as a share of their own GDP but as a share of world GDP as well. By the U.S. deficit was shrinking as a share of both U.S and world GDP but China s surplus continued to rise as a share of world GDP and the euro-area deficit countries combined current account deficit was expanding as well Figure Current Account Deficits or Surpluses as a Share of World GDP Percent Japan Germany China U.S Rest of world Euro deficit : Q1 : Q2 : Q3 Notes : " Euro deficit " represents France Greece Ireland Portugal and Spain. " Rest of world " represents all other countries not shown here plus the statistical discrepancy Sources : Country sources ; CEA calculations The World Economy | The crisis brought about a sharp change in these imbalances.5 The U.S. current account deficit shrank from percent of its GDP to less than percent in At the same time China s surplus fell from percent of its GDP in to percent in Still as is clear from the figure imbalances remain and have begun once again to widen albeit slowly. The U.S. current account deficit is still less than percent of U.S. GDP and given that the United States is growing somewhat slower than the world as a whole this deficit is shrinking further as a share of world GDP. The surpluses in both Germany and China remain above percent however Furthermore when a fast-growing country such as China has a constant surplus as a share of its GDP that implies the surplus is growing as a share of the world s GDP. Also while U.S. borrowing in the early 2000s was larger than the surpluses in Germany Japan and China combined over time the current account surpluses in these countries grew and by the third quarter of their combined total was considerably larger than the U.S. current account deficit. As noted the G-20 continues to work on how to reorient countries policies so they are more mutually consistent and growth is more balanced and sustainable Box : What Do We Owe the Rest of the World ? Because the current account represents net borrowing in a year it indicates the net capital flows ( such as securities purchases bank deposits and direct investment ) into a country. Along with adjustments for changes in exchange rates and asset prices the current account measures the change in a country s net foreign wealth ( all of the assets its investors own abroad minus all the claims on its economy by foreign investors ) Net borrowing by U.S. residents over the past decade has left a negative net international investment position of roughly percent of U.S. GDP. Relative to other countries this negative position is still fairly small as a share of GDP.a Box continued on next page U.S. personal consumption increased to more than percent of the world economy in and measured in current dollars but over time that share began to shrink. A depreciating real exchange rate and rapid growth in emerging markets meant that by U.S. consumption as a share of the world economy had declined to percent. Despite growing by percent in U.S. imports as a share of the world economy fell that year. The simple fact that emerging markets often grow faster suggested that U.S. consumers and U.S. imports could not continue to absorb such a large share of the world economy. The crisis abruptly and sharply changed the relationships but they were already shifting well before the crisis erupted | Chapter Box continued In addition foreign investors own only about percent of the overall financial assets in the U.S. economy. This fact is sometimes obscured by foreign investors preference for U.S. Treasury bills. Because so much of U.S. net foreign debt is concentrated in one asset class the United States is often viewed as a massive debtor to the world. Foreign investors own roughly one-third of U.S. Treasury securities ( roughly one-half if Treasury securities held by government trust funds such as the Social Security Trust Fund are excluded ) ( see box figure ) China is the largest foreign holder of U.S Treasuries but China s investors own just percent of the total one-fifth as much as U.S. bondholders ( some foreign holdings may be misclassified if for example China buys Treasuries through a London investment bank that buys them from the United States ) Major Holders of U.S. Treasury Securities % China mainland % Japan % % European Union % % Financial centers Other foreign United States Intra-U.S. Government % Notes : Financial centers include Caribbean banking centers Hong Kong Luxembourg Singapore and Switzerland Sources : Treasury International Capital data October ; Department of the Treasury Monthly Statement of the Public Debt of the United States a The U.S. net international investment position has not become as negative as one might have expected based on the amount of borrowing over the 2000s. In addition to borrowing in any given year the values of U.S. foreign assets and liabilities change in response to changes in market conditions. Over the past decade the United States has had on net positive valuation effects ( Lane and Milesi-Ferretti ) Strong asset performance in the United States and changes in currency may have led to a decline in the net international investment position in The World Economy | Determinants of Exports The United States is well positioned to spur growth through exports even if the precise composition of the goods and services America will sell to the world in the future is not known today. The pattern of trade between one economy and another quite different economy is determined in part by the forces of comparative advantage that is what it is that differentiates the two economies. Comparative advantage can lie in differences in labor productivity the relative availability of a country s natural and physical resources the educational priorities that help to determine the skill sets of its people and even the institutions that can create different conditions across national markets. For example the United States exports high-tech machinery to other countries that may not have the high-skill labor or advanced technology required to make those goods. Also high judicial quality and good contract enforcement give the United States an advantage in the production of goods and services that require businesses to invest to tailor products to particular consumer needs. Thus the United States has a comparative advantage in highly complex products that are difficult to commoditize Such products may require teamwork in the design and production process and substantial financial investment in research and development ( R&D ) and hence commitment to the protection of intellectual property But comparative advantage does not explain the determinants of and benefits to the back-and-forth trade of similar products ( intraindustry trade ) especially that taking place between similar economies. A modernday example is trade in smartphones. Beginning in the late 1990s a Canadian firm was a first entrant to the wireless communications market and U.S business consumers flocked to import a mobile device that could send and receive e-mail messages. Soon thereafter U.S. firms innovated and engineered different varieties of these mobile products with additional features that increasingly appealed to individual consumers as well. Consumers in other countries ( including Canada ) imported substantial quantities of these U.S.-designed smartphones. The ability to trade internationally let these firms produce for multiple markets and take advantage of scale economies and it encouraged their entrepreneurship and innovation by providing a larger potential market. But manufacturers are not the only ones that gain ; consumers in the United States and Canada also benefit through access to foreign-designed varieties of the product in addition to those that are conceived and produced domestically Product quality is also important to understanding the determinants of intraindustry exports. Generally speaking richer countries tend to specialize in higher-quality goods within the same product type while developing and emerging economies tend to focus on goods further down the | Chapter quality ladder. For example Italy may import low-cost T-shirts from China but it is a leader in exporting high-quality high-fashion shirts to the world Those products that have wide variation in quality allow advanced-country firms to differentiate their goods and services away from imported varieties from low-wage countries Manufacturing Exports. While the United States is still the largest combined exporter of goods and services America has slid from being the world s leading exporter of goods at the beginning of the century to the third position behind China and Germany. Nevertheless the United States continues to export over $ trillion of goods annually more than threequarters of which are manufactured and these exports support more than one-fourth of the manufacturing jobs in the United States. As Figure indicates manufacturing and agriculture goods combine to make up more than two-thirds of total U.S. exports Figure U.S. Exports by Sector Percent Manufacturing Services Agriculture Note : data are through October Sources : Bureau of Economic Analysis / Census Bureau U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services Experience from other high-income countries shows that a shift in the world share of exported goods does not mean a shift entirely out of manufacturing and into a service-only economy. Germany the secondplace goods exporter maintains a substantial share of manufacturing in its economy and exports many of these products ( including to emerging markets ) Manufacturing is also a larger share of the economy in Japan than it is in the United States. Like the United States these countries have a The World Economy | floating currency and highly paid high-skilled workers. The rise of emerging markets with lower wages but also lower productivity has not forced these high-income countries out of manufacturing. Richer countries do tend to produce and consume more services than do emerging-market countries Nevertheless manufacturing especially of complex products continues to play a substantial role in advanced economies including the U.S. economy Services Exports. Services are of increasing importance to highincome economies. Some services are nontraded such as restaurant meals live entertainment and cleaning services. But services such as consulting finance architecture accounting law and tourism are traded. With improvements in communications technology as well as infrastructure many services are becoming increasingly tradable. As noted nearly onethird of total U.S. exports annually are in services. Figure shows the rapid growth of U.S. services exports as well as the growing surplus in U.S services trade Figure U.S. Trade in Services Billions of dollars Billions of dollars Exports ( left axis ) Oct-2010 Trade balance ( right axis ) Jan-1992 Jan-1996 Jan-2000 Jan-2004 Jan-2008 Source : Census Bureau U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services Some of the largest and fastest-growing U.S. services exports are in business professional and technical services. Other important categories are insurance finance and education services. Analogous to the case of goods exports U.S. service exports are in sectors where U.S. firms and employees offer world-class high-quality performance and thus give the United States a strong comparative advantage | Chapter Changing Composition of Goods and Services Exports. Economic forces have traditionally allowed the United States to produce and export many of the goods and services in which it had a comparative advantage at that point in time. There is no reason to think that those forces will cease to operate going forward As the next section documents in more detail the growth in U.S exports is coming from new demand much of it from emerging economies Some emerging markets are quickly urbanizing and shifting away from subsistence agriculture thus increasing foreign demand for U.S.-grown farm exports such as soybeans corn and wheat. These emerging economies are developing a sizable middle class newly able to afford the higher-quality goods and services that they may not have been able to buy in the past. And the expansion of home-grown businesses in emerging economies creates new demand for R&D-intensive highly complex products such as aircraft turbojets oil and gas field machinery electronic integrated circuits and medical instruments. These products frequently sit at the top of the U.S export list and U.S. exports of these products will likely sit at the top of the quality ladder The details may be impossible to forecast accurately but past experience suggests that the U.S. export industry is likely to be built on high-quality goods and services that tap into entrepreneurial talents and that reflect the United States commitment to reward an innovative workforce. Many of the policies and programs described in Chapter as essential to long-run innovation and growth are also critical to the successful evolution of the United States as it adjusts to changes in the world economy Evolving U.S. Trade Patterns Even before the global economic crisis and recession of the United States had been in the midst of a longer-term reorientation of its international trade patterns. Understanding the relative shift in these trade patterns is as important as coming to terms with the shifting trends in the underlying goods and services that the United States produces and exports While historical trading partners such as Canada Japan and the European Union continue to be a strong component of overall U.S. trade the new and most dynamic sources of U.S. trading relationships are coming from other places in the world Increasing Trade with Emerging Economies. The share of total U.S exports sent to mature trading partners has been declining for decades The share of total U.S. goods exports consumed by the countries of the European Union ( EU ) dropped from nearly one-third ( percent ) in to one-fifth ( percent ) in even though these economies have The World Economy | grown increasingly wealthy. The share of total U.S. goods exports to historically important high-income economies like Japan and Canada has also shown signs of decline ( Figure ) But the European Union Canada and Japan are not buying less from the United States than they did in the past Rather U.S. exporters are now shipping an increasing amount of goods to other faster-growing economies in addition to maintaining their historical trading relations ( Figure ) Figure Share of U.S. Goods Exports to Mature Foreign Economies Percent EU-27 Canada Japan Sources : IMF Direction of Trade Statistics ; CEA calculations U.S. trade with China exemplifies this story. As late as the year before China joined the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) and substantially opened its market to imports only percent of all U.S. goods exports went to China. By after a decade of rapid growth China had become the fourth-largest destination market for U.S. goods exports after the European Union Canada and Mexico. Mexico is another prime example. Mexico s import tariffs in averaged percent with a maximum rate of percent ( de la Torre and Gonz lez ) Mexico signed onto the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) in and by it had cut those tariffs under the GATT to an average of percent with a maximum rate of only percent. In recent years the share of total U.S. goods exports to Mexico has remained steady at percent nearly double its level in the early 1980s before Mexico liberalized its economy signed onto the GATT and negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) | Chapter Figure Share of U.S. Goods Exports to Major Emerging Economies Percent Brazil India and other emerging economies Mexico signs onto GATT Mexico China ( and Hong Kong ) China joins WTO Sources : IMF Direction of Trade Statistics ; CEA calculations U.S. exports to several other emerging economies still have room to grow. The share of total U.S. goods exports going to Brazil India and a number of other emerging economies ( see Figure ) has increased slightly from its mid-1980s low point hitting a recent peak in the mid-1990s when some of these economies went through an initial phase of trade liberalization. U.S. export growth to these economies has since leveled off. Whether future U.S. export growth to these other emerging economies replicates the experience of earlier U.S. export expansions into China and Mexico and even to Japan through the 1980s ( see Figure ) depends partly on the extent to which these other emerging economies commit to liberalizing their import markets. A key item on the Administration s trade agenda is therefore continued work to open these markets through the Doha Round of WTO negotiations U.S. import patterns are also experiencing a reorientation. At the end of the 1940s Japan and the European Union countries were still devastated by World War II and far from being the mature economies they are now After these economies rebuilt however they quickly became large sources for U.S. imports. The European economies peaked at supplying nearly percent of U.S. goods imports in the late 1960s ; Japan peaked at roughly percent of U.S. imports in the mid-1980s. Imports from Canada peaked at nearly percent around U.S. imports from Canada the European Union and Japan continue to grow but the share of U.S. imports from The World Economy | these countries has declined as imports from fast-growing export markets including China and Mexico have increased ( Figure ) Figure Share of U.S. Goods Imports by Foreign Source Percent EU-27 Canada Japan Mexico China Sources : IMF Direction of Trade Statistics ; CEA calculations Doubling U.S. Exports. In his January State of the Union address the President established a goal of doubling U.S. exports of goods and services in five years meaning that nominal exports would double from their level of $ trillion to an annual level of $ trillion by the end of To meet that goal U.S. exports need to grow an average of percent a year. So far exports are on track to meet or exceed that pace. Through the first three quarters of U.S. exports of goods and services increased by percent relative to the same period in Doubling exports over five years will increase the number of jobs supported by exports and importantly these are on average higher-paying jobs Goods exports have been rising faster than total exports increasing percent through the first three quarters of But that total masks significant variation in exports to different regions. U.S. goods exports to the Pacific Rim ( East Asia and Oceania ) increased by percent to Latin America by percent to Canada and Mexico by percent but to Europe by only percent. This slow export growth to Europe means that even though it is a key export partner the European market contributed very little to export growth in Some of this variation is attributable to the longer term pre-crisis trends in which U.S. exports to many emerging economies were already increasing | Chapter The extent to which a region drives U.S. export growth is not simply a function of the growth rate of U.S. exports to the region. The size of the trading relationship matters. Even though exports to our NAFTA partners grew more slowly than those to the Pacific Rim exports to Canada and Mexico contributed more to total export growth because they represented roughly a third of all U.S. exports. Still increasing demand from emerging markets is essential to the growth of U.S. exports. Emerging markets accounted for percent of U.S. goods exports during the first nine months of but they generated half of the export growth during that period and might have generated even more than half had not excellent U.S export performance to Canada and Korea helped keep up export growth to advanced regions. Faster growth of exports to emerging economies means their share of U.S. exports will rise over time Figure U.S. Export Growth vs. Foreign GDP Growth : Q2 : Q2 U.S. nominal goods export growth percent Malaysia Colombia Canada EU Thailand Mexico HK China Australia Japan Korea Israel Singapore Brazil Turkey Taiwan India Chile Switzerland Russia Foreign real GDP growth percent Sources : IMF Monthly Direction of Trade Statistics ; country sources ; CEA calculations A crucial determinant of U.S. export growth to a region is the pace at which that market is growing that is the speed and depth of trading partners domestic economic recoveries. Figure illustrates this fact by showing the strong positive relationship between growth in foreign real GDP and nominal growth in U.S. goods exports between the second quarter of and the second quarter of The relationship suggests that each percentage point of economic growth in a country is correlated with The World Economy | more than percentage points of additional U.S. bilateral export growth Eliminating Singapore the sole outlier leads to a relationship of roughly three to one.6 Thus growth abroad is good for the United States the global economy is not a zero-sum game Figure Projected Share of U.S. Nominal Export Growth Canada % Mexico % EU % % China Other advanced economies % Other emerging / developing economies % Sources : IMF World Economic Outlook October ; Bureau of Economic Analysis / Census Bureau U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services ; CEA calculations U.S. export growth also benefits from changes in relative prices caused by faster inflation in growing emerging markets because faster inflation abroad means U.S. goods are cheaper on world markets relative to goods from these countries. These price and growth relationships suggest that if the United States is to double exports an overwhelming portion of that new export growth will come from faster-growing emerging and developing economies. Figure shows the share of projected growth of U.S. nominal exports by region using IMF forecasts for GDP and price growth in different regions. Trade with America s traditional partners will remain important For example trade with the European Union is likely still to be roughly percent of U.S. exports by and growth in exports to EU countries will be roughly percent of U.S. export growth over the five-year period But more than percent of U.S. export growth is projected to come from Mexico China and other emerging and developing countries. Growth in These findings are consistent with standard results on aggregate relationships across countries which suggest that growth of real exports increases roughly percent for every percent of world real GDP growth ; see Chinn ( ) and IMF ( ) In addition one would expect U.S. export prices to rise in fast-growing markets so the result that nominal growth of U.S. goods exports rose at a faster pace than the anticipated real growth is also to be expected | Chapter these countries and active engagement in trade with them will be essential to meeting the Administration s goal of doubling U.S. exports in five years Trade Policy Recent economic research has focused on U.S. firm productivity and the fixed cost of exporting as fundamental determinants of which U.S businesses are able to enter new markets and export successfully ( Bernard et al. ) Some costs to firms of market entry are well known for example learning about customer-specific attributes and tailoring products accordingly establishing new distribution networks to reach a market and targeting advertising to attract those new customers. Nevertheless U.S. businesses that seek to enter a new foreign market sometimes have to overcome additional costs such as foreign import tariffs. Another such cost is nontariff barriers including foreign requirements that the exporting firm undertake a costly modification of its export product to fit local standards even in the absence of any recognized technical safety or customer benefit for doing so Appropriately tailored government policy can reduce some of the costs that firms must incur to export to new foreign markets. In particular the President s National Export Initiative includes several policy instruments aimed at reducing these costs. These instruments include negotiating the reduction of foreign tariffs and removal of nontariff barriers to trade enforcing existing market access agreements and increasing advocacy and access to credit for U.S. exporters Negotiating to Open New Markets Any import tariff in a foreign market is an additional cost to market entry that U.S. firms must factor into their export decisions. Despite the trade liberalization of the past few decades U.S. exporters still encounter substantial unevenness in the tariff treatment they receive For example U.S. exporters enjoy low tariffs and open markets in U.S NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada. Equally important are the relatively open markets of several high-income economies with which the United States has partnered for more than years under the WTO and the GATT before it. As Table shows the European Union and Japan offer U.S exporters most-favored-nation ( MFN ) tariff rates that are on average only moderately higher than the average rate the United States applies toward their exports. The applied import tariffs of these high-income economies are also quite close to their bound rates that is the upward limits that their applied tariffs can not legally exceed without compensation to their trading partners. The third column of the table provides an alternative The World Economy | and more sophisticated measure of import restrictiveness the overall trade restrictiveness index ( OTRI ) that takes into account not only import tariffs but also some nontariff measures and the potential responsiveness of imports and exports ( elasticities ) to changes in trade barriers ( Kee Nicita and Olarreaga ) ; it does not take into account trade distortions caused by undervalued exchange rates. The United States is also quite open based on this index but Japan s OTRI is nearly twice as large indicating that its nontariff measures are an important constraint to the ability of trading partners to export to its market Table Import Tariffs Nontariff Measures and Trade Restrictiveness Conditions facing exporters Import regime Applied MFN Tariff ( simple average % ) Bound MFN Tariff ( simple average % ) Overall Trade Restrictiveness Index ( OTRI ) Foreign Trade Restrictiveness Index ( MA-OTRI ) Korea Colombia Panama China Brazil India Russia Economy United States European Union Japan Notes : Russia s tariffs are not bound because it is not a WTO member. Dashes indicate data are not available. The most recently available year s data are reported where OTRI and MA-OTRI for are not available Sources : Tariff data from WTO ( ) ; OTRI and MA-OTRI from World Bank World Trade Indicators There are substantial differences between the openness of these particular high-income economies and other important U.S. trading partners however. First consider Korea a country with which the United States recently concluded negotiations on a trade agreement as well as Colombia and Panama countries with which the United States is seeking free trade agreements. Relatively high tariffs in these countries ( see Table ) are likely to remain in place until trade agreements negotiated with them are ratified and implemented. Completion of these agreements has the potential to lower and secure these import tariffs for U.S. exporters at rates much closer to zero and also to remove many other burdensome nontariff measures ( Box ) However these gains will be realized only if the agreements address these burdensome measures in a sustainable way which is | Chapter why the Administration is committed to supporting only agreements that secure serious concessions and that overall are in the interest of U.S. workers and the U.S. economy Box : The Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement In December the Administration announced the successful resolution of the outstanding issues with the Korea-United States free trade agreement ( KORUS ) The agreement is the most economically significant free trade pact that the United States has negotiated and signed in nearly years. A study by the U.S. International Trade Commission estimated that the agreement could boost U.S. annual goods exports to Korea including agriculture products and autos by as much as $ billion. The agreement also includes Korean commitments expected to result in considerable expansion of U.S. services exports Table highlights why agreements like KORUS are especially critical for the competitiveness of U.S. exporters. In its absence U.S exporting firms face an average Korean import tariff of percent ; under the agreement this rate will eventually reach zero and will help U.S. exports compete in Korea against Korean firms. Without KORUS U.S. exporters would also be at a competitive disadvantage with other foreign competitors that also export to Korea. The European Union has signed a similar trade agreement with Korea scheduled to be implemented in July that would give its exports a leg up. Indeed in little more than years the United States has already fallen from being the number one exporter to Korea to being the fourth-largest supplier trailing China Japan and the European Union. Implementation of KORUS and the lowering of Korea s tariffs toward U.S. exporters are expected to help stem further erosion The KORUS may also result in changes to the composition and source of U.S. imports. Korea s exporters already face a relatively low average U.S. tariff of percent even without the agreement. KORUS would eventually lower that rate to the level enjoyed by the United States other free trade partners including Canada and Mexico Second the major emerging economies also tend to have more restrictive import regimes than the high-income economies. Economic growth in China India and Brazil has surged in part because these nations lowered their import tariffs significantly from their levels of years ago. U.S. firms have responded to those reductions by increasing exports to these new The World Economy | markets over the past years providing these economies with key goods and services that contribute to their growth. Nevertheless Table indicates that the import tariffs that remain in these economies are still relatively high Just as U.S. trade shows a reorientation toward emerging economies U.S. trade liberalization negotiations have turned toward these same emerging economies especially through forums such as the WTO s Doha Round of multilateral negotiations. Dubbed the Doha Development Agenda the negotiations are focused in part on the power of trade liberalization to enhance the development prospects of low-income countries The Administration is pushing for an ambitious set of trade liberalization commitments under the Doha Round not only to enhance opportunities for U.S. exporters of manufactured goods services and agricultural products but also to increase opportunities for development-enhancing trade among developing countries. Emerging economies such as China India and Brazil will have a particular responsibility to further reduce and bind their import tariffs to produce such an outcome The need for partners to commit to additional trade liberalization is confirmed by evidence from the last column of Table which reports a separate World Bank index ( the market access-overall trade restrictiveness index or MA-OTRI ) of the average trade restrictiveness facing a country s exporters from all of its foreign markets combined. The index is based on tariff levels and some nontariff measures that trading partners impose ( again not including an undervalued exchange rate ) and the importance of those measures is weighted by the composition of the exporting country s exports in addition to the exporter s and its trading partners responsiveness ( elasticities ) to trade. Lower numbers reflect fewer trade barriers confronting the country s exporters. By this measure the average U.S. exporter faces trade restrictions surpassed only by those facing exporters from Panama and Brazil. One reason for this high index number for the United States ( and a main driver of it for Brazil and Panama ) is that it is a major agricultural exporter and agricultural trade barriers around the world remain high : they need to be negotiated and reduced. Nevertheless U.S. exporters face trade barriers that are higher than they are for Japan the European Union and other important competitors in global export markets. The Administration is therefore committed to negotiating better terms for U.S. exporters to help level the playing field. In addition to completion of free trade agreements with Korea as well as Colombia and Panama and a successful conclusion of the Doha Round the Administration is placing increased emphasis on persuading Asian economies to reduce trade barriers and open themselves to U.S. exporters through the Trans-Pacific Partnership | Chapter Encouraging Exports by Enforcing Existing Agreements The Administration works to increase U.S. exports through regular engagement in bilateral and regional trade policy forums in a way that encourages trading partners to live up to their international commitments and obligations. These trade dialogues facilitate policy reforms yield additional foreign market access and level the playing field for American workers and companies. For example in December the Administration worked with China through the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade to improve China s intellectual property rights protection better ensure nondiscriminatory treatment of foreign suppliers and products and provide fair treatment for new technologies. Similar successes are occurring through other dialogues notably in other emerging economies throughout Asia Africa and Latin America Nevertheless enforcement of existing trade agreements sometimes means that the U.S. Government resorts to dispute settlement provisions to resolve trade frictions whether under a free trade agreement or more commonly under the WTO s multilateral auspices. The total number of disputes the United States has filed at the WTO has declined over time dropping from initiated between and to only initiated between and As trading partners increasingly commit to open their markets to U.S. exporters enforcement becomes increasingly important to ensure that trading partners live up to their agreements. Enforcement is a fundamental role for the Federal Government ; under WTO rules exporting firms themselves can not challenge another country s trade actions. As such U.S. Trade Representative Ronald Kirk has frequently stated the Administration s commitment to step up enforcement on behalf of U.S. exporting interests.7 A growing share of the complaints the United States has filed with the WTO is now being filed against emerging economies. As Figure shows nearly two-thirds of all disputes the United States brought between and were against emerging economies up from roughly one-third between and This increase is not surprising given the importance the United States places on maintaining current and future trade with these emerging economies. During the crisis for example the number of import restrictions imposed on U.S. exporters by emerging markets increased substantially relative to those imposed by high-income trading partners ( Bown ) Historically many U.S. disputes allege that some element of a newly imposed import restriction that is obstructing U.S exports is inconsistent with WTO rules See for example his speech at Georgetown University on April The World Economy | Figure U.S. Trade Disputes at the WTO Percent U.S. complaints against emerging markets Emerging-market complaints against the U.S Notes : Percentages are for the number of disputes initiated during the period. Disputes are broken down into bilateral ( respondent/complainant ) pairs Sources : WTO ( ) ; CEA calculations At the same time as Figure indicates the share of disputes filed against the United States by foreign exporters in emerging economies attempting to protect their access to the U.S. import market has also grown Because an increasing share of U.S. imports derives from emerging markets these economies are now the most frequent challengers to U.S. trade policy Two additional points regarding the U.S. Government role in WTO disputes are worth highlighting. First use of the WTO dispute resolution mechanism represents attempts to resolve differences between trading partners through rulings based on the application of agreed international trade rules. During when more U.S. exports were destined for high-income economies most U.S. disputes filed at the WTO were lodged against these economies even though they were and continue to be strategic allies. The process was designed to prevent trade issues from escalating in a manner that would increase barriers to international trade Second despite the growing importance of enforcement to keep foreign markets open to U.S. export interests the U.S. Government s enforcement role has become ever more complex. The production process of many goods is increasingly fragmented into supply chains that cross international borders. As a result domestic stakeholders often have varied interests with respect to the issues that may arise in a particular dispute | Chapter When the U.S. exporter facing a new foreign trade barrier is also a multinational firm with significant affiliate activity in that foreign market that firm may be hesitant to publicly support U.S. Government actions to have the trade impediment removed. The company could face many forms of reprisal from the foreign government in ways that the U.S. Government is legally unable to help fight and that may cost the company more than it loses under the trade restriction. The complexities facing U.S. enforcement of the rights of U.S. exporters and the interests of the U.S. workforce are likely to continue to escalate as technology improves transport costs continue to fall and production processes continue to be integrated among operations in various nations Advocacy to Encourage Exporters Credit and Trade Facilitation Part of the fixed cost of exporting can be learning about a market or making the necessary investments in building relationships. In many cases the Federal Government may already have that information and can thus lower the cost of exporting by sharing it. As such several WTO-consistent policies may help boost the visibility of U.S. exports especially those produced by small- and medium-size firms and lower the hurdle that each firm faces in entering new markets One approach contained in the President s National Export Initiative is for the U.S. Government to improve advocacy abroad. For example trade fairs can showcase export-ready enterprises that may be too small or too young to be a part of the larger industry associations that often organize promotions. Advocacy could also involve better support from consular offices abroad such as providing exporters with contacts and buyer-seller information The government can facilitate trade by offering trade credit to match the terms available to firms in other countries. Investments in the U.S transportation and supply chain infrastructure are critical to enabling U.S exporters to move their goods to ports quickly and inexpensively. The Administration is also committed to negotiating agreements on trade facilitation abroad so that U.S. exports can be shipped to foreign customers more efficiently. At an even more basic level the Government through the Small Business Administration the Export-Import Bank or the International Trade Administration can work with U.S. firms ( especially small businesses ) to help them navigate the process of exporting In the end the decision whether to export to a given country is a private market decision made every day by thousands of U.S. firms Nevertheless the National Export Initiative sets out an ambitious agenda by which the Federal Government can play a more constructive role for U.S businesses and their workforce The World Economy | Conclusion As the United States orients its economy toward more exports and more investment growth in exports will be determined by U.S. interactions with a complex and changing world economy. Trade relationships of today look little like those of years ago when different countries led the world economy and played leading roles in U.S. trade. Recognizing those changes and engaging constructively with the world as it is today can be a significant source of growth for the U.S. economy for decades to come | Chapter C H A P T E R HEALTH CARE REFORM O n March President Obama signed into law landmark legislation that extends health insurance coverage to millions of uninsured Americans ensures the security and affordability of coverage for many more and reduces the Nation s budget deficit. The Affordable Care Act is the latest chapter in nearly a century-long history of efforts to ensure comprehensive health insurance coverage for more Americans.1 At the same time the new law marks an important new chapter in the quest for high value in health spending. For decades the policy problem posed by millions of uninsured Americans has overshadowed the underlying economic challenge of how to control health care costs while preserving the high quality of the American medical care system. In addition to extending coverage to the uninsured and reforming insurance markets to ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to affordable coverage the Affordable Care Act introduces a framework for moving the medical care system toward higher-value care Broadly the Affordable Care Act controls costs and improves quality by strengthening physician and hospital incentives to improve the quality of care and provide care more efficiently. These delivery system reforms are paired with coverage reforms that create new coverage options through competitive state marketplaces for insurance ensure access to affordable coverage through the provision of tax credits for small businesses and individuals and put in place individual and employer responsibility requirements. Over the next decade these reforms are expected to expand coverage to million Americans make health care more affordable and improve the quality of care We use the term Affordable Care Act to mean the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( P.L. enacted March ) and the provisions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of ( P.L. enacted March ) that are related to health care Many reforms that afford significant protection to consumers have already taken effect ( Box ) These reforms in conjunction with those that will go into effect in a few years time provide Americans with unprecedented security giving individuals and families freedom from worry about losing their insurance or having their coverage capped unexpectedly when they are sick. The Affordable Care Act also represents a significant tax cut for individuals and businesses purchasing health insurance ; already many small business owners who provided insurance to employees in are eligible for tax credits to offset the cost of this coverage helping them make new hires and strengthening our economy. Beginning in additional tax credits for individuals and households will help millions of middle-class Americans afford health insurance. As a result of the Affordable Care Act million young adults up to age now qualify for insurance under their parents health plans. The Affordable Care Act also provides new benefits to America s seniors improving the coverage of preventive care in Medicare and lowering the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare Part D by closing the donut hole. The Affordable Care Act is also fiscally responsible. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the law will reduce projected deficits by $ billion during and by more than $ trillion in the subsequent decade. The Affordable Care Act improves the financial status of the Medicare program by extending the solvency of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund by years. It provides unprecedented new authorities for fighting fraud thus potentially returning hundreds of millions of dollars to the Medicare trust funds This chapter offers an economic analysis of how the Affordable Care Act will achieve the long-run goals of expanding coverage and making health care affordable once its major provisions take effect in The discussion is not meant to be exhaustive and it necessarily excludes many parts of the law.2 The focus is on the major provisions to promote value in the delivery of medical care and to expand insurance coverage. The measures aimed at controlling costs focus on promoting the provision of high-value medical care and improving the quality of care provided. Measures that expand coverage rely primarily on private markets. In both areas controlling costs and expanding coverage the discussion highlights the imperfections in markets for medical care and health insurance that are addressed by the Affordable Care Act. The aim is to explain how these policies work with rather than against the underlying economic forces that drive consumers and firms Significant investments in health care workforce development and in community health centers are just a few important elements of the reform bill that this chapter does not discuss | Chapter Box : Early Provisions of the Affordable Care Act Although some of the Affordable Care Act s major provisions such as the Health Insurance Exchanges and health insurance premium tax credits for individuals and families do not go into effect until many provisions take effect much sooner expanding coverage and making care more affordable Effective within days of enactment  The Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan provides coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions who would otherwise be unable to obtain coverage  The Early Retiree Reinsurance Program helps employers with the cost of providing health insurance coverage for early retirees with unusually high medical spending  ebate checks for $ go to eligible beneficiaries to help close R the Medicare Part D coverage gap ( the donut hole ) The donut hole will be eliminated entirely by  Web portal www.HealthCare.gov enables consumers to A search for the best plan for their needs at the lowest cost  A Small Business Health Care Tax Credit offsets the costs of offering health insurance for small firms with low-wage workers ( applies to tax years beginning on or after January ) E  ffective for insurance plan years beginning six months after enactment  Consumer protections prohibit insurance industry practices such as rescinding coverage imposing lifetime caps on benefits imposing unreasonable annual dollar limits on essential health benefits and denying coverage for children based on preexisting conditions  rivate insurance plans covering dependent children must P provide coverage for adult children up to age on a parent s plan  New private insurance plans must provide percent coverage with no additional out-of-pocket costs for preventive care and medical screening such as smoking cessation programs and blood pressure screening in adults given an A or B rating by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Health Care Reform | Addressing the Rising Cost of Medical Care Trends in Aggregate Health Spending Health care spending has increased dramatically over the past halfcentury both in absolute terms and as a share of gross domestic product ( GDP ) ( Figure ) placing increasing pressure on household finances government budgets and businesses bottom line. Total spending in the U.S. health care sector was $ trillion in representing percent of GDP almost twice its share in Figure GDP and Health Spending Trillions of dollars Percent Health spending as a share of GDP ( right axis ) GDP ( left axis ) Health spending ( left axis ) Sources : Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services National Health Expenditure Accounts ; Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts These trends have given rise to concern that the Nation can not sustain such high spending growth and must bend the curve of health spending The challenge is to do so by transforming the Nation s health care system so that it rewards providers for delivering high-quality high-value care and discourages the provision of low-quality low-value care. Meeting that challenge is a much more complex task than simply slowing the growth of spending but the benefits of a system that delivers high-value care are much greater than the benefits of one that simply delivers low-cost care | Chapter Technological Change and Increases in Health Spending Most health economists agree that increases in health spending are driven largely by the breathtaking pace of technological innovation in health care. The question is whether the benefits of these new technologies are worth their high cost. Economists have thought about that question in two different ways and have generally concluded that these technological breakthroughs are absolutely worth the cost The first approach is to estimate directly the costs and benefits associated with increases in health spending. Recent economic analyses of this kind confirm that the advance of technology in medicine is indeed worth it in terms of health benefits provided ( Cutler and McClellan ; Cutler Rosen and Vijan ) Murphy and Topel ( ) estimate that discovering a cure for cancer for example would be worth about $ trillion ; a breakthrough that lowers cancer mortality permanently by even percent would be worth almost $ billion A second approach involves opportunity costs : what are we giving up to be able to spend so much on medical care ? In this context it is important to keep in mind that spending on health has risen during a period of overall economic growth. Health may be a superior good in the economic sense that as GDP rises more and more resources go to health because other material needs are largely satisfied. Hall and Jones ( ) use a personal analogy : [ A ] s we get older and richer which is more valuable : a third car yet another television more clothing or an extra year of life ? In fact GDP has grown so much over the past years that increases in health spending as large as they have been have generally not reduced spending on nonhealth items Rather than falling real per capita spending on all nonhealth items more than doubled between and ( Chernew Hirth and Cutler ) Market Imperfections and Increases in Health Care Spending Although increased spending on health delivers tremendous benefits on average some medical spending is almost certainly of low value Economists often attribute some of this low-value spending to a phenomenon known as moral hazard : at the point of service most insured consumers pay only a fraction of the cost of their care which gives them reason to opt for more and sometimes less effective care than they would choose if they were paying the full cost themselves. Unavoidably the protection that insurance affords households against the risk of catastrophically high medical spending carries with it the side effect of some unnecessary spending ( Pauly ) Health Care Reform | The market for medical care also suffers from multiple information problems that contribute to rising costs. The first is incomplete information : simply put there is considerable uncertainty for all patients and providers alike about the effectiveness of different medical treatments. And information in the medical care market is not only incomplete but also asymmetric Patients know much less than providers ( doctors and hospitals ) do about what treatment is appropriate for a particular condition. Third-party payers such as insurance companies and state or Federal Government programs are also at an informational disadvantage relative to providers. These information asymmetries give rise to a principal-agent problem in which the less-informed party or principal in this case either the patient or the third-party payer would like to hire the better-informed party or agent in this case the provider to provide treatment but can not be sure what to ask the provider to do or how much the provider should be paid. The result is that some health spending yields low value According to economic theory one way to mitigate the principalagent problem is to structure incentives so that it is in the interest of the agent to do what is best for the principal. Commissions for example give sales associates an incentive to work hard in situations where a supervisor might not be able to monitor their effort directly. In medical care the challenge is to design payment mechanisms that reward providers for delivering high-quality high-value care and discourage them from providing lowquality low-value care while continuing to ensure that patients have control over their care and are never denied the care they need expect and deserve As noted the task is much more complex than simply reducing spending but the potential benefits of having a system that delivers high-value care are tremendous How the Affordable Care Act Promotes High-Value Medical Care Designing reimbursement systems that reward high-value care discourage low-value care and put patients in control represents a key challenge for reform. In addition what may be high-value care for one individual may not be for another because the efficacy of treatments may vary with an individual s characteristics. Rather than imposing a single solution to promoting high-value care one that might get it wrong the Affordable Care Act approaches the task from three different directions to create the conditions under which the right answers will emerge. It invests in better information about what treatments work best while ensuring that all treatment options remain available to patients. It experiments with new approaches to delivering and paying for care. And it empowers patients to make informed decisions about their providers and their care | Chapter Better Information about What Works : The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. The Affordable Care Act supports research through a private not-for-profit Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute governed by a multistakeholder group and expert advisory panels whose task is to identify priorities for research. The Institute will continue the work of the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research created by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in February of The Institute s research findings can not be used to mandate coverage or reimbursement policy. The information the findings provide will enable patients providers employers and insurers to choose high-value care New Approaches to Delivering and Paying for Care. The Affordable Care Act includes a host of new programs and demonstration projects designed to identify effective ways to encourage the provision of high-value care. Two illustrative examples are bundled payments and a delivery system reform that reduces hospital-acquired conditions Bundled payments are one-time reimbursements to providers for the costs of treating a patient s condition across multiple settings. For example the hospital the cardiologist the primary care physician and any other caregiver for a patient undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery would receive one payment. Bundled payments create incentives for providers to coordinate care and keep to a minimum any treatments that are of little or no value. Providers who keep patients healthy and thus spend less make a profit and those who spend more lose money. The approach builds on the success of Medicare s inpatient prospective payment system introduced during the 1980s which has been adopted by many private insurance companies Hospital-acquired conditions ( HACs ) are generally avoidable health problems caused by medical treatment ; they are considered indicators of poor-quality care. Examples include surgical site infections and urinary tract infections associated with catheters. Since Medicare has not reimbursed most hospitals for costs associated with treating these conditions in hospitalized patients. The Affordable Care Act increases the incentive to prevent these conditions by reducing Medicare reimbursement for all conditions in hospitals that have high rates of HACs and by extending the nonpayment policy to the Federal share of the Medicaid program. These changes will reduce Federal health spending through Medicare and Medicaid and will provide a roadmap to reduced spending for private insurers and employers They also create a high-powered incentive for hospitals to prevent these conditions in the first place. The result lowering spending and improving patient outcomes is a classic win-win solution Health Care Reform | Bundled payments and nonpayment for HACs are just two examples of Affordable Care Act delivery system reforms that will result in higher value for patients ; other promising reforms include Accountable Care Organizations and a program that reduces Medicare payments to hospitals with relatively high rates of preventable readmissions. In this same area the Affordable Care Act also establishes the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation ( also known as the Innovation Center ) which will identify test disseminate and evaluate new models of delivering and paying for care. The Innovation Center will ensure that Medicare and Medicaid have the flexibility to test new incentive and delivery systems to keep pace with technological innovation in medical care. It will also seek to enlist the participation of private third-party payers to align provider incentives and accelerate the adoption of successful delivery system models Better Information on Provider Quality. One more way to drive the system to high-value care is to empower patients with better information on provider quality. The Affordable Care Act creates a quality-reporting program for physicians that will collect performance data on physicians who participate in Medicare and publish it on a Web site similar to the existing Hospital Compare and Nursing Home Compare Web sites. Research has shown that quality report cards influence consumer choice in health care and lead to higher-quality care ( Bundorf et al. ; Mukamel et al. ; Werner Stuart and Polsky ) Reimbursement mechanisms that explicitly reward quality will be reinforced by patients voting with their feet in response to information on the quality of their providers Improving the Health Insurance Market The ranks of the uninsured have grown steadily in the United States over the past decade as shown in Figure Almost million Americans percent of the population lacked health insurance coverage in ( DeNavas-Walt Proctor and Smith ) An increasing body of credible evidence has documented that being uninsured has negative consequences for health access to medical care and financial security ( Asplin et al. ; Card Dobkin and Maestas ; Cooke Dranove and Sfekas ; McWilliams et al. ) The failure of the United States unlike other industrialized nations to ensure access to basic care for all its citizens together with our Nation s continuing mediocre record on measures such as life expectancy and infant mortality compared with other industrialized nations has made the need for reform increasingly urgent | Chapter Figure Percent of Americans Uninsured Percent Source : DeNavas-Walt Proctor and Smith ( ) Problems in the Market for Health Insurance Complicating the policy problem posed by the many uninsured Americans are long-standing market failures in the individual and small group health insurance markets. The most important such market failure is adverse selection. In the context of health insurance adverse selection means that individuals or families with poorer health and thus high expected medical spending are more likely than their healthier counterparts to buy coverage at a given price. The selection of more high-cost people into coverage triggers a vicious cycle. To cover the health needs of this costly group the insurer raises the premium generating still more adverse selection into coverage. In the extreme case the market simply does not function In practical terms some people are uninsured because the only policies available to them do not seem to be a good deal ( although they might be a good deal for someone in worse health ) Many more people pay higher prices than they should in order to get coverage at all A second failure contributing to dysfunction in health insurance markets is the problem of missing markets ; in particular there is no market for multiyear health insurance contracts that would protect individuals throughout their lives from the risk of becoming sick and having to pay much higher insurance premiums or lose their coverage altogether. The missing market problem contributes to multiple inefficiencies. Individuals Health Care Reform | with high medical spending may be locked in to a policy for fear that their premiums will increase if they change their coverage particularly in the individual market. The decision not to seek new coverage may reduce competition in health insurance markets. Labor markets too suffer negative consequences when workers who want to change jobs especially entrepreneurs who want to start new businesses stay in their old jobs for fear of losing insurance Health insurance markets are also characterized by the high search costs they impose on consumers. Largely unaided consumers must gather and evaluate comparative information about the prices and quality of an array of complex health insurance plans. The high cost of conducting that search reduces competition and may result in prices that are higher than the competitive level. One effective way to reduce search costs is through information systems that assist consumers in comparison shopping. In the market for life insurance for example greater use of price comparison Web sites has led to substantial reductions in premiums and gains in consumer surplus ( Brown and Goolsbee ) For reasons that are not entirely clear but may be related to the multiple other market failures health insurance markets have been slow to adopt these innovations Health insurance markets are also highly concentrated ; in all but four states the three largest insurers control half of the market or more ( Robinson ) Such concentration raises the possibility that insurers may have market power to set prices above the competitive level and recent evidence suggests that increased concentration leads to higher premiums consistent with that possibility ( Dafny Duggan and Ramanarayanan ) A final market failure is the Samaritan s dilemma ; because hospitals and other health care providers offer charity care some people do not purchase insurance ( Coate ) Indeed multiple studies document that the availability of charity care reduces the rate of private insurance coverage suggesting that there is some free riding on the system ( Herring ; Rask and Rask ) How the Affordable Care Act Addresses the Insurance Market Failures Exchanges. The Affordable Care Act extends insurance coverage to the uninsured and makes insurance markets work more effectively for those who already have coverage. To achieve these goals it establishes Health Insurance Exchanges organized marketplaces in every state that enable individual consumers without access to affordable employer-sponsored coverage to shop easily for coverage and receive any tax credits or reduced cost-sharing for which they are eligible. The Affordable Care Act also establishes Small Business Health Options Program ( SHOP ) Exchanges similar | Chapter marketplaces in each state for small group coverage. Private insurance companies will offer plans for sale through the Exchanges beginning in Beginning in states can choose to expand their Exchanges to larger employers as well Minimum Benefits and Coverage Tiers. Every plan available in these marketplaces must include a specified set of minimum essential benefits and will be categorized as platinum gold silver or bronze depending on the extent of consumer cost-sharing. For platinum coverage the most comprehensive on average consumers will pay only percent of the cost of covered services as cost-sharing at the point of service. Consumers who choose this option can expect to pay a higher premium up front for the increased cost-sharing protections. The next three types of coverage gold silver and bronze feature progressively higher point-of-service cost-sharing corresponding to percent percent and percent of the total cost of covered services. Consumers can expect to pay lower premiums up front for these categories of coverage with bronze plans being the least expensive Online Choice Tools. Online tools will enable consumers to choose coverage based on the characteristics that are most important to them : premium costs cost-sharing or plan quality ratings for example. The HealthCare.gov Web portal which launched on July is one such tool. Beginning in Exchanges will leverage these technologies to allow consumers to make informed choices among multiple plans. The Affordable Care Act has already provided states $ million in funding to plan and develop their Health Insurance Exchanges including information technology systems that will enable consumers to search for plans that best suit their needs and preferences Tax Credits for Premiums. Beginning in individuals and families without access to adequate affordable coverage will receive tax credits for premiums purchased in the Exchange. These tax credits which are available to households with incomes between and percent of the federal poverty level limit the amount that an individual or family must pay for health insurance coverage as a share of household income.3 The income share ranges from percent for families at the low end of the eligibility threshold to percent for those at the upper end. Some families eligible for a premium tax credit also receive cost-sharing assistance that limits their out-of-pocket spending at the point of service The Federal poverty level in is $ for a family of four living in the contiguous states or the District of Columbia ; percent of the poverty level for such a family would be $ Health Care Reform | Coverage Responsibility. Creating Health Insurance Exchanges and developing online choice tools are significant steps toward making individual and small group health insurance markets more competitive transparent sensible and affordable. By themselves however these steps do not address the critical problem of adverse selection. Correcting that market failure requires changing the current practices of both insurers and consumers. To that end the Affordable Care Act provides a new protection for consumers called guaranteed issue which prohibits insurers from denying coverage to anyone who wants to buy it. The law also prohibits insurers from charging higher premiums for individuals in poor health. For their part consumers who can afford coverage are required to have coverage or pay a penalty except for specified exemptions such as individuals with religious objections Any remaining incentives that insurers may have to try to attract healthier consumers will be offset through risk adjustment that transfers payments from insurers with relatively healthy enrollees to those with sicker enrollees This framework largely solves the adverse selection problem Employers and the Affordable Care Act Most employers already offer health insurance ; percent of employers with to employees and percent of employers with or more employees do so ( Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research and Educational Trust ) The Affordable Care Act imposes financial penalties of approximately $ per full-time worker on the very few employers with or more workers who do not offer coverage if their workers obtain premium tax credits for the purchase of coverage in an Exchange. The first full-time employees are exempt for purposes of this calculation. Fewer than firms or percent of American businesses are likely to be affected by the penalty. Small employers ( those with fewer than workers ) face no such penalties. On the contrary the Affordable Care Act includes a tax credit to help businesses with fewer than full-time workers and average annual wages below $ afford health insurance for their workers as described in Chapter Together with the SHOP Exchanges described above which allow small employers to join a larger pool of buyers and purchase coverage that has the same fair prices and low administrative cost that large employers have historically enjoyed this tax credit will level the playing field for small and large employers in the area of health benefits Expanding Medicaid In addition to expanding private coverage through the Exchanges the Affordable Care Act expands public coverage. Specifically it extends Medicaid eligibility to all individuals in families with incomes at or below | Chapter percent of the Federal poverty level. Expanding Medicaid eligibility provides a critical coverage option for the most economically vulnerable citizens. The Affordable Care Act also allocates resources to states to offset their added costs for newly eligible individuals ( percent of the costs for the first three years phasing to percent permanently ) The Administration has also proposed additional resources that will help states design and implement streamlined enrollment systems to make obtaining health insurance a seamless process Conclusion In the end the Affordable Care Act will benefit both those who now have health coverage and those who are uninsured. The more than million uninsured Americans who will gain insurance coverage will reap the benefits of longer life and better health conferred by innovations in medical technology. The newly insured will also enjoy relief from the economic insecurity of lacking coverage ; no longer will American families have to worry about being one illness away from bankruptcy. Americans who are now insured will benefit from lower premiums because they will no longer pay a hidden tax associated with the costs of providing uncompensated care to the uninsured. They will enjoy greater security of coverage because the law prevents insurance companies from canceling their coverage unexpectedly if they are in an accident or become sick. The insured will also be free from the worry that they will exhaust the limits of their coverage because the new law prohibits annual and lifetime coverage limits. And the law ensures that they will have percent coverage for important preventive care services with no additional out-of-pocket costs Insurance market reforms and the new Exchanges will make it possible for all Americans who lack access to employer-based insurance to obtain coverage and thus feel greater economic security during periods of labor market transition or instability. The Affordable Care Act will smooth the transition from school to work for young adults who have historically been uninsured at very high rates. The law will also mitigate the consequences of job loss because losing a job will no longer entail losing all access to affordable insurance Moreover the Affordable Care Act levels the playing field for small employers who will be able to compete for workers by offering benefits that are comparable in price and generosity to those offered by large employers Potential entrepreneurs will be able to pursue their dreams without having to worry about where they will get health insurance at a fair price thus tapping new reserves of creativity for the American economy. And all Health Care Reform | employers large small and in-between will benefit from reduced uncertainty about health spending as a result of the larger and more stable private insurance pool that the Affordable Care Act will create. Reforming insurance markets will transform American business in subtle but far-reaching ways improving the bottom line for both workers and employers The benefits of delivery system reform will be even more widely shared. Improvements in health care quality such as reductions in hospitalacquired conditions should within just a few years yield measurable benefits that will touch the lives of most if not all Americans. The transition to a uniformly high-quality high-value system of medical care will take longer but by improving the quality and value of health care while freeing up resources that can be used for other productive purposes will lay the foundation for future economic growth | Chapter C H A P T E R TRANSITIONING TO A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE A merican prosperity depends on a continuous supply of safe and reliable energy. Energy heats cools and lights homes and businesses ; transports workers to jobs customers to stores and families to relatives ; and runs the factories that manufacture the goods Americans consume and export. It is increasingly clear however that existing energy supplies pose risks to national security the environment the climate and the economy To counter those risks while recognizing the continued importance of safe responsible oil and gas production to the economy the Administration is committed to moving the Nation toward use of cleaner sources of energy with the potential to support new industries exports and high-quality jobs ; to improve air quality and protect the climate ; and to enhance America s energy security and international competitiveness A future with cleaner energy sources promises numerous benefits Innovation in cleaner energy will reduce U.S. dependence on oil over half of which is imported decreasing the vulnerability of the U.S. economy to supply disruptions and price spikes ( Box ) Cleaner energy will improve the quality of the air American families breathe because energy use accounts for the vast majority of air pollution such as nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Cleaner energy is essential for the United States to make progress toward its pledge as part of the United Nations Climate Change Conferences in Copenhagen and Cancun to cut carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) and other human-induced greenhouse gases by roughly percent below levels by and to meet its long-term goal of reducing emissions by more than percent by Finally supported by well-designed policies clean energy can make an important contribution to America s ability to compete internationally using innovative new technologies while also having ancillary economic benefits like lower risks from accidents at coal mines and oil wells Box : Energy Security Benefits of Reduced Oil Consumption Combustion of all fossil fuels generates pollution to varying degrees. But because more than half of the petroleum consumed in the United States is imported it creates an additional set of costs for the American economy First although percent of U.S. imports come from Canada America s biggest supplier many of the most accessible reserves are concentrated in unstable regions leading to fears of supply-related world price fluctuations. The risk may have declined over time because the U.S. economy has become less energy intensive and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is now filled to capacity with million barrels of crude oil more than two months of net imports. Nevertheless petroleum still plays a key role in the United States accounting for percent of energy use and over percent of personal consumption expenditures The second cost relates to the missed opportunity for the United States to lower world oil prices by decreasing its own demand for oil Because the United States is the world s largest consumer of crude oil decreased U.S. demand results in lower world prices. Lower prices benefit petroleum purchasers and harm petroleum producers with no overall global benefit. Because the United States is a net importer the offsetting effects would on balance favor U.S. interests The third component of the energy security cost of oil involves policy expenses borne by U.S. taxpayers. Among such expenses are military costs associated with protecting oil supply routes and maintenance costs of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve The Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimated that the fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and light trucks issued in May have energy security benefits of $ a barrel of oil in saved macroeconomic disruption costs in ( in dollars ) or about $ a gallon of gasoline. This estimate depends on predictions about future oil prices supply disruptions OPEC behavior and the elasticities of global oil supply and demand. The estimate does not include the demand-side market power benefit which represents a transfer from exporters to importers. Nor does it include the U.S. policy expenses because it is difficult to know how much of them to allocate to an incremental change in oil consumption. By comparison one U.S. government estimate of the global social cost of the CO2 emissions associated with one barrel of oil is $ in going up to $ in ( Box ) | Chapter These same security environmental and economic risks confront all the countries of the world to varying degrees. And many like the United States have embarked on efforts to transition to cleaner sources of energy As a consequence the clean energy sector is likely to be a vibrant source of innovation growth and international trade worldwide. Innovation is an engine of the American economy and a key to long-term job creation and economic growth. Those nations that invest first and whose transition efforts are most successful are likely to lead the world in exporting equipment and expertise as the rest of the world s countries seek the same secure clean affordable energy. The number of clean energy patents worldwide grew about percent per year from through and the United States was home to percent of the clean energy patents issued between and behind Japan with percent ( UNEP EPO and ICTSD ) The Obama Administration s commitment to clean energy represents an effort to ensure that the United States does not slip behind but instead leads the world in this critical sector The benefits of transitioning to clean energy energy security cleaner air fewer risks from climate change and enhanced economic competitiveness are enjoyed by everybody not just the producers or consumers of the clean energy. As a consequence the benefits are not fully represented in market prices. Examples of these benefit spillovers abound. Clean energy innovators reap only part of the overall rewards for their efforts the rest spill over to others who build on their work. The payments that solar and wind power generators receive for the electricity they supply do not reflect the benefits that spill over to the rest of the economy. Energy users reap only part of the benefits from weatherizing their homes and driving electric vehicles. These spillover benefits are substantial. A peer-reviewed report prepared by the EPA estimates that for the year alone the Clean Air Act Amendments of yielded net benefits of $ trillion everything from lives saved to healthier kids to a more productive workforce ( EPA ) These spillovers mean that market rewards for switching to clean energy production are lower than the societywide benefits market costs of switching to clean energy consumption are higher than the societywide costs and markets alone provide less clean energy than is optimal Because there are many types of clean energy benefit spillovers the path to a clean energy future includes many possible policies. Existing fossil fuel consumption can be made cleaner by increasing the efficiency of combustion by capturing and sequestering CO2 emissions or by switching within the fossil fuel sector to lower-emitting natural gas. Cleaner fossil fuel technologies and nonfossil sources of energy such as wind solar geothermal natural gas and nuclear power can supply a larger share of Transitioning to a Clean Energy Future | the Nation s energy consumption with the help of a Federal Clean Energy Standard. Energy use by homes and vehicles can become more efficient And more energy-efficient technologies some of which may have yet to be discovered can be supported as they are developed and brought to market Transitioning to a clean energy future and progressing toward America s carbon pollution reduction goals will be best accomplished by pursuing costeffective well-coordinated public policies This chapter highlights some of the important steps the Administration has already taken or is proposing to take to ensure that the economy makes the important transition to clean energy. The list of policies discussed here is not exhaustive but rather serves to demonstrate the economic rationale that motivates ongoing work on these programs. The policies include assisting with residential and commercial energy efficiency ; increasing vehicle efficiency ; increasing the share of electricity generated by clean sources ; recording reporting and accounting for the cost of greenhouse gas emissions ; funding transportation infrastructure including expanded transit and high-speed rail ; assisting with manufacturing and adoption of electric vehicles ; and providing incentives for clean energy research and development ( R&D ) Initial Steps Toward a Clean Energy Economy The Administration s first task in January was to end the deepest recession since the 1930s and while doing so it made major initial investments to help turn the economy in a new cleaner direction. Many of those initiatives were integral to the recovery effort ; others were distinct but concurrent Energy Investments in the Recovery Act The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( Recovery Act ) directed about $ billion in Federal expenditures and tax relief to investments and job creation with a primary objective of reversing the collapsing economic conditions of early As part of that effort the law contained over $ billion in public investment and tax incentives targeted at increasing sources of clean energy and reducing America s dependence on fossil fuels ( Box ) These clean energy investments directly targeted the beneficial spillovers that provide an economic rationale for promoting clean energy. One example is the Recovery Act funds directed to the Weatherization Assistance Program. The funds helped retrofit more than low-income homes by the end of November. A recent study by the Oak Ridge National | Chapter Laboratory estimated that the annual average savings for homes weatherized by the program include $ in heating and cooling costs and tons of reduced CO2 emissions ( Eisenberg ) Another example of Recovery Act spending targeted at home energy efficiency is the Smart Grid funds that electric companies are using to test various types of electricity metering enabling customers to monitor and adjust their electricity use to save power and money. Still other Recovery Act investments in transit electric vehicles and high-speed rail create construction jobs and will provide energy savings and other benefits to Americans for generations Box : Clean Energy Investments in the Recovery Act The more than $ billion in Recovery Act expenditures aimed at reducing American fossil fuel use fell into eight categories :  billion for energy efficiency including retrofits for low $ income homes  billion for renewable generation such as wind turbines $ and solar panels $ billion for transportation and high-speed rail  billion for Smart Grid technologies to improve the $ efficiency of electricity use and distribution  billion for domestic production of advanced batteries $ vehicles and fuels $ billion for green innovation and job training $ billion for carbon capture and sequestration $ billion in clean energy equipment manufacturing tax credits As an example of the programs that make up these categories the top category energy efficiency includes the following : $ billion for the Weatherization Assistance Program $ billion for the State Energy Program  billion for Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants $ $ million for retrofit ramp-ups in energy efficiency $ million for energy-efficient building technologies $ million for energy-efficient appliance rebates / Energy Star $ million for the Industrial Technologies Program $ million for national laboratory facilities $ million for small business clean energy innovation projects Another part of the Recovery Act addressed the positive spillovers that R&D generates for others by subsidizing a wide variety of investments in clean energy R&D. These investments included several billion dollars for Transitioning to a Clean Energy Future | R&D directly related to clean energy. Roughly $ billion has been awarded for research development and deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies. Another portion has funded R&D on potentially transformative next-generation clean energy and efficiency-enhancing technologies including advanced materials and building systems vehicle efficiency solar power biofuels and wind turbines. Recovery Act funds have also been awarded to finance clean energy research at universities as part of a larger $ billion effort managed by the Department of Energy to support basic scientific research Funding for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy ( ARPA-E ) within the Department of Energy represents an especially innovative R&D component of the Recovery Act. ARPA-E is modeled after the 50-year-old Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) which is credited with the initial innovations underlying the Internet navigation satellites and stealth technology for aircraft. ARPA-E aims to attract America s best scientists to focus on creative transformational energy research that the private sector by itself can not support but that could provide dramatic benefits for the nation ( Box ) Full details of the Recovery Act and its economic effects including the law s clean energy components can be found in the CEA s quarterly reports to Congress Further Steps Toward a Cleaner Economy In addition to the clean energy investments in the Recovery Act the Administration has taken several other steps to lay the groundwork for cleaner energy. Among the most significant of these are new vehicle standards ; increased electricity generation from renewable sources ; and programs to record report and account for the cost of greenhouse gas emissions Vehicle Standards. In May the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued standards that will raise the combined car and light truck fuel economy from miles per gallon in to miles per gallon in and that are projected to reduce combined car and light truck tailpipe CO2 emissions from grams a mile in to grams a mile in As a result of these rules vehicles to be sold during model years to are projected to use billion fewer barrels of oil over their lifetimes and by the entire light-duty vehicle fleet will emit percent less carbon pollution The reduced fuel costs will save consumers $ billion per year by in dollars after taking into account the increase in the purchase price of vehicles | Chapter Box : The Recovery Act and ARPA-E : Spurring Innovation to Transform the Energy Economy The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy ( ARPA-E ) was developed to support innovations with the potential to create new clean energy jobs businesses and industries. It attracted thousands of proposals and has funded over projects that have the potential to radically transform the energy sector One small startup company is developing a new way to manufacture the key part in solar panels silicon wafers for less than percent of current costs. If successful the technology could be used to increase domestic clean energy production and add many new jobs in the solar photovoltaic industry. A second startup is developing an inexpensive and versatile means of storing energy using a new type of catalyst to separate pure hydrogen and oxygen from ordinary water. That technology could allow renewable energy to be used even at times or places where wind or sun is not available. Another company has partnered with Argonne National Laboratory to create lithium-ion batteries with the highest energy density in the world. The technology has the prospect of increasing U.S. leadership in advanced batteries and boosting the performance of hybrid/electric vehicles. Yet another small company is developing a new type of wind turbine that generates more energy than existing models and is cheaper to produce and operate. The turbine is compact enough to use in urban locations and could hasten the growth of wind power in the United States ARPA-E funds have enabled companies to pursue their innovative research to attract additional financing from private investors and to increase the odds of a dramatic breakthrough that would accelerate the development of American clean energy Doubling Renewable Electricity Generation. Early in his Administration the President announced a goal of doubling the amount of electricity generated in the United States by wind solar and geothermal energy. Toward this goal tax credits have assisted both the production of electricity from renewable sources and the manufacture of equipment ( such as solar panels and wind turbines ) used in that generation. As Figure shows the United States is on track to achieve that goal adding more wind solar and geothermal capacity in years than in the previous Yet as the figure also shows those particular sources of energy still account for only a small fraction of the Nation s overall electricity generating capacity. To build Transitioning to a Clean Energy Future | on the progress made to date the President has proposed a Federal Clean Energy Standard to obtain percent of electricity from these and other clean sources of electricity by expanding the range of sources from which clean energy is generated. The standard will double the share of electricity generated by this broader group of clean sources in years and will provide utilities with incentives to generate clean energy along with the associated spillover benefits at the lowest possible cost ( see Next Steps below ) Figure U.S. Wind Solar and Geothermal Energy Generating Capacity Gigawatts ( GW ) Geothermal Solar GW ( % ) Wind GW ( % ) GW ( % ) GW ( % ) GW ( % ) Notes : Net summer generating capacity of wind solar and geothermal energy.

In addition to these concrete tangible steps that increase the efficiency of vehicles and the share of renewable sources used for electricity generation the Administration has taken two significant steps that involve collecting and analyzing information These two disclosure and information-gathering endeavors will inform and guide future Federal climate and energy policy The first of these was an interagency study to estimate the social cost of carbon ( SCC ) a set of values for the climate-related damages from incremental changes in carbon pollution. These estimates enable Federal agencies to consistently quantify the benefits of reduced CO2 emissions when analyzing the costs and benefits of their regulatory actions similar to the way all Federal agencies use consistent discount rates for trading off current and future costs and benefits. Based on the SCC described in Box | Chapter the CO2 reductions in resulting from the new car and light truck standards described above are expected to save an estimated $ billion to $ billion in dollars in the form of reduced damages from climate change. The ability to quantify benefits consistently across agencies in this manner is critical for assessing the cost-effectiveness of rules and regulations Box : The Social Cost of Carbon : A Tool for Cost-Effective Policy In an interagency task force that included the Council of Economic Advisers produced an important white paper called Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis ( Interagency Working Group ) The goal was to measure the present value of benefits from reducing CO2 emissions by an extra ton. The report suggests four values for this social cost of carbon ( SCC ) : $ $ $ and $ a ton in dollars. The first three average SCC estimates across various models and scenarios and differ based on the rate at which future costs and benefits are discounted ( and percent respectively ) The fourth value $ comes from evaluating the worst percent of modeled outcomes discounted at percent. All four values rise over time as more carbon in the atmosphere exacerbates the damages from each additional ton. For example the central value of $ rises to $ in These estimates provide guidance for assessing the costs and benefits of agencies rulemakings that reduce incremental carbon pollution Why is it important for agencies to agree on a common range for the SCC ? A key advantage of market-based regulations such as pollution fees or tradable permit schemes is that they are cost-effective. By putting a common price on emissions these types of polices give each source of pollution equal private incentives to avoid paying that price by abating The incremental cost of abating pollution will thus be equal across sources meaning that it will not be possible to reduce collective compliance costs by abating less from some sources and more from others While most regulations do not involve a price on carbon and the SCC is not itself a price setting a common SCC range allows policymakers to explicitly compare the benefits and costs of emissions reductions across a wide range of regulations and to mimic the costeffectiveness of a true market-based policy. The Administration will periodically reassess whether the four SCC values are appropriate for evaluating U.S. policies ; meanwhile the SCC helps guide Federal agencies in the direction of consistent and cost-effective policymaking Transitioning to a Clean Energy Future | The second information-gathering step the Administration has taken has been to require major sources of carbon pollution to publicly report their annual emissions. The Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule published in October covers percent of U.S. emissions from roughly facilities. Data collection began in January for stationary sources including electricity generators large industrial facilities and suppliers of fossil fuels. For cars and light trucks engine manufacturers are required to report emissions beginning with model year This important step will be instrumental in helping identify cost-effective opportunities to reduce carbon pollution as well as ways to target regulations efficiently Next Steps Toward a Clean Energy Economy In his State of the Union address and in his Budget the President outlined a series of proposals that build on current efforts to transition to an economy based on cleaner sources of energy. Among these are a Federal Clean Energy Standard for electricity ; further investments in energy efficiency ; a substantial commitment to transportation infrastructure including a major investment in high-speed rail and steps to achieve the Administration s goal of million electric and hybrid vehicles on the streets by ; and increased investments in clean energy R&D A Federal Clean Energy Standard The President has proposed a goal of generating percent of the Nation s electricity from clean energy sources defined broadly to include renewables and nuclear power as well as partial credit for fossil fuels with carbon capture and sequestration and efficient natural gas. To meet this goal the Administration is proposing a Clean Energy Standard ( CES ) that would require electric utilities to obtain an increasing share of delivered electricity from clean sources starting at the current level of percent and doubling over the next years. Electricity generators would receive credits for each megawatt-hour of clean energy generated ; utilities with more credits than needed to meet the standard could sell the credits to other utilities or bank them for future use. By ensuring flexibility through a broad definition of clean energy and by allowing trading among utilities the program is designed to meet the overall target cost-effectively The Administration s proposal emphasizes the importance of protecting consumers and accounting for regional differences | Chapter The proposed Federal CES will provide a critical complement to the Administration s investment in clean energy R&D by creating a stable market for new technologies. Funding for R&D provides a push to technological innovation by helping to promote basic and applied research and addressing the market spillovers associated with private research efforts A CES would create economic incentives for deployment of clean energy that can help pull new technologies coming out of R&D into the market Importantly a CES would not pick particular clean technologies but instead let markets and businesses determine the most cost-effective technologies to achieve the target share of clean energy The Administration s proposed CES will build on the national progress depicted in Figure as well as on a range of existing efforts at the state level. By the end of states plus the District of Columbia had enacted renewable energy standards ( RES ) which specify the minimum amount of electricity that utilities are required to generate or purchase from renewable sources typically solar wind geothermal and biomass ( Figure ) Five additional states have also recognized specific renewable energy goals. The laws range from modest departures from the overall business-as-usual forecast to requirements that percent of power come from renewable sources in California by and percent in Hawaii by Together the states that have binding RES policies currently account for nearly two-thirds of all national retail electricity sales Most RES laws incorporate market-based regulatory flexibility by allowing some utilities to meet the minimum renewable shares by purchasing renewable energy credits ( RECs ) from other utilities that exceed the standard. Because utilities can sometimes purchase energy and RECs across state borders the patchwork of state standards depicted in Figure can achieve some but not all of the cost-effectiveness benefits of a national standard Although states have led the way making significant advances in the use of renewable energy sources a coordinated Federal action could achieve even greater benefits with lower costs. A Federal standard with nationally tradable credits would ensure that renewable power and other clean energy sources are deployed in those locations where they can be most cost-effective. By covering the whole country and including a wider array of sources a Federal CES has the potential to accelerate the transition to clean energy at significantly lower cost Transitioning to a Clean Energy Future | Figure State Renewable Energy Standards in None Goal Less than % % % % % Other Standard Notes : Percentages are renewable energy standards that are binding on utilities. In some states the standards are binding only on investor-owned and/or large utilities Sources : North Carolina Solar Center Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy ; various state sources Energy Efficiency One certain approach to reducing energy-related pollution and America s reliance on fossil fuels would be to consume less energy Americans have many opportunities to make energy efficiency-enhancing investments in their homes their vehicles and their businesses. Examples include weatherizing buildings replacing old appliances with new energyefficient models and switching to compact fluorescent light bulbs. For a variety of reasons however people tend to under-invest in these types of simple energy-saving measures where up-front costs would be paid back in the form of reduced energy bills There are numerous explanations for this energy paradox. People may simply not have the information necessary to evaluate the tradeoffs between current costs and future savings. Some energy efficiency decisions are made by landlords who have diminished incentives to invest in energy efficiency because their tenants pay the electricity bills. In other cases people may plan to sell their homes before they would have enough time to reap the | Chapter energy savings and might not expect those energy-saving investments to be reflected in resale prices. And some individuals simply do not have access to the funds to invest in energy efficiency even if they know they would earn that investment back many times over. Existing Federal programs designed to address this energy paradox include the Energy Star program which labels appliances consumer electronics and building products providing the information consumers need to make cost-effective choices and the Weatherization Assistance Program which helps cash-strapped low-income families conserve energy and reduce their energy bills To build on existing efforts to address the energy paradox and the beneficial spillovers from energy efficiency and to help boost job creation in the construction and manufacturing industries the Obama Administration has proposed two new programs to help retrofit buildings : Homestar for residences and the Better Buildings Initiative for commercial properties Homestar. The Homestar Energy Efficiency Retrofit Program would provide point-of-sale rebates to homeowners who make efficiencyenhancing improvements to their homes. Rebates of $ to $ would be paid for percent of the costs of straightforward retrofits including insulation water heaters windows and doors and air conditioners. Other rebates of $ would help pay for home energy audits and follow-up retrofits that reduce energy costs by percent. Included in the proposal is an oversight program to ensure that contractors are qualified and that efficiency-improving work is done properly. The program aims to create tens of thousands of jobs and save homeowners hundreds of dollars a year in energy costs Better Buildings. For the commercial real estate that is currently responsible for roughly percent of U.S. energy consumption the President has proposed a Better Buildings Initiative. The initiative encourages retrofits of commercial buildings so that they become percent more energy efficient over the next years and save an estimated $ billion a year in energy costs. The program calls for replacing the current tax deduction for commercial building upgrades with a more generous tax credit ; promotes energy efficiency loans to small business hospitals and schools ; and provides competitive Race to Green grants to state and local governments for programs that encourage energy-efficient commercial upgrades Together Homestar and Better Buildings would complement the energy efficiency progress already made under the Recovery Act help homeowners and businesses save energy costs and help the Nation capitalize on the beneficial spillovers from energy efficiency investments Transitioning to a Clean Energy Future | Transportation Transportation accounts for more than one-fourth of energy consumption in the United States so the transition to a clean energy future must enable Americans to choose more energy-efficient vehicles such as electric and hybrid cars and to use less energy-intensive modes of transportation including public transit and high-speed trains Vehicles. The President has challenged the Nation to become the first country in the world to have million electric vehicles on its roads and to do so by To achieve that goal several obstacles must be overcome One obstacle is what the industry calls its chicken and egg problem : many drivers will not purchase fully electric vehicles unless an infrastructure of charging stations is ready to support them and businesses will not invest in charging stations without a sufficiently large base of electric vehicle owners as customers. A second obstacle involves the standard R&D innovation spillover some of the gains from efforts to develop the first generation of electric vehicles will be earned by producers of subsequent generations of cars To help achieve the million-car goal over $ billion in Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing loans are already supporting three of the world s first electric car factories located in Delaware Tennessee and California. To make further progress the Budget proposes to provide a $ point-of-sale rebate to customers who buy electric vehicles ; to invest $ million toward research development and deployment of electric vehicles ; and to fund a new $ million competitive grant program to reward communities that invest in infrastructure to support electric vehicles Americans who continue to choose gasoline-powered vehicles can still make progress toward a clean energy future when those vehicles become more fuel-efficient. The new fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and light trucks for model years to is a step in that direction. To make further progress the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency have announced plans to develop standards for new cars and light trucks for model years and beyond along with the first proposed requirements to increase fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from mediumand heavy-duty trucks and buses Alternatives to Automobiles. Another way to reduce transportationrelated energy use is to provide more Americans with the opportunity to choose alternative cleaner forms of mobility such as railways for intercity travel and commuting and bicycles and walking for short local trips However all transportation systems require infrastructure investment : automobiles require roads trains need tracks and airplanes need airports and air traffic control systems. Throughout U.S. history public investment | Chapter in transportation infrastructure has led to long-term benefits from the Erie Canal to the transcontinental railroad to the interstate highway system As Chapter notes these types of infrastructure investments have been shown to have broad economic spillovers including increased economic growth productivity and land values. Some transportation infrastructure investments such as public transit high-speed rail and improved air traffic control can also have significant energy efficiency benefits For intercity travel the Budget proposes enhancements to train and air travel that will reduce energy demands. The United States already has the world s most extensive freight rail network. To extend that expertise to passenger trains the Administration is proposing to invest $ billion over six years to fund the development of a national passenger rail network including high-speed trains accessible to percent of Americans by And for air travel the budget includes continued investment in the NextGen satellite-based air traffic control system that will reduce delays improve air safety and yield significant energy savings For short local trips the Administration is undertaking a number of measures to promote alternative modes of mobility such as public transit bicycles and walking. The Budget allocates $ billion for transit programs over six years more than doubling the commitment to transit in previous budgets. As part of that the Administration is proposing $ billion in new grants over six years for projects supporting interconnections between various transportation modes and improving streets to make room for pedestrians bicycles and mass-transit alternatives Research and Development Finally a crucial forward-looking part of clean energy policy involves R&D. As already described market incentives produce less R&D than would be optimal because innovators create social benefits in excess of their private market returns. These positive spillovers affect every level of R&D from basic science all the way through demonstration and deployment of existing technologies In the past industries that have invested heavily in R&D have led the United States in creating high-quality jobs and exports. As Chapter notes R&D-intensive industries are characterized by higher sales per employee and more exports than comparable industries selling internationally tradable goods and services. For the future the energy sector is a large potential source of R&D-intensive industries along with the associated high-quality jobs and exports they produce. Other countries around the world face the same energy-related threats to their prosperity as those confronting the United States and global demand for new clean energy technologies is Transitioning to a Clean Energy Future | increasing. But given the spillovers associated with all R&D those countries that make public investments in clean energy R&D are likely be the first to develop those new industries. To address those spillovers and help ensure that the United States leads the world in this important growth industry the President has called for more than $ billion for clean energy research development and deployment incentives Research and development funding is often most productive when scientists collaborate across disciplines and institutions. To facilitate that cooperative work the Department of Energy has launched three Energy Innovation Hubs. Each brings together top researchers from academia industry and government to work on a particular energy-related technology. The first three hubs focus on deriving fuel from sunlight increasing energy efficiency in buildings and improving nuclear reactors. The Budget proposes three additional hubs targeted at rare earths and other critical materials vehicle batteries and Smart Grid technology for energy transmission. Such funding for research and development will help make future innovations possible yielding novel ways to produce clean energy and to store and use energy more efficiently Conclusion To guide the United States toward a clean energy future the Administration has enacted and proposed a wide variety of programs including manufacturing loan guarantees tax credits and rebates R&D subsidies weatherization assistance new vehicle standards information reporting requirements significant investment in transit infrastructure and a new Clean Energy Standard for electric utilities. The programs are connected in important ways. They are all motivated by the same fundamental economic rationale : the problem that the full social benefits of clean energy R&D production and consumption including energy security cleaner air and reduced carbon pollution and enhanced international competitiveness and economic growth are not reflected in private markets Moreover the programs focusing on different parts of the clean energy supply chain innovation manufacturing generation and use are complementary. The benefits from putting million electric vehicles on the road will be fully realized only if the electricity used to charge those vehicles can be generated by clean sources. R&D creates technologies that will be valuable only if they are manufactured and deployed which is why the Administration has proposed a Clean Energy Standard to create incentives for utilities to use new clean sources of energy. The Clean Energy Standard in turn is complemented by the Administration s programs to enhance energy efficiency | Chapter In the end all of the Administration s clean energy programs are united by the overriding goal that in the decades to come American families will prosper in a cleaner safer world. Today s investments in clean energy R&D will lead to innovations and new industries with high-quality jobs Clean sources of energy will mean that Americans breathe cleaner air enjoy better health face reduced risks from climate change and work and do business in an economy facing lower risks from energy-related disruptions a clean energy future Transitioning to a Clean Energy Future | C H A P T E R SUPPORTING AMERICA S SMALL BUSINESSES E nsuring the prosperity and growth of our Nation s small businesses and creating a climate conducive to entrepreneurship are critical to strengthening the American economy. The spirit of entrepreneurship has been intertwined with the Nation s history from the early entrepreneurs who laid the foundation for modern American commerce. Entrepreneurs built the industrial companies that helped to transform our Nation into an economic power and today innovative startup companies proliferate across the country in a wide range of industries. Not only do small businesses now employ approximately half of the private sector workforce nearly every American business starts small implying that entrepreneurs play a critical role in economic growth and job creation Small businesses defined by the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) Office of Advocacy as independent businesses having or fewer employees account for more than half of nonfarm private gross domestic product ( GDP ) These million businesses many of them family-owned companies are a key part of the U.S. economy. The economic challenges of the past few years however have proved difficult for owners of small businesses. Between and the number of new businesses founded is estimated to have dropped percent from to and the number of bankruptcies rose percent from to ( Figure ) Figure Births Closures and Bankruptcies of Firms Number of firms Births Closures Bankruptcies Notes : Births and closures in and are SBA estimates Births and closures include only employer firms. Bankruptcies include both employer and nonemployer firms. Employer firms have paid employees while nonemployer firms do not Sources : SBA Office of Advocacy In response the Administration has taken several actions to support small business such as reducing taxes and improving access to capital and credit. Through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( Recovery Act ) the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment ( HIRE ) Act the Small Business Jobs Act ( SBJA ) and the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act the Administration cut taxes for small businesses times and improved their access to credit and capital This chapter briefly reviews the impact of the recession on small firms and details how Administration policies have built a solid foundation for the future growth and prosperity of American small business Impact of the Recession on Small Businesses Job Creation One particularly important contribution of small firms to the Nation s well-being is the jobs they create. According to the SBA s Office of Advocacy small firms accounted for million of the million net new private sector jobs created between and nearly two out of every three of the period s net new jobs. In normal times new small businesses account disproportionately for employment growth. Although many new firms fail surviving | Chapter firms create enough jobs to offset those lost to firm exits so that most jobs created by firm births persist. A recent Kauffman Foundation study for example shows that startup firms created million gross jobs in the United States in By about half of the initial firms had failed but the survivors still employed million people ( Kane ) During the recession small businesses hired fewer workers than usual According to Business Employment Dynamics statistics between and businesses with fewer than employees hired an average of million workers a year but those numbers fell to million and million in and Furthermore some evidence suggests that small businesses have found it harder to recover from this recession than from past downturns. According to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report released in November new firms created a seasonally adjusted million jobs during the three quarters before March or percent fewer than during the comparable period after the recession Financing Small Business Access to credit and capital enables owners of small businesses to start support and expand their companies. During the recession both credit and capital availability for small businesses declined sharply hampering entrepreneurs efforts to finance operations and start new businesses. Although larger businesses typically rely on banks for only percent of their financing small firms receive percent of their financing from banks ( SBA ) Importantly community banks those with less than $ billion in risk-weighted assets provide percent of small business and farm loans ( COP ) The capital structure of small business is typically roughly half equity and half debt and the equity comes mainly from friends family or the founder themself. Unlike larger public companies which routinely submit extensive financial documentation to the Securities and Exchange Commission small firms can not easily provide verified data to potential investors. These information asymmetries and other market frictions tend to slow the flow of credit and capital to promising small businesses. Many researchers have found evidence of these liquidity constraints which limit the funding that small business owners can raise from the market.1 Over the years various institutions have arisen to help surmount this challenge in small business finance. One key to overcoming information issues is long-term relationships between small firms and commercial banks whose officers not only can observe whether each small business is servicing This discussion draws from Berger and Udell ; Peterson and Rajan ; Evans and Jovanovic ; and Holtz-Eakin Joulfaian and Rosen Supporting America s Small Businesses | its loans but also can collect additional information about its creditworthiness. To that end one major aim of the SBA credit and capital programs is to overcome the market failures involved in financing small firms. The purpose of SBA loan programs for example is to support commercial loans to firms that would be considered good credit risks were it not for these information asymmetries. And the goal of SBA investment programs such as the Small Business Investment Company program is to overcome frictions in capital markets by encouraging the flow of venture and growth capital to small businesses Changes in Availability of Credit and Capital for Small Business The recession complicated the already challenging financing landscape for small business in credit and capital markets. Commercial banks reduced their outstanding small loans ( which are generally assumed to go disproportionately to small businesses ) by more than $ billion or almost percent between June and June and the number of new loans to small business declined sharply ( Duke ) ( Figure ) Figure Bank Lending to Small Business Billions of dollars Number of loans in millions Value of loans Number of loans Source : FFIEC ( ) Commercial and industrial loans including loans to small businesses fell an estimated percent during the same period. This precipitous decline can be explained by changes in both demand and supply. First the recession caused a drop in aggregate demand reducing the ability of and incentives for small businesses to invest in new capital equipment or hire new employees | Chapter As a result the drop in demand for new loans contributed in part to the decline in lending to small business. Indeed an additional percent of bank senior loan officers reported lower demand in the second quarter of than reported higher or no change in demand with smaller net differences throughout the rest of and early Furthermore surveys from the National Federation of Independent Business indicated that in small business owners were far more concerned about poor sales than about tight credit ( Figure ) Figure Most Important Problem Facing Small Businesses in Percent Cost of labor Financial and interest rates Competition from large businesses Insurance cost/availability Government requirements Other Taxes Poor sales Notes : Other includes issues such as inflation and quality of labor. Data are an average of monthly National Federation of Independent Business surveys from Sources : Dunkelberg and Wade ( ) ; CEA calculations But falling demand was not the only problem. Firms that wanted to borrow and invest faced an especially grave situation during the recession Specifically the declining quality of existing loan portfolios for commercial banks led them to reduce or eliminate lines of credit and curtail new loans to small businesses. According to the Federal Reserve s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices standards for lending to small businesses tightened and interest rate spreads the difference between rates charged to small businesses and a bank s prime customers on loans Supporting America s Small Businesses | between $ and $ million increased by percentage point to its highest level in more than years The sharp drop in both residential and commercial real estate prices also likely contributed to the deteriorating lending environment for many small businesses. The value of real estate assets is important to small businesses. According to the Federal Reserve s Survey of Consumer Finances nearly percent of all households owned and managed a small business and percent of these households used personal assets such as their home as collateral for loans Despite signs of overall economic recovery the lending environment for small business may take some time to recover completely. Following the and recessions for example commercial lending continued to decline falling percent between and and percent between and ( COP ) Support for the small business lending market may thus continue to be necessary even as economic growth resumes The recession generated problems not only in the small business credit market but also in the angel and venture capital markets that allocate funds to promising new small businesses with high growth potential. Angel investors are wealthy individuals or small groups who invest in entrepreneurial ventures often in the early stages of development. In these angel investors provided $ billion ( down percent from ) in funding to entrepreneurial ventures ( Sohl ) Figure Venture Capital Investment Billions of dollars : Q3 Source : PricewaterhouseCoopers and National Venture Capital Association ( ) | Chapter Venture capital firms raise funds from institutional investors and other limited partners to invest in privately held companies. Although venture capital firms fund less than percent of new startups firms that have received venture capital investments provide disproportionate growth accounting for more than million jobs and approximately $ trillion in revenue in Venture capital has been especially important in spawning industries such as biotechnology which has produced life-saving medicines and tens of thousands of American jobs ( BIO ) The venture capital market grew tremendously during the late 1990s but fundraising has declined in recent years and fewer venture capital firms are focusing on early-stage firms ( Figure ) Venture capital investment has never completely regained its strength since the end of the dot-com boom in the early 2000s for at least three interrelated reasons : a decrease in such capital invested in early-stage startups ; difficult economic conditions including a weak initial public offering market ( Figure ) ; and asset reallocation away from venture capital funds by institutional investors. On average $ billion of venture capital was invested per quarter between and In the third quarter of however venture capital investments fell percent to $ billion according to a recent report from the National Venture Capital Association. The decline in access to capital for new firms exacerbated the more general financing challenges facing small firms Figure U.S. Initial Public Offerings Number of IPOs Source : Ritter ( ) Supporting America s Small Businesses | Administration Policies to Support Small Business To address the challenges for small businesses and entrepreneurs arising from the recession the Administration has taken measures that can be grouped under two broad headings : reducing the tax burden for small business and improving access to credit and capital. Both sets of policies are designed to increase the funds available to small business owners to hire workers invest in new equipment expand operations or attract new customers. It should also be noted that the stimulus provided by the Recovery Act increased aggregate demand a key concern mentioned in surveys of small business owners. The Financial Stability Plan administered by the Department of Treasury was designed to restore stability and confidence in the financial market. Both of these policies addressed the macroeconomic conditions affecting small businesses In addition to further spur demand for the products and services provided by small business the President issued a memorandum on April calling for an Interagency Task Force on Federal Contracting Opportunities for Small Business. The task force released specific recommendations in September aimed at increasing contracting opportunities for small business. Those recommendations are now being implemented by the Office of Management and Budget the SBA and other Federal agencies Tax Cuts for Small Business Since taking office in January President Obama has signed into law tax cuts targeted to small business. Each has given relief to business owners who struggled to stay afloat during the financial crisis and subsequent recession As noted hiring by small businesses slowed during and In response the HIRE Act was enacted in the spring of to spur job creation across the economy including in small businesses. The law provided a two tiered tax incentive to employers who hire and retain jobless workers. The first part of the incentive exempted employers from paying their share of Social Security taxes ( percent of the first $ of wages ) on qualified employees. The second part was a general business tax credit of up to $ for each new employee retained for more than one year. Both of these targeted tax cuts provided an incentive for small businesses to hire new workers and retain them helping to revive an important engine of job growth in the American economy | Chapter In addition the Affordable Care Act responded to small business owners concerns about high health care costs by giving eligible employers a tax credit of up to percent of health insurance premium costs increasing to percent for any two years starting in Moreover would-be entrepreneurs are sometimes discouraged from starting new firms for fear of losing health insurance coverage provided by their employer. In response the SBJA allows million self-employed individuals to deduct the cost of health insurance in for themselves and their family from their selfemployment taxes saving these workers an estimated $ billion Administration policy also aimed to increase incentives for small business investment. These incentives included a Recovery Act provision which was extended in the later SBJA that allowed percent bonus depreciation for new investments. The Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act expanded this same incentive through a provision allowing businesses to expense percent of their investments from September through the end of It is estimated that this provision will benefit up to million businesses. The Administration also doubled from $ to $ the capital investment and new equipment purchases that small businesses could write off in and increased that limit to $ in and It is estimated that million small businesses qualify for this provision. Taken together these measures reduce the cost of capital for small business providing significant incentives to invest in new machinery and equipment Finally the Administration has taken key steps to facilitate the startup of new businesses and encourage equity investments in existing small businesses. The Recovery Act permitted percent of capital gains on qualified small business investments to be excluded from taxation. The SBJA temporarily raised that exclusion to percent for key small business investments held for at least five years a benefit that is estimated to go to million firms and which the Administration has proposed to make permanent Initiatives to Increase Access to Credit Aside from these important tax cuts for small business the President also signed legislation that has helped small businesses access credit to hire employees and expand. The Recovery Act provided $ million to the SBA to eliminate fees on SBA-backed loans and raise the guarantee to percent on certain loans. Furthermore the Administration expanded the Microloan program and the Surety Bond Guarantee program and provided funds to improve the efficiency of the SBA s lending and oversight Supporting America s Small Businesses | processes. Combined with measures taken under the Financial Stability Plan to unfreeze the secondary markets on which SBA loans are bought and sold the Recovery Act SBA loan provisions have supported $ billion in lending to more than small businesses through October These measures were critical to the rebound of SBA-backed loans through and early ( Figure ) Figure SBA-Backed Loan Approvals Millions of dollars Recovery Act provisions implemented Mar-09 Oct-07 Feb-08 Jun-08 Oct-08 Feb-09 Jun-09 Oct-09 Feb-10 Jun-10 Oct-10 Source : SBA The SBJA went even further to increase the amount of loans to small businesses. It provided $ million to the SBA to support up to $ billion in new lending for small business while extending Recovery Act provisions to increase loan guarantees and reduce fees thus ensuring continued access to more affordable credit for small business owners. From February through December the SBA has supported more than $ billion of loans to nearly small businesses The Administration also took several new steps to increase access to credit. For example as small businesses grow they typically need to borrow more to finance more expensive equipment to increase their real estate holdings and to hire more skilled workers. In addition to extending Recovery Act SBA lending initiatives the SBJA also permanently increased the maximum size of SBA ( a ) program loans from $ million to $ million raised the lending limit in the SBA manufacturing-related loan program | Chapter from $ million to $ million and temporarily increased the SBA Express program limit from $ to $ million Small Business Lending Fund. The Administration s efforts also focused on increasing small business lending more broadly. As noted community banks are a critical source of credit for small businesses. These banks struggled during the financial crisis and sharply cut back their small business lending though less dramatically than did larger institutions To support these community banks and encourage more lending the Administration created a Small Business Lending Fund to be administered by the Treasury Department and tailored to the specific needs of each state Under this plan the Federal Government is authorized to lend up to $ billion in capital to community banks in return for preferred stock. The dividend rate that banks are required to pay back to the Treasury depends on how much they increase their loans to small business with a dividend rate as low as percent for lenders that increase loans by percent or more State Small Business Credit Initiative. As part of the SBJA the Administration also took action to boost small business lending by establishing a State Small Business Credit Initiative. Several states have already implemented loan programs to support small businesses and the Administration is working with other states to create similar programs Capital Access Programs for example create loan-loss reserves to which lenders and state governments contribute funds. Across a range of states these funds have historically leveraged $ to $ from every $ of public funds. The credit initiative will provide $ billion to shore up state programs that faced difficulties during the economic downturn and to spur private sector lending to small businesses. This initiative will require a minimum leverage of to $ for every $ received from the Treasury Department thus designed to support a total of $ billion in lending across the nation National Export Initiative. Another important program to benefit small business is the National Export Initiative ( NEI ) launched through an executive order issued by the President on March The NEI calls for a national outreach campaign both to identify small businesses that may be able to increase their exports and to raise awareness generally among the nation s small businesses about export opportunities. The NEI working through a number of agencies including the Commerce Department s International Trade Administration will also provide training and other kinds of technical assistance to help small businesses prepare to become exporters. In addition the NEI proposes to set up a pilot program to match small businesses with export intermediaries and outlines several measures to support small businesses with trade assistance programs once they begin Supporting America s Small Businesses | to export to new markets. In the months before August the ExportImport bank increased its approvals for small business loans nearly percent from $ billion to $ billion Policies to Encourage Greater Access to Capital In addition to providing tax cuts and increasing credit for existing small firms the Administration also has introduced important policies to provide access to capital and to encourage the formation of new businesses In particular the Administration has launched several important initiatives to facilitate the flow of venture and growth capital to small businesses and create more supportive conditions for the launch of new ventures Small Business Investment Company ( SBIC ) Program. SBICs are private venture and later-stage capital firms that register with the SBA and make equity investments in small companies. They raise equity capital from private sources raise debt backed by SBA guarantees and deploy this capital in private companies. Since SBICs have invested more than $ billion in more than small businesses. Today approximately SBICs manage more than $ billion Just as the Administration took action to counteract the decline in small business credit availability it worked to counter the decline in the funding of new small businesses. To reverse the precipitous fall in venture capital fundraising during and early provisions in the Recovery Act permanently increased the effectiveness of SBICs in providing capital to high-growth firms. The Recovery Act first made SBICs eligible for increased SBA guaranteed funding. It then required them to increase their investments in smaller companies In SBIC financing to small firms totaled $ billion an increase of percent over its average for the previous four years. In addition processing time fell from more than a year to less than six months allowing the SBA to increase markedly the number of new SBICs that it licensed Promoting Entrepreneurship in Regional Clusters. The SBA also launched its Innovative Economies Initiative to spur the development of entrepreneurship in regional clusters. The SBA provided $ million to regional economies across the nation to nurture and grow small businesses in critical industry supply chains. In one instance the SBA provided funds to its Small Business Development Centers in the Philadelphia region to link local small businesses to the Energy Regional Innovation Cluster initiative on green buildings | Chapter Startup America. The Administration has also promoted the success of new small businesses with high growth potential. On January it launched Startup America to encourage high-growth entrepreneurial ventures such as those that have revolutionized the nation s software semiconductor life science and energy sectors among others. Startup America includes both specific federal policies and a public-private partnership to promote entrepreneurship. The primary goal is to increase the number of high-growth startups that create broad-based economic growth and jobs. A second goal is to celebrate and honor entrepreneurship as a core American value and give more Americans the opportunity to start their own business Startup America features policy initiatives in four areas : access to capital entrepreneurship education and mentoring commercialization of university and federal laboratory research and reductions of barriers to growth for new ventures. To improve access to capital the SBA will work with the private sector through its SBIC Impact Fund program to guarantee investments totaling $ billion over the next five years in high-growth small businesses in underserved regions. The SBIC Innovation Fund program will guarantee an additional $ billion of investment over several years in early-stage innovative companies. This initiative also calls for an extension of the percent exemption of capital gains from qualified investments in small businesses and expands the New Markets tax credit program from $ billion to $ billion a year In the area of education and mentoring the Department of Energy the SBA and the Department of Veterans Affairs will provide support to expand successful business mentorship programs for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and for clean energy entrepreneurs around the nation. In addition private sector partners have committed to more than $ million in investments for entrepreneurial education and mentoring. The third set of initiatives in Startup America will invest in strategies to bring innovative ideas from federal labs and universities into the commercial marketplace both by establishing and disseminating best practices for commercialization and by funding regional proof of concept centers. In the fourth set of initiatives on reducing barriers to growth the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has announced that it will pursue a more efficient Three Track patent examination process creating benefits for entrepreneurs seeking more certainty over the timing of important intellectual property protection Startup America will also ask Federal agencies to identify barriers to highgrowth entrepreneurship and launch a listening tour for Administration officials to travel the nation and meet with entrepreneurs to solicit their recommendations for improving the environment for entrepreneurship Supporting America s Small Businesses | Conclusion Small businesses the foundation of the American economy are critical to economic growth and job creation. Entrepreneurs in part because of their reliance on commercial banks were especially hard hit during the financial crisis and subsequent recession. A swift and comprehensive policy response was thus essential. The Administration has advanced important initiatives to lower taxes and make health insurance more affordable for small businesses to increase their access to credit and capital and to provide stronger incentives for job creation and investment. Taken together these steps have stabilized the small business economy and placed it on a stronger footing for future growth | Chapter REFERENCES Chapter The Year In Review And The Years Ahead CBO ( Congressional Budget Office ) Monthly Budget Review : A Congressional Budget Office Analysis.
