REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS DURING APPENDIX B. STATISTICAL TABLES RELATING TO INCOME EMPLOYMENT AND PRODUCTION IV ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT To the Congress of the United States : A healthy and productive economy is a bulwark of freedom Around the world and here at home our trials of strength our works of peace our quest for justice our search for knowledge and understanding our efforts to enrich our environment are buttressed by an amazing productive power Americans have confronted many challenges in this century. The ones we face in are as trying of men 's spirits as any we have known. But the overwhelming majority of us face our challenges in comfort if not affluence. The sacrifices required of most of today 's generation are not of income or security ; rather we are called on to renounce prejudice impatience apathy weakness and weariness In purely material terms most Americans are better off than ever before. That fact expands our responsibilities as it enlarges our resources to meet them RECENT ECONOMIC GAINS An average of million persons were at work in million more than in Nonfarm payrolls averaged million a gain of million. On the whole these jobs were better paying than ever and more regular and more secure than most workers can remember The value of our total production of goods and services in was $ billion $ billion or 8/ percent higher than in More of the increase than we wanted represented higher prices. Still the gain was nearly 51/2 percent after correction for price changes Labor business and the farmer all contributed to this major gain in production and they rightly shared the benefits Aggregate compensation of employees rose percent. Average compensation per man-hour in the private economy rose percent reflecting increased wages and fringe benefits more overtime the shift to higher-paying jobs and increased employer contributions to Social Security. Corporate profits after taxes advanced more than percent ; per dollar of sales they were roughly unchanged from the high rate of Net income per farm rose more than percent The single most meaningful measure of economic well-being is real disposable income per person the after-tax purchasing power in stable dollars available on the average to every man woman and child. It rose / percent or $ per person in Although this advance was somewhat smaller than in it was still three times as large as the average yearly gain in the 's February launched the strongest and most durable economic expansion in our economic annals and it still continues Almost million jobs have been added in the last years The rate of unemployment has fallen from percent in early to under percent. The rate for white adult males fell from percent to percent ; for Negro men from nearly percent to less than percent Early in more than two-thirds of our major labor markets were " areas of substantial unemployment " ; today only of the are so classified and have unemployment below percent While total population rose million between and the number of Americans in poverty declined ^ million and probably fell at least another * million in ( The poverty definition is adjusted for the increase in living costs. ) Our gross national product ( GNP ) has grown percent in years. In constant prices the gain has averaged 5J/2 percent a year. The physical output of our factories and mines is up over percent Private output per man-hour in was percent higher than in The 6-year addition to our gross stock of private productive capital machines buildings transportation equipment land improvements and inventories is valued at $ billion American families have added $ billion to their accumulated financial assets. They have added $ billion to their debts So their net financial position is $ billion stronger than years ago OUR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS Prosperity is everywhere evident. But prosperity is never without problems and in some of them were serious SOME LEADING PROBLEMS Economic progress still left far too many behind Nearly million workers were without jobs at the end of Perhaps two-thirds of them were " frictionally " unemployed : new entrants to the labor force in the process of locating a job ; persons who quit one job to seek another ; workers in the " off " months of seasonal industries ; those temporarily laid off but with instructions to return. Their unemployment will be temporary ; many were drawing unemployment insurance # But most of the remaining third will wait a long time for a steady job. They are the " hard-core " unemployed lacking the necessary skills to find other than intermittent work ; the victims of past or present discrimination ; those unable or unwilling to move from depressed areas and occupations ; the physically or emotionally handicapped # Another half million to one million potential workers were not even counted as unemployed. Many had long ago abandoned any search for a job. Some had never tried But even among those who worked year-round some million breadwinners particularly the low-skilled with large families earned incomes insufficient to support a minimum standard of decent subsistence * And 63/2 million families were poor because the heads of their households were unable to work : either aged severely handicapped or a widowed or deserted mother with young children Those left behind used to be called the " invisible poor. " But an awakened public conscience has sharpened the vision of most Americans Price increases although less than in many comparable periods still were greater than we wanted or should long tolerate It is tempting to blame the creep of prices on the greed of producers or the irresponsibility of labor or Government policies or bad weather or economic disturbances abroad. Some of the price rise may have been due to each. But the main causes lay elsewhere : Some can be traced to imbalances created by the special pressures of Vietnam procurement and booming private investment # The spurt of demand partly real partly psychological that followed the step-up of our Vietnam effort in mid-1965 simply exceeded the speed limits on the economy 's ability to adjust. Our resources were sufficient for the task ; but the sheer speed of the advance strained the ability of industrial management to mobilize resources at the required pace Some price advance was the inevitable cost of the adjustments required in recovering from a decade of slack : Wages had to be raised sharply in underpaid occupations which previously held their labor only because the alternative was no job at all Producers in once stagnant low-profit industries saw opportunities for expansion and found it possible to raise prices and earnings in order to attract needed capital Demand pressed harder on skilled occupations and professional services where we had trained too few persons to meet the needs of a high employment economy Some price increases would still have occurred had we moved at a steadier pace But these price increases could have come slowly enough and have been small enough not to threaten a chain reaction of wages chasing other wages wages chasing prices prices chasing wages and prices chasing other prices It is this spiral we must and can avoid. But it will require responsible action on the part of all Achieving equilibrium in our balance of payments remained a problem in spite of strong new measures The costs of Vietnam required us to spend many more hundreds of millions of dollars beyond our shores. At the same time the spurt of demand caused our imports especially of capital goods to soar We are determined to continue our progress toward equilibrium Tight money and high interest rates concentrated the burden of restraint on housing Interest rates in were as high as at any time in years. They were pushed there by an insatiable demand for credit straining against a deliberately restricted supply. Monetary policy in like tax policy was properly aimed at slowing down an economy expanding too fast The brakes applied last year worked. But tight money worked painfully and inequitably. It cut construction by more than $ billion during Its impact was equivalent to a heavy across-the-board tax increase but with most of its effect concentrated on a single industry FINDING SOLUTIONS We will move this year toward solutions for these problems and others But they can not all be completely solved in Lifting the Burden on Housing Now that the economy 's advance is again more moderate the burden of tight money is being lifted. Interest rates are still extremely high but they are moving down from their peaks. Credit is still not readily available to all who can make sound and productive use of it but it is becoming easier to get. More savings are flowing into our thrift institutions and are beginning to be available to builders and homebuyers The steps we took last year and those I am now proposing the steps the Federal Reserve has recently taken and is continuing to take to increase credit availability and lower interest rates should have our housing industry moving smartly forward by the end of and ready for one of its best years in Restoring Price Stability The advance of prices has already begun to slow. Wholesale prices in December were below their levels of August The more moderate pace of economic advance now underway which the policies I am recommending are designed to maintain should further diminish inflationary pressures We can not rescind all of last year 's increases in costs some of which are still spreading through our structure of prices. Price stability can not be restored overnight. But we will be making good progress toward price stability this year Improving Our International Payments We have recently announced stronger voluntary balance of payments programs for Our policies to constrain economic expansion to a sustainable pace should permit an improved export surplus I am now recommending further steps to strengthen our external payments. Yet so long as we remain heavily engaged in Southeast Asia we will have a balance of payments problem Combating Poverty We will continue to attack poverty and deprivation through such weapons as Community Action and Head Start ; rent supplements and child nutrition ; aid to elementary and secondary education in poverty areas and the Teachers Corps ; the Manpower Development and Training Act the Job Corps the Neighborhood Youth Corps ; Medicare Medicaid and neighborhood health centers ; measures to end discrimination in jobs education and public facilities ; the expanded coverage enacted last year for a higher minimum wage I am proposing that our attack be reinforced with new weapons in Yet with old weapons and new the war on poverty will not be won in or There is no wonder drug which can suddenly conquer this ancient scourge of man. It will be a long and continuing struggle which will challenge our imagination our patience our knowledge and our resources for years to come. Our capacity to stay with the task will be a test of our maturity as a people USING THE GAINS OF GROWTH From early to the end of our GNP rose an average of $ billion a year. About $ billion a year was price increase. Of the balance An average real gain of $ billion a year ( in prices ) came from putting idle men and machines back to work An average real gain of $ billion a year ( in prices ) came from the growth of our resources : a larger work force more and better capital and management higher productivity Further gains from putting idle resources to work will now be harder to achieve But our annual dividend from growth has meanwhile become more generous. In it will add $ billion at today 's prices to our potential output Our economic policies must assure that we realize this potential dividend and use it wisely REALIZING THE GROWTH DIVIDEND To ensure our full dividend from economic growth requires that markets for goods and services expand steadily and adequately but not excessively. In recent years we have tested and refined the power of fiscal and monetary policy to stimulate or moderate the expansion of total demand During Federal expenditures were expanding rapidly. But tax policy worked to counter their impact Federal expenditures in our national income accounts grew $ billion in calendar year reflecting the step-up in national defense ; in Social Security Medicare and related payments ; and in grants to State and local governments. They added strongly to private pur chasing power. They would have added more but for the substantial expenditure cutbacks put into effect during the year On the other side taxes restrained demand. Higher payroll taxes the restoration of some excise taxes the institution of graduated withholding and the suspension of tax incentives to investment all represented new measures that were draining off more than $ billion of spendable incomes by year-end. In combination and for the full year these measures and an expanding economy produced $ billion more in revenues than in Prompt action by Congress in response to my tax proposals of January and September made tax policy an important force for economic restraint Taking the two sides together our national income accounts budget was in surplus in the first half and in balance for as a whole But as private investment threatened to outrun private saving sharp monetary restraint was also applied. In response to both fiscal and monetary restraints the economy shifted gears from excessive speed to a moderate advance FISCAL POLICY FOR In the year ahead we are determined to maintain that moderate advance ; we need no further slowdown ; we can tolerate no new spurt of demand. After midyear the tax increase I have proposed and a more moderate growth of Federal spending will increase the freedom of monetary policy to support expansion. I am confident that the opportunity will be used The specific fiscal program I am recommending includes a surcharge of percent on the tax liabilities of individuals exempting persons in the lowest income brackets ; the same percent surcharge on the tax liabilities of corporations Here are some examples of the effect of this proposal as applied to a married couple with two dependents using typical deductions : With $ income their tax will be unchanged still $ lower than they would have paid in With $ income their tax in will rise $ or $ a week. Their annual tax will still be $ less than they would have paid in With $ income their tax in will rise $ or $ a week. But their annual tax will still be $ less than they would have paid in A corporation with profits before tax of $ will pay an extra $ It will still pay $ less than it would have paid in One with profits of $ will pay an extra $ still $ less than it would have paid in The surcharge will provide for $ billion of extra revenues in fiscal year on a national income accounts basis substantially offsetting the expansion of $ billion in defense purchases The national income accounts budget will also be affected by my proposals for Social Security benefits and taxes After allowance for these changes the national income accounts deficit for fiscal year is now estimated at $ billion compared with $ billion in fiscal year I am also recommending two further accelerations of corporate tax payments to begin in : requiring quarterly payment of estimated tax on the basis of percent rather than percent of liability ; requiring over a 5-year period that small corporations as well as large become current in their tax payments in the same way as individual proprietors We have fashioned a fiscal program for sustainable expansion. With that program we now see a rise of about $ billion in our GNP in a growth dividend close to percent in real terms USING THE GROWTH DIVIDEND The first priority for the use of our growth dividend must as always be the defense of freedom. But it will take only a small part of our $ billion of added production These will be the public claims on our growth dividend : * $ billion more of our output in will go for the support of our men in Vietnam and other urgent needs of defense $ y2 billion will go for the expansion of other Federal purchases including adjustments in Federal civilian and military pay # State and local governments will use about $ billion more of the Nation 's resources in In this they will be aided by Federal grants totaling nearly $ billion The remaining $ ^ billion of our GNP gain in nearly percent of it will be used in the private sector. And the flow of goods and services to consumers will expand this year by even more than that In the past several years an unusually large part of our output growth has gone to expand the productive capacity of business and to build up inventories to support high and growing production and sales. On balance a slightly smaller portion of our resources will be used for these purposes in than in IO For the year as a whole slightly less of our resources than last year will be used to build new homes although a sharp recovery in residential construction from its current deep recession is expected during the course of the year As the flow of goods and services to consumers expands the ability of our elderly citizens to share in these gains will be supported by a rise of more than $ billion in Social Security and Medicare payments In we will have no bonus dividend from using previously idle resources. But the dividend from growth alone is a big one. We must be sure we get it ; and we must use it wisely RESTORING PRICE STABILITY From the beginning of until the United States enjoyed both price stability and a strongly expanding economy. The average of wholesale prices hardly moved and consumer prices rose only a little more than percent a year. Last year that record was blemished Consumer prices rose percent between and wholesale prices percent When we were involved in Korea consumer prices rose percent between and wholesale prices percent. And we had price controls during most of Even when we were not at war consumer prices rose percent between and wholesale prices percent Nevertheless we are not satisfied with our record on prices. And we expect to improve on it this year There are many reasons why we refuse to tolerate rapidly rising prices : They injure those with fixed incomes especially older people They can lead to speculation and economic distortions which could undermine prosperity They weaken our competitive position in world markets As they persist they become harder to stop without throwing the economy into reverse Restoring price stability is one of our major tasks. It will not be accomplished all at once or all in That could be done if at all only at the cost of mass unemployment idle machines and intolerable economic waste. But a gradual return to stability can go hand in hand with steady economic advance Such an improvement will require prudent fiscal and monetary policies ; Government efforts to help relieve the key points of pressure on prices ; II the responsible conduct of those in business and labor who have the power to make price and wage decisions With steady sustainable and balanced growth we can look forward to relief of pressures on capacity in such strained areas as machinery and metals ; adjustments of raw materials supplies to demand ; the end of labor shortages in key areas Other efforts of the Federal Government can help to relieve particular pressures on prices and wages. We will continue to develop manpower training programs to meet skill shortages ; to increase the efficiency of the employment services in matching jobs and men ; to handle Government procurement so as to minimize its pressure on prices ; to dispose of surplus Government stockpiles to alleviate shortages of raw materials ; to manage farm programs to assure adequate supplies as well as equitable returns But efforts of the Government alone will not be enough. The cooperation of business and labor is essential for success In the past year most businessmen who had a choice in setting prices and most trade unions that negotiated wage contracts acted responsibly They did so because they took account of the national interest and saw that it was also their own If business and labor were to consider only their own short-run interests each union might seek a wage increase which exceeds the most recent settlement by some other union ; each business might strive to achieve a new profit record by translating strong demand into higher prices whether or not costs have increased But when business and labor consider the national interest and their own longer-run interests they realize that such actions would have only one result : a wage-price spiral which is in the interest of neither If unions now attempt to recoup in wages all of the past or anticipated advance in the cost of living in addition to the productivity trend ; If businesses now seek to pass along rising costs when it would be possible to absorb them or do not reduce prices when costs fall ; then the result will be just such a spiral damaging to business damaging to labor and disastrous to the Nation Once again I appeal to business and labor in their own interest and that of the Nation for the utmost restraint and responsibility in wage and price decisions INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICIES The current year is a critical one for our international economic policies and for the economic progress of the world community As the largest single market and source of capital the United States carries special responsibilities TRADE This Administration is committed to reducing barriers to international trade as demonstrated by my recent action terminating the escape clause action on watches and rolling back the special tariff on imports of glass The Kennedy Round of trade negotiations is now entering its final and most critical phase. I emphasize once more how important this great attempt to liberalize world trade is for all the developed and developing nations of the free world After more than years of discussion it is essential that the participants now resolve the many complex problems that still remain. It would indeed be a tragedy if the wide authority granted to the President by the Trade Expansion Act of were allowed to lapse unused. Never before has there been such a splendid opportunity to increase world trade It must not be lost But the Kennedy Round is not the end of the road. We must look beyond the negotiations in Geneva to further progress in the years ahead We must begin to shape a trade policy for the next decade that is responsive to the needs of both the less developed and the advanced countries We should seize every opportunity to build and enlarge bridges of peaceful exchange with the countries of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. We should have the ability to adapt our policies to whatever political circumstances or commercial opportunities may present themselves. I again urge the Congress to provide authority to expand our trade relations with Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union AID Although was a relatively good year for world economic growth average output in developing countries rose by less than $ a person There were however encouraging signs of progress. Developing nations demonstrated a willingness to take difficult but necessary steps to help themselves. India for example revised her foreign exchange and agricultural policies to promote more rapid growth Among the wealthier nations stronger efforts were made to assist the development of the poorer countries. Canada and Japan increased their assistance programs. Major free world aid donors joined in new groups to coordinate theirflowof aid The United States will continue to respond constructively to the aspirations of the developing nations. We will give first priority to fighting the evils of hunger disease and ignorance in those free world countries which are resolutely committed to helping themselves There should however be increasing efforts to make both the receiving and giving of aid a matter for creative international partnership We shall therefore continue to support enthusiastically in a manner consistent with our balance of payments position such promising cooperative regional efforts as the Alliance for Progress the Inter-American the Asian and the African Development Banks and the Mekong Development Fund of the United Nations ; further encourage the coordinated extension and expansion of aid by the major donor countries in ways that result in an equitable sharing of the burden ; seek the cooperation of other major donor countries this year in replenishing the resources of the International Development Association BALANCE OF PAYMENTS We can take some satisfaction in the fact that our balance of payments in may prove to have been in surplus on official reserve settlements Despite the added costs of the war in Vietnam and the rapid growth of imports our deficit on a liquidity basis increased only slightly in But we can not relax our efforts to seek further improvement Our goal in the coming year is to continue to move toward balance of payments equilibrium as rapidly as the foreign exchange costs of the Vietnam conflict may permit. This goal will be supported through measures and policies consistent with healthy growth at home and our responsibilities abroad We already have extended and reinforced the voluntary restraint programs for corporate investment abroad and for foreign lending by financial institutions. I am counting on the continued full cooperation of businesses and banks with these programs in And I have instructed all agencies of the Government to intensify their efforts to limit the dollar drain resulting from their activities But more is needed. I now recommend the following steps : The Congress should extend the Interest Equalization Tax in strengthened form to July This tax has proved extremely useful in limiting the borrowing of developed countries in our capital markets and in reinforcing the Federal Reserve voluntary program. As we move toward easier money in the United States foreign borrowing in our financial markets may tend to increase. I am therefore requesting authority to adjust the rates of the Interest Equalization Tax as monetary conditions warrant so that the effective impact on interest costs can be varied between zero and percent. This would replace the present flat 1-percent impact Moreover to ensure against possible anticipatory increases in foreign borrowing I am also requesting that the tax be imposed at rates which provide an impact of percent on interest costs while the legislation is under consideration by Congress The most satisfactory way to arrest the increasing gap between American travel abroad and foreign travel here is not to limit the former but to stimulate and encourage the latter. I shall appoint in the near future a special industry-Government task force to make specific recommendations by May on how the Federal Government can best stimulate foreign travel to the United States. After a careful review of their advice I shall ask the U.S. Travel Service and other appropriate agencies to take the steps that seem most promising As part of our long-run balance of payments program I shall also request continuation and expansion by $ billion of the lending authority of the Export-Import Bank in order to support the expansion of exports ; continue to urge other countries to participate in the development of better means both of sharing the resource burdens and of neutralizing the balance of payments effect arising from the common defense and foreign assistance efforts For the longer run strength of our payments balance we should intensify efforts to stimulate exporters ' interest in supplying foreign markets ; enlist the support of the financial community to attract additional foreign investment in the United States ; encourage further development of foreign capital markets IMPROVING THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM In significant progress was made toward a better international monetary system. Through close consultation and cooperation among the financial authorities of major countries temporary strains were met promptly and effectively Two large forward steps were taken on the road to international monetary reform : wide consensus was reached on basic principles for the deliberate creation of additional reserve assets ; and the negotiations advanced to a second stage in which all members of the International Monetary Fund are participating An even greater effort must be made in the coming year to improve our monetary system. In particular I urge that all countries participate in the continuing task of strengthening the basic monetary arrangements that have served the world so well ; both surplus and deficit countries assume their full responsibility for proper adjustment of international payments imbalances and cooperate in efforts to lower world interest rates ; full agreement be reached on a constructive contingency plan for the adequate and orderly growth of world monetary reserves HELPING THE DISADVANTAGED The United States is the first large nation in the history of the world wealthy enough to end poverty within its borders. There are many fronts in the War on Poverty. We are moving forward on them all There must be full employment so that those qualified and able to work can find jobs. The unemployment rate last year was the lowest in years Those not now fully qualified must be given the education and training the health and guidance services which will enable them to make their full contribution to society. We have greatly increased our aid to education and enlarged our training programs and we will expand them further For those who will be unable to earn adequate incomes there must be help most of all for the benefit of children whose misfortune to be born poor must not deprive them of future opportunity. We have increased our income support and we will increase it further Wherever the poor and disadvantaged are concentrated intensive and coordinated programs to break the cycle of deprivation and dependency must continue and be reinforced. We instituted these programs in hundreds of cities and rural areas ; we are expanding them and designing others INCOME GUARANTEES Completely new proposals for guaranteeing minimum incomes are now under discussion. They range from a " negative income tax " to a complete restructuring of Public Assistance to a program of residual public employment for all who lack private jobs. Their advocates include some of the sturdiest defenders of free enterprise. These plans may or may not prove to be practicable at any time. And they are almost surely beyond our means at this time. But we must examine any plan however unconventional which could promise a major advance I intend to establish a commission of leading Americans to examine the many proposals that have been put forward reviewing their merits and disadvantages and reporting in years to me and the American people PUBLIC ASSISTANCE Our system of public assistance is now years old and has obvious faults. The standards of need set by many States are unrealistically low ; benefits are further restricted by excessively stringent eligibility conditions. In some respects the system perpetuates dependency State standards of need are miserably low. In States a family of is presumed able to manage for a month on $ a person or less And in many States actual payments average far below their own standards of need It is time to raise payments toward more acceptable levels As a first step I ask the Congress to require that each State 's payments at least meet its own definition of need ; and that its definition should be kept up to date annually as conditions change With minor exceptions payments under public assistance are reduced dollar for dollar of earnings by the recipient removing any incentive to accept part-time work. We should encourage self-help not penalize it It is time to put an end to this percent tax on the earnings of those on public assistance I shall therefore ask Congress to enact payment formulas which will permit those on assistance to keep some part of what they may earn without loss of payments Many recipients of public assistance are capable of receiving training which would ultimately make them self-supporting I therefore urge the Congress to make permanent the Unemployed Parent and Community Work and Training programs associated with Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) and to require all States receiving Federal support under AFDC to cooperate in making Community Work and Training available for the unemployed parents of dependent children TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT The coexistence of job vacancies and idle workers unable to fill them represents a bitter human tragedy and an inexcusable economic waste One of society 's most creative acts is the training of the unemployed the underemployed or the formerly unemployable to fill those vacancies A dynamic economy demands new and changing skills. By enabling workers to acquire those skills we open opportunities for individual development and self-fulfillment. And we make possible higher production without inflationary pressures I shall ask the Congress for funds to support a new and special effort to train and find jobs for the disadvantaged who live in urban ghettos I shall also propose legislation to improve the effectiveness of the Federal-State employment service SOCIAL SECURITY Millions of aged still live in poverty. Millions of younger Americans are willing to pay for more adequate retirement benefits in the future I ask the Congress to approve an over-all percent increase in our Social Security program. We can increase benefits for all Social Security beneficiaries by at least percent raise the minimum benefit by percent to $ a month assure workers with years of coverage at least $ a month extend Medical Insurance to disabled beneficiaries and allow larger earnings without loss of benefits UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE Our system of unemployment insurance was created in a world of massive unemployment. The needs of a high employment economy are different. Today when jobs are available the jobless who exhaust their benefits typically need training guidance or other supportive services Therefore I am asking the Congress to consider legislation to provide such services in conjunction with extended benefits to the long-term unemployed to extend the protection of the system to additional workers to establish more uniformly adequate benefits and to correct abuses CITIES AND HOUSING The American city is not obsolete ; it is still a great engine for economic and social progress. But cities are in trouble threatened by congestion pollution crime poverty racial tension slums and blight Yesterday 's rural poor have been moving to the city just as many of the jobs they seek and need have been moving to the suburbs. Inadequate transportation and discrimination in housing make it difficult for them to follow the jobs ; and deficiencies of education health and skills compound their disadvantages Most cities can not afford the massive expenditures necessary to solve these problems. The flight of higher income families and businesses to the suburbs erodes sources of revenue for the cities even as expenditure demands escalate. Inflexible city limits have created a hodgepodge of local taxing jurisdictions often dividing the tax base from the need The cities can not collect for the many benefits they supply to residents of the suburbs The problems of the cities flow across irrelevant boundaries established by historical accident. So solutions must draw on the resources and imagination of a larger area. Our efforts have been aimed to encourage a metropolitan approach to metropolitan problems We must also find ways to enlist more fully the resources and. imagination of private enterprise in the great task of restoring our cities I have just appointed a Commission under the chairmanship of Senator Paul H. Douglas to work with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to examine problems of codes zoning taxation and development standards and to recommend ways to increase the supply of low-cost housing. I am convinced that this study can make a major contribution to the solution of urban problems Last year the Congress enacted the pathbreaking Model Cities legislation. The Federal Government will help cities to focus all available programs on their needs eventually to overwhelm the problems that have heretofore overwhelmed the cities More than cities will have completed their plans and be eligible to start receiving assistance in Federal aid for water and sewer projects open land conservation and urban mass transportation is encouraging a more coordinated approach to metropolitan problems. I seek increased appropriations for all of these programs. And I shall seek authorization and resources for a greatly expanded program of research on urban problems Growth in the number and incomes of American families will require us to build about million new houses a year for the next decade most of them in and around cities. Last year housing bore a disproportionate part of the burden of needed restraint. But we are now moving into a period of renewed homebuilding. I look for construction to rise briskly during Federal programs for fiscal will assist in construction or renovation of housing units for the urban poor the elderly and the handicapped. The Rent Supplement program will contribute to this goal This year will be a brightening one for the housing industry ; it can also be a landmark year in the progress and evolution of our cities EDUCATION AND HEALTH Individually and collectively Americans have insatiable appetites for more education and better health. Education and health contribute both to individual well-being and to the Nation 's productivity. But far too many of our urban and rural poor are denied adequate access to either. The efficiency of our methods of education and of providing medical care can and should be strengthened History will record these years as the time when this Nation awoke to its needs and its limitations in education and health. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act Head Start the Teachers Corps Medicare Medicaid and the Partnership in Health will be landmarks in our social and economic development I shall propose an expanded Head Start program ; a Follow-Through program in the early years of school ; and the opening of other new educational opportunities for children ; both legislative and administrative changes to accelerate research and development on more efficient and effective ways of providing health resources ; an expanded child health program including early diagnosis and treatment a pilot program of dental care and the training of additional health personnel to provide services to children ABATING POLLUTION A polluted environment erodes our health and well-being. It diminishes individual vitality ; it is costly to industry and agriculture ; it has debilitating effects on urban and regional development ; it takes some of the joy out of life The 89th Congress enacted important legislation to improve the quality of our environment. All States have now signified their intention to establish water quality standards for their interstate and coastal waters The Federal Government is assisting State and local governments through comprehensive water basin planning and is providing financial help to States for the administration of water pollution control and to local areas for the construction of sewage treatment facilities. In addition we are studying appropriate methods to encourage industry to control its discharge of pollutants The foundation for abating air pollution was laid in the Clean Air Act of But the air over every city proves that further steps are necessary I propose that we get on with the jobs of preserving and restoring our environment. I will present detailed proposals on control of air pollution in another message IMPROVING OUR TAX SYSTEM Our tax system is one in which we can take pride. In terms of fairness revenue productivity and balanced economic impact it is unsurpassed by any other tax system in the world today Nevertheless it can be improved. As they now stand our tax laws impose undue burdens on some and grant unfair benefits to others A system as complex as ours can not be perfected in a single bill Rather the process of tax reform must be continuous with every provision of the law subject to constant examination and adjustment where needed. Moreover this work of basic reform should proceed independently of the requirements for raising taxes or the opportunities for tax reduction I therefore plan to submit proposals to the Congress to improve the equity of our tax system and reduce economic distortions. These proposals will be designed to avoid significant budgetary effects As one specific reform I will urge changes to deal with abuses by tax-exempt private foundations IMPROVING GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION Separate Departments of Labor and Commerce perpetuate the obsolete notion that there is fundamental conflict between the interests of business and labor or between the interests of either and that of the Nation A single department of labor and business can more effectively carry out those national programs which affect the private productive sector as a whole. The two departments share many common objectives ; their interests and activities coincide or overlap in fostering economic and regional development ; matching the skills of labor with the needs of employers ; providing more jobs at better wages ; avoiding labor disputes ; maintaining a fair distribution of private incomes without inflation ; providing stability of production and jobs ; providing basic economic and social information and technical services needed by both private and public sectors ; supporting expansion of international trade and considering its impact on the domestic economy By combining these activities we can greatly improve efficiency reduce costs simplify the reporting burden on business provide better and more uniform statistics and assure that the views and the problems of the private sector enter more effectively into decisions on general economic policy I urge the Congress to support my recommendation for a new department of labor and business OTHER ECONOMIC POLICIES I renew four recommendations made in my Economic Report of and not acted upon by the 89th Congress : a fair system of charges for users of highways aviation facilities and inland waterways to improve efficiency in the use of transportation resources and to reimburse the Federal Government for a part of its expenditures on facilities which directly benefit those who use them ; truth-in-lending legislation to provide consumers with a full and clear statement of the true cost of credit ; stronger regulation of savings and loan holding companies ; provision of Federal charters for mutual savings banks to enlarge and strengthen our system of thrift institutions To aid the advance of technology on which economic progress depends I now urge Congressional support for a long-overdue modernization of our patent system ; a large-scale program of research in transportation Total holdings in the Nation 's stockpile of strategic and critical materials now stand at $ billion. Of this amount $ billion are excess to our defense needs as presently determined During the last fiscal year the Administrator of General Services disposed of excess stockpile materials valued at slightly more than $ billion without disruption of the domestic economy or the normal channels of trade The last session of the Congress authorized disposal of excess stockpile material valued at $ million. I will ask the Congress for authority to dispose of additional stockpile excesses bringing to about $ billion the present value of excess stockpile material available for disposal I believe that we should relieve taxpayers of the burden of carrying unneeded surplus stocks and provide businesses and workers with the materials necessary to assure continued high levels of production The responsibility which we share with the States to ensure that our banks and thrift institutions are honest competent and competitive is a continuing function demanding constant attention. We must continue to encourage the orderly and progressive development of a financial system adequate to meet the needs of a growing and dynamic economy I urge the Federal Reserve Board the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to continue and to intensify their efforts to coordinate their regulatory policies and procedures and to improve their examination methods AFTER VIETNAM Despite all our efforts for an honorable peace in Vietnam the war continues. I can not predict when it will end. Thus our plans must assume its long duration But peace will return and it could return sooner than we dare expect When hostilities do end we will be faced with a great opportunity and a challenge how best to use that opportunity. The resources now being claimed by the war can be diverted to peaceful uses both at home and abroad and can hasten the attainment of the great goals upon which we have set our sights If we keep our eyes firmly fixed on those goals and if we plan wisely we need have no fear that the bridge from war to peace will exact a wasteful toll of idle resources human or material But when that welcome day of peace arrives we will need quick adjustments in our economic policies. We must be prepared for those adjustments ready to act rapidly both to avoid interruption to our prosperity and to take full and immediate advantage of our opportunities Planning for peace has been an important activity in many executive agencies. But the effort needs to be stepped up and integrated Accordingly I am instructing the heads of the relevant agencies in the Executive Branch under the leadership of the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to begin at once a major and coordinated effort to review our readiness. I have asked them to consider possibilities and priorities for tax reduction ; to prepare with the Federal Reserve Board plans for quick adjustments of monetary and financial policies ; to determine which high priority programs can be quickly expanded ; to determine priorities for the longer range expansion of programs to meet the needs of the American people both through new and existing programs ; to study and evaluate the future direction of Federal financial support to our States and local governments ; to examine ways in which the transition to peace can be smoothed for the workers companies and communities now engaged in supplying our defense needs and the men released from our armed forces I have directed that initial reports be prepared on all of these and related problems and that thereafter they be kept continuously up to date CONCLUSION Our task for is to sustain further sound and rewarding economic progress while we move toward solutions for the problems we met in It will require a flexible and delicate balance of economic policies Above all we must guard against any interruption of our prosperity The steady advance of jobs and incomes is our most powerful weapon in the battle against poverty and discrimination at home. And it undergirds our policy around the world Yet we must be equally alert to the dangers of inflation In his Economic Report of January President Eisenhower wrote : The continuance of general prosperity can not be taken for granted In a high-level economy like ours neither the threat of inflation nor the threat of recession can ever be very distant. The only rigid rule we can afford to admit to our minds is the principle that the best way to fight a recession is to try to prevent it from occurring Only months later the sharpest recession of the entire postwar period began which also led to the largest peacetime budget deficit in our history. Over the same months both consumer prices and wholesale prices advanced 5J/2 percent considerably faster than in the months since June That history does not invalidate but rather reinforces President Eisenhower 's proposition. Neither the threat of inflation nor of recession is ever distant in a high level economy How can we steer between these dangers and at the same time supply the needs of national defense strengthen our overseas payments relieve the inequities of tight money and high interest rates maintain the momentum of social progress and provide the growth of incomes which lets each of us move toward fulfilling his private aspirations ? I am confident that we can find such a course. We will continue to coordinate the tools of monetary and fiscal policy to the common goal the sound balanced and noninflationary advance of production and incomes. We are steering toward lower interest rates a better balance in our economy a budget and a Social Security program that reflect national priorities There will be surprises in store along the way. We must be prepared to meet them swiftly and flexibly. And I think we are. The tools of economic policy are not perfect ; but they are far better understood and accepted in the Government and in the private community than ever before We have surely proved over recent years that economic progress does not need to be interrupted by frequent recessions. And although prices have risen faster in the past year and a half than we expected or wished we have done better than in most similar periods of our economic history. And we have done it without burdensome controls on prices or wages The Federal Government can not do the whole job or even very much of it. Production and incomes arise from the strength and skill of workers the ingenuity of managements the willingness of savers to risk their capital the genius of inventors and engineers the patience of teachers the devotion of local public servants the contributions of all who participate in our economy Yet the Federal Government has a role of leadership and a responsibility for coordination The Congress defined that role in the Employment Act of : it is the continuing policy and responsibility of the Federal Government with the assistance and cooperation of industry agriculture labor and State and local governments to coordinate and utilize all its plans functions and resources for the purpose of creating and maintaining in a manner calculated to foster and promote free competitive enterprise and the general welfare useful employment opportunities for those able willing and seeking to work and to promote maximum employment production and purchasing power Our economic policies for respond to that mandate January THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS Washington D.C.

The unemployment rate reached a 13-year low of percent. At that level demand finally matched supply in most labor markets a situation which economists define as essentially " full employment. " Real incomes of all major groups registered sizable gains. Expansion continued for the sixth straight year. For the third successive year growth exceeded } percent a record unparalleled in our postwar experience By any standard then was a big year for the economy. Gross national product ( GNP ) expanded by a record $ billion in current prices and reached $ billion. As in the preceding years a major advance in business fixed investment was a key expansionary force. And the rising requirements of Vietnam ddded $ billion to defense outlays. State and local spending and inventory investment also rose strongly As a result was in some respects too big a year especially in the early months. Spurred by the defense buildup total demand public and private forged ahead at an extraordinarily rapid rate in late and early Strains developed in financial markets. Demand outstripped supply in several sectors which were already near full utilization. As Chapter explains many of the new orders simply added to backlogs and put upward pressures on prices. Some of the excess demands were met by imports reducing the U.S. foreign trade surplus and retarding progress toward equilibrium in the balance of payments as Chapter indicates After years of stimulating demand policy was called upon to restrain the economy. The need for restraint was recognized at the start of the year. Monetary policy assumed a restrictive stance. In anticipation of large increases in private expenditures and defense outlays tax policies were applied to curb private demand. In and an expansionary tax policy had stimulated the economy ; but in March restrictive tax changes were enacted at the President 's request. Excise tax cuts were postponed and income tax payments were accelerated. Moreover the President 's budget program in January stringently held down nondefense outlays. These measures produced a Federal surplus in the national income accounts budget and a net restrictive fiscal impact in the first half of despite the strong advance in defense spending But the magnitude of the task was not fully appreciated at the beginning of As private demand and Vietnam requirements exceeded forecasts policy was adjusted to the new developments. Monetary policy tightened further causing a major cutback in homebuilding. In September the President proposed additional selective fiscal measures to alleviate excessive demands for funds and for capital goods The initial restraining measures reinforced by the previously enacted rise in payroll taxes began to take effect in the spring. By the closing months of it was clear that the brakes had worked. The economy had shouldered the burden of active hostilities without the need for cumbersome and inefficient controls and without losing its basic health and stability. It was shown that policy could work both ways ; it could restrain the economy much as it had been able to provide stimulus during the preceding years. In particular the power of tight money as a tool of restraint as well as its uneven impact was demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt As opens inflationary forces set in motion during the period of overly rapid expansion are still alive although their strength is waning But now there is also a renewed challenge to sustain expansion ; any further slowdown would be undesirable A healthy advance of demand in pace with the growth of potential output would permit gradual restoration of price stability. It would also promote a recovery in our foreign trade balance thereby aiding the pursuit of equilibrium in the balance of payments. The fiscal program for is designed to meet these objectives and to assure that the easing of monetary conditions presently underway can be extended ACHIEVEMENTS OF AN EXPANDING ECONOMY Last year 's record of economic gains added in length and strength to the remarkable uninterrupted expansion that began early in ( Table ) This advance can be viewed in many dimensions. Prosperity has conferred its benefits on nearly every sector industry and region in almost every year EMPLOYMENT GAINS Of all its facets the growth of employment may be of greatest significance Increasing numbers of Americans have obtained opportunities to earn secure livelihoods and to contribute to the material welfare of society Employment in Employment gains in were the largest of any year in the expansion Civilian employment increased by million and persons were added to the Armed Forces. The civilian unemployment rate fell from percent in to percent in the lowest since During the year the seasonally adjusted rate remained essentially on a plateau fluctuating between and percent.

Although employment in both of these groups expanded the increase was not enough to keep pace with the rapid growth of these groups in the labor force The expansion in the demand for labor extended to every nonagricultural sector of the economy. The most remarkable gains were in manufacturing where the number of jobs rose million from to Since most manufacturing employment consists of. high-productivity high-wage jobs the gain contributed to a major advance in real income. Employment in trade and services and State and local governments also expanded substantially rising by about V/2 million workers in The mirror image of the rapid increase in nonagricultural jobs was a remarkable decline of in agricultural employment in This decrease of 8J/4 percent was the largest percentage drop on record as higherpaying nonfarm job opportunities attracted farmers and hired workers out of agriculture Labor Supply The labor force expanded by million workers last year nearly more than demographic trends alone would have indicated. In particular a larger fraction of women and teenagers participated in the labor force Low unemployment encourages entry into the labor force. Some people especially women and teenagers who would be interested in working if jobs were plentiful do not actively search for jobs when they believe none are available. At such times these persons are considered neither as employed nor unemployed and are not counted in the labor force. When job opportunities improve they enter the labor force seeking and frequently finding jobs. The evidence of suggests that nearly of " hidden unemployed " or " discouraged workers " entered the labor force. Probably additional workers who did not respond fully to improved job opportunities last year will enter the labor market if it remains buoyant The Record Since The number of unemployed today is about million lower than years ago. Over the same period nearly million additional Americans have gained employment. Millions more moved into higher paying more secure and better jobs and out of declining areas and low-wage industries. The benefits of full employment have extended far beyond the important gains in real income and material welfare. By reducing poverty and hardship the opportunities for productive employment have contributed to human dignity and self-esteem and to freedom of choice The decline in unemployment in a vigorous and buoyant economy has changed the diagnoses and the proposed remedies for our labor market problems. Allegations that a substantial fraction of the labor force lacks the motivation to work have been refuted by the facts. Proposals to cut unemployment by artificially shortening the workweek or by instituting practices deliberately designed to hold down productivity are no longer seriously advanced The marked decline in unemployment in the past years has been shared by nearly all groups. In some instances improvement has been dramatic Only one-third as many Americans were unemployed for consecutive weeks or longer in as in Over the same period the unemployment rates for nonwhite adult males blue collar workers and married men fell by more than half Many of the previously hard core depressed areas are no longer suffering from high unemployment. In early of the Nation 's major labor market areas were classified as areas of substantial unemployment with rates in excess of percent. Today there are only labor market areas in that category. There are now areas that have unemployment rates of less than percent ; for most of there were none Of course some groups have gained less than others. Unemployment remains high among nonwhites teenagers and especially among workers with few skills and little training. As Chapter indicates inexperience inadequate education and racial discrimination unfortunately penalize these groups placing their members at the end of all too many hiring lines PRODUCTIVITY Productivity increases during the expansion have been excellent. The slow growth in the number of adult male workers was often cited as a reason for expecting bottlenecks in the labor market and a sluggish productivity performance during the expansion. However from to the average annual growth of private output per man-hour was percent exceeding the long-term trend of a little over percent a year One factor making for good productivity performance in recent years has been the high level of business investment expenditures. As a result capital has not been a bottleneck to the expansion of production and employment in most areas and industries. Moreover high investment rates have helped to modernize the capital stock and thereby speed technological progress In large part however the above-normal growth of productivity is typical of economic recoveries. A slack economy does not make full use of its capital stock or overhead labor. As activity expands both are utilized more efficiently and productivity increases. But this can not go on indefinitely In and average use of plant and equipment approached " preferred " rates and overhead labor had to be expanded. As a result of these factors and need for major rapid adjustments in the composition of employment growth of productivity slowed in and to just under percent slightly below the long-term trend GAINS IN REAL INCOME Advances in employment and productivity have generated unprecedented gains in the real income and the standard of living of the American people Farmers wage earners businessmen and professional workers have all shared in the impressive advance. Real disposable income per capita the best single measure of consumer welfare has risen by percent over the past years matching the increase in the preceding years Gains have been particularly rapid in recent years. In and real disposable income per capita increased by percent a year the equivalent of more than extra weekly paychecks annually. Despite the disturbing rise in consumer prices in real disposable income per capita continued to grow strongly by Zl/i percent. The higher incomes of included a percent increase in social insurance transfer payments which aided some of the needier groups Since there have been impressive advances in each type of income as well as in total income as shown in Table Through the growth of corporate profits outpaced GNP and most other types of income In however profits rose in line with GNP and less rapidly than employee compensation The full story of the welfare gains from economic expansion can not be conveyed by any array of statistics. Other data such as the rapid growth in the number of families owning durable goods and the greater percentage of families enjoying adequate diets and medical facilities could be presented to document various trends. But they all add up to the single story TABLE Changes in measures of income since Percentage change per year Measure of income to to Billions of dollars Disposable personal income : Current prices prices Corporate profits : Before taxes.

Gone were the chronic underutilization of resources general excess supply in labor markets and wastefully idle industrial capacity that had blemished the performance of the economy for a decade. Because of the excessive unemployment and idle capital in previous years the Nation sacrificed the opportunity to consume and invest a large amount of the output that it was capable of producing. At the trough of the recession in the first quarter of the " gap " between actual and potential GNP amounted to $ billion ( prices ) From to the cumulative gap totaled $ billion ( Chart ) Five years ago when unemployment was percent of the labor force there was clearly an excess supply of labor. Nobody could be sure where balance between supply and demand would be reached. The Council of Economic Advisers among others judged that an unemployment rate near percent would ( with the existing structure of labor markets ) yield approximate balance between the supply and demand for labor. Other experts argued however that the economy would run into substantial and significant labor bottlenecks when unemployment fell to percent. Another group contended optimistically that a sufficient expansion of aggregate demand might push unemployment down as low as percent without creating excess demand pressures. The experience of the past year provides a partial answer suggesting that the percent judgment was nearest to the mark.

The areas of shortages seemed largely to reflect the speed of the economy 's advance rather than the level of utilization attained. With the return of a more moderate advance those pressures have begun to subside The economy caught up with its economic potential in But total demand must continue to rise to keep pace with a growing potential GNP Indeed primarily as a result of faster growth of the labor force potential output itself has been accelerating somewhat. From the mid-1950 's into the early 's it advanced by about J/2 percent a year. More recently the rate of growth moved up to % percent a year ; and at present it seems to be advancing at an annual rate of about percent The growth of potential stems from three principal determinants : the rise in the labor force ; changes in annual average hours worked per man ; and the growth of average output per man-hour that is of productivity Because of the low birth rates during the depression of the 's and World War II the working-age population expanded slowly in the 's. However high postwar birth rates have recently led to accelerated growth of the labor force from * percent annually in earlier years to ^ percent Under steady full employment conditions longer vacations and shorter workweeks would lead to an annual decline of about * percent in hours worked per man thereby reducing the growth in total man-hours to about 15/2 percent a year Labor productivity in the private economy has grown at a trend rate somewhat over percent a year during the postwar period. But since the method of measuring productivity of Government workers ignores any change in their efficiency the trend rate of increase in output per man-hour in the total economy is just over } percent a year. Thus with GNP per man-hour advancing at that rate and total man-hours at about Y/i percent potential output advances at percent The Nation 's economic potential may grow even more rapidly in the future if the trend advance of productivity quickens. Two recent developments in particular could speed the growth of productivity. First the current investment boom has led to a significant modernization of our capital stock. About one-third of manufacturing equipment in use today is less than years old compared with one-fourth at the beginning of When much of our capital stock is new the production process will incorporate many of the latest technological advances. However new investment does not confer its productivity benefits immediately. Projects must first be completed and even then there are important start-up and break-in costs until new plant and equipment work smoothly. Hence much of the productivity bonus of the recent capital boom may still lie ahead. Second the use of active manpower policies can make a significant contribution to the improvement of the quality of the labor force and thus to productivity Manpower policies may also increase growth rates over the long run by lowering the level of unemployment consistent with price stability. In fact significant further reductions in unemployment will depend primarily on manpower programs particularly those aimed at disadvantaged groups as discussed in Chapter The closing of the gap in was a great achievement. But it necessarily means that the 5J/2 percent rate of advance of real output registered in recent years can not be matched in the near future. That rapid expansion was possible because idle resources were ready and able to make a productive contribution. The growth of employment outpaced the expansion of the civilian labor force ; many new employees were put to work on previously idle or underused machines ; improved utilization rates yielded a bonus of extra gains in productivity. But now that full employment has been essentially attained output can not continue to rise faster than productive capacity STRAINS AND RESTRAINT IN A SURGING ECONOMY The major theme of recent economic developments is the continuation of progress. But there is also a secondary theme of problems and imbalances many of which can be traced back to mid-1965 when the sudden increase in defense requirements for Vietnam led to a marked acceleration in economic activity. By the time measures of fiscal and monetary restraint took hold and slowed down the economy significant problems had developed an interruption of price stability a deterioration in international trade performance acute pressures in financial markets and sharply divergent movements among the various sectors of the economy THE ECONOMY IN MID-1965 As of mid-1965 the economy was advancing steadily and healthily toward full employment. GNP had risen by $ billion a quarter on the average for the preceding years ; the annual rate of real growth over that period had been } percent. Unemployment was down to ^ percent of the civilian labor force and the average operating rate of manufacturing capacity was up to percent. The price record showed few blemishes : average consumer prices in July were only percent higher than they had been in early and prices of nonfood commodities had risen by only percent Prices of manufactured finished products at wholesale had advanced by percent in years Expansionary fiscal policy had contributed actively to the record of months of advance. The reform of depreciation rules and the investment tax credit both initiated in encouraged business to expand and modernize plant and equipment. Furthermore as a result of these measures and the much larger tax reductions granted by the Revenue Act of both corporate and individual income recipients were enjoying an average reduction of one-fifth in their tax liabilities. Monetary policy continued to meet the credit needs of a brisk expansion and thereby contributed to the relative stability of long-term interest rates that was unusual for a period of rapid economic advance. Meanwhile Federal spending on goods and services was essentially level after mid-1962. As a share of the growing GNP defense purchases fell steadily from percent in to a postKorean low of percent by mid-1965. Defense spending was clearly not the fuel that was propelling the economy toward full employment. But neither was the decline in the defense share permitted to retard the growth of total demand ; some economic stimulus was provided by spending on new Federal civilian programs and major reductions in taxes encouraged private spending New stimulative policies were being prepared in the spring of to complete the advance to full employment. Congress enacted a major phased reduction of excise taxes in line with the President 's proposals and its first stage took effect in June cutting taxes by $ % billion ( annual rate ) A liberalization of social insurance benefits designed to help the aged was enacted to take effect retroactively. The larger benefits were to be financed by a payroll tax increase at the beginning of Meanwhile the liberalization of benefits was expected to give the economy a significant stimulus in the fall of when an anticipated liquidation of steel inventories might otherwise have threatened a slowdown. The retroactive portion which was disbursed in September amounted to $ million. Thereafter annual benefits were raised by about $ billion SPURT IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY The economic environment was significantly changed by the expansion of defense requirements. On July the President requested additional funds for defense and indicated that further increases would be required in January. Military outlays at an annual rate rose by nearly $ billion a quarter in late and early ( Table ) Defense orders expanded very rapidly spurring demands for labor and inventories by contractors Yet the defense buildup itself was not enough to account directly for the acceleration in the over-all economic advance. Rather it reinforced the previously planned fiscal stimuli and the forward momentum of a strong economy close to full employment. Furthermore the expansion of defense spending contributed to a significant change in the climate of opinion The Vietnam buildup virtually assured American businessmen that no economic reverse would occur in the near future. The impact on business attitudes was intensified by unwarranted fears that the Vietnam conflict might have consequences like those of the Korean conflict : direct controls excess profits taxes and a huge jump in prices of raw materials 4e TABLE Changes in gross national product during two periods since mid-1965 [ Billions of dollars seasonally adjusted annual rates ] Change Expenditure category II to I Gross national product Personal consumption expenditures Durable goods Nondurable goods _ Services _ Gross private domestic investment Fixed investment Businessfixedinvestment Residential structures Change in business inventories. _ I to I V i _ _ __ Net exports of goods and services Government purchases of goods and services Federal National defense. _ _ Other_ State and local. _ _ _ Preliminary Nonresidential structures and producers ' durable equipment NOTE. Detail will not necessarily add to total because of rounding Sources : Department of Commerce and Council of Economic Advisers The increase in defense spending swelled an already strongly rising tide of business investment expenditures. From the second quarter of to the first quarter of business spending for new structures and equipment rose by $ billion. Defense investment and social security liberalization in combination speeded the growth of disposable income. Consumer spending responded strongly growing by $ billion over this three-quarter interval. All in all GNP advanced at an average of $ billion a quarter Real output grew at a phenomenal annual rate of percent and industrial production rose at an annual rate of percent Unemployment fell from percent to percent of the civilian labor force during this period. New orders for durable manufactured goods rose markedly ( percent ) with orders for electrical machinery ( percent ) and defense products ( percent ) increasing especially rapidly The surge in demand for goods and labor created pressures on prices in many areas. From October to July the annual rate of advance for industrial wholesale prices stepped-up to percent. Prices of industrial crude materials moved sharply upward at an annual rate of percent from October to April. At the consumer level demand pressures raised prices of services and nonfood commodities and combined with special supply factors in agriculture to push up food prices. These price movements and their consequences are discussed in detail in Chapter All in all the economy exceeded reasonable speed limits in the period from mid1965 through the first quarter of MODERATION IN THE PACE OF ADVANCE After years of providing stimulus to the economy policy changed direction at the turn of the year. Monetary policy accounted for a major share of the restraint during most of As described in detail below the { Federal Reserve restrained the growth of credit supply in the face of extremely strong demands for borrowing by business. With intense competition for funds interest rates rose sharply. Institutions which supply mortgage funds to the homebuilding industry lost deposits both to the commercial banks and to the market for new corporate securities. As a result residential construction was starved for funds and the sharp decline in this sector was one of the principal moderating influences during the second half of Fiscal policy also responded effectively. Although the special defense costs necessarily swelled Federal outlays and were highly stimulative restrictive actions were taken in other areas. Increases in nondefense purchases were held to $ million from to Several restrictive tax measures were proposed in January and were enacted in mid-March. These included a reinstatement of some of the earlier excise tax reduction restoring about $ billion to the annual rate of Federal revenues ; and a system of graduated withholding for individual income taxes that drew off $ 1J4 billion ( annual rate ) from disposable income beginning in May. These new measures followed the $ billion increase in payroll taxes that took effect at the start of In addition revenues were increased in the spring by unusually large payments on income tax liabilities The national income accounts budget for the Federal sector shifted from a deficit at an annual rate of $ ^ billion in the second half of to a surplus at an annual rate of $ billion in the first half of ( As explained in the Appendix to this Chapter Federal fiscal policy is discussed throughout this Report in terms of the national income accounts budget. ) These monetary and fiscal actions helped to bring the rate of over-all economic expansion in line with the growth of capacity. After the first quarter of gains in GNP slowed to an average of $ ^ billion a quarter no longer outstripping the growth of potential GNP. The unemployment rate leveled off as employment gains essentially matched the growth of the labor force. Manufacturing output actually rose less than the growth of manufacturing capacity and average operating rates at yearend were below the percent that had been reached in the first quarter The change of pace was first clearly noticeable in the spring. Fiscal restraint appreciably slowed the growth of disposable income in the second quarter and contributed to a marked slowdown in consumer spending During the summer consumer demand perked up again. But homebuilding which had declined moderately in the second quarter was hit hard by the shortage of mortgage financing and took a sharp plunge holding down the increase in economic activity 4s Business demand for capital goods on the other hand continued to expand rapidly during the spring and summer. Although tight money rising costs of machinery and construction declining prices of common stock and appeals for voluntary restraint had moderating effects in particular firms and industries total business investment forged ahead. In August both the Commerce-SEC anticipations survey and the National Industrial Conference Board appropriations survey confirmed the vigor of the capital boom Commercial construction was the only type of business investment that showed weakness ; it was restrained by the shortage of mortgage funds The capital boom in fact was proving too vigorous. In view of the growing backlogs of orders shortages of certain types of skilled labor rising prices in capital goods industries and acute pressures of business credit demands on financial markets there was a clear need to moderate investment demand. On September the President asked Congress to suspend until January the percent tax credit on investment in machinery and equipment and accelerated depreciation provisions on new buildings. At the same time he initiated a program to reduce nondefense spending The Commerce-SEC survey in November showed that only moderate further increases in plant and equipment spending were planned through the second quarter of It also revealed that the actual increase in capital outlays in the third quarter was somewhat smaller than the planned advance reported in August ; this was the first downward revision of plans in years. The results of the survey no doubt reflected several factors including the moderation of economic expansion the financial pressures on business and the suspension of the investment tax incentives. Even though orders for machinery and equipment continued to outrun shipments through December there were favorable prospects that the pressures of excess demand on capital goods industries would be lessened in the months ahead RETROSPECT Despite the moderation after the first quarter expansion for was more rapid than virtually anyone expected at the outset. At the time it was presented last January the Council 's forecast that GNP in would rise strongly by $ ^ billion was somewhat above the typical forecast of private economists. Yet it turned out to be $ billion too low. In part the underestimate reflected the difference between the predicted real growth of nearly percent and the actual rate of * percent. In addition the over-all price deflator rose by percent about percentage point more than projected The primary sources of the underestimate were in Federal defense purchases and business fixed investment. While both had been expected to be key sources of strength they were even stronger than anticipated. As the prospective duration of Vietnam hostilities and the intensity of our military commitment exceeded those assumed in the budget Federal spending for defense in the calendar year ran above last January 's estimate by $ billion. Spurred in part by defense outlays expenditures on plant and equipment topped the Council 's expectations by $ billion to $ billion. State and local purchases and inventory investment also were above the projections while homebuilding and net exports fell below the estimates As it became clear that public and private demand was exceeding expectations the desirability of further increases in taxes came under public discussion. Continuing and careful consideration of this issue within the Administration sharpened by the increasing strain on financial markets led to the fiscal program of September In retrospect it is clear that after March monetary and fiscal policy in combination provided adequate total restraint. It may be debated whether a better balance of demands and policies would have been achieved if a program of additional fiscal restraint had been undertaken earlier in order to relieve the pressure on monetary policy. It may also be argued that the capital boom could have been cooled off sooner if the investment tax credit had been suspended earlier in the year. The question of whether a different timing or different magnitude of fiscal actions might have produced a more favorable balance in will long interest and challenge analysts of economic policy. But the main lesson is clear from the record : economic policy was used effectively to restrain the economy during much as it had been used during the preceding years to stimulate demand THE PATTERN OF OUTPUT In contrast to the reassuring balance of the expansion from to the advance in was uncomfortably uneven among sectors. The nature of these imbalances is illustrated by Chart which shows the shares of GNP absorbed by various types of expenditures since It is striking that the portion of GNP devoted to Federal purchases in was much the same as in earlier years. Indeed despite the sharp growth of defense outlays Federal expenditures represented a smaller share of national product than in any other post-Korean year except and The share of defense purchases was percent also lower than in any year from to State and local government purchases continued their secular rise as a share of GNP The share of private domestic and foreign investment in percent of GNP was quite typical for a full-employment year. Private investment exceeded private saving at full employment leaving room for moderate surpluses in government budgets ( national income accounts basis ) UNEVEN SHARES IN INVESTMENT Although the share of investment in GNP was normal the pattern of the major investment components was unusual when compared with other post Chart Selected Shares of Gross National Product PERCENT O F G N P DOMESTIC INVESTMENT GOVERNMENT PURCHASES AND NET EXPORTS FEDERAL PURCHASES X BUSINESS FIXED INVESTMENT STATE AND LOCAL PURCHASES RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES CHANGE IN BUSINESS INVENTORIES NET EXPORTS I I I I SOURCE : DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Korean years. Business fixed investment was at a record high of percent of GNP surpassing its previous peak of percent in and considerably above its post-Korean average of percent. Because of the scarcity of mortgage funds housing starts fell steadily from an average of million units in the first quarter of the year to million in the fourth ; at percent the share of residential construction was at a post-Korean low Inventory investment at percent matched its previous post-Korean high of Excess demand at home generated a spurt in demand for goods from abroad pulling down the share of net exports to the lowest level since The record share of business fixed investment in occurred despite the need for a much greater volume of external financing at unusually high borrowing costs. Incentives to invest were provided by a continuation of the forces that had spurred business to expand and modernize facilities in and : growing sales orders and profits and high operating rates These were further strengthened by the rise in defense spending INVENTORY INVESTMENT A high rate of inventory investment in relation to GNP during reflected many of the same factors that stimulated business fixed investment Inventory-sales ratios generally crept up after years of stability or decline Nonfarm stocks expanded by percent over the year considerably above the rate of growth of real output or sales. Inventories rose especially rapidly in durable goods manufacturing ; these stocks grew by nearly $ billion during the first months of Within durables goods-in-process inventories rose by about $ billion over the period reflecting in part the build-up of defense and business equipment in the pipeline The long production times that are essential for many durable goods were largely responsible for the growth of stocks of goods-in-process. From the time a company begins to build an airplane or a machine it may take months or a year to produce a finished good and complete a shipment While the piece of equipment is being fabricated the value of the completed portion shows up in inventories of goods-in-process. Thus if orders rise sharply for items with long production times inventories grow ; the ratio of inventories to shipments also tends to increase until shipments can catch up In late and in orders for business equipment and defense hardgoods rose sharply and shipments did not keep pace. The economic impact of this step-up in orders was not fully reflected in Government purchases or in business fixed investment ; some of it showed up as inventory investment The impact of defense orders on inventories can not be quantified precisely But it can be estimated by two approaches : one uses data on progress payments made by the Department of Defense and the other rests mainly on the statistics of defense-oriented industries. Both approaches suggest that from the beginning of the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of defense contractors and their suppliers added about $ billion to their stocks as a result of defense orders MONEY AND CREDIT The composition of output and the pace of advance last year were much influenced by financial and credit developments. In monetary policy moved to the center of the stage. Previously it had played a significant role in support of an active fiscal policy to stimulate economic expansion PROMOTING EXPANSION TO From through Federal Reserve policy permitted a sufficient expansion of credit to accommodate expanding demands for funds at only moderately rising interest rates. As in any period of economic advance greatly increased credit was demanded by consumers to purchase homes and durable goods businesses to finance investment in plant and equipment and inventories and State and local authorities to support their expenditures In the net flow of new credit to these groups was $ billion nearly double the amount in ( Table ) The pattern of credit flows had several outstanding characteristics. The volume of corporate security issues actually declined ; with the very rapid growth of corporate profits internal funds nearly kept pace with the expansion of business investment until mid-1965 ( Chart ) Also the volume of security issues was held down by the ready availability of bank loans to business The share of commercial banks in total lending rose by nearly one-third from to while the share of thrift institutions ( savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks ) declined by nearly one-third. Following a series of upward adjustments by regulatory authorities in the maximum interest rates allowed on time and savings deposits commercial banks competed aggressively for time deposits and acquired funds to meet growing demands for loans. They developed and made effective use of some new financial instruments especially the negotiable certificate of deposit ( CD ) Because these certificates unlike ordinary time deposits can be readily sold holders can earn interest on idle deposits without sacrificing liquidity These innovations helped to hold down long-term interest rates in the face of TABLE Net funds raised by domestic nonfinancial sectors [ Billions of dollars ] Type of credit Total i First half Second half * Seasonally adjusted annual rates Private domestic nonfinancial sectors Consumer credit Bank loans State and local obligations Corporate securities Home mortgages Other * U.S. Government Preliminary estimates Bank loans not elsewhere classified Mortgages on to 4-family homes Acceptances commercial and finance company paper U.S. Government loans and mortgages on multifamily dwellings and on farm and commercial land and buildings Source : Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Chart Investment and Gross Saving of Nonfinancial Corporations BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SEASONALLY ADJUSTED ANNUAL RATES ~ ~ n CROSS JAVWG2/ i i i 1i i 1i i 1i i 1i i 1i i r J/FIXED INVESTMENT PLUS CHANGE IN INVENTORIES 2/CORPORATE PROFITS AND INVENTORY VALUATION ADJUSTMENT LESS PROFITS TAX ACCRUALS AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS PLUS CAPITAL CONSUMPTION ALLOWANCES SOURCE : BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM growing credit demands and supported continued expansion of economic activity SHIFT TO RESTRAINT Conditions changed dramatically in the closing months of The rapid rise of business investment far exceeded the growth of corporate cash flow. This widening gap shown in Chart was the major driving force behind the rising demand for credit that continued into the first half of Given the intensity of this demand monetary policy could have prevented an increase in interest rates and a tightening of credit availability only by creating bank reserves at an extremely rapid rate. Such a policy would have contributed to inflation by removing financial limitations on the surging demands for goods and services. Under the circumstances it was desirable to curb the growth of credit. The appropriate degree of restraint had to take into account the volume of pressure on financial markets and the magnitude of the upward movement in interest rates that could be tolerated In December the Federal Reserve signaled the forthcoming tightening of monetary policy by increasing the discount rate from percent to 4J4 percent. At the same time the maximum allowable interest rate on time deposits of commercial banks was raised from ^ to } percent During the first half of business demands for credit rose rapidly. Supplies of credit did not keep pace as the Federal Reserve held the expansion in bank reserves somewhat below that of when credit demands were rising less strongly In order to maintain the good will of valued business customers banks made every effort to satisfy the mounting demands for business loans. They obtained additional loanable funds by increasing their borrowings from the Federal Reserve reducing their investments in securities bringing back funds from their foreign branches and attracting additional time deposits through higher interest rates. As a result they were able to expand business loans at an annual rate of about percent in the first half of even more rapidly than the percent increase in Corporate demands for credit were so strong that even this extraordinary increase in bank lending provided less than half of the external funds raised by corporations. To finance their investment expenditures firms began to issue large amounts of new securities. Sales of securities by the Government particularly Government agencies were also large during this period The large volume of corporate and Government securities could be sold only at much higher yields. After November interest rates on highgrade securities increased sharply ( Chart ) As in the past the rise in market yields relative to the rates paid on deposits permitted security issues to absorb a larger proportion of total household lending ( Chart ) As in other periods of tight money and rising security yields funds deposited in financial institutions declined relative to funds provided directly to the security markets COMPETITION AMONG FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS Commercial banks competed strongly and rather successfully to hold their own as the total flow of funds into depository institutions declined By raising yields on CD 's the banks attracted corporate time deposits in large volume. In addition through the expanded use of savings certificates and other types of nonnegotiable certificates of deposit they induced an increasing flow of household time deposits The impact of the increased direct flow of savings to security markets fell heavily on the thrift institutions.

Because the portfolios of these institutions were invested primarily in mortgages ( assets with a fixed yield and a very slow turnover ) they had relatively little flexibility in adjusting the rates paid on ordinary deposits.

In the third quarter only $ billion ( annual rate ) went into residential mortgages more than percent below the amount provided a year earlier. The net flow into home mortgages from savings and loan associations was virtually zero. The result of all this was the marked decline in residential construction described earlier In the first half of the year Federal Reserve policy restrained bank lending only moderately but placed other financial institutions under severe pressure. If monetary policy had been applied more restrictively to banks by providing a smaller increase in reserves through open market operations banks would have sold more securties and bid more aggressively for time deposits. In that event pressure on thrift institutions would have been even more extreme than it was in fact. In view of this monetary policy was tempered by the intense competition among financial institutions ACTIONS TO REDUCE FINANCIAL PRESSURES The Federal Reserve acted after midyear to curb this intense competition In July interest rate ceilings were lowered on selected types of time deposits and reserve requirements on time deposits were raised Banks were also put under pressure during the summer as market interest rates rose further and those on CD 's moved up to the permissible ^ percent ceiling curtailing the ability of banks to retain corporate time deposits Meanwhile the Federal Reserve tightened its open market operations reducing nonborrowed reserves by $ million between July and August. Interest rates rose sharply and by late August all sectors of the financial markets were under severe pressure. Banks faced with a declining reserve base and unable to obtain corporate funds through CD 's were obliged to slow down their lending. Thrift institutions fearing a loss of funds sharply curtailed new mortgage commitments In September the Administration the Congress and financial regulatory agencies all took actions to improve the balance of demands for both funds and goods The Federal Reserve on September asked member banks to cooperate in moderating the rate of lending to business and spelled out its own current policies regarding lending to member banks. Banks that cooperated in holding down business loan commitments and refrained from liquidating securities would be permitted to borrow funds from the Federal Reserve for somewhat longer periods than usual while making necessary adjustments The Federal Reserve further increased the reserve requirement on time deposits The President 's proposal for temporary suspension of tax incentives to investment was designed to reduce corporate demands for long-term funds The Administration also buoyed financial markets by indicating that Federal agencies would hold down stringently their issues of securities in the financial markets even for purposes of refunding maturing issues On September the President signed a bill allowing Federal regulatory authorities to impose new interest rate ceilings on time and savings accounts In order to restrain excessive rate competition among different types of financial institutions the agencies involved announced new interest rate regulations on the same day that the bill was signed The interest rate that commercial banks were permitted to pay on deposits of less than $ was reduced from J4 percent to percent. A percent interest rate ceiling was also imposed on the deposits of mutual savings banks. Because the rates paid by savings and loan associations varied widely among different parts of the country the regulations governing these institutions were considerably more complicated but in general the ceilings were set somewhat above the comparable ones for commercial banks The flow of funds into mortgages was also supported by another piece of legislation signed the same month which increased the lending ability of the Federal National Mortgage Association by a total of $ billion These various actions reflected widespread concern over the uneven impact of monetary policy actions and changing credit demands on different sectors of the market SIGNS OF RELAXATION Since September financial conditions have improved considerably. The moderation in the pace of economic activity began to be reflected in less intense demands for credit. As inflationary pressures abated monetary policy responded promptly to the changing economic climate and nonborrowed reserves resumed their growth in November and December Moreover the Federal Reserve in late December rescinded the September letter requesting banks to restrict business loans After touching in late August and early September the highest levels in more than years interest rates fell steadily. By the end of the year most major interest rates on securities were appreciably below their earlier peaks. The Treasury bill rate fell to about % percent from more than J/2 percent in September. Rates on new issues of high grade corporate and municipal bonds declined by about one-half percentage point The reduction in market interest rates and in the ceilings on rates of depository institutions has begun to restore balance among financial intermediaries. Mutual savings banks gained deposits at an annual rate of more than } percent in the latter part of Savings and loan associations took longer to recover but by December there was definite improvement. In the first months of the net inflow of funds was percent below a year earlier. In December however a substantial net inflow of $ billion exceeded that of December Commercial bank credit fell from August to October bottomed out in November ; in December it rebounded at an annual rate of percent returning to its August level. However bank lending continued to be conservative at year end as many banks felt a need to rebuild their liquidity position before expanding their loan commitments As a result of the moderation in economic activity and the flexible response of monetary policy a welcome movement toward easier monetary conditions began to emerge as closed EVALUATION OF MONETARY RESTRAINT The credit squeeze of had an impressive and beneficial restraining effect on over-all demand. Its side effects were equally impressive but far less beneficial These side effects explain in part why relaxation of credit conditions is and has been an objective of policy. The cause of equity was not served by the arbitrary redistribution of income produced by very high interest rates or by the adversity experienced in the homebuilding industry. Moreover the stability of financial markets was at times endangered. While the insurance of deposits and the powers of " lenders of last resort " gave full protection against any recurrence of the financial panics experienced in previous generations the liquidity of portfolios was impaired by rapidly rising interest rates Last August monetary policy was probably as tight as it could get without risking financial disorder. Any further increase in over-all demand could not have been effectively countered by general monetary policy. In such a situation the flexibility of over-all stabilization policy is impaired. It is desirable for both fiscal and monetary policies to be operating from positions where they can move freely either way toward stimulus or restraint in the event of unanticipated developments The main effect of tight money on over-all activity worked primarily through the mortgage market curtailing homebuilding and other mortgagefinanced construction. In December expenditures for residential structures were $ billion ( annual rate ) below the first quarter level. Homebuilding had been on a plateau during most of and was rising moderately at the start of Demand conditions for housing looked fairly encouraging as excess supplies of new housing ( especially apartments ) that had earlier appeared in certain areas were reduced moderately during In the absence of tight money residential construction might have risen slightly further or retreated modestly during the course of ; the decline that actually occurred is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the change in credit conditions. By similar reasoning the performance of commercial and other mortgage-financed types of construction suggests an impact of perhaps $ billion or more. Monetary restraint probably also had some modest effect on expenditures for producers ' durable equipment and consumer durables but the amount is not evident in aggregate data All in all it seems reasonable perhaps even conservative to estimate that credit-financed expenditures may have been held down directly by as much as $ billion at year-end as a result of tight money compared with what would have happened had monetary policies continued supportive as during and most of This direct impact of $ billion on GNP is roughly as great as the estimated direct impact from a percent surcharge on personal and corporate tax liabilities. ( By restraining incomes both tax increases and tight money have further indirect " multiplier " effects on GNP. ) Thus when monetary restraint is taken into account it becomes 6o clear that the combined impact of monetary and fiscal policy was markedly restrictive PROSPECTS AND POLICIES FOR As begins over-all demand is reflecting the restraint of last year 's monetary and tax actions. Excessive demand is not now a serious threat The economy 's advance is being stimulated by a continuing rise in Federal defense and State and local purchases. In the private sector significant increases should be registered in consumption. Modest advances are indicated for business fixed investment and for net exports which reversed a long decline in the fourth quarter of Data on housing starts and permits for the closing months of provide encouraging although not conclusive evidence that homebuilding activity has touched bottom. But the recovery of homebuilding will take considerable time and the effects of last year 's monetary restraint will still be felt for many months. Interest rates on securities have declined ; but revitalizedflowsof funds into banks and thrift institutions have just begun. Financial institutions are relaxing their lending policies only gradually as they rebuild liquidity. Interest rates on bank loans and mortgages have not yet reflected the easing in financial markets. Finally construction expenditures will take place only after contracts are placed and work is initiated Inventory investment is bound to be considerably below the unusually high rate in the closing months of The rate of accumulation in the fourth quarter was about double that required to keep stocks advancing in pace with the trend growth of sales. As in the earlier months of much of the latest advance in inventories seems to have taken place in goods-inprocess held by industries producing defense and business equipment ; the buildup may continue but probably at a diminished rate Thus the economy faces a transition to a lower rate of investment in inventories. The strength elsewhere in the economy offers important evidence that the inventory adjustment need not cumulate into an excessive slowdown of activity. The over-all assessment does suggest however that private demand is not likely to be particularly buoyant in the first half of and that a stimulative stabilization policy is appropriate to support steady expansion during this period FISCAL PROGRAM FOR The budget will be appropriately stimulative in the first half of The annual rate of deficit ( national income accounts basis ) is expected to be more than $ billion compared with a $ 2/ billion deficit rate in the second half of Although nondefense spending has been held down both the special costs of Vietnam and further increases in transfer payments for Medicare will add substantially to Federal outlays. Revenues will continue O ^ 6i their normal growth in the first half of ; but unlike no significant net changes in tax payments will result from recent legislation. An increase in payroll taxes of $ l * /2 billion ( annual rate ) which went into effect at the beginning of will be nearly offset by the effect of the system of graduated withholding on income tax collections. As a result of this system which was instituted last May an additional $ billion in personal taxes was collected during Reflecting this net final payments this spring on personal tax liabilities for are expected to be correspondingly smaller By midyear construction should be recovering with the stimulus of monetary ease ; and inventory investment should be leveling off at a moderate rate. In combination these two sectors should significantly strengthen over-all private demand. A shift toward restraint in fiscal policy is appropriate at that time to assure that demand does not outrun capacity that movement toward restoration of price stability is maintained and that monetary policy does not have to be tightened again In line with this set of aims the President is asking the Congress to enact as of midyear a percent surcharge on personal and corporate income tax liabilities with an exemption for low-income families. The tax will remain in effect for years or as long as the unusual special Vietnam costs continue The form of this proposed temporary tax increase parallels the conclusion of the Subcommittee on Fiscal Policy of the Joint Economic Committee that " a uniform percentage addition to corporate and personal income tax liabilities to be effective for a stated period best satisfies criteria for shortrun stabilizing revenue changes. " Once fully in effect the surcharge will drain off an estimated $ billion ( annual rate ) of private incomes $ billion from individuals and $ billion from corporations On the expenditure side defense purchases will continue to rise but at a diminishing rate during the course of the year. Transfer payments in the second half of will exceed the rate in the first half by $ 4j/i billion reflecting primarily the proposed increase in Social Security benefits The President is requesting benefit liberalization amounting to $ billion ( annual rate ) to begin by midyear to support the needs of the elderly The liberalization will be followed by an increase in the payroll tax base at the beginning of Reflecting the income tax surcharge normal revenue growth and increased expenditures the rate of budget deficit will be reduced to about $ billion in the second half of the year and the budget is expected to be approximately in balance in the first half of ECONOMIC OUTLOOK With Congressional enactment of the President 's key fiscal proposals GNP for is expected to reach $ billion given the $ billion now estimated for In the nature of economic forecasting the projected advance of $ billion must be viewed as the midpoint of a range of possible outcomes rather than a precise estimate Like any quantitative forecast the estimated rise of $ billion is meant to convey important qualitative judgments. The advance will be considerably less rapid than the record increase of $ billion in GNP in Healthy forward motion will nevertheless be maintained. Real output should expand nearly in line with the percent growth of potential. As explained in Chapter the price record should improve ; over-all prices may increase slightly more than 2l/ % percent. Finally and most important the Nation should continue to experience substantially full employment in The unemployment rate should be essentially the same as in when it averaged percent. After allowance for an increase of more than in the Armed Forces the civilian labor force should expand by about 1J4 million and civilian employment should approximately keep pace Outlook by Sectors A more balanced composition of output is expected in reflecting the aims and effects of policy. Neither business fixed investment nor inventory investment will or should be strong stimulating forces. On the other hand housing should gain as the year develops and defense outlays will continue to provide economic stimulus Business Fixed Investment. After increasing by an average of ^ percent annually over the past years business fixed investment should expand much more slowly in Evidence of this is already provided in the November survey of intentions for plant and equipment spending Investment should increase only slightly from its level in the fourth quarter of and should show a rise of about $ billion from to This pace would be a welcome respite permitting pressures on capital goods industries to abate. The ratio of business investment to GNP should decline slowly to a more sustainable level near * percent by year end Business Inventories. Inventory investment was at a record high last year partly because of the rise in goods-in-process stocks of industries producing business and defense equipment. Any further buildup of these stocks will be small. Stocks in most areas are expected to rise in line with steady and moderate advances in sales. Inventory investment for may be about half the $ J/a billion rate experienced in Most of the decline to a sustainable rate should occur in the first half of the year with a leveling off thereafter Homebuilding. As monetary policy continues to ease housing starts should begin to rise above their current depressed level. Additional help should come from actions of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ( FHLBB ) and the Federal National Mortgage Association ( FNMA ) Because of the lag between mortgage commitments and construction expenditures activity should begin to increase very gradually in the first half of the year and gain considerable momentum in the latter part. Demo- graphic factors and low vacancy rates point to latent strength in homebuilding which should become evident during the course of Residential construction expenditures are expected to increase by about $ billion to $ billion from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of Even so for the year as a whole they would still be about $ billion below the average Government. State and local government purchases which grew by percent or $ billion in should expand in by about $ billion in response to growing needs and strongly increasing revenues. The increase in Federal purchases from to is expected to be $ billion mostly for defense. But the rate of advance will taper off during the course of the year Net Exports. As the growth of imports moderates and exports show strength net exports should expand throughout the year rising about $ billion from to Consumption. The fiscal program for will have a direct impact on after-tax incomes of households and thus on their consumption outlays. The growth in transfer payments will increase disposable income while the proposed surtax on individual incomes and the payroll tax that just took effect will restrain it. The more moderate growth expected in employment and the net effect of these policy measures will hold the growth of disposable personal income in somewhat below the gain in This advance in disposable income should make possible a gain in consumption of more than $ billion in compared with a rise of $ ^ billion in In real terms the expected gains in consumption and disposable income in are expected approximately to match those of The saving rate in should remain close to the level of } percent a little below the average of recent years Flexibility The program and the outlook for provide good prospects for a growth of demand that keeps pace with capacity. But the experience of is a clear reminder that surprises can develop and that policy must be alert to them. This year the risks are on both sides : demand could grow too sluggishly or too strongly. A balance of risks is a necessary feature of a full employment economy moving ahead essentially in line with potential In the first half of there are forces which could make for sluggish private demand but a sizable stimulus from fiscal policy will help to clear the hurdles. Then in the second half housing should move up strongly the rate of inventory investment should stop declining and transfer payments will rise. Indeed with these developments private demand could once again move ahead rapidly perhaps even too rapidly. But by that time the President 's tax program will be moderating the advance At any time in the year the outlook for plant and equipment demand could be upset if the recent signs of moderation should prove illusory or if a sharp and pronounced decline should occur. Either development could call for a response by stabilization policies Cessation of hostilities in Vietnam would be the most welcome surprise that could develop in It would challenge economic policy to smooth the transition and policy will be ready to meet the challenge. On the other hand an unexpected increase in outlays required for defense would have important consequences pointing toward further measures of restraint particularly from fiscal policy A firm set of attainable objectives a program that fits the present outlook alertness to changing circumstances and flexible and well-coordinated use of policy instruments are the necessary means for maintaining full employment and achieving a sustainable advance in IMPROVING STABILIZATION TOOLS OVER THE LONGER RUN The tools of economic stabilization now at our disposal can cope quite effectively with the problems that lie immediately ahead. Over the coming years however there is a continuing need to sharpen and improve these policy tools as well as the institutional framework within which they operate so that short-term policy can respond efficiently and flexibly to economic fluctuations and simultaneously promote progress along a path of sustainable long-term growth USES OF MONETARY POLICY As a stabilization tool monetary policy has some distinct advantages Policy changes can be made quickly in response to changing signals. Furthermore as was evident in a restrictive monetary policy can reduce aggregate demand fairly promptly and very sharply But there are also distinct limitations on the uses of monetary policy As demonstrated in its impact on different sectors of the economy can be highly uneven both in magnitude and in timing. Moreover if monetary policy is used repeatedly and in large doses to restrain inflation it may be difficult to avoid a long-term upward trend in interest rates. And the scope for monetary policy may at times also be limited by balance of payments considerations The uneven impact of changes in credit conditions is unavoidable to a certain extent. Monetary policy inevitably has its principal effect on those sectors that are particularly dependent on credit. But the special vulnerability of some sectors to tightening is also importantly related to certain structural characteristics of our financial institutions. Over time there should be scope for reducing the uneven impact of monetary policy through various modifications in these institutional arrangements. This is particularly true with respect to homebuilding In the postwar period changing monetary conditions have contributed to several major swings in residential construction. This particularly sensi- tive reaction to monetary conditions reflects the reliance of mortgage financing on institutional rather than open market sources of credit and its special reliance on one particular type of institution namely savings and loan associations. The most recent example of this sensitivity reviewed earlier was in when the associations suffered major withdrawals of funds Until savings and loan associations were largely sheltered from competition with commercial banks. Bank interest rates for time deposits were fixed at a low level and most banks were not interested in competing for savings funds. At that time however a series of increases was initiated in the administrative ceilings on the interest rates that banks could pay on time deposits. This led to a gradual narrowing in the differential between rates paid by the associations and by the banks ; and the share of deposits going into savings and loan associations declined even though the total amount advanced rapidly at least until Given the respective legal limitations on the portfolios of banks and of thrift institutions such a shift gradually tended to curtail the flow of funds to the mortgage market There is every reason to believe that thrift institutions will continue to face strong competition from banks and must hereafter operate in a very different environment from that prior to The supply of mortgage funds might be better protected in future periods of tight credit conditions if techniques could be devised to give the mortgage markets new and better forms of access to the open capital markets either directly or through the thrift institutions. A number of possible arrangements are now under discussion in the industry. With such arrangements funds would be available only at competitive rates ; but they would be available. At present some access is obtained indirectly when banks insurance companies and savings banks sell bonds in periods of tight money in order to buy mortgages. FNMA secondary market operations and FHLBB advances to savings and loan associations also provide an indirect link between mortgage financing and the national capital market Some additional stability in the flow of funds to the mortgage market could also be achieved through changes in the practices of savings and loan associations. They could partially stabilize their mortgage lending activity in the face of fluctuations in deposit flows if they held secondary reserves as commercial banks normally do. They can also place themselves in a better position to hold on to interest-sensitive deposits in a period of tight credit by issuing special instruments like CD 's returning a higher yield to investors. Comprehensive authority to issue such instruments has been granted only recently and should be of additional help in the future. In particular the associations reduce their exposure to abrupt changes in deposit flows by issuing such instruments for longer maturities It would also be desirable to strengthen thrift institutions by legislation permitting the Federal chartering of mutual savings banks. Such institutions would have powers to invest in corporate securities and con- sumer loans as well as mortgages. While broadened investment privileges of federally chartered mutual savings banks might initially divert some funds from the mortgage market such chartered banks would improve the efficiency of thrift institutions strengthen them in competition with banks and thereby ultimately benefit the mortgage market If the ability of the thrift institutions to compete with commercial banks can be strengthened continuous reliance on interest rate ceilings on savings accounts may no longer be desirable. But there could still be occasions when rate ceilings would serve a genuine need. This contingency could be provided for in either of two ways : ( ) through standby authority to impose rate ceilings under particular circumstances ; or ( ) through permanent ceilings set sufficiently high that they would become effective only in unusual instances. Pending agreement on the most suitable form of permanent legislation for regulating rates the present legislation ( which expires in September ) should be continued for a limited period The kinds of financial innovations sketched above could increase the scope for the active use of monetary policy as a tool of stabilization. With such changes a restrictive monetary policy might have a broader and less uneven impact There are however other possible limitations on the use of monetary policy. There is the danger that under some circumstances employment of the monetary instrument for short-run stabilization purposes can produce an upward ratcheting of interest rates which could interfere with long-term economic growth Indeed in the postwar period cyclical movements in rates have been superimposed on a distinct upward rate trend. Every period of business expansion has brought new postwar peaks in interest rates. Of course rates were abnormally low at the start of the postwar era reflecting the unusually large liquid balances of businesses and households. But this initial situation can not explain the continuing upward trend in rates since the mid-1950 's. During each period of economic expansion in the 's credit was tightened sharply to restrain demand. The resulting increases in interest rates were not fully offset during the subsequent mild recessions. With each advance expectations became adjusted to the new level. Rigidities retarded declines once higher rates were built into the deposit and loan practices of financial institutions But an upward ratchet of interest rates is not an inherent or necessary result of a flexible monetary policy. There is now a welcome opportunity for monetary policy to demonstrate its reversibility in a period of prosperity ; indeed that opportunity has already begun to be converted into reality A variety of approaches can also be used to reduce some of the obstacles to a flexible use of monetary policy which may be imposed by balance of payments considerations as discussed more fully in Chapter Monetary policy is an indispensable tool ; and there is important scope for making it more useful. But the measures that can be taken to this end can- not fully overcome its inherent limitations. It needs and has a powerful ally in fiscal policy NEED FOR FISCAL FLEXIBILITY In any over-all stabilization program fiscal policy must play a major role. Fiscal policy is generally more even in its impact than monetary policy Its effects tend to be more readily predictable and less subject to time lags Fiscal policy too can be used with a great deal of flexibility In principle a fiscal program for short-term stabilization can involve adjustment of budget expenditures of tax rates or of both. A limited amount of discretionary expenditure variation within a given year can be very useful to deal with unanticipated economic developments. But most economists now agree that the selection of appropriate expenditure levels for various public programs in the budget should be made in light of the relative merits of alternative programs and of the benefits of added public expenditures compared with private ones at the margin. Although the timing of some Federal expenditures can be flexibly adjusted only gradual changes can be made in other programs without compromising their efficiency at least to a degree. For such reasons it is preferable to emphasize changes in tax rates ( suitably coordinated with changes in monetary policy ) for stabilization purposes and to take full account of the possibilities of tax and monetary adjustments in determining patterns and levels of public expenditures A change in tax rates can have a powerful impact ; but it usually need not be applied in heavy doses. A large downward adjustment in tax rates was needed in because fiscal policy had been permitted to tighten unduly over a period of many years. But if active fiscal policy is pursued continuously only small adjustments in tax rates at any given time should be needed in most peacetime situations. Willingness to consider making such small adjustments frequently would contribute substantially to the effectiveness of stabilization policy and to efficient planning of Government programs. Indeed this willingness seems already established : in each of the past years Presidents Kennedy and Johnson have called for significant changes in tax laws. Annual tax changes have in fact become the rule rather than the exception The very fact that tax rates are less stable than in the past helps to make for a more stable economy. Far from being a source of increased uncertainty as is sometimes alleged the flexible and coordinated use of stabilization policies should enable both business firms and individuals to make their economic decisions in a climate of greater confidence. A knowledge that policies are alert to changing developments should help to reduce the important uncertainties about possible fluctuations in sales profits and employment opportunities Appendix T H E FEDERAL BUDGET NATIONAL INCOME ACCOUNTS BASIS Throughout this Annual Report Federal receipts and expenditures and budget surpluses or deficits are referred to in terms of the national income accounts ( NIA ) budget. This is a set of accounts devised by the Department of Commerce as part of the national income statistics to register the way that Federal fiscal transactions affect the income stream The principles followed in the NIA budget are relatively simple. In the first place this budget is comprehensive and records all Federal transactions that directly alter private spendable income including that of State and local governments. It incorporates the fiscal transactions of all Federal agencies regardless of the legal arrangements applying to these agencies. Thus the accounts include operations of trust funds and other Government-owned agencies as well as regular Government departments Second Federal transactions are counted at the time that they add to or subtract from private spendable income which often is different from the time when funds are actually withdrawn from or deposited into Treasury accounts Third all transactions involving loans or exchanges in assets are excluded The Government engages in numerous lending and swapping transactions involving billions of dollars a year. These are extremely important to the operation of the economy but they are not to be regarded as fiscal transactions because they do not affect disposable incomes directly In following these principles the NIA budget differs in several important respects from the more familiar administrative budget. The administrative budget is the traditional vehicle for the management and control of most of the Federal programs which operate through regular Congressional appropriations. But it does not and was not designed to reflect even approximately the economic impact of fiscal policy For the calendar year the NIA budget was essentially balanced with a tiny surplus of $ billion. But in the administrative budget expenditures outran receipts by $ billion. The main elements accounting for this very large difference are shown in Table Particularly important were Federal net loans and the net surplus of trust funds Trust funds. The administrative budget generally excludes both the revenues and expenditures of Federal trust funds. These funds include the T A B L E Relation of two measures of Federal budget surplus or deficit calendar year Description Billions of dollars Surplus or deficit ( ) national income accounts budget Plus : Seigniorage Excess of taxes received over taxes accrued Miscellaneous adjustments ( net ) Less : Excess of cash payments over goods received.. Net loans and financial transactions Surplus Federal trust funds Equals : Surplus or deficit ( ) administrative budget... Sources : Bureau of the Budget and Department of Commerce various Social Security hospital insurance and Medicare funds unemployment insurance railroad and civil service retirement funds the highway trust fund veterans life insurance and many others. Most transactions of trust funds directly affect the private income stream. Both expenditures and receipts are very large approximately $ billion. Moreover the funds can be in substantial surplus or deficit in any year. In calendar they showed a net surplus of $ billion. That surplus is properly reflected in the NIA budget although ignored in the administrative budget. A third measure of Government financial transactions the consolidated cash budget corresponds in this respect with the NIA budget Timing. In business accounting which provides the framework for decision-making by firms purchases and sales of goods and services are typically recorded when liabilities are incurred rather than when cash changes hands. The NIA budget generally follows the same procedure On the revenue side withholding of personal income taxes is counted as a collection when the taxes are actually taken from the paychecks of employees rather than when employers pay the Government ; excise and sales taxes are counted when the sales of taxable goods are actually made ; and corporate income taxes are counted when they accrue. Similarly on the expenditure side Government purchases of goods from businesses are recorded at the time of delivery rather than at time of payment. In this respect both the administrative budget and the consolidated cash budget differ from standard business accounting treatment by adopting a cash basis for the timing of transactions In cash collections of taxes exceeded accruals by about $ billion while cash disbursements for goods and services exceeded deliveries by $ billion Seigniorage. The NIA budget and the administrative budget also differ in their treatment of Treasury profits on coinage operations ( seigniorage ) which amounted to $ billion last year. When the face value of new coins minted exceeds the cost of metal used to produce them the profit is counted as a receipt in the administrative budget. But it is not a Government receipt in the NIA budget because the increase in Treasury cash bal- ances which results is a purely internal Government bookkeeping entry which does not reduce or drain off private purchasing power Lending. A further and vital difference between the NIA budget on the one hand and the consolidated cash and administrative budgets on the other involves the treatment of lending loan repayment and sales of financial assets. Such financial transactions are excluded from the NIA budget because they do not change the net worth or incomes of private parties but only their liquidity. The reasoning follows the same line applied above to tax accruals and profits on coinage. Just as businesses do not regard themselves as becoming poorer at the time they actually pay taxes they already owe neither do they consider repaying a Government loan as a current expense. Nor conversely do their incomes rise when they obtain loans from the Federal Government. Yet in the administrative budget a new Federal loan increases the deficit as much as an outlay that directly raises private income and sale or repayment of the loan diminishes it just as much as a tax payment To be sure many Federal loan transactions have important effects on private spending. But they work in a less direct way than the incomegenerating transactions. They channel funds at low costs to various activities deemed to be of particular social or economic importance such as exports college housing and farm production. Given the level of tax revenues when the Government lends more it must also borrow more. The net impact of a Federal loan financed by Government borrowing is that Government liabilities Treasury and agency issues are substituted for private debts Such substitution is likely to improve the terms and lower the interest rates available to some borrowers. But other borrowers may be displaced depending on credit conditions and monetary policy. Federal lending is best regarded as an aspect of monetary credit and debt management policy not of fiscal policy. When it lends borrowed funds the Government is acting as a financial institution much like private financial institutions Borrowers from private financial institutions also increase their liquidity They acquire cash by incurring debts. They are indeed better off for the opportunities to borrow and they may spend more as a result ; but they do not regard the borrowing as an addition to their incomes In the past year the Federal Government was a net lender partly because of the scarcity of funds in private financial markets. The difference between the two budgets on this account amounted to $ billion Chapter Prices and Wages in xpanding production and fuller employment brought gratifying advances in the incomes of most Americans in But satisfaction with higher incomes was marred by concern over the first significant rise in prices in years The shift away from price stability actually began early in when sagging farm prices suddenly reversed direction followed shortly by a climb in food prices first at wholesale and then at retail. During the course of the year prices of many other items turned upward. But it was only in that price movements were sufficiently disturbing to arouse public concern The public sensed what every economist knows that a reasonably stable price level is essential if balanced prosperity and full employment are to be continued at home and if the strength of the dollar is to be maintained abroad. Experience proves that rising prices can generate distortions that can eventually topple an economy from boom to recession. Experience also shows that rapidly rising prices can quickly erode a country 's competitive position in international markets. The critical economic problem to be solved in the year ahead is that of maintaining income growth and full utilization of resources without becoming trapped in an inflationary pricewage spiral The recent advance in prices was due in large measure to the acceleration in the growth of demand which began in mid-1965 and to the particularly rapid increase in output of capital goods and defense products. The step-up in the rate of price increase can not be explained by any simple formula It was a by-product of the complex process by which additional resources are drawn into production and adapted to the changing composition of demand. That process is now largely completed leaving the economy with a much higher rate of utilization of resources. But in the process of adjustment forces were set in motion which will continue to push up prices for a time even though the pressure on resources has now relaxed E Demand had of course been rising steadily since But that rise began when there were abundant supplies of idle labor and unused equipment. In addition productive capacity was being steadily increased through the installation of new plant and equipment ; accretions to the labor force ; and the steady rise of productivity as a result of better management an increasingly educated and skilled work force new industrial processes and increased capital per worker. Thus throughout the early 's production could expand freely to match growing demand. Moreover the pattern of expansion of industrial capacity was well balanced with the pattern of rising demand so that few specific points of pressure on the price structure developed By mid-1965 prices of farm products and of some industrial raw materials were already rising partly because of growing demand but also for such unrelated reasons on the supply side as the stage of the hog production cycle or impediments to minerals production abroad. Moreover by that time margins of idle labor and underutilized plant and equipment were shrinking. Under these circumstances the rapid spurt in demand and production that began in mid-1965 could not fail to affect prices The sharp rise in demand for defense products and capital goods imposed special pressures on the metals and machinery industries. In some branches of these industries the limits of efficient utilization were surpassed and in a few output was close to absolute limitations on capacity Even where productive resources were not fully used it was often difficult to adjust production rapidly enough to keep pace with soaring demands Time is needed even when there are no special problems affecting supply to increase the output of farm products and of industrial raw materials especially metals. It takes time to hire workers activate additional machines or increase the rate at which purchased supplies are delivered. In the second half of and in early the expansion of demand for many products and services was pushing against these speed limits on the expansion of output. Moreover the growth of demand was less balanced than previously so that pressure points multiplied. For some products and services production could keep up with demand only at somewhat higher costs using standby semi-obsolete equipment paying overtime rates mining lower grade ores and so on There were also imbalances in labor markets which created increasing difficulties as unemployment declined. Workers in low-paid occupations could not be retained without substantial upward adjustments of wage scales. Moreover reduced unemployment strengthened the bargaining position of unions and weakened that of employers. Wages generally began to rise faster at a time when productivity gains were slowing down. Prices of services of all kinds continued to rise and at an accelerated rate as wages in many service occupations were increased substantially The broad upswing in prices must therefore be explained in terms of a complex interaction between a general increase in the pressure on productive resources and special factors impinging on a limited range of product and labor markets. Had the increase in demand been slower and more evenly balanced the rise in the price level would certainly have been less although some increase would still have occurred. Farm products and raw materials would surely have risen in any event given the supply problems at home and abroad. Wage adjustments for low-paid occupations would still have been necessary though they could have been more gradual Although the pressures that developed in early have now abated somewhat they have left their mark on the structure of costs and prices. Prices of most farm products and of many industrial raw materials move more or less freely in both directions. The same is true though to a lesser degree of many products at early stages of fabrication. But it is unlikely that past price increases in most other parts of the economy will be reversed so long as the economy remains strong. Moreover price advances for such items as metals and industrial equipment tend to fan out and become built into the structure of industrial costs. And even temporary increases in farm and food prices through their impact on consumer prices materially affect the pattern of wage negotiations. The resulting higher wage settlements also tend to be permanently built into the cost structure Consequently the return to price stability can only be gradual. However as drew to a close there were signs of progress. Prices of farm products and some raw materials had leveled off. Thanks to the enormous strength and adaptability of the economy and the skill and ingenuity of workers and managements many of the industrial pressure points had been alleviated With the slower pace of growth in the second half of much of the necessary adaptation was accomplished. More of it will be accomplished in THE RECENT PRICE RECORD The year marked the end of a long period of price stability ( Charts and ) After having remained virtually constant since the wholesale price index rose by percent during ( i.e. December to December ) and percent during Consumer prices increased by percent during and by percent during Between December and September the wholesale price index was dominated by a rise of 14/ percent in the average price of farm products foods and feeds ( Table ) This group of products accounted for over percent of the total increase in the index over this period. In the fourth quarter of wholesale prices of farm products and foods dropped sharply and by the end of the year were only percent higher than at the end of Prices of the other commodities included in the wholesale price index increased by percent during ( Table ) Because of the strong demand for investment goods the largest price increases came in the machinery producing sector though prices of metals and metal products also rose appreciably Chart Wholesale Prices = FARM PRODUCTS H I I I I I I I I M I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I M I I I J/COMMODITIES OTHER THAN FARM PRODUCTS AND PROCESSED FOODS SOURCE : DEPARTMENT OF LABOR TABLE Changes in wholesale and consumer prices Percentage change December to December Group December September to to September December December to December Wholesale prices : All commodities Farm products processed foods and manufactured animal feeds Metals and metal products Nonelectrical machinery Electrical machinery and equipment A ll other commodities. ) Consumer prices : All items All commodities Food Other commodities Services i Less than percent Sources : Department of Labor and Council of Economic Advisers Chart Consumer Prices = SERVICES COMMODITIES LESS FOOD i ii I I h i m I n i n i l i ii i l i i h i i SOURCE : DEPARTMENT OF LABOR From to the consumer price index rose at an average rate of percent a year with commodity prices rising by less than percent and service prices increasing by about percent a year ( Table ) Much of the acceleration in consumer prices during was directly attributable to food prices but by the following year prices of all major components had begun to rise more rapidly. Prices of services especially in the medical and financial areas increased most and accounted for half of the total rise in the index during There were further increases in foods and other nondurables including a percent rise in apparel prices. After declining through prices of consumer durables began to rise in the second quarter of Perhaps the most comprehensive measure of price movements is the implicit price deflator for gross national product ( GNP ) Although consumer prices are its largest component the deflator also reflects changes in the prices of structures producers ' durable equipment exports and imports and government purchases. The over-all GNP deflator rose by percent between the fourth quarter of and the fourth quarter of Over that same period prices of structures and of government purchases increased more than the average price of consumer expenditures prices of producers ' durables rose less and prices of exports and imports remained unchanged TABLE Changes in wholesale prices December to December Indexes = Percentage change Relative December importance to in index December December December ( percent ) Commodity group All commodities Contribution to total change in ( percent ) Farm products foods and feeds Farm products..Processed foods _ Manufactured animal feeds Other commodities Textile products and apparel Hides skins leather and leather products Fuels and related products and power _ Chemicals and allied products Rubber and rubber products Lumber and wood products Pulp paper and allied products..

Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding Source : Department of Labor LABOR COMPENSATION AND LABOR COSTS Compensation of employees increased by $ billion from to more than two-thirds of the increase in GNP. Much of the increase in money compensation represented labor 's share of the added output produced by added employment. Some of it represented labor 's share of the added output which resulted from the growth of productivity. But some of the gain in employee compensation reflected increases in wage rates in excess of the growth of productivity. That part of the increase in labor compensation served to increase unit labor costs and thereby to push prices up Compensation per man-hour grew more rapidly in than in earlier years. At the same time productivity grew more slowly than usual. As a result unit labor costs in manufacturing showed the first significant rise since For the private nonfarm economy the rate of increase of labor costs accelerated The tight labor markets generated by rising demand were mainly responsible for the rapid rise in hourly compensation although collective bargaining power was important in a few sectors SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE LABOR MARKET The accelerated growth of output that began in mid-1965 was accompanied by record increases in employment throughout the economy. As indicated in Chapter the rising demand for workers also induced an increase in the supply with nearly more workers entering the labor force in than demographic trends would have indicated. The number of workers on part-time schedules " for economic reasons " dropped sharply for the second year in a row and the unemployment rate fell to the lowest level since Although no general labor shortage resulted labor markets in almost every industry occupation and area tightened appreciably and shortages appeared at a number of points. The abruptness of the increase in demand itself strained the normal processes of adjustment and contributed to more pressure on wages and on costs than would have occurred had the same over-all level of employment been reached more slowly Pattern of Demand The gains in employment were distributed unevenly among industries and occupations ( Table ) In many industries the expansion since mid-1965 simply accentuated long-run employment trends such as the growth in trade and services and the decline in agriculture. After years of little change manufacturing employment rose sharply particularly in the durable-goods sector reflecting the sharp increase in defense and capital goods spending ( Chart ) For the same reasons the increase in the demand for workers in various occupations was also uneven. Many of the occupational labor shortages reported during the past months were an intensification of longstanding imbalances between supply and demand for example for teachers doctors nurses and engineers. But new shortages appeared in a number of skilled occupations machinists toolmakers modelmakers and patternmakers aircraft mechanics and setup operators for various metalworking ma- TABLE Changes in employment by industry Percentage change per year Industry to Agricultural employment * Manufacturing Durable __ Nondurable Mining _ Contract construction Transportation and public utilities Retail trade Wholesale trade Finance insurance and real estateService and miscellaneous Government Federal State and local Nonagricultural payroll employment : Total to to i Labor force basis Source : Department of Labor chines which clearly resulted from the rapid expansion in durable manufacturing. Until the closing months of there were in addition shortages of skilled construction labor in many parts of the country Meeting the Demand for Labor Some of the increase in the demand for labor could be easily met by hiring workers previously unemployed. For the reasons set forth in Chapter however the pattern of skills and residence of the unemployed did not fully match the pattern of hiring needs. Employers often were forced to make other adjustments. They recruited at longer distances than before in some cases even abroad ; searched their rolls for workers who could be upgraded ; redesigned jobs and even altered production methods to make better use of available workers. Hiring standards were lowered and training programs for both new and previously employed workers were expanded. Particularly in manufacturing employers lengthened the workweek to meet their production schedules But such adjustments become increasingly costly the further they are pushed. Moreover for highly skilled occupations at the extreme professional workers several years are needed to increase the supply. Employers therefore were willing to increase what they would pay for a worker who already met their preferred specifications. The result was a bidding up of wages for scarce skills and a rapid rise in quit rates Competitive market pressures also extended to many low-paid types of labor. Many farm laborers unskilled or semiskilled service workers and factory workers in the low-wage industries were attracted by the jobs opening up in higher wage industries and areas and new entrants to the labor force naturally preferred jobs in the high-wage sectors. Employers in lowwage industries were thus forced to give larger wage increases than other employers in order to hold experienced workers and to recruit new ones Chart Employment in Durable Goods Manufacturing = SEASONALLY ADJUSTED ) n HI niminiinMiiiTiitmitniiittiNtiniI mutt tin FABRICATED METALS AUTOS / \ j /CONSTRUCTION ' MATERIALS ! / PRIMARY METALS I I I I I mi i ill i ii ii n nil ii i I I I n I inn nun I in in in n STRIKE VLUMBER AND WOOD PRODUCTS AND STONE CLAY AND GLASS SOURCES : DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 8o Collective Bargaining Moreover tight labor markets enhanced the bargaining power of organized workers and reduced that of employers. When prices and profits are rising throughout the economy workers expect to receive larger increases than before. Also workers are more willing to strike when jobs have been and are expected to remain plentiful. On the employers ' side wage increases are less vigorously opposed at a time when they can easily be recovered in higher prices. In addition to the market forces that put pressure on wages the rise in consumer prices associated with the strong expansion of demand as well as the high profits of many employers understandably strengthened organized labor 's demands for larger wage increases generally As a result of the changed bargaining situation and of workers ' more militant attitudes more workers struck in than in any year since Also the available information on mediated contracts indicates that in union members voted down a higher proportion of tentative agreements made by their representatives than in other recent years Only a limited number of contracts were negotiated during but they provided for wage increases substantially higher than those obtained in earlier years ( Table ) Moreover the size of wage and fringe benefit gains tended to increase as the year progressed. A number of important negotiations in the second half of the year resulted in compensation gains well above those typical of earlier contracts As a result of deferred wage increases and cost-of-living escalator adjustments wages paid under existing contracts also rose. But these wage gains were substantially lower than the increases obtained from contracts newly negotiated in The median union wage increase ( excluding fringes ) in all nonconstruction contracts new and existing was TABLE Wage changes in major collective bargaining situations Changes in wage rates as percent of straight-time hourly earnings Type of wage change Median of first-year changes negotiated during specified year : All industries.

The available information indicates that the average annual increase in hourly compensation ( wages plus fringe benefits ) in major construction settlements was over 6J/2 percent in both and Compensation The pressures on the labor supply in areas other than manufacturing during the past year resulted in a sharp acceleration in wage rates. As shown in Table the increases in average hourly earnings in the manufacturing industries were exceeded by the gains in most other sectors The substantial wage gains outside manufacturing extended through the whole spectrum of occupations though as noted above the intensity of wage pressures varied widely. Professional and semiprofessional workers were in continued short supply. In fact there was a general shortage of persons with a college education. The salary offers made to graduating college students in increased by about percent compared with an increase of ^ percent in There were also notable wage increases for nurses in many areas in the last half of the year. At the other end of the spectrum wage rates rose rapidly in low-wage service occupations ; and agricultural wages which are generally low rose by a spectacular percent For the entire private economy average hourly compensation including fringe benefits increased * /2 percent ( Table ) About percent was due to increased employer contributions for social insurance.

Because wages are generally higher in the nonfarm sector this shift of workers raises the average level of wages in the private economy. In fact it is the main reason why the over-all gain is so much higher than the gain in the nonfarm sector alone Compensation per man-hour for manufacturing workers rose by percent in a significant increase over the percent average annual gain from to but considerably less than the percent gain for other nonfarm workers. Furthermore much of the acceleration in manufacturing compensation was due to the increased employer contributions for social insurance the rise in overtime work and the relative shift of workers into the higher-wage durable manufacturing sector. In spite of some skill shortages and the rapid increase in general employment manufacturers generally had less difficulty in recruiting than employers in some other sectors because manufacturing wages are relatively high. Of course the small proportion of new union contracts in manufacturing negotiated during also served to hold down wage increases Productivity and Unit Labor Costs Output per man-hour has shown a long-term upward trend but annual advances in productivity often deviate significantly from the trend. The trend rate of growth of productivity largely determines the long-term trend in real wage rates. And the changes in unit labor costs which result from the movements of employee compensation in relation to the movements of productivity play a major role in determining price level movements The long-term advance in output per man-hour is attributable to several factors : an increase in the abilities of the average worker ; additional capital per worker ; technological progress ; and improved management and organization. A major element underlying the increased average quality of the work force has been a steady gain in educational achievement. The expansion of private and Government training programs better health and improved working conditions have also contributed to the efficiency of workers Gains in labor skills have been accompanied by additions to the economy 's stock of productive capital. Business investment has continually provided the average worker with more and better machines to increase the speed accuracy and ease of his production. The rapid pace of technological progress has been made possible through large and increasing investments in research and development Over any reasonably long period of time these changing characteristics of the labor force and the capital stock are the basic determinants of the economy 's total productive capacity and of the productivity of its workers But in the short run much of the fluctuation in productivity is due to cyclical variations in business operating rates. During an expansion as operating rates pick up firms utilize their capital and labor more efficiently Until full capacity is reached output can be increased with little or no increase in overhead labor ( supervisors clerical and maintenance workers etc. ) Furthermore since it is difficult and costly to adjust the work force in response to each fluctuation in demand changes in employment tend to lag somewhat behind production. For these reasons productivity gains are generally higher than average during periods of rising utilization rates However once output begins to press against capacity less efficient equipment is brought into use less skilled labor is hired and employment begins to catch up with output. Productivity gains drop back to and temporarily drop below their long-run rate of increase The substantial and sometimes erratic short-run movements in productivity make it impossible to provide a single unambiguous estimate of the trend in productivity. But a variety of statistical techniques has been used to adjust as completely as possible for the effects of the short-run factors The results for the private economy as a whole consistently indicate a trend rate of increase in real output per man-hour of somewhat over percent a year. The comparable trend for the private nonfarm economy is about half a percentage point lower. Of course the trends themselves are likely to change slowly over time Because of the technological advances in agriculture productivity gains in that sector far exceed those in the nonfarm sector. This accounts in part for the fact that productivity grows faster in the total private economy than in the nonfarm sector alone. An even more important factor is the continuing shift of workers from farming into nonfarm occupations. Although productivity is growing faster in the farm sector average output per man-hour is appreciably higher in the nonfarm sector. When a worker shifts from a farm to. a nonfarm occupation he generally increases his productivity and thus the average productivity in the private economy From to as the economy moved toward full utilization of resources it made more efficient use of its productive plant and overhead labor. As a result output per man-hour rose at a faster rate than the longterm trend ( Table ) By however productivity gains in some sectors began to weaken despite the very rapid growth in output. After some years of rapid expansion the deferred adjustments in employment began to catch up with output. Furthermore in some industries production began to press against capacity and firms were forced to use semi-obsolete equipment run extra shifts hire untrained workers and struggle with supply bottlenecks As output grew at a more moderate pace in firms continued to make adjustments in their work force. Productivity gains remained somewhat below trend in all sectors and there was a further slowdown in manufacturing productivity. After showing strong gains in the first half of manufacturing productivity remained virtually unchanged after midyear. For the year as a whole output per man-hour increased by percent somewhat below the average annual increase in the postwar period Unit Labor Costs Because productivity gains between and were above normal and compensation gains relatively moderate unit labor costs remained essentially stable in that period. Then as productivity gains began to slacken in unit labor costs were held to a modest increase by the slowdown in the growth of compensation per man-hour. For the entire private economy unit labor costs in averaged only percent higher than in In however tight labor markets pushed compensation up more rapidly and there was no surge in productivity to maintain stable costs. As a result unit labor costs rose an average of more than 3y2 percent in the private economy and nearly percent in manufacturing the first appreciable increase during the entire period of expansion Although the rise in unit labor costs in in the crucial manufacturing sector represents a serious break with the earlier record of stability it was well below the increase experienced in every other postwar expansion ( Chart ) Hourly compensation in manufacturing grew steadily and quite rapidly throughout the entire year. From the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of compensation per man-hour increased by nearly percent. Because of the uneven rates of growth of output and productivity most of the rise in unit labor costs in manufacturing was concentrated in the second half of During the first half of unit labor costs rose at a rate of about percent but then accelerated to an annual rate of nearly percent in the second half of the year. Since this sharp upturn was in part a reflection of the very uneven pattern of growth of output during the year it should be regarded as temporary in nature Chart Unit Labor Costs in Manufacturing Since PREVIOUS PEAK = 100J/ SEASONALLY ADJUSTED A / rv / ^ ^ A / ! * * ^ / /ft/ * I ) \ \ is / \ V W ^ J ^ * / V M I MONTHS FROM CYCLICAL TROUGH P = C Y C L I C A L PEAK : JULY JULY AND MAY I960 ^ PREVIOUS PEAKS ARE NOVEMBER JULY JULY AND MAY I960 ^ C Y C L I C A L TROUGHS ARE OCTOBER AUGUST APRIL AND FEBRUARY NOTE.-PERIODS COVERED ARE NOVEMBER 1948-AUGUST JULY 1953-APRIL JULY 1957-FEBRUARY AND MAY 1960-DECEMBER ( LATEST DATA AVAILABLE ) SOURCES : DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM In summary all major sectors of the economy experienced higher unit labor costs during particularly in the latter half of the year. This upswing broke a long record of relative stability. Productivity gains which had been above trend during previous years slowed down in and while the rise of compensation accelerated. The trend of prices described in the following sections could not be insulated from the resulting rise in unit costs PRICES IN MAJOR SECTORS In view of the critical significance of prices in the economic record and in the outlook for a fuller review than usual of the price situation in major sectors is called for in this Annual Report. This review concentrates on four sectors : farm and food products ; raw materials ; manufactured products ; and consumer services FARM PRODUCTS AND FOOD As indicated earlier farm prices rose sharply in and continued to rise during the first three quarters of Prices declined sharply in the final quarter of the year and by December showed little change from a year earlier. However they remained well above the levels of early These increases were reflected at wholesale in the prices of processed foods and at retail in the consumer price index The rise in farm prices was due to the strong expansion of domestic and export demand combined with only slightly increased or in some cases reduced supplies of important farm commodities. Given adequate time for the adjustment of production America 's farmers are capable of expanding total farm output to meet any foreseeable expansion of domestic demand and to provide substantial surpluses for export in most instances at essentially constant costs. To be sure for some highly labor-intensive products particularly dairy products and some fruits and vegetables rising prices may be necessary to attract or hold the necessary labor services. But this is the exception rather than the rule. However an expansion of farm output necessarily takes time ranging from a few months for broilers at least a year for most field crops or years for hogs and even longer for cattle or tree crops. To expand production of some of these commodities also requires changes in Federal farm programs Because of relatively long production cycles supplies of some farm products reflect past rather than current prices. In hog supplies were declining in response to the low prices of and The resulting rise in livestock prices was intensified by strong consumer demand. The price rise which began in continued into early After February supplies began to expand and by December wholesale livestock prices were percent below the unusually high levels of December Meanwhile however grain prices began to rise. At the beginning of grain prices stood percent above their levels of a year earlier During demand had expanded sharply but so had production. In strong domestic demand was supplemented by a jump in exports but total production was essentially unchanged from levels. Export demand was particularly buoyant for wheat as reduced supplies from Argentina and Australia led to a rise in the volume of U.S. exports estimated at about percent Prices for wheat feed grains and soybeans rose sharply during the late spring and summer. The rise was accentuated by speculation based on uncertain crop prospects and the strength of export demand. In the fall harvests having proved somewhat better than had been expected prices for grains and soybeans declined sharply. However grain prices averaged percent higher for December than a year earlier In contrast to both grain and livestock prices dairy prices moved up sharply in the second half of as growing demands were matched with a decline in production. This decline in turn was related to general economic conditions as high beef prices induced farmers to cull and sell dairy cows while excellent off-farm employment opportunities encouraged some farmers to abandon dairying altogether Thus the major factors involved in rising farm product prices in were : ( ) the hog production cycle which led to reduced marketings until mid1966 when numbers shipped began to increase ; ( ) poor weather here and abroad which caused some decline in U.S. production and increased the demand for U.S. wheat exports ; ( ) high cattle prices which resulted in reduction in dairy herds and good employment opportunities which induced farmers to leave dairying ; ( ) strong demand for food based on rising consumer incomes Chart Farm and Food Prices = f ' \ WHOLESALE FARM PRODUCTS 1/ II II I I III I I II III I III I II II II I I1I II IMI I I I 1III I1II I I MII 1II J/FARM PRODUCTS INCLUDE DOMESTIC AND IMPORTED TEXTILE FIBERS TOBACCO AND SOME PRODUCE NOT SUBJECT TO PROCESSING SOURCE : DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Processed Foods and Foods at Retail Changes in food prices at subsequent levels of processing and distribution generally follow changes in the costs of raw farm products. These costs however account for only about percent of the price of delivered foods with the remainder reflecting costs of transportation processing distribution and marketing. Over time these latter costs have risen steadily reflecting in part increases in labor costs and in part higher quality and better packaging As a result even when farm prices are stable food prices especially at retail tend to rise Chart shows the relation between farm and processed food prices and retail food prices. As expected changes in farm product prices are more directly reflected in processed food prices. Changes in retail food prices tend to lag behind farm prices and fluctuate with less amplitude Following the decline in farm prices processed food prices ended the year only slightly above the levels of December But retail prices remained percent above the level a year earlier. The spread between farm and retail food prices narrowed during but then widened late in On the average there is little evidence of an increase in processing and distribution margins. In the months ahead there may be some further decline in retail prices but the rising trend in intermediate costs suggests that a full reversal can not be expected RAW MATERIALS The rise in raw materials prices which began in continued through although the prices of hides secondary copper and softwood lumber which had risen rapidly during and early declined in the last half of the year. Prices rose for a wide range of mineral products including sulphur nickel vanadium and a number of other alloy metals. Some nonmineral raw materials used in industry such as tobacco and wool also rose Over long periods the relative price of mineral products reflects a race between the improvement of the technology of discovery mining and refining and the gradual deterioration in the quality of available ores Despite the fact that use is now made of ores which would have been discarded years ago the average price of minerals has not generally risen relative to other commodities In the short run however sharp increases in demand almost always mean higher prices for both ores and metals. Since it takes several years to develop new mines increased requirements can only be met from inventories and by stepping up output from existing capacity and from an expansion of capacity which is already under way. Once these limits are exceeded as they have been for many of the minerals pressures on price become severe Even when primary producers do not raise their prices or do not raise them enough to balance the market secondary market prices will rise. The initial advance is likely to be accentuated by inventory speculation. Cor- respondingly a relatively small improvement in the supply and demand balance can reverse the speculative movement and produce a sharp decline in price. These characteristics are shared by many nonmineral raw materials The upward pressure on raw materials prices in and reflected the slow response of supply to a sharp increase in demand. It was accentuated by the fact that the increase in demand was heavily concentrated in defense and capital goods which use large amounts of mineral raw materials Random factors such as strikes and interruptions in foreign supplies always influence raw materials prices. Copper and hides were particularly affected by changes in foreign markets. However in the strength of demand and the basically tight supply situation magnified the impact of fluctuations in supplies In the case of copper strong demand drove domestic consumption up by more than short tons from the first half of to the first half of Foreign supplies were reduced by strikes and political disturbances in the principal producing nations. While this loss was largely offset by sales from the government stockpile prices in the United States were influenced by changes in the outlook for foreign supplies. The price of primary domestic copper was not raised significantly until early but the price in the secondary market which supplies about one-third of domestic consumption rose sharply to a peak of nearly $ a pound early in compared with cents for the primary refined metal. It then eased to a range of to cents during the summer and fall The influence of demand pressures was also clearly shown in the case of softwood lumber prices which rose rapidly early in the year under the pressure of rising defense and construction demand and then sank as residential construction declined As indicated below the rise in raw material prices played a significant role in the increase in prices of manufactured products during MANUFACTURED GOODS In contrast to some farm products and raw materials price changes in most manufacturing industries do not reflect an automatic balancing of supply with demand through the operation of impersonal market forces Producers in many industries have some degree of discretion in setting prices although the range of discretion varies with competitive conditions from industry to industry Firms with considerable market power are often able to maintain markups over unit costs that are largely independent of changing market conditions. In other industries the effectiveness of market power is more limited. When utilization rates are low markups often have to be shaded By the same token when demand and capacity utilization rates are high competitive pressures are weakened presenting the opportunity to restore temporarily depressed markups to desired levels or even to raise sights on what is desired. In a few industries market power is insignificant and markups over cost vary widely with demand conditions On the whole the markup of prices over " standard costs " ( based on assumed or standardized capacity utilization ) appears to have been relatively stable in the past few years. Actual costs tend to decline as capacity utilization rises. The general improvement in capacity utilization between and would have produced very substantial increases in profit margins even if prices had been adjusted only enough to maintain a constant markup over costs calculated on a fixed volume. But as markets strengthened some prices were raised even though costs had not increased. And some firms failed to reduce prices even when standard costs were falling After remaining stable from to prices of finished nonfood manufactures rose by percent during and then moved up by percent during Some part of the increase in prices was of course directly attributable to the rise in raw materials prices and unit labor costs But the basic factor underlying the general price rise was the strength of demand and in particular the sharp increase in demand in late and early Though demand pressures can not be measured precisely the relation between capacity utilization and the preferred rate of operation provides a crude measure. Capacity utilization in manufacturing has been increasing since and the average rate in was exceeded only in and in the postwar period. At the end of manufacturing industries were operating at an estimated percent of capacity compared with an average preferred rate of percent ( Table ) The end-of-year capacity utilization was lower than the average for the year as a whole. Even so TABLE Manufacturing Industry capacity utilization Output as percent of capacity December Total manufacturing Iron and steel Nonferrous metals Machinery __ Electrical machinery Autos trucks and parts Other transportation equipment Fabricated metals and instruments _ Stone clay and glass Chemicals Pap Rubber.

Furthermore in of these sectors ( all except nonferrous metals paper and textiles ) operating rates either increased or held steady between December and December The pressure of demand for finished goods is in itself a major element contributing to the rise in wages and in raw materials prices. Translated into a demand for labor it can create shortages which bid up wages or at least strengthen the bargaining power of unions. And after being transmitted through a chain of suppliers and processors the increased production requirements can pull up the prices of raw materials. Thus by forcing up wages and raw materials prices an increase in demand in one sector can raise production costs in other sectors. If aggregate demand is strong producers in these latter sectors will tend to increase their prices to cover the higher costs. Thus while it may at times be useful to describe a price increase in terms of cost factors only or demand factors only in general both elements will be present The direct impact of materials costs is of course most evident for products requiring relatively little fabrication. For example in copper pipe brass fittings and wire prices rose sharply in response to increased copper prices. But the effect of higher costs continued to spread though somewhat more slowly to products at more advanced stages of fabrication. Ultimately increased raw materials prices exercised a pervasive influence on industrial prices although their direct impact was notable in only a few cases. Similarly the rise in unit labor costs in manufacturing eventually influenced prices over a wide range of manufactured goods But without strong demand conditions the rise in prices and costs would not have spread so quickly nor of course been so large Most manufacturing industries were affected to a greater or lesser degree by all these factors rising unit labor and materials costs and pressures on capacity. However in a few cases where demand pressures were conspicuously absent prices did not rise or actually declined. Thus prices of synthetic fibers dropped during because capacity had outrun demand by a considerable margin The machinery industries afford the outstanding example of the problems involved in operations at rates close to full capacity and their reflection in the price movements. The demand for machinery grew rapidly while output was limited by shortages of skilled labor and some types of equipment in part because the machinery sector had to compete with expanding defense production for labor materials and components Spurred by the capital boom of the past years and the sharp rise in defense demands production of machinery expanded by percent between and an average annual growth of more than percent. For the first time in many years both the electrical and the nonelectrical machinery industries were operating in at about their preferred rates and in each segment order backlogs grew by about one-quarter In the nonelectrical sector there appears to have been sufficient plant capacity and manpower to meet the growing demand without much strain until early Then beginning around mid-1965 some segments of the industry especially machine tool producers began to report increasing difficulties in recruiting and training skilled labor. After rising at an average annual rate of only percent between and prices of nonelectrical machinery rose by percent during and then percent during Similar strains on capacity developed in the electrical machinery industry and prices which had been declining for a number of years changed little in and then rose by about percent during Summary The moderate but persistent upward trend in manufacturing prices reflected the interaction of many factors of which the most pervasive was the rapid increase in demand at a time when the economy was operating close to capacity. The actual course of prices varied considerably from industry to industry depending upon the degree to which each was affected by changes in costs of materials supplies fuel and labor the balance between demand at prevailing prices and the capacity to meet that demand without undue strain and the extent and exercise of discretion in the pricing policies of leading concerns On the average the / percent increase in manufacturing prices during was probably about commensurate with the average percentage increase in all elements of cost. This seems a reasonable inference from the over-all profit record in manufacturing. During the first three quarters of after-tax profits for all manufacturing averaged percent of sales the same as in the first three quarters of As a percentage of equity however they were higher percent for the first three quarters of against percent a year earlier CONSUMER SERVICES Since the cost of consumer services has risen at an average rate of about 3J/2 percent a year more than twice as fast as for commodities at retail ; between and the rate of increase was a little over percent a year ; and in it was about 2l/2 percent Between December and December the rate of increase jumped to percent accounting for half the total rise in the consumer price index This acceleration reflected partly an intensification of existing long-run trends and partly the appearance of new factors The services included in the index are a highly diversified group but they can be regarded as comprising three very broad and somewhat over240-782 simplified categories : ( ) rents and utility rates ( ) labor intensive services and ( ) financial charges The behavior of prices in the first of these categories differed little during from earlier trends and increases were relatively small ( Table ) The second group labor intensive services is quite heterogeneous ; but in most cases the scope for significant improvements in productivity is limited and therefore costs and prices are sensitive to changes in wage rates This is true whether the labor involved is relatively highly skilled ( as for professional services repair mechanics barbers and beauticians ) or relatively unskilled ( as for domestic services hotels motels or laundry and dry cleaning ) As already indicated wage increases in the service industries accelerated during This was also true of fees for professional services. The resulting rise in personnel costs was aggravated in some instances by increases in other cost elements such as commercial rents and hospital equipment While prices for virtually all these services had been rising for years the advance was particularly sharp during Examples are shown in Table The third category of services financial costs had received relatively little attention in the past though property taxes had been rising slowly and property insurance rates more rapidly. Both accelerated considerably during and a major new element was added : mortgage interest rates which had remained quite stable in preceding years rose by percent As shown in Table these higher financial costs accounted for over one-third of the total advance in prices of services during A large part of this advance reflected increased mortgage costs. The fact that the increase in mortgage interest rates had such an impact on prices reflects TABLE Changes in consumer prices for services during Percentage change December to December Type of service Contribution to total change in ( percent ) Interest and property insurance and taxes Public transportation and labor-intensive services Public transportation Medical services Skilled labor services Other2 Rent and utilities- Rent Utilities All services All other services <___ _ ______ _ Includes repair and maintenance services barbers and beauticians Includes hotels and motels domestic services babysitters laundries drycleaning and shoe repair Less than percent Includes postal charges recreational services legal and banking services etc NOTE.

The index is designed to measure the change in prices associated with commitments currently entered into rather than the change in the cost of current expenditures related to commitments entered into in the current and past periods Had weighting been based on current expenditures rather than commitments entered into during the year the increase in the over-all consumer price index would have been about percentage points less There are other difficulties in measuring service prices. Changes in the quality of services are difficult to assess. This is particularly true of medical services because of the progress in medical techniques. It is impossible to make a statistical correction for the changing quality of medical care but it is clear that the cost of a given standard of health care has risen less than the indexes indicate PRICES AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF REAL INCOME The significance attached to price movements varies with the perspective of the observer. A trade association usually reports a price rise for the products of its members as an improvement in prices. But the firms in another industry using those products describe the same price increase as an unfortunate rise in costs. A rise in the price of haircuts is a rise in the cost of living to most of us but it means an increase in income to barbers. Wages are incomes to workers but costs to employers In wages profits and farm incomes all rose rapidly in money terms. But the gains in money income could not have been so large without price increases. Those increases turned very large money gains into smaller though still substantial increases in real income In the nominal increases in hourly compensation were unusually large percent for manufacturing employees and percent for other nonfarm workers. Farm wages rose by percent and net income per farm by percent. But after adjustment for price increases hourly compensation in the nonfarm sector increased by only percent and net income per farm rose by percent. In manufacturing real hourly com pensation rose by less than percent. Because some of that gain represented increased employer contributions to social security real hourly take-home pay for manufacturing workers increased even less for the year as a whole and actually declined between the end of and the end of The disparity between the large nominal gains in hourly compensation and the very moderate increase in real compensation per man-hour in emphasizes again the fact that more can not be taken out of the economy than is produced. On the average labor productivity in the private economy can be expected to increase by somewhat over percent a year. Real hourly compensation can not rise more rapidly than that except at the expense of other incomes. In conditions of strong demand and full utilization of resources a general increase in money wages in excess of productivity growth is more likely to result in a rise in prices than in a corresponding increase in real wages When producers pursue pricing policies designed to increase the share of income going to profits or to maintain that share at excessively high levels this too is likely to be self-defeating. Despite sizable short-run fluctuations due to changing utilization rates the profit share of income has shown no perceptible trend over the long-run ( Chart ) When profits are unusually high they encourage workers to demand higher wages. By pushing up the cost of living the price increases necessary to sustain a high profit share provide further incentive for increased wage demands Thus in price increases were no more successful in raising the profit share than nominal wage increases were in accelerating real wage gains. The share of gross profits in corporate gross income had been rising steadily throughout the expansion. This was of course a normal response to the rise in capacity utilization. The profit share reached a peak in the first quarter of and then despite rising prices began to decline slowly Within the manufacturing sector the decline in profits after the first quarter of resulted in a decline of 1J4 percentage points in the profit share of gross manufacturing income. Nonmanufacturing corporations experienced a similar though less pronounced decline in share The decline in the profit share reversed the upward movement which had continued since That movement was as noted earlier primarily due to the improvement of capacity utilization from the low levels ruling in In spite of the small decline during the corporate profit share remained substantially above the post-Korean average though somewhat lower than in The relatively minor change in the aggregate share of labor income was accompanied by significant differences in the wage gains in particular sectors. In general wages increased more rapidly in the nonmanufacturing sectors than in manufacturing. Construction workers made notable gains as did medical workers from the professional level on down. Other professionals such as teachers enjoyed sizable increases in compensation and trade and service wages continued to advance relatively rapidly Chart Shares of Gross Corporate Income PERCENT OF GROSS CORPORATE INCOMEl/ COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES NET INTEREST J/lNCOME ORIGINATING IN " BUSINESS PLUS CAPITAL CONSUMPTION ALLOWANCES ; BASED ON SEASONALLY ADJUSTED DATA J/CORPORATE PROFITS PLUS INVENTORY VALUATION ADJUSTMENT NOTE.-DATA RELATE TO DOMESTIC ACTIVITY OF NONFINANCIAL CORPORATIONS SOURCES : DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS Of course the most dramatic income movement was the percent gain in real income per farm. The relative improvement in farm income was largely a result of the sharp rise in prices of farm products in and early By the last quarter of farm prices had begun to fall and income per farm declined substantially from the peak in the first quarter. However for as a whole real income per farm still showed a gain of more than one-third over OUTLOOK FOR PRICES While forecasts of price trends are even more hazardous than other forms of economic prediction there is good ground for anticipating that will witness progress toward greater price stability. That view is based on the expectation reviewed in Chapter that the growth of the real GNP in will not exceed the growth of productive resources Average wholesale prices in the farm and food sector should be relatively stable if weather is normal with advances for some items approximately balanced by reductions for others. However retail food prices will probably continue to rise although more slowly than in The sharp increase in mortgage interest rates which significantly affected the average level of consumer service prices in should not be repeated in Costs for medical care will continue to increase and prices of other labor intensive services may also rise although less rapidly Demand pressure on manufacturing prices should be significantly reduced in With capacity increasing by an estimated percent there will be a slight reduction in average capacity utilization as well as a better balance among industries. A small decline in manufacturing capacity utilization may have an adverse effect on productivity in some industries but in others such a decline will reduce the need to use obsolete facilities. Moreover the large amount of new capital coming into use should improve productivity The movement of employment costs will be affected by a number of conflicting factors. The pressure of demand on wages in unorganized labor markets will be somewhat weaker. Although employment will grow in pace with the growth of the labor force the balance between the skills in demand and those available will improve. However there will be continued upward pressure on the compensation of some groups of professional and technical workers. At the other end of the scale the scheduled increase in minimum wage rates will raise employment costs in some sectors During negotiated wage settlements had only a limited influence on the over-all movement of employment costs. In the average size of negotiated wage increases will tend to increase and the number of workers affected will also be larger. These increases will have a significant influence on the costs of the particular industries involved. However only about million workers less than percent of all private employees will be involved in this year 's wage negotiations. Consequently taken by itself the direct and immediate effect of higher union wage settlements will be relatively small. However increases obtained by organized workers tend to pull up the wages of unorganized workers in the same labor market. This process will broaden the impact of union settlements on wages and costs in and will continue to affect wage costs for a much longer time The increase in employer contributions for social security in will be much smaller than in That will more or less offset other factors tending to push up the rate of increase of hourly employment costs Unit labor costs will doubtless continue to rise this year. But with greater stability in the farm and food sector and with less acute demand pressures in product markets the rise in the general price level in should be more moderate than in Chapter Maintaining Price Stability and Reducing Unemployment T HE OUTPUT AND EMPLOYMENT gains of brought the U.S. unemployment rate to the lowest point since But these gains were accompanied by the fastest rise of prices since Once again after years of absence an old set of questions reappeared : ( ) How far can unemployment be reduced without inflation ? ( ) If there is a " trade-off " between lower unemployment and price stability how do we choose between them ? ( ) What ways are available to change the terms of such a trade-off ; how can we reduce unemployment further and maintain reasonable price stability ? An analysis of recent U.S. experience throws some light on these important questions but it provides no simple answers The remarkable economic record of the years demonstrates clearly that when surplus labor and plant capacity abound fiscal and monetary policies to expand demand can reduce unemployment substantially and at stable prices. But in as unemployment hovered just below percent of the labor force prices rose at a clearly unacceptable rate. As shown in Chapter some of this rise can be attributed to temporary and nonrecurring factors. Some was the result not of getting to percent unemployment but of getting there too fast. There is good reason to expect that this year an expansion of production which will hold unemployment at the present level will be consistent with a substantially smaller price advance. Nevertheless the experience of clearly suggests that expanding demand can not lower the unemployment rate much below the present level without bringing an unacceptable rate of price increase. Under present conditions an over-all unemployment rate close to percent appears to be associated with an approximate balance between supply and demand in most labor markets. A higher level of demand for goods and services would create inflationary pressures in both product and labor markets If the economy is now in the range of trade-off between falling unemployment and rising prices then the second question above needs to be faced : how should we rank the advantages of fuller employment against the disadvantages of rising prices ? In a meaningful sense any involuntary unemployment is too much Ideally everyone who wants work should be able to find it. To tolerate any unemployment other than temporary means subjecting individuals to concentrated hardship both economic and psychological. On the other hand it is clear that the overwhelming majority of Americans would also say that any rise of prices is too much. Rising prices create hardships for those on fixed incomes or with savings fixed in money value and windfalls for others. Moreover more than a very slow rise of prices can create economic distortions that threaten continued prosperity. And a significant rise in prices would surely worsen the U.S. balance of payments not only in the short run but for some time to come. Surely at the present juncture when the payments balance remains in persistent deficit inflation could undermine the ability of the United States to carry out its objectives around the world Faced with a desire for both lower unemployment and price stability the third question thus becomes the really relevant one : How can the terms of the trade-off between lower unemployment and greater price stability be altered ? This chapter does not attempt to deal with all of the answers to this question ; but it deals with three First the pattern of skills and related attributes of the unemployed can be more closely adapted to the pattern which employers seek ; and the functioning of the labor market can be improved so that qualified workers and suitable vacancies can be brought together more expeditiously Second all Government policies affecting markets for goods and services can be directed toward the objective of achieving general price stability in an economy with sustained full employment Third producers and labor unions can learn to use their market power more responsibly Public policies to improve the performance of labor and product markets and private policies of voluntary restraint in price and wage decisions will together enable the American economy to move gradually in the coming years toward lower unemployment with stable prices IMPROVING U.S. LABOR MARKETS During each of the three recessions since unemployment rose sharply then returned to a rough plateau at about percent in percent in and 5J/2 percent in There were many who read into this record an ominous and irreversible trend toward ever higher rates of unemployment even in " prosperity. " Profound structural changes in the economy during the 's they argued had rapidly and radically altered the pattern of the demand for labor. The new pattern was not matched within the ranks of the labor force This thesis found many supporters in early when with an unemployment rate of about percent a new national administration was deter- IOO mining its economic targets and the means to achieve them. Most economists advising the new Administration argued that an adequate increase in the total demand for goods and services could restore unemployment to moderate levels. The advocates of the structural change thesis agreed that more demand for goods and services would create more job openings but predicted that before unemployment was reduced very much the economy would experience serious labor shortages and a resulting inflation of wages and prices It is obvious now if it was not obvious in that there were then plenty of unemployed workers available to fill almost every job that could be created by a general expansion of demand. Labor shortages except in a few professional areas were only a distant threat. Chapter has shown how the long economic expansion that began in produced a sharp and steady decline in unemployment. But as the unemployment rate approached percent in late and dipped below it in early significant labor shortages appeared Shortages of professional and subprofessional personnel in medicine and education which have existed for a number of years continued and were intensified. New shortages appeared in a number of highly skilled occupations particularly in defense and capital goods industries. And there was a more general excess demand for workers who could fully meet employers ' minimum standards for work experience and education. To be sure employers lowered hiring standards and expanded training activities significantly and made numerous other adjustments of the kind outlined in Chapter But the rapid expansion of the demand for labor strained the capacity of employers to adapt their employment requirements to the characteristics of the available labor force or through training or other means to adapt the available labor force to the requirements of the vacant jobs The unemployment remaining today is not of the same character as that of Plans for further reduction of unemployment must be geared to the nature of the present problem. This requires a careful examination of the composition of today 's unemployed COMPOSITION OF THE UNEMPLOYED Unemployment rates for almost every category of workers have been sharply reduced in recent years ; yet the incidence of unemployment by occupations by age by sex and by other characteristics is still highly uneven. By occupation rates in varied from percent for nonfarm laborers to percent for professional and technical workers ( Table ) By age unemployment rates were high for teenagers very much lower among workers aged and still lower among older workers. Rates for women at all ages were higher than for men ( Table ) The pattern of unemployment rates by age and sex for nonwhite workers was similar to that for white workers. But unemployment among nonwhite workers was IOI TABLE Unemployment rates by major occupation groups and [ Percent * ] Occupation group Total Farm workers : Farmers and farm managers Farm laborers and foremen _ Service workers : Private household workers Other service workers __ Blue-collar workers : Craftsmen and foremen Operatives Nonfarm laborers White-collar workers : Professional and technical workers Managers officials and proprietors except farm Clerical workers. _ Sales workers i Number of unemployed in each group as percent of labor force in that group ; data relate to persons years of age and over Source : Department of Labor TABLE Unemployment by age sex and color Unemployment Group Number ( thousands ) Total _-_ Teenagers ( years of age ) : Males White Nonwhite Females.

As total unemployment has fluctuated these relative patterns of unemployment rates have been fairly stable ( Chart ) Unemployment averaged million persons in ( the latest year for which the following data are available ) but more than million or percent of all persons who were in the labor force at some time during the year experienced some unemployment. Most of those unemployed were out of work only once during the year and then only briefly. But percent had two spells of unemployment and nearly percent had three or more Much of the unemployment during the years through was the result of an inadequate total demand for goods and services. This is sometimes referred to as " cyclical " unemployment ; but since a large part of it persisted through the post-recession expansions of and the cyclical label is clearly unsatisfactory With the virtual elimination of cyclical unemployment in most of that which remains can usefully be described as either " frictional " or " structural. " But these terms are not entirely precise ; often a particular Chart Unemployment Rates PERCENT31 MEN I I I I I I * PERCENT OF CIVILIAN LABOR FORCE IN EACH GROUP SOURCE : DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IO3 I worker who is without a job can not easily be classified as either frictionally or structurally unemployed. Moreover whenever there is also unemployment that is due to inadequate demand it becomes impossible in many cases to say which particular workers are unemployed for frictional structural or cyclical reasons. It is obvious for instance that not all unskilled workers or older workers who were unemployed in were structurally unemployed ; very large numbers of them found jobs in the subsequent period of expansion. The reason why many of the unskilled workers or older workers who were without jobs in could be called structurally unemployed is not that they were necessarily different from those millions of unskilled or older workers who were at work. Rather in many cases more unskilled workers could be hired only if employers could readily find the necessary complement of skilled workers who were in relatively short supply. There is no need for construction laborers if construction is held up by the absence of bricklayers or pipefitters. But a great many of the " structurally unemployed " have characteristics that make employers reluctant to hire them except under conditions of rather severe labor shortage " FRICTIONAL " UNEMPLOYMENT Even in an economy characterized by steady high-level employment some involuntary unemployment is bound to occur. New workers need time to find jobs even when jobs are available. Continuous changes in the composition of demand cause fluctuations in the output and manpower requirements of individual plants though the total level of demand in the economy may be growing steadily. There are seasonal variations in activity in many sectors of the economy such as construction recreation and agriculture. The secondary effects of strikes in some plants or industries may cause workers in other plants or industries to be laid off temporarily Whether unemployment from these causes is called or in fact is frictional depends on whether the workers involved have the skills and other characteristics to qualify for available jobs and on the availability of jobs In more than percent of the unemployment among men over nearly percent of the unemployment among women over and percent of unemployment among teenagers was associated with either entry reentry or voluntary job change. Workers entering the labor force found jobs more quickly than in ; but the number entering was also considerably greater. As a result unemployment associated with these causes changed little. Since unemployment from other causes declined the proportion of total unemployment associated with entry and job change increased during In most cases unemployment due to entry or reentry is of short duration ; but a small percentage of new entrants may not be able to find their first jobs for some months. They account for a substantial fraction of the total unemployment associated with entry The primary reason why unemployment rates are consistently higher for teenagers and women than for male adults is the higher proportion of teenagers and women who are new entrants or reentrants into the labor force Moreover the voluntary turnover rate of young workers is particularly high as they often try several jobs in search of one they like The rising trend of unemployment rates among teenagers relative to other workers in recent years reflects the further fact that the size of the teenage labor force which had been stable or contracting in the early postwar period more recently has been sharply expanding. New entrants obviously make up a larger proportion of the teenage labor force when that force is rapidly growing. Thus in when the over-all unemployment rate was percent teenage unemployment averaged percent. At that time the total teenage labor force was actually declining slightly. The higher teenage unemployment rate of percent in largely reflected the fact that the teenage labor force is now increasing rapidly by percent in The rising proportion of women in the labor force also tends to increase the amount of unemployment associated with entry reentry and departure A rather high rate of voluntary turnover is an important characteristic of the restless mobile American worker compared with workers in most other countries. Moreover voluntary turnover rises as labor markets tighten and workers feel more secure in their ability to find other jobs. Of course not all voluntary job changes involve any intervening unemployment. While frictional unemployment associated with causes other than entry and turnover is substantial no useful data regarding its extent are available Frictional unemployment could be reduced somewhat if the demand for labor were to continue to expand more rapidly than the normal growth of the labor force. Workers in seasonal occupations would find it easier to obtain other jobs in their off season. New entrants to the labor force would find first jobs somewhat more quickly. There would be fewer temporary layoffs to " adjust inventories. " Such a reduction of frictional unemployment would not only make jobs easier to find but it would also make job vacancies more widespread. Frictional unemployment might be reduced ; but only by a further tightening of labor markets creating greater upward pressure on wages and prices It is impossible to eliminate frictional unemployment completely and undesirable to try. The efficient allocation of labor depends on the movement of experienced workers to better jobs. The frequent entry and reentry of women into the labor force in response to improving job opportunities is an important source of flexibility. The interval between leaving school and the first job could be reduced although it can not be entirely closed in all cases. The freedom to change jobs if only for the sake of variety is a right that Americans cherish. The seasonally of many types of activity can be reduced but not eliminated. And the rapid pace of technological change that contributes to the rapid advance of living standards also requires some involuntary job changes. Yet there are ways to reduce frictional unemployment without increasing the tightness of job markets IMPROVING THE OPERATION OF LABOR MARKETS Unemployed workers often fail to find vacancies which they are capable of filling because they are unaware of such vacancies because they are in the wrong location or because of artificial job entrance requirements The U.S. Employment Service and its affiliated State employment services perform an important function by bringing jobs and workers together and thus reducing frictional unemployment. During recent years they have sought to improve their effectiveness in matching jobs and men through improving the quantity and quality of their job market information ( including the experimental development of job vacancy data ) and through more effective dissemination of this information to job seekers employers schools and community groups ; through working more closely with employers to alleviate occupational shortages and to meet defense manpower needs ; and through developing an experimental automated system for matching available jobs with characteristics of applicants in both interarea and interstate recruitment. They have also sought to improve their service to disadvantaged workers through cooperating with Community Action agencies and other community groups through sending mobile teams to rural and smaller urban areas through making greater efforts to reach the disadvantaged in slum sections of metropolitan areas and through Youth Opportunity Centers. A detailed report on methods for improving the effectiveness of public employment services has recently been made by a public Task Force on the Employment Service. Legislation will be proposed incorporating many of the recommendations of this report General expansion in the economy has reduced unemployment remarkably in many areas formerly considered to be " depressed areas. " Nevertheless a few areas of regional depression or underdevelopment remain. The activities of the Department of Commerce under the Economic Development Act and of the Appalachian Regional Commission established in are continuing to assist such areas in developing new industries by providing loans public works technical assistance and manpower training Whenever the effects of general prosperity and of new development programs can not promise adequate local employment for all workers migration of workers is clearly called for. Often those who should migrate in order to find jobs either fail to do so sometimes because of financial inability or move with inadequate knowledge of where jobs are available for which they might be suited. The Department of Labor has operated an experimental program of relocation allowances and relocation counseling the results of which need to be thoroughly evaluated in order to determine how relocation assistance might usefully become an expanded element in U.S. manpower policies. Relocation programs appear to have been highly successful in reducing frictional unemployment in several other countries " STRUCTURAL " UNEMPLOYMENT During nearly million workers were unemployed for more than weeks during the year and about million of those workers were unemployed for weeks or more but of course not all at the same time These million workers accounted for nearly two-thirds of the total number of man weeks of unemployment. On the basis of monthly data on the long-term unemployed it can be estimated that the number of workers who lost or more weeks of work during fell to about million. Of that number about million workers were unemployed for more than consecutive weeks over twice the number of persons appearing in the monthly statistics of long-term unemployment. An additional million workers lost at least weeks of work in several spells of joblessness. Workers experiencing severe unemployment are found most frequently among farm and nonfarm laborers operatives and service workers generally the least skilled. By industries long-term unemployment is most heavily concentrated in agriculture construction mining entertainment and recreation food and kindred products manufacturing and private households Several of these sectors have a strongly seasonal character Classified by their demographic characteristics those most exposed to severe unemployment were youths out of school nonwhite workers or older workers. Each of these groups suffers from some special disadvantage Over-all unemployment rates for older men are relatively low because they do not leave jobs readily and seniority often protects them from layoff or dismissal. But older workers who do become unemployed because of plant closings or relocations or technological change often have severe problems in finding new jobs. They are less mobile than new workers ; it is often more difficult for them to learn new skills ; and the cost of training is higher per year of their remaining working career. Employers may also have to assume higher pension costs when they employ older workers Nonwhite workers suffer from discrimination as well as from the poor education and lack of skills which are in large measure the result of past discrimination. Some ghetto areas are located far from areas of expanding employment in the same metropolitan complex and transportation facilities are often inadequate. Nonwhite teenagers make up a large proportion of the out-of-school youths unemployed for long periods. They suffer the disadvantages of other nonwhite workers. Like all teenagers in this group many can not get jobs because they have little or no work experience and can not get experience because they can not get jobs Other concentrations of long-term unemployment are found in depressed areas or areas where job opportunities for workers with particular skills are no longer available Many individuals with serious unemployment problems suffer personal disadvantages which make it difficult for them to get or hold jobs even in a tight labor market. Special studies of the unemployed in ghetto areas indicate that many of the long-term unemployed are functionally illiterate Many fail entrance tests for military service. Poor health and physical defects are common. Some are mentally retarded or physically handicapped. Some suffer from emotional instability. Others have prison records. Many have poor work habits and lack motivation and discipline They lose jobs because of absenteeism tardiness and inability to follow instructions. Some are younger workers who are unwilling to take low paying " dead-end " jobs but lack the patience discipline or opportunity to acquire training for better ones While an expansion in the number of jobs available would surely cause some reduction in unemployment among these workers it is clear that many of them will not be steadily employed except under conditions of severe and general labor shortage until a heavy investment has been made in improving their skills and education and in helping them to solve their personal problems A concentrated attack on the causes of " structural " unemployment is obviously essential if we are to move toward continually lower unemployment while maintaining reasonable stability of prices. However this statement of the need for attacking these social problems is obviously far too narrow We need to attack discrimination not only because it stands in the way of fuller utilization of our economic potential but because it is morally wrong We would need to assist the handicapped and the disadvantaged even if we were not able to lower the over-all unemployment rate in order to make it possible for them to compete on more equal terms for whatever jobs are available. We need to open the doors of opportunity for individual development and self-fulfillment through useful employment .even if we should conclude that on purely economic grounds it would be cheaper merely to provide guaranteed incomes regardless of contribution to production FEDERAL MANPOWER TRAINING In recent years the Federal Government has launched a major effort to provide training and retraining designed to develop the large reservoir of unused or underutilized talent in the labor force with emphasis on the disadvantaged. These include the Manpower Development and Training Act ( MDTA ) Job Corps Neighborhood Youth Corps Work Experience the Office of Economic Opportunity ( OEO ) Adult Work Program and the OEO Special Impact Program for retraining and employing residents of blighted urban areas. The distribution of trainees for the last and the currentfiscalyear is shown in Table Under the MDTA program persons were enrolled in training for productive employment in fiscal ; and from its inception in through December persons were enrolled in training for occupations. The typical MDTA trainee was a white male high school graduate. Only one-third of the trainees were from the disadvantaged groups that form the bulk of the hard-core unemployed. Experience under the Act has led to an altered program emphasis which will ex- TABLE Training opportunities fiscal years Number of trainees ( thousands ) Program Manpower Development and Training Act Program _ Institutional training On-the-job training and other Job Corps Neighborhood Youth Corps : In-school Out-of-school Summer Work experience Adult work program Special impact Estimates Each position may be occupied by more than one person in the course of a training period since trainees often do not occupy positions for the full period Source : Bureau of the Budget pand the highly succesful on-the-job training component and raise to twothirds the proportion of the disadvantaged in MDTA programs particularly older workers displaced by technological change persons in correctional institutions handicapped workers the paroled the illiterate and the young. Special assistance will be given for intensive on-the-job training to prepare disadvantaged persons for jobs with private firms The remaining Federal programs are wholly aimed at the disadvantaged In the Neighborhood Youth Corps program reached needy students who received an average of $ of aid fronr iri-school and summer programs which helped them to continue in school and youths no longer in school who received an average of months of training. Since its inception the Job Corps has provided training and work experience for of the most disadvantaged youths. When first enrolled more than percent of Job Corps enrolles fail to read at the 5th grade level and percent can not read a simple sentence. Despite this handicap the retention rate for the Job Corps is superior to that of vocational training programs nationally. However the difficulty of reaching these hard-core unemployed youth and the need for residential training facilities result in high unit costs Other Training Programs In addition to these programs which emphasize immediate impact the longer-range objective of continuing improvement in available skills is an important component of other Federal programs. This objective underlies Federal support of education ranging from the basic Elementary and Secondary Education Act of and the Higher Education Act of to the more specific Allied Health Professions Personnel Training Act of IO9 About million persons were enrolled in vocational education programs in Although some reorientation of these programs has occurred their occupational distribution continues to stress traditional areas of home economics and agriculture along with office and industrial occupations. It is essential that vocational training programs be more rapidly transformed to conform with the changing pattern of the economy and of its labor requirements. A comprehensive evaluation of the role and effectiveness of vocational education is a necessity for developing sound national manpower policies. The establishment of the Advisory Council on Vocational Education to appraise the results of the Vocational Training Act of is a step in the right direction. Its evaluation and recommendations must be placed in the perspective of the future manpower needs of the Nation and the various alternative methods of meeting these needs The apprenticeship programs operated in cooperation with the Federal Government are more directly focused on providing the skills needed by industry. In the past year workers completed apprenticeship programs primarily in the construction trades. There are currently federally registered apprentices. The completion rate in these programs was percent but many dropouts found other work or returned to school The rapid growth in the demand for skilled craftsmen in factories and construction requires an expansion of apprentice training. However there is some question whether the expanding needs of the construction industry can better be met by traditional apprenticeship training aimed at the production of fully qualified craftsmen rather than by training specialists with a more limited range of skills. A great deal needs to be done to increase the enrollment of minority groups in apprenticeship programs Encouraging signs have been observed in certain major northern cities particularly in the form of cooperation with trade unions and civil rights groups in New York City Cleveland and Chicago but they are only a beginning Issues in Manpower Training The large and rapid expansion of Federal training activities obviously responds to a major need and it is clear that such programs will be and should be further expanded in the years to come. In recognition of this fact it is important that a number of issues be clearly faced ( ) Manpower training has several interrelated objectives. Different kinds of training programs are needed for pursuing each of these objectives and decisions need to be made as to the relative emphasis to be placed on each. Broadly speaking training is needed for three purposes. First training is needed for the disadvantaged who are barely if at all employable without it. Second training or retraining is needed for workers who suffer no special deprivation or disadvantage other than that they lack the IIO specific skills now in demand by employers. This is a need which will continue and increase in an economy marked by rapid technological advance. Third training is needed to help break immediate skill bottlenecks. To the extent that expanded employment of unskilled workers is held back by shortages of special skills breaking these bottlenecks can advance the prospects of noninflationary expansion of total employment The other issues discussed below may be resolved differently depending on which purpose is to be served by a particular training program ( ) The relative responsibilities of public agencies and private employers need to be evaluated. Despite the large expansion of public manpower training private training activities greatly exceed public. Obviously the incentive for employers to provide training varies depending on the nature of the skills involved the character of the industry and the characteristics of the trainees. In many cases no single employer in an industry may have an economic incentive to train workers many of whom will work for his competitors or employers in other industries. Devising special forms of incentive or subsidy which would induce private employers to expand their own training programs is a challenging problem. So far as possible such incentives should avoid rewarding employers for what they are already doing and what is already advantageous for them to do ( ) Further study is needed of the relative merits in public training programs of institutional versus on-the-job training and within institutional training of the contribution that can be made by regular educational institutions of various types ( ) The relative importance to be given to the work and the training aspects of work-training programs needs to be specifically considered There may be clear public purposes to be served in employing the disadvantaged in such programs particularly in the city ghettos whether or not any significant training emerges as a byproduct and even if the jobs have something of a " make-work " character. Advocates of certain types of work-training programs are proposing a system of residual public employment for persons otherwise unemployable with training as one ostensible purpose. Yet the design of a program may be such that many of those initially enrolled are unlikely ever to be prepared to move on to regular jobs. There may well be a useful role for such programs but the issues and purposes involved need to be frankly faced ( ) The proliferation of Federal local government and private training programs often designed to serve the same or overlapping clienteles has led to a number of problems and some inefficiency and duplication particularly at the local level. Recent Federal efforts have been devoted to improving this coordination and good results are being achieved in a number of cities under the leadership of the President 's Committee on Manpower There are also problems of coordinating training activities in local areas with other programs designed to serve disadvantaged groups. There have III also been problems now being resolved of coordinating program planning and management at the national level of the Federal Government ( ) New methods need to be developed for finding reaching and motivating more of the unemployed to undertake training. This requires analysis of incentives such as training bonuses earnings allowances for persons receiving public assistance provision of day care centers for mothers of dependent children training allowances for long-term unemployed who have exhausted their unemployment insurance benefits and many other issues ( ) Most generally a great deal more study and evaluation of the effectiveness of existing training programs is needed. Very little systematic study and evaluation has yet been made of the rapidly expanding Federal activity in this field. Most of the programs are still very new Moreover since some of them are intended to solve problems of special difficulty there is no traditional standard against which to measure effectiveness. It may cost several times as much to prepare an illiterate youth from the slums for employment as it does to improve the skills of a literate adult with previous work experience. Yet the investments may well be equally rewarding for society. The increase in productivity which can result is only one of the economic benefits and the benefits are not only economic. Nevertheless the objectives and benefits should as far as possible be quantified and compared with the costs. This is surely important where alternative programs serve essentially the same objectives. Substantial research is needed on the effectiveness of different and particularly of new training techniques Considerably more knowledge of the population that can benefit from the various kinds of training can help in designing more effective programs The Government plans a large sample survey early in to collect more detailed information on the nature extent causes and concentration of unemployment and poverty throughout the United States. In addition special surveys of ghettos and depressed areas in large metropolitan cities are planned by the Department of Labor. The information will be extremely useful for improving the effectiveness of existing manpower programs and for designing new programs to combat the unemployment and poverty that remain during a period of extended prosperity It is now clear that large sums will be spent for training over a considerable period of years. Because the objectives are vitally important and their attainment costly every possible effort must be made to increase the effectiveness of training programs. The Federal Government will undertake this year an intensive general review and assessment of the Nation 's needs for training and retraining of the effectiveness of various methods of the organization of training efforts and of the relative responsibilities of Government and industry Expanded and improved manpower training both public and private is an essential requirement for achieving further reductions of unemployment in a context of general price stability. Through providing the skills needed by an economy undergoing rapid technological change and helping those who are presently unemployable or only marginally employable to become productive workers manpower training along with improved job placement and job counselling and a reduction of discrimination can permit a more rapid rate of economic growth involving progressively fuller use of human resources. It can help the Nation avoid the painful choice between the two goals of lower unemployment and stable prices. More importantly it serves larger human purposes Although precise targets can not be set for the ultimate minimum level of unemployment or the speed of the downward movement it is clearly unnecessary and undesirable to accept 4-percent unemployment as a permanent objective of U.S. economic policy IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF PRODUCT MARKETS Progress toward the goal of fuller utilization of resources along with price stability will require improving the performance not only of labor markets but of product markets as well Active and vigorous competition offers the strongest defense against the tendency for prices to rise as full utilization of resources is approached When competition is weak profit margins in a prosperous economy are likely to be high. To be sure high profit margins once established make no further direct contribution to rising prices. But to the extent that the higher profit margins of a strong economy are initially achieved through price increases the price level is directly affected. Moreover high profits understandably provide inviting targets for union wage demands. Firms with strong market power may grant large wage increases maintaining their profit margins by raising prices. To minimize such upward ratcheting of the price structure it is essential to maintain and strengthen the forces of competition wherever possible Government action can improve the operation of product markets in other ways. Effective regulation can increase efficiency and reduce prices for essential utility services. And the numerous programs of the Federal Government which directly or indirectly affect costs or prices can and should be administered in a way which attempts to avoid unnecessary or unintended upward pressure on prices and where possible to alleviate such pressures STRENGTHENING COMPETITION The virtues and benefits of free competition have long been among the fundamental premises of the American system. The dynamic growth and vigor of the U.S. economy and this country 's position of industrial leadership in the world have in good part reflected the emphasis which public policy has placed on encouraging and strengthening competition The promotion of competition reflects values other than purely economic ones and economic values other than those related strictly to costs and prices. However one principal reason why competition in product markets is supported is that it spurs firms to control or reduce costs and insures that the benefits of cost stability or cost reduction are passed on to consumers The intensity of competition among the firms producing a given line of products or services varies widely among the many sectors of the American economy. In many lines individual firms have virtually no control over prices. Their product prices are set by the market in almost the same way as are prices for soybeans or livestock. At the other extreme there are sectors where strong market power makes it possible for firms to establish prices which yield good profits even when capacity utilization is low and rapidly expanding profits as utilization rates move up. In many other product lines producers have some degree of market power the effectiveness of which varies with the state of capacity utilization The market power of firms is limited not only by the competition of existing rival producers of the same product but also though again in varying degrees by the potential entry of new producers ( sometimes including the industry 's own customers ) and by competition from producers of other products and services. In today 's world of rapid technological change completely new products or services often produced by firms in another industry may provide the strongest competition for established products ( for example plastics with metals automatic washers with laundries television with movies ) The intensity of competition has been substantially increased in recent years by the growth of international trade and the gradual reduction of barriers to such trade. U.S. firms seek markets all over the world and foreign firms are increasingly active in U.S. markets Actual and potential competition is a powerful force restraining unnecessary price increases promoting product improvement and inducing firms to seek efficiency and to find new methods for producing at lower cost The effectiveness of competition is maintained and increased through vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws It is essential to apply the law against collusion among competitors to fix prices or to share markets. Antitrust efforts are also designed to combat practices which strengthen market power through reducing the number of firms in an industry which erect artificial barriers to the entry of potential competitors which delay the introduction of superior products or cost reducing techniques or which serve to blunt the effectiveness of competitive price changes. Such practices raise prices for consumers or reduce the quality of goods which people can buy The antitrust statutes assume particular importance in an economy operating near the limits of its capacity. Their vigorous enforcement can counter a possible inflationary bias in product markets by sustaining and strengthening competition. Antitrust activities should continue to be fo- cused on this main purpose. In particular effective antitrust can not provide for the protection of individual competitors at the expense of the protection of competition In some areas unfortunately the thrust of protective efforts has been diverted. For example during the early 's many States acted to restrict competition in the field of retail distribution when the pervasive economic distress bankrupted many small firms and threatened countless others with failure. Relief was sought and frequently obtained in the form of restrictions on the pricing policies of larger and more efficient firms especially chain stores and mail order houses RESALE PRICE MAINTENANCE Resale price maintenance is such a device largely born in the 1930Js which can impair the competitive forces of free markets. It permits the manufacturer of a branded product to enter into agreements with one or more retailers in a State establishing a minimum resale price for that product. These agreements then become binding on all retailers in that State regardless of whether they have signed them. Today resale price maintenance laws are on the books of States but as the result of a series of adverse legal decisions the nonsigner clause has been nullified in some States and the laws are now fully effective in less than States. In those States firms entering into and affected by price maintenance agreements are exempted from the Federal antitrust statutes as a result of amendments adopted for that specific purpose. In recent years proposals have been made in Congress to amend further the antitrust laws so as to exempt resale price maintenance agreements from the antitrust laws throughout the United States. The Administration has consistently opposed such legislation Resale price maintenance permits manufacturers to guarantee attractive margins to retailers in order to encourage them to promote their products rather than those of competitors. But by providing a shield from competition price maintenance agreements often raise prices to consumers. Moreover they can induce the development of excess capacity in some branches of retailing as well as blunt price competition in manufacturing industries dominated by a small number of large firms While resale price maintenance is used for many products including household appliances cosmetics beverages and many other items it is most extensively used in the sale of pharmaceutical supplies and proprietary drugs. Because of the adoption of Medicare and the growing public concern with improvement in health standards it is particularly important to evaluate the impact of resale price maintenance for this group of products A basic purpose of the antitrust laws is the maintenance of a market system in which many firms can operate effectively. But protection of inefficient firms is not a purpose of the antitrust laws. A small number of very large firms will not dominate retail markets in a competitive environment For one thing entry costs in retailing are typically low so that any attempt " to seize and hold a dominating market share in any major retail market would be futile Whatever the case may have been in the 's for depression-born modifications of the basic competitive philosophy that case does not apply in today 's and tomorrow 's expanding economy. In a healthy and viable market economy effective competition will inevitably see some enterprises falter and go under. But vigorous new firms will be created and those with effective managements will survive prosper and grow. Prices in markets protected from competition will be higher on the average and less responsive to changes in economic conditions and consumer demands RESTRICTIONS ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE Foreign competition can be as effective as domestic competition in forcing producers to hold down costs and prices. This is one of the reasons why for many years U.S. policy has been directed toward a free and open world trading system with a minimum of restrictions on the flow of goods and services across national boundaries. In such a system the spur to specialization and productivity which is provided by international competition serves not only U.S. commercial interests but those of the U.S. consumer as well While the reduction of trade barriers will in time benefit all it can raise temporary problems for both industry and labor. These problems are obviously considerably less serious during periods of full employment Nevertheless they exist even then. The burden of these problems can be reduced in several ways. First barriers to trade can be relaxed gradually The tariff cuts expected under the Kennedy Round will be made over a 5-year period. Second where an industry or its workers or both are seriously injured through a reduction of protection they can either receive renewed protection from import competition through an " escape clause " action or they can qualify for " adjustment assistance " temporary financial and other assistance to help them adjust to the new situation. The latter approach is to be preferred since the costs to the economy of such support are generally considerably lower than those of trade restrictions and the assistance deals with the underlying problem rather than with its symptoms. The President recently lifted escape clause protection on watches which had been in effect since and reduced it for glass REGULATORY POLICIES Some major sectors of the economy are subject to extensive Government regulation. In these sectors where competition is not considered feasible because of the wastes of duplicative service regulation substitutes for competition in keeping prices reasonable and service adequate. These regulated industries are vitally important ; they not only originate about one-fifth of the national income but they include the very sinews of a modern economy electric power communications and transportation. The markets and technologies of these industries are subject to the forces of persistent change which requires that existing policies be continually reexamined The broad issues are often the same as for the nonregulated sectors. Regulation like other Government policies must not be diverted to protecting the established positions of particular firms or industries at the expense of economic efficiency. Nor must excessive reliance on uniform prices preclude the use of price differences to achieve the best use of capital intensive technologies. Finally regulatory policy must not forego the possibilities of introducing competition when technological change makes this economically desirable A vigilant program of regulation makes a special contribution to price stability by holding the prices of essential utility services at the lowest levels consistent with their costs ( including necessary profits ) thereby helping directly to stabilize or reduce the cost of living and the costs of other businesses. The opportunities for price reduction are particularly promising because of the special economic characteristics of at least some of the regulated industries. In several of them a high elasticity of demand ( price reductions increase volume greatly ) coexists with large economies of scale ( increased volumes lower unit costs ) As a result significant price reductions may sometimes be achieved with little adverse effect on profits and in some cases with a favorable effect Further public utilities communications and some sectors of transportation have experienced particularly rapid productivity gains. In some cases wage increases have exceeded those elsewhere in the economy and may well have been inconsistent with the standards for wage-price behavior discussed in the next section In these circumstances regulation is not adequate if it merely protects consumers against excessive price increases. It must be alert to make certain that the economy realizes the opportunities for lower prices and improved service. In so doing of course regulation must vigilantly preserve the strength of the regulated industries and their highly skilled labor force Low prices at the expense of profits insufficient to attract the necessary capital or wages inadequate to attract the necessary labor in the long run benefit no one. Regulation must be flexible to take prompt advantage of changing technology such as new sources of power new channels of communication new modes of transportation and new ways of using old modes At times such innovations will permit the scope of Government regulation to shrink in favor of greater emphasis on competition Well conceived regulatory activities can contribute to the goal of maintaining reasonable price stability in a high level economy moving steadily toward fuller use of its human resources DIRECT GOVERNMENT ACTIONS AFFECTING SUPPLY The rapid expansion of demand during the last half of and the first part of resulted in numerous bottlenecks which impeded the smooth flow of production. In some cases the supply of raw materials especially minerals could not keep pace with the needs of industry. In others an essential piece of equipment could not be delivered promptly. In still others transportation facilities were overloaded. All these impediments naturally aggravated pressure on the prices of either the scarce material or component or the finished product or both Many of these problems could only be alleviated by the passage of time and some still persist. In a considerable number of instances however Government could and did find ways of assisting Scarcities of mineral raw materials were especially prevalent as requirements for military hardware and capital equipment of all kinds rose sharply Increases in domestic production of minerals take considerable time and for many the United States is dependent in whole or substantial part on imports. Fortunately there were substantial supplies of such metals as copper aluminum tungsten vanadium and columbium in the strategic stockpile. As a result of changing military technology the necessary security objectives for some stockpile commodities could be and had been reduced Disposal of the indicated surpluses was phased and accelerated so as to augment the supplies of some of these critically short materials. Thereby many interruptions of production were avoided Another area which received increasing attention during was that of Government procurement. Intensive efforts were made to phase procurement and adjust specifications for both military and civilian purchases so as to minimize the impact on productive facilities and product markets Arrangements were worked out to this end for the closest possible cooperation and consultation between the Department of Defense and the Departments of Commerce and Agriculture The Government also sought to smooth out irregularities in the supply of farm products by appropriate sales of farm commodities from government stocks through judicious programing of the timing of P.L. exports and through the adjustment of the timing of purchases by Government agencies. In response to increased export demands and in order to rebuild depleted stocks the Department of Agriculture adjusted production programs to elicit increased production of wheat feed grain and soybeans during As specific problems developed other possible forms of Government action were explored and taken. Thus the Business and Defense Services Administration of the Department of Commerce was able to expedite delivery of critical items of equipment on a number of occasions. The Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture took steps to increase the cutting of timber in the Northwest. The Interstate Commerce Commission working with the railroads alleviated freight-car shortages by speeding up the turnaround of cars at ports and other delivery points and by pressing for a more appropriate distribution of the cars available n8 It is likely that will bring more problems of this kind though they will not recur in exactly the same form. However the experience of demonstrates that Government can make a significant contribution to smoothing the flow of production and thereby lessening pressures on prices WAGE-PRICE POLICIES Vigorous competition is essential to price stability in a high employment economy. But competitive forces do not and can not operate with equal strength in every sector of the economy. In industries where the number of competitors is limited business firms have a substantial measure of discretion in setting prices. In many sectors of the labor market unions and managements together have a substantial measure of discretion in setting wages. The responsible exercise of discretionary power over wages and prices can help to maintain general price stability. Its irresponsible use can make full employment and price stability incompatible When demand outruns the growth of productive resources prices and wages will rise even in the most highly competitive markets. ( Indeed they may rise faster and farther than where large firms and long-term labor contracts give some degree of stability. ) That kind of " demand-pull " inflation can be held in check by fiscal and monetary policies which keep demand in line with productive capabilities. If labor markets are efficient control of demand-pull inflation will not require restraints on demand that would lead to a high unemployment rate But businesses and unions can push prices up even when resources are not fully utilized. That kind of " cost-push " inflation too can be controlled by lowering demand but only at the cost of an unacceptable degree of economic slack. Frequent recessions chronically high unemployment idle capacity and a low rate of investment may purchase price stability but the cost is too high The problem of cost-push inflation has been a matter of concern in this country and abroad ever since the end of World War II. Shortly after the war when many governments including our own declared their determination to maintain high employment many economists predicted that the irresponsible exercise of market power in an era of high employment would lead to progressively faster rates of inflation These fears were exaggerated. But cost-push inflation has been a problem in many countries. A number of them have adopted formal " incomes policies " as a means of limiting inflation. In the United States efforts to influence the general level of prices through a national wage-price policy have emerged gradually during the period since World War II These efforts have relied on education persuasion and voluntary coopera- tion. For example the Economic Report of the President ( pp. ) included the following paragraphs : A further responsibility of leaders of management and labor in a free economy derives from the fact that concentrations of power place in their hands the ability to take actions that through the sensitive network of our economic system significantly affect the Nation as a whole Specifically business and labor leadership have the responsibility to reach agreements on wages and other labor benefits that are fair to the rest of the community as well as to those persons immediately involved. Negotiated wage increases and benefits should be consistent with productivity prospects and with the maintenance of a stable dollar. And businesses must recognize the broad public interest in the prices set on their products and services In the introduction to his Economic Report ( p. v ) President Eisenhower wrote : Business managements must recognize that price increases that are unwarranted by costs or that attempt to recapture investment outlays too quickly not only lower the buying power of the dollar but also may be self-defeating by causing a restriction of markets lower output and a narrowing of the return on capital investment. The leadership of labor must recognize that wage increases that go beyond over-all productivity gains are inconsistent with stable prices and that the resumption of economic growth can be slowed by wage increases that involve either higher prices or a further narrowing of the margin between prices and costs These injunctions were given more precise content in the " Wage-Price Guideposts " of the Report of the Council of Economic Advisers THE COUNCIL 'S WAGE-PRICE GUIDEPOSTS The Report started from the premise that there are important segments of the economy in which large firms or well-organized groups of employees have some discretionary ability to affect the levels of their prices and wages. Such decisions affect the public interest. An informed public therefore should have standards by which to judge and by judging to influence those decisions. The Council proposed a set of standards for this purpose as a contribution to public discussion These standards like those more generally described in the statements quoted above are based on certain arithmetical relationships among output per man-hour ( productivity ) wage rates and prices. These relationships show that if wage rates increase in line with output per man-hour prices can be stable while the distribution of income between labor and others contributing to production remains unchanged Since this arithmetic is frequently not understood it will be useful to give an example. If a worker in a particular firm is paid $ an hour $ a week and contributes to the production of units a week output per man-hour is units ( units divided by hours ) and unit labor cost is $ ( $ divided by units ) If for whatever reason output rises by percent to units a week with no extra labor time required output per man-hour is also up percent to units ( units divided by hours ) If the wage rate also rises by percent to $ an hour ( $ a week ) unit labor costs will remain at $ ( $ divided by units ) If the price of the product is unchanged the margin between price and unit I2O labor cost available to pay for others ' contributions to production will be the same. But with percent more units sold the total amount available to pay others including owners will also rise by percent If productivity were to advance at the same pace in every industry the same result would apply to the whole economy. But productivity grows at different rates in different industries. If the wage rate in each industry should rise at the same rate as productivity in that industry the prices of each industry 's products could be stable and the distribution of income between wages and profits would be unchanged both within each industry and in the entire economy. But some wage rates would rise hardly at all while others would rise rapidly. That result would clearly be unsatisfactory for after a time workers with similar skills in different industries would be receiving widely different wages Alternatively the yearly percentage increase in hourly wages and fringe benefits in each industry could be the same equal to the average yearly percentage rise in output per man-hour over the whole economy. Then the average of unit labor costs in the whole economy would be stable although rising in some industries and declining in others. If prices in each industry were to change correspondingly rising in some and falling in others they too would be stable on the average. The sharing of gross income between labor and ownership would then be unchanged in each industry and for the economy as a whole. This is the arithmetic which underlies the Council 's guideposts The advance of productivity from year to year is far from uniform even though its general trend is reasonably clear. The Report related the guideposts to the trend of productivity over a period of years rather than to year-to-year changes. This meant that the rise in average hourly wages and fringes should be steady and smooth not erratic. Moreover the problem of trying to estimate the particular movement of average productivity over the period to be covered by a given wage agreement was avoided Consequently profits would vary with short-run movements in productivity ; and the stable distribution of income between labor and ownership would then be achieved only on the average over a period of years The Wage Guidepost The Report proposed as a general rule that hourly labor compensation should advance in accordance with the trend increase in productivity in the entire economy. No specific estimate was given of that trend although a summary of statistical evidence on the long-run growth of output per man-hour was provided The general guidepost rule was subject to various exceptions some explicitly stated and others only suggested. The stated exceptions were these : In the interest of equity wages of workers who are underpaid because of weak bargaining power ( or other reasons ) should rise faster than the average while wages of workers who are overpaid because of exceptionally strong bargaining power should rise more slowly than the average. In the interest of efficiency wages should rise somewhat faster than the average in industries with a rapidly growing employment ( in order to aid recruitment ) and more slowly in industries with labor surpluses. Moreover workers who contributed to an extra rise in their own productivity for example by consenting to the relaxation or removal of restraints on the freedom of their employers to change work rules or introduce new methods should be allowed to share in the benefits of that extra productivity gain The Report suggested without listing them that there were other factors which could justify deviations from the general rule. One such factor may be the recent history of wage movements : if wages for one group of workers have increased faster than the productivity trend in the recent past they should rise more slowly now and vice versa. Moreover there might be occasions for the removal of glaring inequities between wages in different plants areas or occupations which although they created no immediate labor supply problems might do so in the long run if not corrected. Presumably this would be accomplished both by slower increases for the favored groups as well as by faster increases for the disadvantaged No reference was made to any deviation from the general rule because of a rise in consumer prices an issue to be discussed below If the wage guidepost were generally observed by organized groups of workers with discretion over their wage rates and there were no excess demand in the economy the Report assumed that compensation in unorganized sectors would rise at the same average rate equal to the gain in over-all productivity. If this were the case then hourly wages plus fringes in all industries would rise by about the same percentage and by about that same percentage every year. The average of unit labor costs in the economy Would be unchanged in the average year But unit labor costs would not be unchanged in each industry. In some industries in which the trend of productivity exceeded the general average unit labor costs would show a downward trend. In others where the trend of productivity was below the over-all average unit labor costs would show an upward trend The Price Guidepost The general guidepost rule for prices was that in industries in which the trend of productivity about equaled the average for the economy prices should be stable ; in industries in which the trend of productivity was steeper than the average prices should fall ; and in industries in which the trend of productivity was below the average prices could appropriately rise It has been noted however that the over-all productivity gain of any given year will diverge from the trend. Such divergences from trend arc even more pronounced in individual industries. Thus in particular years unit labor costs might rise or fall for a particular industry without affecting the recommended trend of prices for that industry. This would result in year-to-year changes in the sharing of gross business income between labor and ownership both in individual industries and in the whole economy Corresponding to the exceptions to the general wage guidepost there were exceptions to the general rule for prices. Prices could rise more than the general rule would indicate in an industry in which profits were inadequate to attract the capital to finance a needed expansion in capacity or costs other than labor costs had risen. Prices should fall in comparison with the general guidepost rule in industries where productive capacity was excessive or where costs other than labor costs had fallen. Prices should also fall in comparison with the general rule where " excessive market power had resulted in rates of profit substantially higher than those earned elsewhere on investments of comparable risk. " Although the price guidepost was directed only at industries in which firms possessed some pricing discretion the Report assumed that if prices in these industries conformed to the guideposts the average of prices would also be stable in the other highly competitive industries ( including agriculture and most services ) where firms had no discretion. If this were true then the average of all prices would be stable. And since money wages would have advanced by the same percentage as productivity the advance of real wages would equal the advance in productivity The Guideposts in Subsequent Council Reports Reports of the Council since have preserved the general concepts of wage and price guideposts presented in the Report. However the Council has given increasingly clear indications of what it regarded as the trend of productivity which should govern wage movements. In the Report the Council specifically recommended that the general wage guidepost be percent a year Most of the exceptions to the general guideposts both for wages and for prices that were explicitly stated in the Report have continued to appear in subsequent Reports. However the possible applicability of these exceptions has been less emphasized. And the possibility of other unspecified exceptions has not been mentioned. Moreover whereas the Report had emphasized that the guideposts were " guides " not " rules " and were presented as a " basis for discussion " subsequent statements by the Council and others in the Administration have been interpreted as treating the guideposts as firm though voluntary rules and those who fail to adhere to them as " violators. " How the Guidepost Policy Has Worked In the areas in which the guideposts were expected to apply among strongly organized groups of workers and in firms which have appreciable discretion with regard to their prices the guideposts were reasonably well observed at least until mid-1966 Strong labor unions are concentrated in manufacturing mining construction and transportation. Data on the average change in hourly earnings or in total compensation for the total private economy are therefore not particularly helpful in appraising adherence to the wage guidepost The most relevant figures are the fragmentary data on important new collective bargaining settlements referred to in Chapter These indicate that until the second half of the median of such settlements ( excluding construction ) was only modestly in excess of the general wage guidepost ( However since many were below the median there were also some appreciably above. ) Construction settlements on the other hand consistently and significantly exceeded the general guidepost. Especially in transportation settlements ( for example airlines and New York subways ) were far above the guidepost. Within manufacturing automobile wages advanced at a rate much above the guidepost and recent settlements in the electrical equipment manufacturing and telephone industries also were about 11/2 percentage points in excess Nevertheless a number of the most significant union settlements including the key steel bargain of were at or close to the general guidepost It is difficult to generalize about the extent to which the price decisions of firms with price discretion have adhered to the guidepost. It is clear that some significant price reductions which the guidepost would have suggested have not occurred. Automobile prices are doubtless such a case. Steel prices have edged up only moderately on the average but it is possible that the guidepost would have permitted some slight increase. The pricing of aluminum particularly of fabricated aluminum products could surely not have been consistent with the general guidepost. Producers of steel and aluminum have argued however that their relatively low profit positions called for some price increase in order to retain or attract needed capital Other important price increases about which guidepost questions might be raised include those for newsprint gasoline alloy and specialty steels some chemicals and agricultural machinery For cotton textiles a sharp decline in the cost of raw cotton would have suggested price reductions ; but it can be argued that no individual producer in this highly competitive industry has significant discretion about his prices and that what happened was a purely supply-demand response. This argument will be tested by what happens to cotton textile prices in the months ahead. Prices of machine tools and of many other types of industrial equipment have undoubtedly risen substantially faster than costs. However in view of the excess demand for this category of goods it seems clear that producers have practiced restraint and that in a purely competitive market prices would have risen faster and farther In the minerals industries increases in sulphur and the small increase in copper ( until January ) again are cases in which price restraint has clearly held prices below levels which would clear the market even though a pure guidepost policy might not have implied any price increase. Moreover in these cases the possible need for higher prices to encourage the use and development of marginal resources complicates any judgment of the public interest in these prices In general terms the greatest failure of observance of the price guidepost lies in the failure to reduce prices on a considerable number of the product lines of a large number of industries. As Chapter has indicated a number of the price increases that have occurred in manufacturing and mining industries undoubtedly had some justification in higher costs. But offsetting price decreases have been far too few GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE GUIDEPOST ADHERENCE The Report proposed the guideposts as a standard for the public to use in judging the extent to which private price and wage decisions were consistent with the public interest in a noninflationary economy. However the message was directed not merely to the public but also to labor and to business. The guideposts were designed to define more precisely to labor and business the Government 's view as to what the public interest required of them. And it was obviously important that labor and business as well as the public should understand why observance of these standards was in the public interest and why it was also in the long-run interest of both labor and business Clearly it was not enough merely to publish these standards and assume that the job was done. The public does not have the information that would permit it to apply the guidepost standards to particular cases of wage or price movements. Some reporting is necessary to help the public make intelligent judgments of labor and business behavior. Likewise so far as business and labor are concerned the educational process is not achieved by a single annual statement Thus it is clear that the Government must take an active and continuing interest in interpreting and explaining the guideposts to both labor and industry on the one hand and to the general public on the other. Indeed there may even be some conflict between the objective of effectively persuading labor and industry to accept voluntarily the disciplines implied by the guideposts and that of informing the public so that it can focus its judgments favorable or unfavorable concerning particular wage settlements or price changes. The Administration has been gradually feeling its way toward a proper definition of Government 's role in the process of information and persuasion. Undoubtedly some mistakes have been made. But some real progress has been achieved Three major types of activities have been undertaken. First the members of the Council of Economic Advisers various Cabinet and sub-Cabinet O officials and the President himself have made numerous addresses about the guideposts to business and labor groups and to the general public. As might be expected the Council of Economic Advisers has taken a leading part in this activity with literally dozens of speeches articles for the popular press and radio and television appearances. Many of these have received substantial coverage in both the general press and in the specialized press of a number of industries The second type of activity has been an increasing number of private communications and meetings between Government officials and leaders of business and labor designed to underscore the public interest factor in wage and price decisions and to solicit the cooperation of union and corporate leadership in specific situations. With labor organizations most of this activity has been carried on by the Secretary of Labor and his associates With industry the Council of Economic Advisers the Secretaries of Commerce Treasury Agriculture Interior Defense and others have participated. However since the largest number of these contacts has been made by the Council of Economic Advisers it seems appropriate that the Council should provide a report on these activities In the past year the Council became involved in regard to perhaps product lines for which price increases were either imminent or had been announced by one or more firms. In the typical case the Council learned in one way or another of a price increase that was contemplated or that had been announced by one or more producers. In some instances companies contemplating price changes themselves brought the subject to the Council 's attention. Where the Council learned of an important actual or impending price increase its procedure was to send letters-or telegrams to all principal producers of the product. In urgent cases telephone calls substituted for letters or telegrams. If some firms had already announced price increases they were asked to reconsider. Those who had not so announced were asked to avoid them if possible. In all cases an invitation was extended to meet with the Council to discuss the matter In the private discussions which often followed these communications the companies explained the reasons why a price increase was considered appropriate and the Government representatives presented any information available to them which appeared relevant to the price decision The Council recognizes in these meetings that it ordinarily does not have the detailed information which would permit a clear judgment as to the appropriateness of the proposed price change on either the basis of the guidepost standards or other relevant considerations. But it explains the public interest in price stability and the company is urged to take this interest fully into account in making its decision. These meetings are ordinarily not reported publicly unless revealed by the company involved In a few of the cases that arose in in which the price problems of an industry appeared to be rather general a number of the leading producers were invited to meet with Government representatives to discuss the price situations in their industries. Some of these meetings were publicly reported The outcome of these activities can not be fully known. In a number of cases it is clear that price increases which were announced or contemplated have been rescinded reduced in amount or coverage or delayed. Some companies have indicated that their subsequent price decisions were affected even where their decision in the immediate case was not changed The response on the part of the businesses involved has been extremely encouraging. Only in rare cases has the Council been told that it had no right to question private decisions. Almost invariably the companies involved have recognized a larger public interest in their pricing decisions and have made a sincere effort to take that interest into account. Some large companies agreed to give the Council advance notice of their intention to change prices This activity will be continued by the Council. It helps to make clear the rationale of the guideposts to business managements in situations where their interpretation may be unclear. And it provides the Council a better understanding of the problems faced by responsible business leaders As a third type of activity the Council has on occasion issued formal statements to the public commenting on particular wage or price decisions In the past year these included statements on wage increases for employees of the New York Transit Authority the five airlines involved in the JulyAugust strike and the American Airlines case. It issued public statements on price increases for steel ( on several occasions ) aluminum copper and molybdenum. It responded informally to press questions in other cases BASIC PROBLEMS FOR WAGE-PRICE POLICY IN Two important developments have created the major problems for wageprice policy today. The first is that consumer prices have risen by percent in the past months which makes organized workers even in unions which were previously disposed to cooperate with the Government 's policy unwilling to contemplate settlements at or close to the guideposts. And it gives unions which were never disposed to cooperate an additional reason for not doing so. The second development is that corporate profits have increased considerably more than aggregate labor income especially when measured from the slack years of the late 's or the recession year of This provides a second reason for labor 's resistance to the guidepost There can be no question that some part of the rise in consumer prices is due to past failure to observe the guideposts both by organized labor and by business. And some part of the faster rise of corporate profits has been due to.the failure of some businesses to make their price decisions conform to the guidepost principles ( particularly by not reducing some prices when costs fell ) But it is clear from Chapter that the primary source of the rise in consumer prices lies in areas to which the guideposts have no applicability : in farm products where prices have risen considerably despite rapid productivity gains ; and in services where wages and professional incomes of unorganized workers have also risen rapidly So far as the rise in corporate profits is concerned much of it would have occurred had the guideposts been precisely followed. As noted above the year-to-year advance of productivity frequently diverges from the longterm trend during years of rapid expansion and did from at least through Moreover greater sales volume and higher operating rates meant lower unit capital costs thus adding to profits. Consequently even if guidepost principles on wages and prices had been literally observed profit margins during such a period would have increased sharply and aggregate profits even more so. Likewise the leveling off of profits in when productivity gains slowed down is consistent with the guidepost expectation Nevertheless the rise in consumer prices and the increasing share of profits until the first quarter of are facts that can not be disputed nor explained out of existence. And they can not fail to influence the behavior of wages in Through the effect of wages on costs they will also influence prices A WAGE-PRICE POLICY FOR The main issues for wage-price policy in are these : ( a ) Should the guidepost for wages be adjusted to recognize in some way the recent increase in living costs ? ( b ) Should further recognition be given to special factors other than those previously recognized which appropriately justify exceptions to the general guidepost principles ? ( c ) To what extent should profit margins absorb cost increases ? Recognition of Higher Living Costs The Council recognizes that the recent rise in living costs makes it unlikely that most collective bargaining settlements in will fully conform to the trend increase of productivity. But it sees no useful purpose to be served by suggesting some higher standard for wage increases even on a temporary basis The only valid and noninflationary standard for wage advances is " the productivity principle. If price stability is eventually to be restored and maintained in a high-employment U.S. economy wage settlements must once again conform to that standard While it can be expected that many wage settlements in will exceed the trend increase of productivity it is obvious that if on the average they should exceed it by the amount of the recent increase in living costs price stability could never be restored. If the average wage increase in were to include a full allowance for productivity plus an additional margin to " compensate " for past increases in living costs unit labor costs would rise at a rate which would require living costs to continue their rapid rise In this connection it must be recognized that some part of the advance of consumer prices represents a transfer of income to public uses. Most State and local governments are compelled repeatedly to raise indirect tax rates to finance the expansion of essential services. These indirect taxes enter into prices accounting for percentage point of rise in the consumer price index in And in there will be no offset to the rise in these indirect taxes ( as in and ) from reduced Federal excises. If every group attempted to offset the burden of these higher indirect taxes by a compensating rise in money incomes no transfer of real resources to public purposes could be achieved It is not expected that market forces in will again require that average wages in the largely unorganized sectors agriculture trade and services should rise faster than in the organized segments manufacturing mining construction and transportation in order to promote an efficient allocation and use of labor. But the higher minimum wage effective in will have its principal impact on wages in the unorganized sectors and in the largely unorganized low-wage segments of manufacturing. Thus there will be some continued pressure on costs and prices originating in wage increases outside of the organized sectors In the national interest continues to require restraint in wage settlements ; indeed it is more essential than ever that restraint be practiced in order to turn the trend of prices back toward stability. If restraint can not mean an average wage advance only equal to the rise in productivity it surely must mean wage advances which are substantially less than the productivity trend plus the recent rise in consumer prices Although the Council recognizes that some allowance will frequently be made for higher living costs in settlements it continues to believe that arrangements which automatically tie wage rates to changes in consumer price indexes will contribute to inflation. One union may be able to protect its members in this way against any deterioration in its real wage or any real impact from increased indirect taxes. But it does so only by imposing more of the burden on others. And if all unions and other groups in society were to succeed in tying compensation to consumer prices the arrangement would become a vast engine of inflation which once it began to roll would continue to gain speed Guidepost Exceptions The most frequent criticism of the present wage guidepost after the criticism that it fails to allow for the rise in consumer prices is that it fails to provide sufficient exceptions for the many special and individual circumstances of which account must be taken in wage negotiations. This criticism requires consideration A guidepost exception has always been made for low wages. In a year in which the minimum wage will advance percent from $ to $ an hour with an inevitable impact on wages previously near the new minimum this exception is obviously significant. The fact however that few strong unions exist among low-wage workers gives the exception only limited relevance for collective bargaining It surely does not justify large wage increases for high-wage unions Indeed the productivity arithmetic suggests that if an exception for lowwage workers is to be meaningful in permitting low-wage workers to receive increases in real wages high-wage workers who have profited in the past from exceptionally strong bargaining power must respect the counterpart exception that their wage increases should be less than the average Second the guidepost principle has always contained a clear exception for wage changes that serve an economic function by assisting in the reallocation of labor toward shortage occupations and industries. Thus for example no complaint has ever been made in the name of the guideposts with respect to the large wage increases recently received by nurses Indeed in a high-employment economy the importance of differential wage changes as an instrument of labor reallocation is greatly increased and this exception is more important today than in earlier years. However the Council suggests that as a general principle an exception to the guideposts for workers in a shortage occupation should be claimed only where the union involved stands ready to lift every artificial barrier to entry into the occupation and to cooperate fully in public and private efforts to train whatever numbers of workers may desire to enter the occupation. Moreover as indicated in Chapter the remaining labor shortages this year will be concentrated in unorganized professional and technical occupations Other exceptions have frequently been proposed for incorporation in a national wage policy One such proposal is to allow for the narrowing of differentials between wage rates paid in different industries or by different employers for similar work the so-called issue of " comparable wages. " To the extent that such differentials may interfere with a rational allocation of labor their correction is already encouraged by the exception just discussed The public interest obviously requires that wage settlements pay appropriate attention to factors of comparability. But it can not accept inflationary settlements ever ) ' time this justification is alleged At least within a single labor market area it is surely desirable that workers in occupations requiring similar training skill education and responsibility should be paid the same wage. This is less obvious as between labor markets Even within labor markets some wage differentials may reflect the fact that one employer finds it worthwhile to pay above-average rates in order to insure low turnover good morale and greater selectivity in hiring while another prefers to pay lower rates and forego these advantages It is probably true on the whole that the dispersion of wages for similar work by similar workers is larger than it should be from the point of view of either efficiency or equity. But the wage comparisons made in collective bargaining disputes often have little or no relevance either to resource allocation or to equity. Very often the wage comparisons in collective bargaining are only part of a game of follow-the-leader which at best is irrelevant to resource allocation and at worst speeds up a wage-price spiral Many recent instances in which outsized wage agreements have emerged from collective bargaining based on claims that such increases were necessary in order to achieve wage comparability have created more problems of inequity and inefficiency than they have resolved. Meaningful wage comparisons should be made not only with wages that are higher but also with those that are lower. Otherwise wage increases to achieve c 'comparability " may actually reduce it. Unions can always find some group of workers more highly paid than they whether or not all other conditions are similar. If all corrections of such " inequities " are upward labor cost inflation is inevitable One recent important collective bargaining dispute produced a highly inflationary uniform percentage increase for the entire work force involved. The justification was that an increase of this magnitude was necessary to correct what may have been genuine disparity between the wages of a small group of specialized workers and similar workers in other employments. The mediation committee which recommended the settlement recognized that for the great majority of the work force involved wage rates were already as high as or higher than those for comparable workers. But they could not recommend des # oying the customary relationship between the wages of those workers for whom the disparity was found to exist and the wages of all other members of the work force This is a clear recipe for inflation Another exception frequently urged is that in industries with rapid productivity gains wages should rise faster than the average. If such an exception were made it would necessarily impart an inflationary bias to the system for no one argues that wages will or should rise less rapidly or not at all in industries with little or no productivity gain It is clearly in the public interest for unit labor costs and prices to fall in industries with relatively high productivity gains. In the long run falling unit labor costs do result in falling prices ( except where there are offsetting increases in other costs ) But the long run may be too long for labor 's and the public 's patience. And sometimes the very factors that produce falling costs may work against price reduction. For example the industries in which labor costs are falling are often those in which demand and thus production is expanding most rapidly a situation which weakens rather than strengthens the competitive forces driving down prices If there is a long lag between a reduction in labor costs and a reduction in prices it is difficult to make a convincing case that high wage settlements in industries with high productivity growth are not in the public interest As the Report ( p. ) put it : Such circumstances pose a most unattractive dilemma from the viewpoint of the public interest. On the one hand extra increases in wages or fringe benefits might tend to spread to other industries creating a general cost-push from the wage side. On the other hand there is no justification on either economic or equity grounds for distributing above-average gains in productivity exclusively through the profits channel. The real way out of this dilemma is for the firms involved to remove its cause by reducing prices That statement is as important in as it was in Indeed it forms one of the most significant elements of a national price policy for Another of the reasons given for an exception to the wage guidepost is ability to pay. In practice this refers to the profits of the bargaining employers. Ability-to-pay considerations are of course often related to the industry 's own productivity trend. Industries with rapid productivity gains falling labor costs and stable prices are industries in which profits have risen But ability-to-pay considerations arise independently in another context In any period of rapid expansion toward full utilization profits inevitably rise faster than total employee income just as profits fall more rapidly when utilization rates decline. The past years have been such a period of rising profits. It is not surprising that trade unions seek to share in the profits generated by prosperity The record shows however that attempts on the part of unions to redistribute income from profits to wages through excessive wage increases in high-profit industries results primarily in higher prices in those industries When this happens the effect is to redistribute real income from the rest of the community who are mostly other wage earners to the workers in question with very little redistribution from profits to wages To avoid a wage-price spiral it is therefore essential that firms with discretion over prices and particularly those with unusually high profits pursue price policies which will not invite excessive wage demands Price Policy for The foregoing discussion ( and that of Chapter ) has indicated the essential character of the problems which businesses with pricing discretion will face in : ( ) Wage contracts newly negotiated in will tend to raise the unit labor costs of many firms and industries ( ) Nevertheless many important industries will continue to operate in under labor contracts negotiated in or which often will be consistent with declining unit labor costs ( ) Although the cost of purchased industrial products may frequently be higher in than in the ^ purchase cost of some raw materials will be lower ( ) Many firms in will be using new and modern capital equipment installed during the past year and will be under less pressure to operate marginal units. Often this will involve substantially lower costs In short the cost picture for price setters in will continue to be a mixed one Although average profit margins of manufacturers declined in the second half of they were higher for the entire year at least as a percentage of equity than in any prior year since the highly inflationary year of In the past profit rates like those recorded in endured only for brief periods. Profits rose rapidly in cyclical expansions. But as the economy reached and quickly passed a cyclical peak reductions in capacity utilization retarded the growth of productivity and intensified competitive pressures with a resulting erosion of profit margins. If public and private policies now succeed in maintaining a steadily expanding economy it follows that the profit margins which were feasible only in the boom stage of a boom-bust economy and therefore may have been appropriate in that stage are inappropriate in a steadily prosperous economy Once firms can become accustomed to operating in a more stable environment the profit margins which they now seek to achieve in periods of high utilization can be reduced as no longer necessary to make up for the low and frequently inadequate profits of periods of slack and recession. In fact profit margins not only should be lower than in the boom phase of a cyclical economy but should be reduced on the average because operations in such an environment carry lesser risk It is true that an adjustment to lower profit margins may be feasible and appropriate only if steady economic advance can be maintained. But it is equally true that such an adjustment of margins may itself be required if a steadily high employment economy is to be maintained In an economy which grows steadily but does not outrun the growth of capacity there will be vigorous competition and ultimately profit margins in most industries should seek an appropriate level. But competitive pressures work slowly. In industries where a small number of leading firms possess strong market power they work very slowly indeed. Firms in those industries in which market power combined with strong demand has pushed profit margins to record levels have a special responsibility in price-making at this critical time If in firms with discretion as to their prices should follow pricing policies which even maintain present margins the opportunity for a significantly improved price record will be compromised. It would speed up the rise in living costs and it would again pose inviting targets for inflationary wage demands by unions To assume steady movement toward price stability in the public interest requires that producers absorb cost increases to the maximum extent feasible and take advantage of every opportunity to lower prices In so doing they will make an important contribution to strengthening America 's international competitive position and to a climate that will permit the economy to maintain the forward momentum which will preserve and enlarge the gains of the past years of rewarding prosperity Chapter Selected Uses of Economic Growth GREAT FINANCIER is said to have remarked that compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. No doubt he was referring to its remarkable properties in enhancing private fortunes. However those concerned with national policies for economic growth have also become aware of the power of compound interest. If the American economy continues to grow at percent a year output will double in years triple in quadruple in If that potential is wisely and efficiently shared among competing uses great advances in the economic well-being of all Americans are assured Literally billions of private and public decisions determine the distribution of the growing gross national product ( GNP ) among consumption investment and Government purchases and within each of these categories among the myriad of individual goods and services the economy can provide Consumption decisions of households and the investment decisions of business firms determine the uses of output in the private sector. But these decisions are inevitably affected by public policies. Monetary and credit policies and changes in tax rates and tax incentives restrain or encourage consumer and business outlays and influence their composition The budget-making process at Federal State and local levels determines the share of output used to meet public needs. Taxes and public spending represent a substantial share of the national product. Moreover in a growing economy with given tax rates tax revenues move upward strongly over time and call for continued decisions on increases in public expenditures tax reductions and debt management. Public policy can not be neutral in its impact on the allocation of the gains from economic growth How these gains should be distributed must be squarely faced as an issue of public policy A PRIVATE AND PUBLIC GOODS Households directly purchase the greater part of our national output to meet their wants and needs as consumers. Personal consumption expenditures now constitute percent of GNP. The share has been as low as percent in World War II and as high as percent in the depression year but has recently been relatively stable. Most of the future increase in output will surely take the form of more goods and services for consumers CONSUMER CHOICE Growing incomes will enable households to enjoy continuing increases in their standards of living. For those families which are now poor higher incomes will mean more of those types of goods and services which most Americans now regard as necessities adequate and varied diets sufficient health care satisfactory housing a good education for their children Even for Americans well above the poverty line a significant share of the growth in incomes will be devoted to these basic items. With higher incomes the proportion of the budget spent for various types of goods shifts in fairly predictable ways toward consumer durable goods travel recreation and other leisure-time activities. Rising incomes provide for more freedom more security more comforts more cultural opportunity and more variety in life permitting the greater fulfillment of personal aspirations EXTERNAL EFFECTS The buyer receives satisfaction from most purchases he makes and he pays the cost. Society as a whole has no important concern about whether the individual chooses to eat more steak and to buy fewer new clothes or the reverse. But there are many instances in which one man 's consumption may affect his neighbors significantly. In the technical language of economists many economic actions have important " external effects " on persons who are not decision-makers in the transaction and whose interests are not normally reflected. Indeed these actions are increasing in number as the size complexity and interdependence of the American economy increases An extreme form of external effects occurs in the category of commodities called " public goods. " Once created their use can not be effectively limited to a group of paying customers or subscribers. A health program to eradicate communicable diseases is an example of a public good. Police protection and national defense are other examples where everyone can benefit without reducing benefits available to others. Since no one can be excluded from the enjoyment of public goods each person would be tempted to let his neighbor pay for them while he spent his own income on goods which he enjoys exclusively. For this reason decisions to supply public goods are everywhere made collectively and paid for collectively by taxes In less extreme but more typical cases of external effects private decisions would lead to some production and consumption of goods but not the right amount from the standpoint of society as a whole. The modernization of one house may help to upgrade an entire block but might not be undertaken if the homeowner had to pay the full cost. The smoke from one man 's chimney can spread soot far and wide and might be stopped if the originator paid the full costs he is imposing on others. Such cases of external benefits which extend to roads parks and education are important reasons for the growing responsibilities of Federal State and local governments Another part of these responsibilities stems from a social concern for equality of opportunity and relief of human misery. There is growing recognition that many Americans due to accident of birth or circumstance do not share in the blessings of a rich society have little opportunity of ever sharing and moreover may well see their children too denied an opportunity to compete on an equal footing. Programs for income maintenance health education and cities reflect this recognition and social concern as well as awareness of the external costs and benefits In meeting social responsibilities of all kinds there is often a choice between public production and public encouragement to private production through subsidies regulation or financial aids to purchasers. For example a comprehensive medical insurance system may reduce the need for public hospitals for the poor. Decisions in such matters have been made pragmatically ; many are perhaps accidents of history. The postal service is nationalized while telephone and telegraph service is provided by regulated private enterprise. Yet these decisions have produced viable results. In contrast with experience abroad and our own experience in previous generations there is no major ideological battle in the United States today over the scope of the Government sector. Public policy now faces up to questions of the Government-private mix in a flexible manner endeavoring to meet the aspirations of our citizenry with greatest efficiency while maintaining an appropriate preference for decentralization in decision making The increased wealth of the United States permits us to face directly the problems of poverty lack of education ill health and urban decay as national issues requiring a coordinated policy effort. Many of these problems can be solved most efficiently by State and local governments if they have the resources. Other problems require national policies. The pace of progress in meeting them will be held back as long as our commitments in Vietnam absorb a substantial share of our economic growth But even in this period progress can and will be made. And when the welcome opportunities of peace arise we will be ready to intensify our efforts to build a better America The following sections of this chapter discuss selected areas in which the provision of public goods the external effects of economic decisions or the achievement of humanitarian goals will absorb part of the additional output which constitutes economic growth. The conquest of poverty improvements in education better health and the rebuilding of American cities are expensive. They will make substantial claims even on our growing affluence. Choices will have to be made not to solve one problem at the expense of another but rather to allocate resources in such a way as to permit balanced progress on many fronts INCOME MAINTENANCE Poverty in the United States today afflicts million Americans directly and every American indirectly. But poverty is curable and the Nation is now committed to using a share of the fruits of growth to stamp out this malady POVERTY AND WORK By definition the poor have incomes inadequate to provide even the basic essentials of a decent life in our society. A household is statistically classified as poor if its total money income falls below levels specified by the Social Security Administration currently $ for an unrelated individual $ for a couple and $ for a family of four. Obviously any such statistical classification ignores such factors as assets particular family needs and the variability of income. But it helps to illuminate the extent and character of poverty In the broadest sense the poor comprise two general categories. The first but smaller includes families headed by an able-bodied male breadwinner whose wages are low or whose employment is irregular. Among nonwhite families in the South even breadwinners holding full-time jobs often do not earn living wages ( Table ) For the entire Nation however only percent of all families headed by a fully employed male worker were below the poverty line in but this group includes percent of all poor families. Large family size was a characteristic of many of these households. Another group percent of all poor families was headed by a chronically unemployed man or by one who worked only part-time Poverty among families with able-bodied male breadwinners has declined substantially in recent years. For example improving nonfarm job opportunities which facilitated migration from the farm also meant a welcome migration out of poverty for many rural families. The number of poor farm households fell by percent between and ( Table ) and represented only percent of all poor households in although some of the formerly poor farm families who acquired urban addresses remained poor But most poor families are headed by persons who can not or should not be in the labor force at least on a full-time basis. The aged the family consisting of a female head with children and the disabled are increasingly becoming the dominant groups of " hard-core poor " accounting for about half of all poor families in Rapid economic growth and full employ- TABLE The poor and their work experience * Poor families Poor households ( millions ) % Work experience of head of household Incidence of poverty ( percent ) Number ( millions ) Male head Female head Male head Female head Total Aged ( years and over ) All other.....

For them cash benefits are essential For those of the poor who can work full time economic growth and full employment will continue to erode poverty. But for them too cash benefits are required to alleviate the immediate rigors of poverty while they take training while they are being relocated while they seek and find jobs INCOME MAINTENANCE AND THE POOR Income maintenance programs financed by Federal State and local governments provide some support for millions of the poor. The poor like others enjoy protection under major social insurance programs such as Old-Age Survivors and Disability Insurance ( OASDI ) Health Insurance for the Aged and Unemployment Insurance. Roughly one-third of OASDI benefits which totaled $ billion in went TABLE Number of poor households and incidence of poverty and Number of poor households ( millions ) Characteristics of head of household Incidence of poverty ( percent ) White Male Female Nonwhite Male Female Total Aged ( years and over ) White Male Female Nonwhite Male.

Poverty-income lines are adjusted to take account of price changes during the period Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding Sources : Department of Commerce and Department of Health Education and Welfare to the poor and another two-fifths went to households which otherwise would have been poor. Other programs such as Public Assistance Food Stamps and Commodity Distribution provide most of their benefits to the poor. Expenditures under these programs totaled nearly $ billion in fiscal year Public Assistance The major income maintenance program aimed directly at the poor is Public Assistance. In many respects this program still reflects conditions that surrounded its adoption in the depression years of the 's when President Roosevelt saw one-third of the Nation as economically deprived At that time it was designed to make cash payments to those who were unemployable and unable to help themselves because of identifiable family or personal characteristics including old age death or absence of the breadwinner disability and blindness. But the program has never been adequate and with the Nation 's growing affluence its shortcomings are even less tolerable The States pay percent of the costs of Public Assistance and they establish standards of eligibility. In response to general financial pressures many States have cut costs by establishing low standards of need and imposing stringent requirements relating to length of residence other income and assets and relatives ' responsibility. Less than half of the poor fall within the Public Assistance categories ; as a result of State eligibility requirements only percent actually receive any help ; and for those on the rolls actual payments typically fall far below need even as defined by the State itself One of the Public Assistance programs Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDG ) can actually promote family dissolution. Because it excludes families in which there is an employed ( or in some States employable ) adult male a man unable to provide adequately for his wife and children can make them eligible for cash payments only by deserting them. The Unemployed Parent Program under AFDC introduced in and now in operation in States therefore represents a gratifying step toward improving the present Public Assistance system However other problems with Public Assistance remain. For example some of those who receive aid may be discouraged from helping themselves The cash payments are intended for those with no earning capacity and are curtailed to the extent that recipients have earnings. While relatively few recipients of Public Assistance can work some mothers with dependent school-age children and most fathers under the Unemployed Parent program who might supplement their benefits with earnings are discouraged from making the effort by knowledge that their assistance payments will be reduced one dollar for every dollar of earnings The President is proposing important amendments to the Public Assistance system this year. They would require each State as a condition for Federal support to make assistance payments at least sufficient to bring households up to the needs standards which the State has established and to update these standards as conditions change. The proposed legislation would also alter the payment formulas to encourage self-support The categories of persons eligible for aid under Public Assistance were set up in the 's. At that time poverty was so extensive that benefits could be provided only to those obviously unable to support themselves But these categories no longer seem adequate for a rich and prosperous society. In particular it is necessary to consider the plight of one group excluded from virtually all existing programs the million poor households headed by an able-bodied male under who is nevertheless an inadequate breadwinner. In the longer run education training health and rehabilitation services counseling employment information and other supportive services are the key escape routes from poverty for potential full-time workers with currently inadequate earning capacity. In the interim ample benefits to families with children have particular priority because they can help to end the poverty cycle in which blighted environment denies poor children the skills and the attitudes they need to break out of poverty as adults Mothers with dependent children have particular needs for day-care schools family management education and transportation. Special programs keyed to special problems can reinforce a more general program of cash payments based on need TOWARD IMPROVED INCOME MAINTENANCE FOR THE POOR Ideally an income maintenance system should provide benefits on the basis of need without degrading means tests while preserving incentives for self help. These goals could be achieved through broadening the Public Assistance program or through new techniques such as a minimum income allowance or negative income tax. Much public attention recently has been focused on methods of guaranteeing a minimum income perhaps sufficient to eliminate poverty altogether In considering these or any other new approaches the question of incentives has to be faced squarely. The poor can not be expected to work without pay any more than can the rich. If sufficient cash support were offered to raise each poor household 's income to a fixed minimum such as the poverty threshold then recipients would have no incentive to obtain outside earnings up to the level of the income guarantee. Every dollar earned would be offset by a dollar of cash support lost. Indeed some persons whose incomes were only slightly above the poverty threshold might find it attractive to reduce their work effort and to receive cash benefits Incentives for self help would thus be dulled. But if benefit payments were cut back by only a fraction of any additional outside earnings some benefits would be paid to families with total incomes above the poverty level increasing the cost. There is an abundance of assertion and anecdote regarding the impact of work incentives on low-income Americans but little real knowledge. The Office of Economic Opportunity and the Department of Health Education and Welfare are each planning to undertake some pilot studies in the coming year SOCIAL SECURITY Under the Social Security Act of and successive amendments spectacular advances have been made toward providing all Americans with basic social insurance protection against loss of income due to old age and retirement long-term disability and joblessness. Most social insurance programs provide protection against these designated risks for the whole population not just for the poor. Old-Age Insurance under the Social Security Act is the basic retirement system for nearly all Americans. It insures many Americans against the risk of poverty in their old age : percent of the aged would be in poverty but for Social Security. Nevertheless nearly two-fifths of all aged remain poor. This proportion will decline under existing law since new retirees will have longer and higher wage histories which will entitle them to greater benefits Further liberalization in benefits particularly in minimum benefits can hasten the day when all Americans will be assured upon retirement of a pension adequate to prevent poverty. Americans with incomes well above poverty levels also want and are willing to pay for increasing social insurance protection. Therefore the President is proposing a substantial liberalization of retirement benefits under Social Security involving an increase in the minimum benefit from the present $ a month to $ a month and a percent increase in all other benefits coupled with an increase in the earnings base. Modernization and improvement of the Federal-State unemployment insurance system is also being proposed in which extended benefits for the long-term unemployed will be coupled with automatic access to training and retraining and other rehabilitative services In the last Congress important amendments to the Social Security Act were enacted to provide health protection for the aged through Medicare and to liberalize Social Security benefits. With enactment of the new proposals retirement disability and unemployment will have been transformed for most Americans who have worked from risks which had to be borne unaided into contingencies against which a substantial measure of public protection is afforded EDUCATION Outlays for education have been rising by IOJ/2 percent a year for the last decade making it one of the major U.S. growth industries. Direct costs for formal schooling in the current school year will total $ billion ( Table ) nearly ^ percent of GNP Education in the United States is both a public and a private undertaking About three-fourths of the costs of education are paid through government budgets ; tuition endowments and earnings of private institutions meet the remainder of the bill. The Federal Government has long played a role in certain phases of education and has recently taken new large steps. Still the bulk of public costs are borne by State and local governments VALUE OF EDUCATION Education provides benefits both for the person receiving it and for society at large.

Some of these benefits are private consumption ; others are " investment in human capital " which like investments in machinery or plant yield profits over a period of years Increase in Earning Power Many studies show that the quantity of education a person has received and his earning power are closely correlated. Of course family income and family connections and place of birth or residence to say nothing of native ability and motivation all tend to result in both higher educational attainment and higher income. However even after taking account of such factors a dramatic story of the net contribution of additional schooling TABLE Earnings of males by years of school completed and other characteristics * White males Nonwhite males Age group by years of school completed North South North South years of age : years years years years $ $ $ $ years of age : years 8years years years i Unweighted average of the earnings of single-age groups of and years of age and and years of age respectively In computing the earnings the following variables were held constant : rural or urban origin size of family marital status 5-year residence in one State or not and foreign or domestic born parents Source : Calculated by Council of Economic Advisers from tables in Giora Hanoch Personal Earnings and Investment in Schooling an unpublished Ph. D. dissertation University of Chicago December to earnings emerges. Table records some of the results of a study of the income and education of employed males classified according to a variety of personal characteristics. It shows for example that in a white male high school graduate living in the North ( aged to ) earned percent more than an elementary school graduate whose other measured characteristics were identical and a college graduate earned percent more than a high school graduate Social Benefits Some scholars have used evidence on private returns from education to estimate the returns on investments in education for the society as a whole Some studies suggest that more than one-fifth of economic growth in the United States during the last three or four decades is attributable to increases in the average educational attainment of the labor force with perhaps another one-fifth attributable to the general advance of knowledge But many qualifications are required in any attempt to estimate the returns to society from the benefits to individuals who receive education For example employers often use educational achievement as a kind of intelligence or ability test in selecting employees as a " ticket of admission " to better paying jobs. To this extent education tends to yield higher returns to the individual than to society On the other hand education yields substantial external benefits which will not show up explicitly in the incomes of the educated. Our economy and our society are built on the assumption of virtually universal literacy which permits information to be transmitted immediately and directly to everyone. Well-educated workers are more adaptable to changing economic conditions. Education can help to reduce antisocial and criminal behavior. It is essential for political democracy Education and the Disadvantaged In the absence of public expenditures to provide schooling at reduced prices to all persons education like other commodities would be purchased in largest quantities by the well-to-do. Since education in turn raises the capacity to earn this would tend to perpetuate and aggravate income inequality. Poverty would run through generations in a vicious circle. The importance of education as a qualification for wellpaying jobs and the recognition that all Americans must be provided with the opportunity to join the economic mainstream together emphasize the responsibility of governments to help finance education Many of the underprivileged particularly members of ethnic and racial minorities have received less than their share of education. Measured by average years of schooling completed nonwhites are today about where the white population was at least two decades ago. Some of the gaps are being reduced or even eliminated ( Chart ) Nearly all whites and nonwhites now complete elementary school but the gap in high school completion rates remains large even among the year old group Moreover nonwhites often receive not only less but also poorer formal education. Also education acquired in pre-school years and outside the school is impaired when parents and companions suffer from educational gaps. Hence far larger efforts for the educationally disadvantaged are necessary to bring about true equality of educational opportunity It was in recognition of the national importance of education that the Federal Government undertook a major new initiative with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of which provides financial help on the basis of the number of children from low-income families. Under this Act the Federal Government is spending $ billion in support of elementary and secondary education in the current fiscal year tripling the support it provided only years ago. The " Head Start " program has demonstrated great capacity for benefiting disadvantaged pre-school children. The Administration is therefore proposing that the benefits of this program be extended by providing a follow-up program in the early elementary grades TRENDS IN DEMAND AND COSTS Between and enrollment in full-time elementary and secondary day schools in the United States increased by percent from million to million. This sharp increase is attributable to the postwar spurt in birth rates and to greater school attendance by teenagers. Because roughly half of high school graduates continued on to college while the number of students graduating from high school rose sharply college and university enrollment doubled from million in to million in In the next decade elementary and secondary school enrollments will increase only about one-fourth as much as in the past decade. Demand for college education on the other hand is expected to continue increasing rapidly as the proportion of youths completing high school rises and as somewhat more than half of high school graduates go to college. Projections for the future also point to a continued very rapid rise in the fraction of labor force entrants with a college education which could reduce the returns from higher education Outlays per student-year of formal education at all levels have risen by nearly percent during the past decade. The increase may reflect in part improvements in the quality of education but it also reflects higher costs of education. A major factor in the increase in costs has been the dramatic rise in professional salaries at all levels as increased demand for teachers outran the growth of supply especially since entry requirements for teachers were raised in many areas. Salaries rose substantially faster Chart Educational Attainment PERCENT OF AGE G R O U P * AT LEAST YEARS OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL and Over AGE GROUP ( YEARS ) PERCENT OF AGE G R O U P * AT LEAST YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL and Over AGE GROUP ( YEARS ) * BASED ON AVERAGES OF MARCH DATA SOURCE : DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE than wages generally and in response an unusually large number of former elementary and secondary teachers returned to the classroom Enrollments are expected to rise less rapidly over the next decade than the number of college graduates available to teach in elementary and secondary schools or than the number with advanced degrees available to teach in colleges and universities. However it may take special efforts to meet acute present shortages of teachers with specialized skills such as nursery school instructors teachers of remedial reading and teachers of the emotionally handicapped. In the recently initiated Teacher Corps the Federal Government helps to support teams of specialized teachers who work in slum areas at the request of the city. The expansion of special programs for the disadvantaged will require a major increase in the supply of teachers in these specialties New Methods Learning can be improved and the costs of education lowered by a variety of changes in techniques and technology : new curricula and methods of instruction including team teaching more job specific and employment oriented curricula ; upgraded and more flexible school systems ; greater application of learning theory ; incentive pay systems ; full utilization of physical plant especially during nights and summers ; and use of subprofessional aides to economize on professional time. The Joint Economic Committee last year surveyed professional opinion on these and other technological developments. Educational television teaching machines computerized education and programmed learning promise future educational breakthroughs perhaps more quality improvement than cost reduction for some time. Many of the newer techniques remain to be tested in practice and further research is required Forgone Earnings as a Cost From the private point of view forgone earnings ( the sacrifice of opportunity to work full-time ) are a significant part of the costs of secondary and particularly of higher education. Many potential students forgo education because they are unwilling or unable to defer careers marriage and present earnings. But society can afford to wait for the returns more patiently than many of the young especially the poor. Thus the private costs of forgone earnings may exceed the social costs thereby creating a deficiency of demand from a social point of view College students could afford to wait more readily for future earnings if investment in human capital could be financed as other forms of investment are financed by borrowing against future earnings. In particular students encounter problems of raising sufficient funds without collateral. To fill gaps in private financial markets a number of Federal and State student loan pro- grams have been initiated since A guaranteed student loan program relying on private bank participation was provided in the Higher Education Act of but its launching was slow partly because of the tight money conditions of Additional steps are underway to strengthen and expand this program. However proposals for new financing techniques over the longer run need and deserve careful exploration. Some interesting proposals would provide for student loans with repayment scaled to the borrower 's earnings after graduation Over the next decade education will claim an increasing share of our growing incomes in a number of ways. First throughout the society average educational attainment is likely to increase. Second significant efforts will be made to improve the content and quality of education. Finally society will endeavor to assure that those disadvantaged groups now receiving education of below average quality and quantity should have full access to educational opportunities. The distribution of responsibility between the public and private sectors varies among these areas. Private choices will largely determine the increases in average educational attainment mainly through greater enrollments in colleges. Both private and public efforts will be required to improve quality. The achievement of equality in educational opportunity will be a top priority public responsibility HEALTH CARE Americans are demanding receiving and paying for more and better medical care every year both as consumers and as taxpayers. Despite rising costs the Nation is demanding for everyone whether he can personally afford the costs or not medical services which a few decades ago were available only for the well-to-do Health care has become one of the largest industries in the United States It employs over million people more than do the steel automobile and aircraft manufacturing industries combined. In total expenditures for health services medical research and new facilities totaled $ billion about percent of GNP ( Table ) Public expenditures account for oneTABLE The Nation 's health budget [ Billions of dollars ] Total expenditures i Expenditure category Total expenditures Consumers Federal State and Philanlocal thropy Govern- government other ments Hospital and nursing home care Services of physicians dentists and other professionals Drugs and eyeglasses and appliances. _ _ Research Construction Allother Direct outlays for health care including net cost of medical insurance.

Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding Source : Department of Health Education and Welfare fourth of the total health budget of the Nation just the reverse of the situation in education The methods by which health care is produced distributed and financed have been changing rapidly. Home visits by physicians have become unusual. The total number of doctors has changed little but the number of specialists is increasing while that of general practitioners is falling. More services are being dispensed through hospitals where specialists are aided by elaborate equipment and auxiliary health technicians. Group practice is becoming more common and medical insurance more important. These changes will continue and will influence the quality and cost of medical care in the coming decade DEMAND FOR MEDICAL CARE Health research and the control of contagious disease are prime examples of public goods which would not be produced in adequate amounts without Government subsidy. Health care outlays which increase the Nation 's productivity are investments in human capital like outlays for education But the major part of health care is a consumption item reflecting the value Chart Age Adjusted Death Rates RATE PER POPULATION A NONWHITE A \ j WHITE ^ " * ^ i A J J LL1 ( I_L L L J NOTE.-AGE ADJUSTED DEATH RATES ARE RATES BY AGE WEIGHTED BY THE AGE DISTRIBUTION OF THE POPULATION. THE NUMBER OF STATES COVERED INCREASED FROM STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN TO THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES IN SOURCE : DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH EDUCATION AND WELFARE which individuals place on their own and others ' comfort and indeed on life itself. Like food clothing and shelter some medical care is a necessity But the notion of what is necessary changes as society becomes increasingly wealthy and technologically advanced. Medical research generates new cures or treatments of illnesses previously considered incurable and this adds further to demands. And habits such as cigarette smoking increased use of automobiles and pesticides and growing urbanization and industrialization have aggravated various health hazards American performance in medical research has been outstanding. But the spread of knowledge and best practices has been slow and spotty. The health care of sizable groups of Americans lags seriously behind that of the majority. For example the average life of nonwhites is years shorter than that of whites ; a newborn nonwhite child is nearly twice as likely to die in its first year as a newborn white child ; and maternal mortality is four times as high for nonwhites as for whites. There are also important disparities among areas and regions. Low-income States have fewer doctors and nurses than high-income States. Infant mortality in Mississippi is twice that in Massachusetts. The poor and especially poor children receive less health care than other Americans ( Table ) TABLE Physician and dental visits per year by age and family income Physician visits per year by age group Family income Under $ $ 2,0Q0- $ 3,999____ $ 4,QG0- $ $ and over. Under years years and over Dental visits per year NOTE. Data are based on household interviews during the period July to June Source : Department of Health Education and Welfare Although U.S. health expenditures have risen steeply mortality rates which fell sharply in the first half of the century did not decline significantly during the last decade ( Chart ) Moreover our record with respect to life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality lags behind that of other advanced countries which have lower average incomes Expansion of Insurance The expansion of medical insurance coverage has had a major impact on the demand for medical services. About percent of the population under has some private hospital insurance coverage today and percent some surgical coverage compared with percent of the population in In about $ billion nearly one-third of consumer outlays for health was reimbursed by private medical insurance. However most of the poor and many of the aged remained completely unprotected until last year Legislation enacted in closed the biggest remaining gaps. With the enactment of Medicare practically all of the aged now have hospital insurance and about percent have insurance covering part of the cost of doctors5 and other bills. Under the same legislation medical payments under Public Assistance are to be replaced by with new State programs of medical assistance for the poor under Medicaid COST FACTORS The costs of medical care which have been rising about twice as rapidly as average consumer prices over the past decade jumped ^ percent during The most rapid increases have been in hospital rates and more recently in doctors ' fees. Prices of drugs and medicines have not risen in recent years. But neither have they been reduced The shift to hospital treatment the increasing use of outpatient and emergency facilities and the spread of group practice have enabled physicians to use their time more efficiently. Prepaid medical care encourages early diagnosis and prompt treatment which can save both money and lives. New drugs and medical practices which shorten hospital stays have partly offset the increases in costs per hospital day. But hospital rates have soared as patients have received more professional services more laboratory work more drugs more treatment by increasingly complex and costly equipment. In many areas duplication of expensive and seldom used equipment in several hospitals has contributed to rising costs. Labor requirements in hospitals have also risen sharply. The number of employees per patient has almost doubled in the last years. Simultaneously the wage gap between hospital workers and employees with corresponding skills elsewhere has narrowed in response to strong demands for workers in health occupations PROSPECTS FOR THE COMING DECADE With both costs and demand rising strongly it seems likely that public and private health expenditures which rose from 4J4 percent to percent of GNP in the past decade will continue to command an increasing share of the Nation 's resources. The bulk of these outlays will be made by consumers as they have been in the past. Public expenditures will be particularly important to break supply bottlenecks and to close gaps in health care associated with poverty Actions to Improve Health Care A serious obstacle to the improvement of health care is the shortage of doctors nurses and other professional health workers. The Public Health Service estimates that about one-half million professional and subprofessional health workers are needed to bring standards throughout the country up to those of the northeastern region. Several recent Federal legislative actions have been designed to help to meet the growing need. The Health Professions Educational Assistance Act of extended grants for construction of medical and dental training facilities and initiated programs of student loans. Subsequent legislation expanded the scope of Federal assistance to cover the training of nurses and subprofessional health personnel and added scholarships assistance for school operations and traineeships for teachers in the health professions. Other general Federal manpower programs are also engaged in training subprofessional health personnel Last year the President appointed a National Commission on Health Manpower due to report this June to review remaining needs and to recommend further remedies These new directions in Federal programs are a much-needed complement to long-established support in the areas of research and construction. Under the Hill-Burton Act enacted in more than $ billion including $ billion of Federal funds have been earmarked or spent for construction or modernization of hospitals or extended care facilities with a capacity of beds Although the shortage of nursing homes and other facilities for the aged is acute in some areas a considerable number of vacancies exists in other areas. The development of needed additional centers for group medical practice will be assisted by legislation enacted in to permit Government mortgage insurance for group practice facilities Considerable private and public effort is needed to hold down costs Most health care is now dispensed either in a physician 's office or through hospitals. Decreases in costs are possible through the increased use of clinic stations outpatient facilities diagnostic and treatment centers supervised home care and group practice. Careful study of new arrangements to make better use of scarce skills and facilities must be followed up by incentives for more efficient operation and distribution of health services. Hospital cost accounting and average cost pricing should be reexamined particularly to assure that capital costs are rationally allocated over time and among uses It is essential to avoid any tendency to control costs less carefully as a result of the increasing scale of insurance and prepayment As long as poverty persists Federal State and local governments have a major commitment to help those unable to purchase their own care. And programs to promote the training of health personnel support medical research and improve health care systems impose particular responsibilities on governments at all levels CITIES Americans have been flocking to urban areas since the Revolutionary War when percent of them earned their livelihood on the farm. Today about two-thirds reside in metropolitan areas roughly half in central cities and half in suburbs. Almost all the growth in the total U.S. popu- lation over the next decade will be in metropolitan areas and as in the last decade in suburbs rather than in central cities. But suburbanites also have a major stake in the quality of central cities since they continue to look to the city for jobs recreation and culture Throughout history people and jobs have congregated in cities : the people came in search of jobs ; and the jobs came because employers found benefits in urban location. Firms could pool costs with other firms and share overhead facilities. Specialized services were available to cater to the sporadic and unpredictable demands of a large number of enterprises Firms could locate close to their suppliers ' warehouses and could count on being able to meet unanticipated requirements on very short notice thereby economizing on inventories. It was highly advantageous to locate near ports and rail hubs which in turn became virtually the center of the city 's economic organization The city has lost some of its economic advantages however. Many of the benefits from urban location arose from savings in transportation and communications costs but the automobile and truck have drastically reduced the cost advantage of the central city. The automobile increased congestion on old city streets laid out for other transportation modes and simultaneously made the location of factories and warehouses near beltways and interurban highway connections more advantageous. The development of more efficient faster communications media has also reduced the advantages of central city locations especially for factories and goods-handling enterprises The city has made vital contributions to economic growth in the past and can continue to do so in the future. But the city needs modernization and revitalization to become a more pleasant place in which to live and work and a more effective contributor to economic growth and productivity Both aspects will involve private investment in housing and in plant and equipment and a variety of public actions and expenditures ELEMENTS OF THE URBAN PROBLEM Despite their earlier advantages and the continued preference of many Americans for urban life cities today suffer from a wide range of economic financial and social problems Cities have become congested and noisy. Traffic jams packed subways and buses and crowded airports are not only unpleasant but impose real economic costs in the form of wasted time reduced efficiency and in some cases personal injury and property damage. Noise causes distraction and discomfort. Crime and delinquency seem to be increasing. The problems of air pollution are becoming more and more acute. City water systems have to remove increasing amounts of chemicals and wastes. Trash junk and dirt make life in cities both more expensive and less pleasant. The problems of poverty and unemployment among the young and disadvantaged are on occasion brought to national attention through mass protest or social unrest It is true that important progress is being made. Housing is better than at any time in the past ; communication is faster ; city dwellers are healthier T A B L E Characteristics of population by area Metropolitan Characteristic Population ( millions ) Xonmetropolitan nonfarm All areas Central cities Outside central cities Percent of population : Children under years of age A ged ( years and over ) Non white Poors Median family income ( dollars ) Farm Excludes inmates of institutions and all members of the armed forces except those living off post or with their families on post.

All data from Current Population Survey March except median income from March Survey Sources : Department of Commerce and Department of Health Education and Welfare better educated and wealthier. Incomes in cities are lower than in suburbs but higher than in rural areas ( Table ) But concern about cities is growing because the standards of all Americans are rising and because the poor rightly insist on sharing access to the bounty that most Americans enjoy In particular the concentration of poverty among racial and linguistic minorities in congested areas leads to a problem which is considerably larger than the sum of its parts Shifts in Jobs and Population As industry has moved to the suburbs so have job opportunities. In large metropolitan areas for example new jobs became available in the suburban ring in the period while the central cities of the same metropolitan areas were gaining only new jobs. The central city gains were all in finance insurance real estate and services In manufacturing the central cities lost jobs while their suburban rings gained Throughout the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century the growth of cities was spurred by immigration from abroad. The city provided the immigrant with his basic requirements at low cost neighbors of similar origin inexpensive housing near his job schools health services and convenient shopping. Since the 's immigration from abroad has been replaced by migration from rural areas. With flagging demand for lowskilled workers the cities have been relatively less successful with the new migrants. And for the Negro migrant into the city racial discrimination in housing and inadequate commuter transportation facilities have made it difficult to follow the jobs to the suburbs Urban Blight Meanwhile the physical plants of cities have been aging and deteriorating Because the very heart of the city is still highly attractive to many kinds of enterprises it frequently pays to tear down old buildings and replace them with new and more suitable structures. But outside the very heart of the city private demand for replacement is inadequate to bring about the renewal of the large nearby " gray areas " of housing which were yesterday 's " suburbs " and are today 's slums. Once blight begins natural market forces quicken the decay over a large area as the deterioration of neighborhoods weakens incentives for any one landlord to maintain the condition of his property Mismatch Between Costs and Benefits Urban blight is only one example of how external effects of private actions affect the modern city. The man who drives to work considers that the convenience of driving his own car outweighs the inconvenience of congestion. But his reckoning neglects the costs he imposes on other commuters by increasing the congestion on the highway. In making location decisions an industrialist will not necessarily consider the pollution of air and water which his factory causes. Should he decide to leave the city his calculation will ignore the impact of his departure on city revenues or the local rate of unemployment. In these cases private benefits exceed private costs ; but because costs to the city or even to society at large are not adequately considered in the decision the action may be harmful These discrepancies between private and social calculations distort choices among alternatives and constitute an important part of the cities ' problems All too often the benefits accrue privately while the costs appear in a city 's budget City Finances The sheer proximity of large numbers of people brings special problems and costs to city governments. Cities must supply services to commuters as well as to residents : transportation clean water opportunities for recreation and perhaps most vital of all economic opportunity. The city 's inhabitants demand services from government that may be provided privately or even be unnecessary in the countryside. All these requirements place heavy burdens on public finance in the city. Thus more is spent for government in cities than in other areas ; on a per capita basis medium-size cities spend more than small ones and large cities still more ( Chart ) The relatively high per-capita tax base in cities is more than eaten up by higher costs and outlays On the revenue side of the ledger there are few taxes which cities can effectively collect. Heavy property taxes can drive wealthier homeowners into the suburbs.

Income taxes that can be administered by a city government are apt to be crude and unprogressive payroll taxes. And retail sales taxes administered by cities can sometimes be evaded on large purchases Finally the historical boundaries of the city government 's jurisdiction have become increasingly inadequate for planning financing and executing efficient programs and policies in water supply air and water pollution abatement transportation and many other fields In short too many cities realize the worst of all possible worlds with strained budgets inadequate expenditures for public services ranging from education to law enforcement burdensome property taxes which spur the exodus of wealthier taxpayers and discourage job-creating business and partial excessively costly solutions to problems that extend far beyond the city 's jurisdiction and control MEETING THE CITIES ' PROBLEMS Both public and private investment will be required on a large scale over the next decade to improve the quantity and quality of city housing to modernize public transportation and to upgrade other services provided by city governments to their residents. But money is by no means the only requirement Eliminating Racial Discrimination The removal of the barriers of racial discrimination in housing and jobs will pay large returns at little cost. If the Negro could secure the kind of housing that he is willing and able to pay for in the location of his choice and if he could compete on equal terms for employment the ordinary processes of the market would lead to substantial improvements in the housing stock and would eliminate some of the worst manifestations of poverty. Racial discrimination imposes large costs on the city. Unemployment is higher income is lower housing conditions poorer and welfare budgets larger than they would be if the Negro were free to seek his best options. To begin to unlock the resources of the city the resources of individuals must be unchained. The only cost entailed will be the sacrifice of prejudices The human resources of the city are also wasted by inadequate training and education and by outmoded public transportation systems. The demand for unskilled labor is rising very slowly and jobs of all descriptions are increasingly located outside the city. Training and education as well as better public transportation are therefore indispensable in bringing enough jobs within reach of the city 's labor force Improvements in income maintenance programs discussed earlier in this chapter are especially urgent in the city where the physical concentration of poverty magnifies health welfare and safety hazards. The elimination of racial discrimination in jobs and housing the alleviation of extreme poverty and more adequate education and training for the city 's population would in combination gradually cure many of the city 's present ills But some ailments require more than this Housing and Urban Renewal Housing is a key additional requirement. It has been estimated that for the Nation as a whole about million housing units a year will have to be built over the next decade to meet population growth and to replace units too dilapidated to be worth repairing. It is clear that most housing will be built either in cities or their suburbs and that much replacement building will be in the central cities themselves. Most of this new construction will be financed privately as it is now. But public efforts will also be needed to assist the poor urban and rural to acquire the housing they need While the Federal Government has been assisting local highway construction and urban renewal for many years and has helped to remove many unsightly slums it has been slow in aiding those displaced by some of the projects. After the demolition of unsatisfactory housing the poor have sometimes been worse off having to crowd into the reduced supply of cheap housing still available Public policies for housing the city 's poor have advanced through several stages. Newly constructed public housing has been made available at low cost to those with incomes below a fixed level. To assure that only the poor occupy such housing families are required to vacate if their incomes rise substantially and if there is other good housing they can afford in the community. This tends to leave in public housing the chronically poor families least able to help themselves. Moreover local public authorities have had difficulty producing an adequate number of housing units through this approach Rent Supplements. The newly adopted Rent Supplement program offers promise of increasing the supply of low-income housing by tapping private resources. Under this program multifamily housing will be constructed and operated by approved nonprofit or limited profit private sponsors Subsidies to tenants are provided for the difference between a fair market rental of such apartments and percent of the assisted tenant 's income The recipient pays more of his rent as his income rises but he is not obliged to move out Model Cities. Public programs for renovating the cities have long taken cognizance of the fact that a blighted residential area can not effectively be restored one house at a time. But these programs have not often been applied to the full area for which integrated advance planning is required and have not included a full range of public services which must be coordinated in an effective area-wide attack. The Model Cities legislation enacted last year was drafted in recognition of the need for an integrated assault on urban blight. It provides for the coordinated use of already existing Federal grant and loan programs for planning housing water and sewers health and social services education and training and employment services and perhaps even more important it pays for part of the cost of locally designed and administered programs in the demonstration area which are not covered by other programs. As funding increases it will become a major forward step in a cooperative Federal-local coordinated effort toward urban renovation Community Action Programs. Solution of the problem of poverty like that of urban blight requires a coordinated attack. Especially in cities the interaction of people and the interrelations among such problems as low incomes lack of education substandard housing and ill health mean that a piecemeal approach is inadequate. More than Community Action Agencies supported by the Office of Economic Opportunity now provide this coordination bringing together needy clients and available services Neighborhood centers are serving as a vehicle for decentralizing and im- proving the delivery of social services to disadvantaged people. The Administration is requesting that funds be provided to increase the services which can be made available in rural areas as well as in cities Cost Reduction. Opportunities to reduce the cost of housing improvements must be sought and pursued. The high cost of construction labor puts a premium on the use of labor-saving devices. But institutional barriers to the introduction of new techniques must be overcome. More needs to be done in research and experimentation leading to the development and perfection of new techniques. And new ways must be sought to use public funds to harness private initiative and private resources Pricing Policies Finally the potential efficiency of the market should be recognized in all areas of city life. Transportation is a notable case where the logic of the price system is often violated. Bridge and tunnel tolls typically remain the same whether the road is jammed or empty. If polluters were forced to bear the costs imposed by their actions the quantity of pollution would be substantially reduced. Subsidized airport landing fees may encourage excessive private use of crowded facilities. The pricing of public transportation often fails to take into account the external benefits arising from decongestion of highways. Similiarly more rational pricing systems for water and sewer service in many of our cities could both increase efficiency in the use of existing capacities and reduce the planning and financial burdens of city governments Summary The fundamental challenge to the city is to achieve an orderly transition to a new pattern of land use which reflects the new requirements of industry and people. All of its policies ( zoning taxation transportation ) and all of its investments ( in housing public buildings and education ) must be geared to encourage the emergence of the new patterns. This is essentially what is meant by comprehensive planning and it is the kind of objective which is sought in the Model Cities program and planned metropolitan development incentive grants. The recently established National Commission on Codes Zoning Taxation and Development Standards will explore ways by which cities can undertake creative change The cost of dealing with the overwhelming problems of poverty housing physical and human renewal exceeds the revenue potential of many cities If each city were required to achieve a financial balance within its own borders it would be forced to neglect some of the most pressing social problems of our time. There is no escape from the conclusion that the Federal Government must continue to provide a share of the resources cities need to remain engines of economic and social progress FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL FISCAL RELATIONS Since World War II State and local expenditures have been growing far more rapidly than Federal outlays. To finance their budgets these governments have increased tax rates and assessments frequently ; yet State and local debt has increased sevenfold. Over the same period Federal receipts have generally kept pace with expenditures in peacetime despite reductions in tax rates ; and the net Federal debt has risen only one-fifth falling sharply in relation to GNP The problem of matching revenues with expenditure responsibilities is a never-ending one in our Federal system. Partly by historical accident the Federal Government has developed the best source of revenue namely the income tax. But increasing urbanization and other factors have swelled the demand for public services which are regarded as primarily the responsibility of State and local governments both by tradition and by the preference of the American people for keeping government as close to home as possible TAXATION The Federal Government obtains two-thirds of its revenues from taxes on personal and business incomes. Despite its imperfections the Federal individual income tax is one of the best taxes ever devised. By taxing larger incomes at higher rates it squares with the American notion of equity. Its revenue yield rises strongly as the economy grows. It serves as a built-in stabilizer by varying with economic fluctuations. By comparison with other taxes it interferes least with job choices and expenditure decisions The States rely principally on sales and excise taxes and local governments on property taxes. Broad-based personal income taxes now levied by States were enacted in most cases before the Federal Government began to draw heavily on this source in World War II. A small number of cities use " income " taxes usually in the form of payroll levies. Tables and show the relative importance of different sources of revenue and of expenditure requirements in Sales and property taxes are regressive. A poor family pays a substantial sales tax in most States even if it owes nothing under the Federal income tax. Sales taxes also discriminate among taxpayers in similar economic circumstances. Families with the same incomes but different patterns of consumption may pay different amounts ; and large families may bear a relatively heavier burden than small families. Moreover the yield of sales taxes is less responsive than that of income taxes to economic growth Property taxes which are the major source of financing for education are especially objectionable to homeowners who have no children and cause hardships for those who own their own homes but have relatively low current incomes. They can also discourage private efforts to rehabilitate and upgrade declining neighborhoods.

Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding Source : Department of Commerce l62 enacted about increases in the rates of their major taxes and imposed new taxes including new retail sales taxes In the years ahead the financial pressures on States and localities in the aggregate may moderate somewhat. The age category that produces the largest per capita need for public services school-age children will grow less rapidly than the working age population. Nevertheless pressures will still be strong especially to meet the massive problems of cities imposed by decades of neglect. According to detailed estimates recently made for the Joint Economic Committee construction needs of State and local governments in the next decade will equal those of the last decade Thus the financial problems of State and local governments will persist Currently increased defense expenditures dominate the Federal budget picture. But over the long run there is every prospect of a return to the fiscal paradox of recent years booming income tax revenues for the Federal Government while States and localities struggle to finance their massive program requirements CATEGORICAL FEDERAL AID The Federal Government now provides many grants-in-aid in support of specific categories of State and local expenditure. Federal grants now constitute about one-sixth of total revenues of State and local governments. The first large Federal grant programs were for emergency relief and public assistance during the 1930Js. Federal grants declined during World War II but then grew rapidly in the 's with highway construction grants producing an acceleration in the second half of the decade ( Table ) TABLE -Growth of Federal aid to State and local governments fiscal years 1930-68x Function 19G8 Billions of dollars Total Federal aid Health labor and welfare Commerce and transportation Education __ Housing and community development..

Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding Source : Bureau of the Budget The last few years have seen a rapid acceleration of Federal aid through a variety of new or expanded programs most notably for elementary and secondary education and to combat poverty. In fact most new legislation in areas discussed in this chapter operates through grants or loans to State and local governments The grant-in-aid approach is flexible. It enables the Federal Government to single out the most urgent needs and to apply suitable remedies directly Furthermore by imposing matching formulas where appropriate the Federal Government often can enlist additional State effort in neglected areas Variable matching requirements are used by the Federal Government to pay for a greater share of costs in States and areas where needs are greatest relative to available resources. Federal grants can encourage innovation at the local level and provide for experimentation and demonstration where the problems are more obvious than the remedies. They can be launched modestly and expanded upon demonstration of effectiveness. The grant approach can spur better planning and coordination among overlapping or adjacent and sometimes conflicting local jurisdictions where a regional or areawide problem requires a cooperative and coordinated attack At the same time the categorical grant mechanism is open to some criticisms. State and local officials are sometimes bewildered by the number variety and complexity of eligibility and matching provisions of different Federal aid programs. A special effort is necessary to keep them informed of latest developments so that all eligible units of government may share equitably. And some localities resent Federal standards and " supervision " in grant programs Broadening the Scope of Federal Grants Supporters of categorical aid argue that while there may be faults in the present system they are not intrinsic. Many steps have already been taken to improve grant programs. The Bureau of the Budget has undertaken recently to improve the coordination of Federal programs at the State and local level. The Partnership in Health act of last year combined several small categorical grant authorizations into one and provided assistance for planning comprehensive health services. Similarly the Model Cities program provides for the coordinated use of funds from a number of separate categorical programs as well as from private and local government sources ; it also authorizes Federal assistance for local government programs in the demonstration area of the city even if these would not qualify for any categorical aid. The Community Action Program offers cities support for a broad range of activities that fit into a coordinated attack on poverty These new programs of broad support represent a major evolution from many traditional types of categorical grants in which the Federal Government pinpoints the State and local expenditures it will support These developments are viewed by some observers as a decisive argument for an evolutionary approach that continues to rely on categorical aid as the principle vehicle by which Federal assistance should be given to State and local governments. These observers would argue that effectiveness is limited only by the amounts that the Federal Government can afford to channel to States and localities rather than by any inherent defects in the mechanism of categorical aid GENERAL SUPPORT GRANTS Others contend however that broader " general support " grants are needed as part of Federal support to States and localities. In principle these grants would have no strings attached and would be available for general budget support rather than tied to specific activities or programs. Direct transfers without supervision would leave the States and cities free to set priorities and to design remedies for local problems. The unconditional grant approach lends itself readily to " equalization " to take account of differences in income levels and fiscal capacity among the States. Many proposals recommend setting the size of such grants as a percentage of collections under the Federal individual income tax. One would earmark percent of collections from the Federal individual income tax for general support grants to the States Critics of general support grants have questioned whether State governments would spend the added revenues wisely whether they would maintain their own revenue efforts and whether they would provide adequately for their own cities. Unconditional grants to the States are viewed by some as a threat to additional Congressional appropriations for categorical grant programs which provide direct assistance to cities and their pressing problems Also if States had a claim on a share of Federal revenues they might oppose Federal tax reduction even when needed to combat recession. And if the cut were nevertheless approved its effectiveness could be weakened by a resulting cutback in State outlays Supporters of revenue-sharing point out that formulas can be devised to cope with cyclical swings in general support grants and to channel funds to localities as well as States. However there are obvious difficulties Under some proposed compromise arrangements a fixed level would be established for total Federal financial aid to State and local government designed to cover both categorical grants and general support. Categorical grants would continue to be appropriated as at present ; and the balance of the support would take the form of untied grants going to cities as well as States. The untied portion would serve as an " overhead " payment to be used by States and cities to strengthen their own programs and their planning. Such a compromise is intended to provide some assurance of continued Federal support for categorical grant programs which have established their merit while enlarging opportunities for State and local initiative and responsibility CREDIT FOR STATE INCOME TAXES An additional method of enlarging State revenues in the context of an improved over-all national tax structure has been proposed by the Advisory Commission on Intergovernment Relations. The suggestion is that a credit against Federal personal income tax liability be given for up to percent of State income taxes paid. This credit would provide powerful incentives : the States which do not now have broad-based individual income taxes would be strongly induced to enact them ; States which already have income taxes would be encouraged to rely on them more heavily. A State could then augment its revenues through income taxation with a net increase in the burden on State taxpayers equal to only percent of added revenue. Through the credit device the States would in effect be collecting part of their income taxes from the Federal Government Federal tax credits to influence local tax policy are not new. They are applied to estate or inheritance taxes paid to States and they are used under the Federal-State unemployment insurance system The tax credit device has been subjected to certain criticisms. First by their very nature tax credits provide more help to rich States than to poor States because the amount of assistance depends on the tax base of each State. Second the proposal does not in itself provide direct aid to the cities Third the Federal tax credit adds to State revenues only when and if the States act to initiate or raise rates on income taxes ; the initial impact merely lowers Federal taxes for people who now pay State income taxes JOINT REVENUE COLLECTION It has also been proposed that the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) expand its current assistance to the States in their income tax collection efforts. At present there is cooperative exchange of information between Federal and State revenue officials. But the IRS could act as collecting agent for State income taxes. The State rate structure would be applied against the Federal definition of taxable or adjusted gross income or Federal tax liability itself Joint revenue collection is a modest proposal which could be enacted on its own merits or as a supplement to the larger plans. It might encourage additional States to enact income taxes and should certainly simplify life for both taxpayers and revenue officials in States which already use income taxes It would of course be necessary for the States to follow Federal concepts of taxable income which may not always accord with their own OTHER ISSUES OF TAX COORDINATION Among other problems requiring better coordination of Federal-Statelocal taxation is one dealing with the exemption from taxation under the Federal individual income tax of interest paid on State and local government securities. Because of the exemption these governments can borrow more cheaply paying lower rates of interest and competing more effectively for funds against other borrowers in capital markets. However the exemption also reduces the progressivity of the Federal individual income tax since it produces much bigger tax savings to those in high income tax brackets than to those taxable at lower rates. This is a relatively inefficient means of channeling aid : the Federal Government loses far more revenue than the States and cities gain in reduced interest costs Apart from the general question of interest exemption and of immediate concern is the use of so-called industrial development bonds. Through the use of these bonds localities have passed to private industries the benefit of the exemption of their interest from Federal tax in many cases without assuming any real obligation for repayment of the bonds. This questionable practice is becoming increasingly widespread and the lack of any obligation by the locality authorizing the bonds permits proliferation without limit The use of the Federal tax code in this fashion is inefficient and inappropriate Another fiscal problem concerns State taxation of corporate income Since most corporate income is generated by interstate corporations States must establish formulas to apportion the income assumed to be earned from business done in other areas. The formulas give various weights to such factors as location of plant percent of payroll sales destination location of sales offices and " origin " of sales. In after several years of study the House Judiciary Committee recommended legislation that would require a uniform State formula based solely on two factors property and payroll The States have responded unfavorably to this proposal. As an alternative additional Federal grants to the States might be used to persuade them to relinquish a tax which is more efficiently collected at the national level CONCLUSION Expenditures for income maintenance health and education and revenues of States and cities have grown faster than GNP since the mid1950 's. Expenditures for educational services and health care combined have risen from about 8J4 percent to ^ percent of GNP and expenditures of States and localities have expanded from 8J/2 percent to percent of national output in the past decade. Federal transfer payments to persons have risen from percent to ^ percent of GNP. Through their dollar votes on the market and their votes at the polls ^ Americans have reaffirmed their strong desires for greater expenditures in these areas In response to the wishes of the public these areas will continue to absorb a significant fraction of the gains from economic growth. But it is impossible reliably to forecast how rapidly these outlays will grow or to set in advance meaningful targets for how fast they should increase. Opportunities for progress in these areas will be influenced by the urgency of competing claims on output ranging from national defense to the unlimited aspira- tions of private consumers and from conservation of natural resources and improvements in the quality of our environment to industrial research development and investment. In peacetime the Nation will face repeated and difficult though welcome choices about how to distribute fiscal dividends between public programs and tax reductions. These decisions should be responsive to changing circumstances Moreover it is not possible to stipulate " needs " in the areas discussed in this chapter. If needs are merely what survival requires most of what is needed is now available. And if needs are everything that could be reasonably desired then they will not be fully met for generations A rational balancing of opportunities and alternatives will undoubtedly call for some progress in all of these and other priority areas. Most of the choices both public and private will be incremental in character The individual chooses whether or not to visit his dentist weighing the need against other uses of funds ; he does not decide on health in the abstract or in the large. Similarly the Federal budgetary process is full of efforts to cut low-priority expenditures marginally in order to expedite a promising new program like model cities. Even major program decisions which will be faced in the years ahead such as whether or not to set a minimum income floor to combat poverty or whether or not to select any of the proposed innovations in the area of Federal-State-local fiscal relations could also be approached on an incremental basis. In making these budgetary decisions it is vitally important that goals and objectives be defined precisely that all alternative methods of reaching them be considered that costs and benefits be quantified as far as possible ; only then can the most efficient means of achieving the objectives be chosen. The Planning-Programming-Budgeting System recently initiated by the Bureau of the Budget and the executive agencies of the Federal Government is designed to advance this systematic approach This chapter has attempted to raise some issues which will require difficult choices. Collectively such decisions will determine the directions of social progress in the years ahead It is clear that social progress will make important claims on the Federal budget. There is no easy way to define the Government 's appropriate role. But the pursuit of public interest and the exercise of public responsibility need not add dollar-for-dollar to the bills of taxpayers or to the size of Government. Much of our advance in health education and cities will be financed through the budgets of consumers and businesses. The energies and outlays of private enterprise can be stimulated by wise and imaginative public policies relying on enlightened regulation carefully designed fees and subsidies appropriate tax provisions Government loans and insurance programs and improved functioning of the market economy so that actual prices become better signals for estimating social costs and benefits Within the public sector another set of issues arises : whether particular programs can be administered and financed most effectively by Federal State or local governments and how the over-all division of responsibilities can assure adequate financing for priority social needs through an equitable tax system The aspirations for material and social progress are boundless ; the limits of our potential progress are set by the resource costs and the level of productivity in our society. It can be confidently forecast that the problem will be to find the means to fulfill our public and private aspirations rather than to deal with any redundancy of resources. A decade from now major gains will have been made but there will still be a large inventory of unmet desires and unsolved social problems requiring public and private efforts to channel a substantial additional portion of our growing output toward priority uses Chapter Growth and Balance in the World Economy W ORLD ECONOMIC EXPANSION in the first half of the 's has been sustained and rapid. The pace has probably been surpassed only during the period of recovery from World War II. Moreover since the end of the war the extreme fluctuations of earlier years have not been repeated But continued economic progress is not assured. Many problems remain The most difficult and important is that of overcoming poverty in many of the less developed countries of Africa Asia and Latin America. A major problem for the developed countries is to cope with international financial imbalances in ways which do not inhibit sound economic growth This chapter records the economic progress in both the developed and less developed countries during the first part of the 's and outlines some major issues for international consideration during the remainder of this decade. It deals especially with the policy issues facing the United States and other developed countries in their efforts to achieve a better international balance and to pursue national policies that promote world economic progress. The worldwide economic impact of their national policies places a special responsibility on the major developed countries WORLD ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE 'S Two quantitative goals for economic growth in the 's have been fixed by international organizations : The United Nations has set percent a year as the minimum growth rate for the less developed countries over the 's calling this the " Development Decade. " The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) which includes the countries of Western Europe the United States Canada and Japan has called for an increase in aggregate output of all member countries combined amounting to percent over the decade or an average annual growth rate of percent As can be seen from Table the expansion of real output in the less developed countries estimated at / percent a year so far has fallen somewhat short of the UN target on average and far below it in several TABLE Changes in total and per capita real GNP in OECD and less developed countries since Percentage increase per year Share of total output ( percent ) Country O E C D countries : Total Total real GNP to to Per capita real GNP to to United States Total excluding United States * Germany United Kingdom France Japan Italy Spain Greece.

However the table also shows that output in the OECD countries has been exceeding the growth rate of the OECD target DEVELOPED COUNTRIES In the first half of the 's real output in Western Europe and Japan increased by more than percent a year. Contributing to the rapid expansion were government policies directed toward achieving and maintaining high levels of employment with reasonable price stability stimulating the movement of labor from low to high productivity employment reducing barriers to foreign trade and encouraging the more efficient utilization of resources in other ways A high rate of capital formation helped to achieve this rapid growth. Investment averaged percent of gross national product ( GNP ) in the OECD countries other than the United States ; it ranged from almost percent in Japan to less than percent in the United Kingdom. While much of the increase in output comes from investment in physical capital and from the incorporation of technological advances a good deal also comes from investment in human capital in raising the education skills and health of the population The growth of output is also benefiting from the movement of labor out of activities of low productivity to those of higher productivity. There has been a large-scale movement of labor from Southern Europe to Northwestern Europe from areas of low productivity low incomes and high unemployment to areas where productivity and incomes are high and unemployment low. Within countries the major shift has been out of employment in agriculture. The OEGD estimates that this latter shift alone accounted for between and percent of the increase in productivity during the first half of the 's in France Germany Italy and Japan. The United Kingdom which by already had only a small agricultural sector did not have this source of expanding productivity Internal shifts of labor have been stimulated and facilitated by the expansion of foreign trade which has far exceeded the growth of output The rapid growth of trade has resulted in part from the reduction of trade barriers especially within the two regional groupings the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and the European Free Trade Association ( EFTA ) For a number of European countries and Japan a rapid rise in exports has also directly stimulated the growth of GNP. In addition when domestic expansion is led by export growth the resulting rise in imports can be readily financed ; there is less chance that the government will need to apply the brakes to reverse a developing balance of payments deficit LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES The achievement of an adequate rate of self-sustaining growth in the less developed countries remains an urgent world economic problem. Over half of the 4J/2 percent annual growth of total output for the less developed areas has been needed just to maintain their low level of living since their populations have been rising by ^ percent annually. The yearly increase in per capita output has been only percent or barely $ a person Achieving rapid and sustainable growth in these countries is by no means a hopeless task however. Self-sustaining growth has been attained in certain less developed countries including Israel Malaysia Mexico Taiwan Venezuela and some Central American countries. Others such as Pakistan South Korea Thailand and Turkey are approaching that objective But the problems are formidable. Further efforts by both the developed and the less developed countries are required. The rapid growth of population in many less developed countries already over-populated in relation to their economic resources must be slowed. A number of these nations have adopted measures to induce their citizens to limit the size of their families. Some of these programs in Hong Kong Singapore and Taiwan have already shown signs of success. Nevertheless the growth rate of population in the less developed countries as a group is still rising Another major problem area is agriculture. Agricultural output has grown so slowly that food output per person in many countries is below pre-World War II levels. Unless a vigorous effort is made to redress the situation it is likely to deteriorate further as population and need for food continue to grow rapidly. Moreover in at least some of the less developed countries agricultural development may be a key to general economic growth. The application of improved farming techniques can substantially improve agricultural productivity with relatively small increments of capital ; increased agricultural output can be a major substitute for imports ; rising farm income can provide an expanding market for domestic industrial output The developed countries can do much to help by providing technical assistance food fertilizers agricultural equipment and financing. But the basic responsibility rests on the less developed countries themselves. They must among other things improve the incentives for farmers to increase output Education also is a major field in which improvement is essential. Economic progress requires literacy. A modern and expanding economy needs much more people trained to operate farm machinery run a lathe operate a retail store and keep accounts. In recognition of the importance of education the less developed countries have in recent years increased their education budgets by percent annually. This effort has long been supported by the United States. More Agency for International Development ( AID ) technicians working abroad are employed in educational projects than in any other field. Moreover beginning in fiscal year AID is sharply increasing its educational aid effort as well as its work in agriculture and health. The educational efforts of our Peace Corps workers are also welcomed throughout the less developed world The Need for Capital The developing countries also need capital. About one-fourth of their domestic investment is financed by capital imports. From to the net amount of this capital inflow rose by only percent a year in money terms and less in real terms. Some increase continued into Since the entire increase from abroad has been in private capital flows This investment to be sure benefits the recipient countries and the United States has taken steps to encourage it. But it has gone mainly to the extractive industries particularly oil. Thus it is unevenly distributed among countries. Further investment in technologically advanced some240-782 O ' u times highly automated extractive processes does not have the same stimulating effects on general economic activity as does investment in local manufacturing. It does however provide much needed foreign exchange and technological know-how for those countries fortunate enough to be wellendowed with minerals For many developing nations a growing burden of interest and amortization payments on external debt absorbs a large and rising proportion of gross aid receipts. In debt service charges amounted to percent of the official bilateral aid receipts of less developed countries ; today the figure is percent. India 's debt service charges on government assistance for the period of its Third Plan amounted to percent of its foreign aid. In Turkey debt service during was more than half as large as gross foreign aid For the net inflow of aid merely to remain constant the gross inflow must rise to cover growing debt service. In fact the gross flow of government aid from the developed countries has been rising just enough to keep net aid inflow on a plateau since Future prospects are even less encouraging Bilateral aid commitments pledges of actual aid disbursements to be made in the future declined in This could foreshadow a decline in net and even in gross official aid disbursements in the years to come The stagnation in the net flow of official capital to the less developed countries has come at the very time that the industrial countries have reached new heights of prosperity. And it comes at a time when the pace of economic expansion achieved by the less developed countries as a group is encouraging. They are developing the skills required for a modern economy. They are capable of using more capital than they can raise domestically or borrow abroad on commercial terms. For this and other reasons foreign aid both bilateral and multilateral should have a high priority claim on the resources of high-income countries One of the most fruitful avenues for increased aid to the less developed countries is through the multilateral lending agencies the World Bank family and the regional development banks. The United States firmly supports these agencies as mechanisms for mobilizing both external capital and domestic resources of the developing countries themselves. Replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association ( IDA ) which lends on easy terms ought to be high on the agenda of the developed countries. The IDA 's resources should be substantially increased in ways which take into account the balance of payments situation of the contributing countries. The recently established Asian Development Bank represents a new stage in Asian economic cooperation in which the United States is participating with other non-Asian countries. For Latin America the United States continues its strong support of the Inter-American Development Bank which serves as the financial arm of the Alliance for Progress and is helping to draw funds from inside and outside the hemisphere into Latin American development. The African Development Bank which has recently begun operations will perform similar functions in its area Foreign aid and private foreign investment finance only one-fifth of the foreign exchange expenditures of the developing countries. The remaining four-fifths is financed by their own export earnings. After near stagnation in the late 's these earnings rose by about percent a year during the first half of the 's. The increase was produced by many factors including strengthened prices for many primary commodities the growing ability of the less developed countries to supply these commodities and the rapidly expanding markets in the United States Western Europe and Japan. Only with continued vigorous growth in the developed world and improved access to its markets can the less developed countries earn the foreign exchange needed to support their own continuing growth TRADE POLICIES The less developed countries obviously have much to gain from reductions in tariffs quotas and other barriers to trade in primary products since such products constitute percent of their exports. Over the longer run satisfactory growth in the export earnings of the less developed countries will require relatively less reliance on sales of primary products and continuation of the sharp expansion in exports of manufactured goods. Such diversification will also be important for their internal growth. Reductions in tariffs and other trade barriers in developed countries can contribute much to the needed growth of manufactured exports from developing countries In most of the less developed countries internal markets are too small to support efficient modern industrial plants. It is not geographic size or population but effective purchasing power that determines the size of a market. Regional cooperation can create larger markets so that the enterprises of the developing countries can benefit from the economies of scale and of specialization on which growth and efficiency depend Encouraging progress toward regional integration is being made in a number of areas. The Latin American Free Trade Association despite handicaps can form the basis for a true Latin American common market Particular progress has been made in the Central American Common Market The United States supports outward-looking regional integration The importance of trade expansion as a factor in economic growth in all countries argues strongly for more rapid trade liberalization. This proposition is effectively demonstrated by the recent experience in the new free-trade areas of Europe just as it was earlier demonstrated in the great common market of the United States. Thus it is essential that success be achieved in the current multilateral trade negotiations by far the most comprehensive in history Kennedy Round This success is important to both the developed and less developed countries. The substantial reduction in tariff barriers which the United States and other countries are seeking to achieve in the Kennedy Round negotiations should make an important contribution to increased world trade Expanding world trade encourages capital and labor to move out of those economic activities which are better supplied from abroad and into those fields which provide higher real income through greater productivity. By permitting countries to produce efficiently and on a large scale freer trade makes a contribution to higher incomes everywhere. And through reduction of artificial shelters to laggard domestic industries the lowering of barriers to imports spurs innovation and efficiency In the Kennedy Round the major reductions in barriers to world trade are expected to be made by the developed countries the United States EEC EFT A and Japan. EFT A has now virtually eliminated barriers to industrial trade among its members while the EEC will do so for both industrial and agricultural products by July The reduction of barriers to trade with nonmember countries would now help these groups to continue their rapid pace of growth and would avoid distortion of the normal pattern of European trade in particular and world trade generally The less developed countries are not being asked to grant tariff concessions that would endanger their economic development programs Longer-Run Tasks A successful Kennedy Round will be a great achievement and will promote rapid and healthy economic expansion throughout the world. But the Kennedy Round can not be the end of the road for the liberalization of world trade. In the year ahead further study and international consultation should be directed at four remaining tasks in the trade field : ( ) Continuing efforts to liberalize those tariff and nontariff barriers which will remain after the Kennedy Round ; ( ) Developing a better international pattern of agricultural production and trade to speed economic growth ; ( ) Achieving more stable export prices and raising the export volume of developing countries ; ( ) Improving economic relations between the countries of Eastern Europe including the Soviet Union and the United States President Johnson has emphasized the importance of this last task on several occasions. In his recent State of the Union Message he noted that the Export-Import Bank can now extend commercial credits to Bulgaria Czechoslovakia Hungary and Poland as we 'll as to Rumania and Yugoslavia. He called again for legislative authority to extend most-favorednation i.e. nondiscriminatory tariff treatment to the countries of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Their trade with Western Europe has increased steadily in recent years while U.S. trade with these countries has been stagnant and constitutes less than percent of all U.S. foreign trade U.S. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS A country 's foreign trade and payments are its main points of economic contact with the rest of the world. The balance of payments of any nation is intimately dependent on policies and developments in the outside world U.S. exports depend heavily on European Canadian and Japanese growth and the foreign exchange receipts of the less developed countries as well as on U.S. growth and price stability. The flow of capital from the United States depends on profit opportunities and monetary conditions abroad as well as on those in the United States For most of the decade following World War II U.S. balance of payments deficits provided needed international currency to support the rapid expansion of world trade and economic growth. Other countries were eager to hold more dollars ; indeed it was commonly known as a period of " dollar shortage. " Recently however as foreign reserves have increased U.S deficits have been less welcome These deficits do not of course contradict the unmatched strength and productivity of the U.S. economy ; neither do they mean that our competitive position in world markets is weak. The United States is not living beyond its means increasing its net debt to foreign countries or using up its international capital. U.S. ownership of assets abroad continues to grow faster than foreign ownership of assets in the United States. U.S. assets abroad net of foreign assets in the United States increased from $ billion in to $ billion in ; by they had risen to $ billion ; and in they were $ billion The deficits have however resulted in a steady erosion of the U.S. stock of reserve assets which are needed to maintain a stable value of the dollar in international transactions. At the same time there have been steady increases in U.S. liabilities to foreigners that may be considered potential claims against our reserve assets. This combination implies a continuing decline in liquidity ; it is clearly not indefinitely sustainable if confidence in the safety and stability of the dollar is to be maintained The U.S. balance of payments performance is now evaluated in terms of two alternative accounting definitions. Both measure an over-all U.S deficit or surplus in terms of what is currently happening to ( ) U.S. reserves and ( ) certain types of claims against the United States. Both count as an increase or decrease in reserves any change in the sum of U.S. holdings of monetary gold U.S. " gold tranche " claims on the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and U.S. official holdings of convertible foreign currencies They differ in how they treat changes in various outstanding claims against the United States One measure the " official reserve transactions " balance treats any increase in foreign private claims on the United States liquid or illiquid as an ordinary capital inflow. Only the change in claims on the United States held by foreign official agencies is counted along with the change in U.S reserves as a measure of the U.S. deficit or surplus. Foreign official monetary agencies have the privilege of converting claims on the United States into gold at the U.S. Treasury ; their net purchases thus add to the direct claims on U.S. reserves. Moreover they are charged with maintaining stable exchange rates for their national currencies. They usually do this by buying or selling dollars to close any gap between normal supply and demand for dollars which might otherwise upset the exchange rate between the dollar and their currency. In this sense the net balance of such transactions by other countries together with changes in our own reserves is one indicator of the size of the imbalance in U.S. payments The alternative " liquidity " balance attempts an assessment of changes in the U.S. liquidity position. It takes account of the fact that liquid dollar holdings of private foreigners may be readily sold to foreign central banks. It therefore treats only increases in foreign non-liquid claims on the United States as ordinary capital inflows. Changes in all liquid claims are included along with changes in U.S. reserve assets as a measure of the U.S balance regardless of whether the claims are acquired or sold by an official agency or by a private individual bank or business While these measures of balance are important they must be viewed as indicators rather than definitions of equilibrium. In part the limitation arises because any measure of balance must arbitrarily divide dollar assets into two distinct groups those Which are claims against our reserves and those which are not. Such a clear division does not exist in reality. To a degree any marketable dollar asset can be indirectly exercised as a claim against U.S. reserves. Moreover the likelihood that assets will be used as a claim against U.S. reserves depends not only on their marketability and maturity but also on the motivation and attitude of current and prospective holders. Evidence on such attitudes including the performance of the dollar in foreign exchange markets helps to interpret the U.S. position. But however that position is assessed the U.S. balance of payments clearly has not been in sustainable equilibrium in recent years and must be improved Where a sustainable equilibrium may lie over the long run is not completely clear. The expansion of international transactions most of which are settled in dollars suggests that some growth of foreign private holdings of dollars is natural and desirable and may be perfectly sustainable. Some increase in official claims on the United States may also occur over the long run given the preference of many countries to hold all or some of their official reserves in dollars and the fact that transactions needs of official agencies will continue to expand. Regardless of the movement of dollar holdings abroad however continuing U.S. reserve losses would not be compatible with sustained equilibrium. On the other hand any growth of either official or official plus private liquid holdings of dollars need not be precisely equaled by growth of U.S. reserve assets in order that sustainable equilibrium be achieved REGENT DEVELOPMENTS The U.S. liquidity deficit widened slightly in while the official settlements balance registered a small surplus for the first time since The liquidity deficit had improved markedly in and showed a slight further improvement through the first three quarters of Preliminary evidence points to a somewhat larger fourth quarter liquidity deficit which will bring the year 's total slightly above the $ billion deficit of During the year there was an extraordinary buildup of foreign private dollar holdings which resulted in a small surplus on official settlements Despite the surplus on official settlements net gold sales continued as foreign monetary authorities reduced their dollar claims on the United States. While sales to France were $ million in the net reduction in the U.S. gold stock for the year was $ million Full data on the U.S. balance of payments are available only for the first three quarters of Unless otherwise noted all figures for used below represent the total of these first three quarters at a seasonally adjusted annual rate The structure of the balance of payments in and was markedly different from that of previous years. The surplus on goods and services which had been rising from to dropped sharply in and On the other hand the net outflow on capital account was also greatly reduced in both years ( Chart and Table ) These developments can in large measure be attributed to ( ) the increase in the direct costs of the war in Vietnam ( ) the sharp rise in imports induced by the rapid economic expansion and the heightened pressure on domestic resources ( ) the exceptionally tight monetary conditions of and ( ) the balance of payments programs inaugurated in The last two factors were important in accomplishing a large reduction in U.S. bank lending abroad and in attracting an exceptional inflow of foreign capital The Balance on Goods and Services The U.S. surplus on goods and services more than doubled from to reaching an exceptional peak of $ / billion. Subsequently however the surplus declined. As the combined result of a narrowing trade surplus and sharply increased military expenditures in it fell to $ / billion Trade. The trade surplus fell through the first three quarters of to the lowest level since The most striking factor in this deterioration Chart U.S. Balance of International Payments BILLIONS O F DOLLARS EXPORTS AND IMPORTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES EXPORTS IMPORTS I I I I I I ^ / CAPITAL FLOWS FOREIGN U.S. PRIVATE J | | I J/ BALANCE OFFICIAL RESERVE TRANSACTIONS BASIS ^ mmmmmmmm LIQUIDITY BASIS I i i I I J/FIRST QUARTERS AT SEASONALLY ADJUSTED ANNUAL RATES J/EXCLUDING OFFICIAL RESERVE TRANSACTIONS i/EXCLUDING LIQUID CAPITAL SOURCE : DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE I I I ^ TABLE United States balance of payments [ Billions of dollars ] Type of transaction Balance on goods and services_ Balance on merchandise tradeMilitary expenditures net Balance on other services Remittances and pensions Government grants and capital net U.S. private capital net Foreign nonliquid capital net Errors and omissions BALANCE ON LIQUIDITY BASIS Plus : Foreign private liquid capital n e t Less : Increases in nonliquid liabilities to foreign monetary authorities BALANCE ON OFFICIAL TRANSACTIONS BASIS RESERVE Gold ( decrease ) Convertible currencies ( decrease -f ) I M F gold tranche position ( decrease -f ) Foreign monetary official claims ( increase-f ) ( ) * First quarters at seasonally adjusted annual rates except as noted Includes changes in Treasury liabilities to certain foreign military agencies during Included above under foreign nonliquid capital * Less than $ million * First quarters at unadjusted annual rates NOTE. Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding Source : Department of Commerce was the sharp acceleration in the growth of merchandise imports beginning in to an annual rate of about percent. In imports rose to about percent of GNP the highest in the postwar period from about percent in and an average of less than percent in previous years of the 's Imports of capital goods rose by about percent and accounted for more than percent of the increase in imports in For the second consecutive year they rose sharply as a percentage of total domestic purchases of capital goods. As the increasing demand for capital goods began to strain domestic capacity in and even more in purchasers increasingly turned to foreign suppliers to get prompt delivery. While less than percent of domestic requirements was imported in about percent of the increase in domestic purchases of capital equipment between and and over percent between and was accounted for by additional imports. The earlier strains and pressures continued to affect imports especially for long lead-time items in the second half of after the pace of over-all economic advance had moderated Export performance in was healthy despite domestic demand pressures. Exports were more than percent greater than in even after adjustment for the effects of the dock strike. The U.S. share of world exports ( excluding exports to the United States ) remained stable while the U.S. share of world exports of manufactured goods rose slightly A major source of the strength of U.S. exports in the 's has been the stability of the U.S. cost-price structure while costs and prices have been rising elsewhere. Recent price developments in the United States however brought this relative improvement to a halt. Even so unit labor costs in manufacturing have risen less rapidly in the United States during than in most other industrial countries. On the whole it appears that the U.S. competitive position with respect to prices and costs was essentially unchanged in Other Goods and Services. Overseas military expenditures increased in by more than $ million after having been relatively stable for several years. The war in Vietnam of course was the cause of the increase Expenditures in Europe still account for about percent of the total but have been largely offset by purchases of U.S. military equipment and by various financial transactions Other items in the goods and services balance behaved normally. Investment income receipts expanding by percent showed continued strength. U.S. travel expenditures abroad also continued to increase. Foreign travel expenditures in the United States rose faster on a percentage basis but by less in dollar amount than the expenditures of U.S. nationals abroad The deterioration of the U.S. balance on goods and services during in summary reflected primarily pressures stemming from the rapid advance of the domestic economy and the foreign exchange costs of the hostilities in Vietnam The Capital Account As shown in Table net U.S. private capital outflows fell from a record $ billion in to $ billion in and remained essentially unchanged in U.S. Purchases of Foreign Securities. After a sharp rise in new issues of foreign securities in U.S. markets beginning in the United States in July imposed an Interest Equalization Tax ( IET ) on purchases from foreigners of securities of issuers in developed economies other than Canada The IET was designed as a partial offset to the lower interest rates which prevailed in U.S. capital markets as a result of better organization and greater competitiveness and of the need for the United States to press toward full employment of its resources through expansionary fiscal and monetary policies The IET has worked well. From through U.S. net purchases of foreign securities averaged about $ million annually down TABLE United States balance of payments : Capital transactions [ Billions of dollars ] Type of capital transaction U.S. private capital net Direct investmentNew foreign security issues. __ Other transactions in foreign securities 2__ U.S. bank claims Other claims _ ( ) ( ) Foreign nonliquid capital net Direct investment U.S. securities ( excluding Treasury issues ) __ Long-term U.S. bank liabilities.

The outflow of direct investment funds from the United States began to accelerate in By the flow was more than double that in The years and also saw a sharp rise in loans abroad by U.S. banks. The total outflow of U.S. capital in was more than $ ^ billion in excess of its average in Although the outflow of portfolio capital and bank loans is largely explained by differentials in the cost of borrowing and the efficiency of U.S financial markets the increase in direct foreign investment by U.S. corporations in the last few years is somewhat more difficult to explain. The rapid increase in investment in Europe generally reflects of course a desire to participate in a large and rapidly expanding new market Earnings on investments in Europe however have fallen since Between and rates of return on investments of U.S. manufacturing affiliates in Europe at to percent were significantly higher each year than the to percent earned by U.S. manufacturers at home However since earnings on direct investments in Europe have varied between and percent about the same as or in even below those in the United States. It is possible that long-term plans for expansion of foreign operations decided upon in the earlier period have dictated the large investment outflows of recent years Whatever the reasons for the sharp increase in direct investment and bank lending in it clearly was imposing an intolerable strain on the U.S balance of payments Consequently early in the United States introduced a program of voluntary restraint on foreign investment by U.S. corporations and banks This program was designed to moderate the capital outflow to the developed countries while not interfering with the flow to the less developed The Federal Reserve program requested that banks limit their increase in claims on foreigners in to percent of the outstanding claims at the start of the year ; a further percent increase was the suggested limit in Banks were asked to give priority to export financing and credits to less developed countries. Similar guidelines were applied to foreign lending by other financial institutions. This program together with the effects of tight money achieved a $ 2j/2 billion favorable swing in bank lending from to and a further $ million improvement in The Department of Commerce early in asked large nonfinancial corporations to make a maximum effort to expand their net payments balances and to repatriate liquid funds. Late in corporations were asked to limit their average annual direct investment outflows ( including reinvested earnings but net of U.S. corporate borrowing abroad ) for to specified developed and oil exporting countries to no more than percent of the average annual flow in Under the Commerce program firms have been encouraged to obtain maximum foreign financing. An indication of the program 's success is the sharp surge in U.S. corporate borrowing abroad. In particular U.S. corporations issued more than $ million of securities in foreign capital markets during the first three quarters of ( These issues are included in Table under foreign investment in U.S. securities ; it offsets a part of the debit on direct investment. ) In addition borrowing by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations has increased reducing the need for outflows from the United States With these adjustments in financing U.S. corporations continued their extraordinary expansion of plant and equipment expenditures abroad Outlays in were more than percent higher than in ; a further substantial increase is estimated for to an amount nearly double the outlays in The increase from to in U.S. manufacturing investment in EEC countries may have been more than one-third Foreign Capital. Higher yields on U.S. securities in attracted a large inflow of foreign capital particularly into Government agency obligations and certificates of deposit issued by U.S. banks. Foreign official agencies and international organizations shifted a substantial volume of liquid dollar claims into these instruments The inflow of foreign private liquid capital that occurred in the third quarter of was particularly large. U.S. monetary tightness provided a strong pull to such funds. Some of the inflow clearly reflected a movement out of sterling during the period of acute pressure in July and August Although an upward trend in private foreign demand for dollar balances is to be expected the surge that occurred in the third quarter will obviously not continue and may be partly reversed in the future Most of the inflow represented borrowing by U.S. banks from their foreign branches as the home offices of U.S. banks responded to tightness in their reserve positions. The foreign branches able to offer higher rates to depositors than those allowed in the United States gathered a substantial volume of short-term funds abroad. Although this flow of funds did not reduce the U.S. deficit on liquidity account it did prevent what would otherwise have been a larger flow of dollars into the hands of foreign official monetary agencies and thereby placed the official settlements account in substantial surplus in the third quarter. It probably held down the loss in U.S. reserve assets at a time when there was temporary deterioration in other parts of the balance of payments i PROSPECTS AND POLICIES FOR The U.S. trade surplus should resume its growth in Indeed improvement may have begun in the fourth quarter of Success of the domestic economic policies described in Chapter will be essential to improvement of the trade surplus. A moderate pace and more balanced pattern of domestic economic advance should lower the ratio of imports to domestic income from the peak recorded in While imports grow at a slower rate export expansion should continue to be strong given favorable growth rates in foreign markets and the increase in dollar earnings enjoyed by foreigners in The easing of domestic demand pressures and more stable prices should enable U.S. producers to take full advantage of export opportunities In addition the U.S. Government will undertake further active efforts to promote exports in part through expanded credit facilities of the ExportImport Bank. Steps are also being taken to attract a substantially larger number of tourists to the United States. The special task force on travel which the President will appoint in the near future should lay the groundwork for a greatly intensified long-run effort in this area Military expenditures abroad will continue to be large although they will probably grow at a slower rate than in At the same time the excess of investment income receipts over payments should show a substantial growth. The surplus on goods and services then should improve in Just as the capital account of the U.S. balance of payments last year benefited greatly from the sharp tightening of monetary conditions relaxation of credit could create pressures in for increased private capital outflows and reduced foreign inflows. This makes it especially important that the programs to limit capital outflows be continued and strengthened Strengthened Voluntary Programs The guidelines for the Federal Reserve and the Department of Commerce voluntary restraint programs issued last December reflect these considerations. Commercial banks by late were more than $ billion under their Federal Reserve guideline ceilings. To limit the potential increase in total foreign lending during the Federal Reserve asked each bank to continue to observe throughout its existing ceiling of percent of the claims outstanding as of the end of Banks were also asked to use their leeway under the ceiling only gradually not more than one-fifth of it per quarter beginning with the fourth quarter of Moreover to assure that such credits as are extended will be devoted primarily to the financing of exports or to meet the credit needs of developing countries any increase in nonexport credits to developed countries is to be limited to percent of the leeway existing on September New and greatly simplified guidelines were also issued for nonbank financial institutions The guidelines for the Department of Commerce voluntary program to restrain direct investment outlays of business firms abroad were also strengthened. The ceiling on direct investment outflow plus overseas retained earnings for the average of the two years was lowered to percent of the average. With the strengthened program the total of direct investment outflows net of borrowings abroad and retained overseas earnings in is expected to be below the actual level now estimated for The program will continue to permit the expansion of U.S. plant and equipment expenditures in those countries covered to the extent that the expansion can be financed from foreign sources. It also remains a fully voluntary program confined to investments in developed and oil exporting countries Extension of 1ET As a further measure to strengthen existing programs the President is requesting a 2-year extension of the IET now scheduled to expire in mid-196 and is asking for authority to vary the effective rate of the tax between zero and percent a year. By present law the tax adds percentage point in effect to the annual interest costs of those foreigners subject to the tax who borrow at long term in the United States or who sell securities to U.S. citizens The discretionary authority sought by the President would permit a rapid and flexible response to changing monetary conditions at home and abroad. Although the present percent rate has virtually eliminated new security issues of countries which are not exempted the current rate could prove ineffective if foreign countries do not lower their high interest rates while U.S. monetary conditions ease BALANCE OF PAYMENTS ADJUSTMENT POLICIES As countries grow at different rates and in different ways payments imbalances are bound to arise. The adjustment policies of each country will directly affect not only its payments balance but its own internal economic performance and the payments balances of other countries. Therefore payments adjustment should be pursued in ways compatible with each country 's major domestic objectives and with the broad interests of the entire international community REPORT ON THE ADJUSTMENT PROCESS During important progress was made toward developing a greater international consensus on policies best suited for adjusting payments imbalances. A report by Working Party of the OECD prepared by representatives of the ten major industrial countries carefully explored the nature of the adjustment process and pointed to various possibilities for improving it The report recommended various ways of strengthening national policy instruments and outlined a set of informal guidelines regarding appropriate adjustment policies. In addition it suggested a number of steps to improve adjustment procedures through greater international cooperation including collective reviews of countries ' balance of payments aims ; the setting up of an " early warning " system for prompter identification and better diagnosis of payments imbalances ; and the strengthening of international consultations with respect to the sharing of responsibilities for adjustment. These suggestions stemmed from the report 's major conclusions which included the following : First countries need to formulate their balance of payments aims more clearly and base their individual and joint policies on aims that are mutually consistent as well as desirable from the viewpoint of a healthy world economy Second responsibility for adjustment must fall on both surplus and deficit countries Third countries need to have available and make use of a wider range of policy instruments both general and selective and to tailor such instruments more finely to the requirements of different circumstances and multiple policy goals. There is particular need in many cases to place greater reliance on fiscal policies and less on monetary policies in achieving internal economic balance because of the important international ramifications of changes in monetary policy Fourth the proper combination of policy instruments depends on the situations encountered and the particular characteristics of the country concerned. No single policy prescription is appropriate in all cases Fifth countries must take continuous account of the impact of their actions on other countries. A special need for international consultation exists in the field of monetary policy to avoid inappropriate levels of interest rates U.S. ADJUSTMENT POLICIES The strategy adopted by the United States to improve its international payments position can be viewed in the light of the adjustment principles outlined by Working Party U.S. policy has been designed to minimize interference with basic domestic and international objectives of this Nation and with the healthy development of the world economy Monetary and fiscal policies were used in to restrain demand in the light of both domestic and balance of payments considerations. The United States has continued to pursue a liberal trade policy. It has maintained its flow of economic assistance to the less developed countries Direct interference with international transactions has been essentially limited to Government transactions and restraints on the outflow of capital to the developed countries of the world Policy on Goods and Services Resort to controls over private international transactions in goods and services has been avoided as harmful to both the United States and the world economy. The long and steady progress toward trade liberalization could well be reversed by even " temporary " restrictions which could threaten to become permanent shelters of protection for economic interest groups Thus U.S. actions to deal with the balance of payments problem have maintained the trend toward trade liberalization in which the United States has taken strong and consistent leadership since On the other hand vigorous action has been taken to minimize the foreign exchange costs of U.S. Government programs. There is no precedent for the economic and military assistance extended to foreign countries and the military expenditures made abroad by the U.S. Government since World War II. The acceptance of these responsibilities has involved a major balance of payments drain U.S. nonmilitary foreign aid programs which net of loan repayments currently amount to $ billion a year now have only a limited net balance of payments impact. This has been achieved by tying aid so far as feasible to purchases of U.S. goods and services. Although tying is already broadly applied and probably can not be usefully extended in any major degree continuing effort is required to assure the effectiveness of the techniques employed U.S. offshore military expenditures have been substantial during the entire postwar period reflecting national security requirements and commitments to allies in an unsettled world. The impact of these expenditures on the U.S. balance of payments was reduced from a high of $ billion to less than $ billion in ; the Vietnam war caused a sharp increase to $ billion in ( first three quarters at annual rate ) At the same time deliveries of military equipment sold to foreign countries rose from about $ million a year in to about $ billion for the full year The foreign exchange costs of the security program even excluding Vietnam remain high. The United States is prepared to play its full part in supplying the necessary real resources for the common defense. But it seems reasonable to expect those allied countries whose payments positions benefit from U.S. expenditures for the common defense to adopt measures to neutralize their " windfall " foreign exchange gains especially when their reserve positions are strong. This could be done in many ways. Specific arrangements could be worked out within the framework of the alliance itself Such arrangements could relieve strategic planning from balance of payments constraints which in the extreme could jeopardize our national security and that of our allies Policy on Capital Flows Over the years the outflow of U.S. capital has made a major contribution to world economic growth. By providing capital to areas where it is relatively scarce U.S. foreign investment raises foreign incomes and often leads to a more efficient use of world capital resources. U.S. direct investment has provided a vehicle for the spread of advanced technology and management skills. U.S. foreign investment also has yielded handsome returns to American investors and substantial investment income receipts for the balance of payments Despite the advantages of U.S. foreign investment both to the recipient countries and to the United States it can like every good thing be overdone. And it was being overdone in the early 's. Just as a person must weigh and balance opportunities for investment that will be highly profitable in the future against his current wants so must a nation weigh the benefits of future foreign exchange income against current requirements. The costs of adjusting other elements in the balance of payments may be greater than the costs of sacrificing future investment income It is often true that U.S. investment abroad generates not only a flow of investment income but also additional U.S. exports. From a balance of payments standpoint this is an additional dividend. Yet it is also true in some cases that U.S. plants abroad supply markets that would otherwise have been supplied from the United States with a consequent adverse direct effect on U.S. exports It is sometimes held that the international flow of capital occurs always and automatically in just the economically " correct " amount and that any effort to affect this flow through government measures constitutes a subtraction from the economic welfare of the country of origin the country of receipt and the entire world community. Such a position can not be sustained While much of the large flow of U.S. capital to the developed countries is no doubt a response to a shortage of real capital there relative to the United States the flow is also influenced by many other factors. These may include O cyclical differences in capacity utilization differences in monetary conditions and financial structure speculation on exchange rates tax advantages and opportunities for tax evasion none of which necessarily leads to a more rational pattern of international investment High prospective returns on investment in a particular country may reflect a particular choice of policies in the recipient country that is quite unrelated to any underlying shortage of capital. If a country chooses to channel the bulk of its private saving into low productivity uses if it employs a tight monetary policy if it limits access of its own nationals to its capital market it will attract foreign capital. Restraint on such capital flows may therefore merely mean that more of the adverse effect of such domestic policies on economic growth will rest as perhaps it should on the country that made the policy choice Trade restrictions may also lead to a flow of capital that would not otherwise take place. U.S. investment in the EEC has at least in part been induced by the desire to get within the tariff walls erected around a large and growing market. If however a continued movement toward trade liberalization may be expected the economic justification for some part of these capital flows is lessened One major stimulant for direct investment abroad is undoubtedly the substantial advantage in technology and managerial skills which U.S. firms often possess. The international transfer of these factors may be embodied in a capital outflow independent of the relative scarcity of capital. Action would thus be appropriate not necessarily to curtail the investment itself which would interfere with the beneficial transfer of the scarce technology and skills but to transfer the source of financing to the area receiving the direct investment. This indeed is the primary intention and the result of the present voluntary program on direct investment Finally differential monetary conditions among countries can induce capital flows. But monetary policy is an important and useful instrument of domestic stabilization and growth as well as of balance of payments adjustment. During U.S. monetary policy was oriented to serve domestic expansion. In it contributed to a desirable restraint on internal demand and to an improved balance of payments. In relaxation of U.S. monetary policy has begun in order to help obtain a better balance of internal demand. Appropriate use of restraints on capital outflows in such forms as the voluntary programs and the IET can usefully supplement monetary policy in promoting domestic and international goals In summary it is clear that balance of payments policy should not exempt capital flows from its compass. It is equally clear that the United States should be a major capital exporter. The U.S. programs have been designed to maintain a reasonable flow of capital especially to the less developed countries. Given the alternatives and the need to improve its payments position the United States has restrained the outflow of capital as preferable to cutting essential international commitments limiting international trade or restricting domestic and world economic growth ADJUSTMENT POLICIES OF OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES Actions by the United States to improve its payments position can not by themselves assure that the world payments pattern will be either sustainable or desirable from an international point of view. Such a result is only possible through appropriate efforts of both deficit and surplus countries In various other countries pursued policies to reduce payments imbalances. The most dramatic measures were taken by the United Kingdom following renewed severe speculative attacks on the pound in the summer which were initially met by drawings on swaps and other shortterm international credit facilities cooperatively provided by the financial authorities of the major industrial countries and the Bank for International Settlements. The British increased the bank rate to percent provided a strong dose of over-all fiscal restraint adopted selective tax measures to encourage increased productivity and imposed a temporary freeze on wages and prices. These measures markedly reduced the earlier deficit and the United Kingdom may soon move into surplus In Italy and Japan resumption of more rapid growth in domestic economic activity together with policies favorable to increased capital exports succeeded in reducing payments surpluses as the year progressed. Industrial expansion in France similarly led to a shrinkage in that country 's overall surplus as the trade balance narrowed ; however there continued to be a net capital inflow Germany which had a payments deficit in for the first time in several years swung back to a sizable surplus in Monetary policy was tightened mainly to contain inflation. As a result domestic investment slowed markedly and the trade surplus increased sharply. The payments surplus was still expanding at year end. In January Germany took a welcome step toward monetary ease by lowering the central bank discount rate Although somewhat reduced from the preceding year payments imbalances continued large in In some countries corrective policies are clearly needed to prevent imbalances from growing still larger in the current year. Moreover considerable question remains whether the pattern of adjustment in will permit a fully satisfactory rate of economic growth in the industrial countries and an adequate flow of capital to the less developed world The United States will be actively pursuing policies to strengthen its payments position in But reduction of U.S. deficits must have a counterpart in reduced surpluses or increased deficits elsewhere. If the impact of the U.S. payments improvement were to fall largely on the United Kingdom or the less developed countries the international payments system would suffer rather than benefit. From the viewpoint of a viable international payments pattern consequently there is no real alternative : it is the countries with strong underlying payments positions and large reserves which must absorb a major share of the impact of reduced U.S. and U.K deficits. In particular a marked reduction is needed in the chronic over-all surplus of the major industrial countries of Continental Europe The surplus countries also bear a significant share of the responsibility for assuring that the manner in which adjustment takes place is to the greatest extent possible consistent with the broad objectives of the international economic community as a whole Most importantly adjustment policies should not in the aggregate prevent a healthy rate of worldwide economic growth compatible with reasonably stable price levels. In the United States demand policies aiming at a slower rate of growth than that of are of course entirely appropriate on purely domestic grounds. But an even more marked slowdown in demand than is needed for proper domestic balance would entail serious social and economic costs at home and could risk a recession. Given the massive weight of the United States in the world economy such a policy would risk a slowdown in trade and economic growth on a worldwide basis On the other hand the objectives of international economic expansion and payments adjustment are simultaneously served when surplus countries with lagging internal demand take effective steps to spur the pace of economic activity as was for example true of France Italy and Japan during the past year. In a number of surplus countries will be in a good position to contribute significantly to better international payments equilibrium in this fashion without running serious risks of engendering inflationary pressures Surplus countries also have a special responsibility for fostering relative freedom in international transactions. As the report of Working Party pointed out it is desirable wherever possible that adjustment take place " through the relaxation of controls and restraints over international trade and capital movements by surplus countries rather than by the imposition of new restraints by deficit countries. " In the past year Italy and Japan generally followed policies that facilitated capital outflows ; the recently announced intention of the French Government to liberalize capital controls is also a hopeful development. There is however scope for further measures by various surplus countries to liberalize the regulations that govern capital outflows and also to ease restrictions on imports. More liberal import policies would both improve payments balance and counter domestic inflation In there was an escalation of monetary restraint. The sharp tightening of monetary policies in the United States undertaken largely for domestic reasons did help significantly to contain the U.S. payments deficit during the year. Monetary action also was a key feature in the program to defend the British pound. But countries in a strong reserve position also placed heavy reliance on restrictive monetary policies to contain domestic demand. The net effect of all these actions and of the failure of most other countries to take active steps to avoid monetary stringency was a dramatic upward movement in interest rates on a worldwide basis ( Chart ) Between September and September rates on 90-day Eurodollar deposits increased from percent to percent ; yields on long-term international bond issues rose by more than a full percentage point ; and there were marked increases in long-term government bond yields in all major industrial countries The extent to which the present high worldwide level of interest rates aids the process of balance of payments adjustment is doubtful. The substantial benefit to the U.S. balance of payments from the tightening of U.S. monetary conditions stemmed from differential monetary conditions here and abroad. The potential magnitude of such effects is reduced when surplus countries simultaneously permit or even encourage their own interest rates to rise From the standpoint of world economic growth it would be preferable if payments adjustment took place at a lower average level of interest rates than has recently prevailed. Precisely what level is appropriate is a matter that deserves continuing international discussion Given the key role of the United States in international financial markets a general easing in international monetary conditions would be greatly aided by a lessening of monetary tightness in the United States. A move in this direction already under way will have major benefits for domestic economic balance. But if credit relaxation were confined to the United States it would not promote a better balance of payments adjustment either for this country or for the major surplus countries of Europe. Moreover at least in some important European economies monetary easing would help to facilitate needed domestic economic growth. It would appear therefore that movement toward easier credit conditions by the countries of Western Europe would promote their own and the general welfare. Where necessary for domestic reasons demand restraint could be maintained by greater reliance on fiscal policy If the major surplus countries adjust mainly by permitting their trade surpluses to decline this can lead to a substantially improved trade surplus for the United States and permit it to maintain and even augment its role as a major capital exporter. Alternatively if the large surplus countries and particularly the EEC countries wish to continue to maintain a substantial surplus on current account they should assume a larger share of the responsibility for providing financial capital where it is needed Some progress in this direction has in fact recently been made partly under the spur of the more restricted access to U.S. capital markets. New international bond issues in Europe during the first three quarters of for example were at an annual rate of about $ billion four times the Chart Interest Rates in Selected Countries PERCENT SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES-L/ Ntf : GERMANY LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES ^ SWITZERLAND I .S.

It is highly desirable however that the surplus countries take stronger steps to enlarge the capacity of their capital markets and to assure an adequate volume of long-term capital exports ( including foreign aid ) especially to the less developed countries INTERNATIONAL MONETARY REFORM The avoidance or appropriate correction of large-scale payments imbalances is of key importance in facilitating sound world economic growth and relatively unfettered international trade and payments. But better adjustment alone is not sufficient to attain these objectives In the long run most countries seek some steady increase in their international reserves. With growing world transactions this has meant that they have generally sought to have surpluses rather than deficits in their balances of payments. Obviously however all countries can not attain such a goal simultaneously. At present only the flow of new gold into monetary reserves can permit a steady accumulation of reserve assets by some countries without corresponding deficits for others This flow of new gold has for many years been inadequate. For much of the postwar period dollars supplied through U.S. deficits served as the major supplement to gold in new reserve creation. For reasons already cited however the dollar can no longer be expected to perform this task in the same way ; nor can it be assumed that adequate new reserves will accrue in the form of automatic drawing rights at the IMF as the byproduct of the Fund 's normal lending operations. To satisfy desires for rising official monetary reserves over the longer run and to eliminate dependence of the world economy on the vagaries of gold production deliberate generation of new reserve assets is needed on a cooperative international basis In significant progress was made toward setting up a mechanism for such deliberate reserve creation. Representatives of the major industrial countries known as the Group of Ten agreed that it is prudent to begin the preparation of a contingency plan now. They also agreed that deliberate reserve creation should be tailored to global needs rather than the financing of individual balance of payments deficits ; that decisions on the amount of reserves to be created should be made for some years ahead ; and that reserve assets should be distributed to all members of the Fund on the basis of IMF quotas or comparable objective standards. While the negotiations in the Group of Ten and parallel deliberations by the Executive Directors of the Fund did not result in complete accord on the precise form and use of new reserve assets the exploration of technical details produced substantial agreement regarding the nature of alternative " building blocks " that might be incorporated in the final contingency plan A major accomplishment in was the initiation of a second stage of international monetary negotiations late in the year involving joint dis- cussions of the Executive Directors of the Fund and the Deputies of the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the Group of Ten. It is hoped that these meetings which have already shown great promise will by the time of the next Annual Meeting of the Fund lead to a wide consensus on the key remaining points at issue Differences of view on two of these points already seem to be narrowing There now appears to be a widespread feeling that the needs of the international monetary system can best be served if deliberate reserve creation is effected through the development of an entirely new reserve unit distributed to all Fund members. At the same time there is increasing recognition that satisfactory procedures can be developed to make the new reserve asset generally acceptable without linking its use to specified payments of gold Probably the most important outstanding issue is the precise manner in which decisions on reserve creation are to be made. There is good reason to expect however that this question can be resolved in a way that takes account of the legitimate needs and interests of all the countries represented in the negotiations While the progress made in the negotiations thus gives ground for considerable satisfaction it is also true that the need for developing a contingency plan for deliberate reserve creation has become more urgent One reason is that it can no longer be assumed that U.S. deficits will automatically increase world reserves. These deficits which for much of the postwar period were the main element in new reserve creation have since the end of made no net contribution to the rise in world reserves. Indeed in September the dollar holdings in the official reserves of other countries were actually smaller than months earlier both in absolute terms and after a rough adjustment for seasonal influences Over this period total U.S. gold sales to other countries were more than twice as large as the accumulated U.S. balance of payments deficit on official settlements. Thus the manner in which the U.S. deficit was financed has tended to reduce rather than augment the total of world reserves Second the flow of gold into monetary channels has been sharply reduced recently. While final estimates for are not yet available it is likely that there was virtually no net addition of gold to monetary reserves during the year. In only $ million of new gold entered into monetary stocks. This contrasts with an annual average of about $ million in the decade ended in Third it is significant that the modest increase in over-all world reserves that did occur in the recent past reflected very special circumstances. During the 21-month period from the end of through September world reserves increased by about $ billion. But the largest part of this increase was a byproduct of the difficulties experienced by the British pound which caused the U.K. authorities to draw $ billion from the IMF ; a large portion of this drawing in turn increased reserve claims on the Fund by other countries. Not only can transactions of this kind no longer be counted upon to add to world reserves as the British situation improves but repayment of Britain 's debt could actually lead to a contraction of reserves These considerations suggest that the time when deliberately created reserves are needed may be closer at hand than is often realized. In any event continued uncertainty regarding the nature of a contingency plan and the timing of its adoption can be a growing source of uneasiness in international financial markets and interfere with the smooth working of the adjustment process. Clear agreement on a contingency plan on the other hand would be a major factor in strengthening confidence in the world monetary system and in reducing gold hoarding and would help lessen the tendency of countries to pursue unattainable balance of payments aims The essential tasks for thus are to improve the process of payments adjustment through increased international cooperation and to move decisively toward establishing a mechanism for deliberate reserve creation. The two tasks are intimately interwoven ; success in both is necessary to provide a sound climate for world economic growth and relative freedom in trade and capital transactions as well as to assure an adequate flow of long-term capital from the developed to the less developed countries Appendix A REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS DURING LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL DECEMBER The PRESIDENT SIR : The Council of Economic Advisers submits this report on its activities during the calendar year in accordance with the requirements of Congress as set forth in section ( d ) of the Employment Act of Respectfully GARDNER AGKLEY Chairman JAMES S. DUESENBERRY ARTHUR M OKUN Report to the President on the Activities of the Council of Economic Advisers During Throughout the Council of Economic Advisers was confronted with the challenge of analyzing the problems and opportunities of a prosperous economy now at full employment for the first time in more than a decade The problem of reconciling full employment and price stability introduced a new emphasis into every area of the Council 's work fiscal and monetary analysis examination of manpower problems and of programs for efficiency in industry and study of balance of payments issues. Some of our specific activities in the price area are described more fully in our Annual Report In recent months the pressures on prices seem to have been more restrained as economic policies have sought to turn the expansion along the path of full employment growth. The challenge for the Council in is to contribute to the shaping of policies that will maintain expansion along that path COUNCIL MEMBERSHIP Gardner Ackley and Arthur M. Okun continued to serve as Council members in with Mr. Ackley as Chairman. James S.

Vincent and Elizabeth A. Zea In as in earlier years the Council relied upon the editorial skills of Miss Dorothy Wescott in preparing the Annual Report COUNCIL ACTIVITIES The Council of Economic Advisers was established as an agency of the Federal Government nearly years ago by the Employment Act of Under the Act the Council is charged with the responsibility of analyzing and interpreting economic developments and of recommending economic policies that will promote the goals of " maximum employment production and purchasing power. " The Council 's chief responsibility is to keep the President fully informed of economic developments and emerging problems which may affect the Nation 's economy. To meet this responsibility the Council continuously reviews economic conditions undertakes special studies of particular problem areas and makes recommendations concerning Government programs and policies. The Council confers regularly with all major Government agencies having responsibilities in the economic field The Secretary of the Treasury the Director of the Bureau of the Budget and the Chairman of the Council and their respective staffs ( the " Troika " ) provide the President with a continuous joint assessment of the economic and budgetary outlook for the current and subsequent fiscal years and where appropriate analyze the effects of alternative fiscal policies. The heads of the " Troika " agencies and their associates together with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System meet periodically as the " Quadriad " with the President to discuss domestic and international monetary problems. Joint staff work among the " Quadriad " agencies contributed in to improved coordination of fiscal and monetary policies In addition to its regular and informal consultations with other Government agencies the Council and its staff in participated with other agencies in a large variety of more formal committees task forces and studies. Although the results of most of these activities are for use only within the Government two studies in which the Council participated were published in the reports of the Northeast Desalting Team and of the Interagency Energy Study. Other projects and studies related to such diverse problems as environmental pollution income maintenance high energy transmission cost effectiveness in the Federal Government economic impact of disarmament manpower activities balance of payments problems and the operation of financial institutions The Council and its staff represent the United States in a number of important international conferences. The Council Chairman heads the U.S. delegation to the meetings of the Economic Policy Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) and members of the Council and its staff this year participated in a dozen or more other international meetings under the auspices of the OECD. The Chairman and Mr. Okun were members respectively of the U.S. Cabinetlevel delegations which meet annually with similar delegations of the Cana- dian and Japanese governments. The Council also was involved in activities of the UN Economic Commission for Europe An important responsibility of the Council is to explain and clarify the Administration 's economic policies both within the Government and to the public at large. This is done through numerous speeches articles press briefings statements Congressional testimony its Annual Report and by assisting the President in the preparation of his Economic Report. The Council meets frequently and informally with many visiting scholars officials of foreign countries men and women from the press corps businessmen labor leaders State officials bankers and interested private citizens and more formally with a number of advisory groups including the President 's Advisory Committee on Labor-Management Policy and the Business Council 's Liaison Committee with the Council of Economic Advisers The Council prepares two documents for publication. One is the Economic Report of the President together with the Annual Report of the Council of Economic Advisers. Over copies of the Report were distributed to members of the Congress Government officials the press depository libraries or sold to the public by the Superintendent of Documents. The second is the monthly Economic Indicators. This important compilation of current economic statistics has been prepared since at the Council under the direction of Miss Frances M. James and is published by the Joint Economic Committee of the Congress. More than copies are furnished to members of Congress depository libraries or sold to the public every month Appendix B STATISTICAL TABLES RELATING TO INCOME EMPLOYMENT AND PRODUCTION CONTENTS National income or expenditure : B-l.
