STATISTICAL TABLES RELATING TO INCOME EMPLOYMENT AND PRODUCTION........................................................ * For a detailed table of contents of the Council s Report see page Economic Report of the President | iii ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT To the Congress of the United States : Over the past years of economic expansion the American economy has proven its strength and resilience. Job creation grew uninterrupted for a record period of time inflation remains moderate unemployment is low and productivity continues to grow. The economy is built upon a strong foundation with deep and sophisticated capital markets flexible labor markets low taxes and open trade and investment policies Americans should be confident about the long-term strength of our economy but our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty and there are heightened risks to our near-term economic growth. To insure against these risks I called upon the Congress to enact a growth package that is simple temporary and effective in keeping our economy growing and our people working There is more we should do to strengthen our economy. First we must keep taxes low. Unless the Congress acts most of the tax relief that we have delivered over the past years will be taken away and million American taxpayers will see their taxes rise by an average of $ The tax relief of the past few years has been a key factor in promoting economic growth and job creation and it should be made permanent. We must also work together to tackle unfunded obligations in entitlement programs such as Social Security Medicare and Medicaid. I have laid out a detailed plan in my Budget to restrain spending cut earmarks and balance the budget by without raising taxes Second we must trust Americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the market. My Administration has acted aggressively to help credit-worthy homeowners avoid foreclosure. We launched a new initiative called FHASecure to help families refinance their homes. I signed legislation to protect families from Economic Report of the President | higher taxes when lenders forgive a portion of their home mortgage debt We have also brought together the HOPE NOW alliance which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure by facilitating the refinancing and modification of mortgages. The Congress can do more to help American families keep their homes by passing legislation to reform Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae modernize the Federal Housing Administration and allow State housing agencies to issue tax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages Third we must continue opening new markets for trade and investment We have an unprecedented opportunity to reduce barriers to global trade and investment through a successful Doha round. The Congress should also approve our pending free trade agreements. I thank the Congress for its approval of a good agreement with Peru and ask for the approval of agreements with Colombia Panama and South Korea. These agreements will benefit our economy by providing greater access for our exports and supporting good jobs for American workers and they will promote America s strategic interests. I have asked the Congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance so that we can help those workers who are displaced by trade to learn new skills and find new jobs Fourth we must make health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans. I have proposed changes in the tax code that would end the bias against those who do not receive health insurance through their employer and would make it easier for many uninsured Americans to obtain insurance. This reform would put private health care coverage within reach for millions. My Budget also improves access to health care by increasing the power of small employers civic groups and community organizations to negotiate lowerpriced health premiums. These policies would encourage competition among health plans across State lines help reduce frivolous lawsuits that increase patients costs and promote the use of health savings accounts Fifth we must increase our energy security and confront climate change Last year I proposed an ambitious plan to reduce U.S. dependence on oil and help cut the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. I am pleased that the Congress responded and I was able to sign into law a bill that will increase fuel economy and the use of alternative fuels as well as set new efficiency mandates on appliances light bulbs and Federal Government operations. In my State of the Union Message I proposed that we take the next steps to accelerate technological breakthroughs by funding new technologies to generate coal power that captures carbon emissions advance emissions-free nuclear power ; and invest in advanced battery technology and renewable energy. I am also committing | Economic Report of the President $ billion to a new international clean technology fund that will help developing nations make greater use of clean energy sources. Additionally my Budget proposes to protect the economy against oil supply disruptions by doubling the capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Finally a strong and vibrant education system is vital to maintaining our Nation s competitive edge and extending economic opportunity to every citizen. Six years ago we came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act and no one can deny its results. Now we must work together to increase accountability add flexibility for States and districts reduce the number of high school dropouts and provide extra help for struggling schools Many of these issues are discussed in the Annual Report of the Council of Economic Advisers. The Council has prepared this Report to help policymakers understand the economic conditions and issues that underlie my Administration s policy decisions. By relying on the foundation and resilience of our economy trusting the decisions of individuals and markets and pursuing pro-growth policies we should have confidence in our prospects for continued prosperity and economic growth THE WHITE HOUSE FEBRUARY Economic Report of the President | THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL Mr. President : Council of Economic Advisers Washington D.C.

How to Reverse a Decline in Statistical Infrastructure : Improving the Sample for the Consumer Price Index............... The Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act ( CIPSEA ) | Economic Report of the President Overview T he U.S. economy retains a solid foundation even as it faces challenges ahead. Toward the end of there were increasingly mixed economic indicators ( see Chapters and ) Economic growth is expected to continue in Most market forecasts suggest a slower pace in the first half of followed by strengthened growth in the second half of the year. The inherent resilience of our economy has enabled it to absorb multiple shocks in recent years but the President does not take this growth for granted. Recognizing the near-term risks of a broader economic slowdown the President called on the Congress to enact an economic growth package to protect the health of our economy and encourage job creation. Much of this Report examines contributions of pro-growth economic policies and market-based reforms that can further strengthen our economy and allow more Americans to benefit from continued economic expansion The United States commitment to fair and open trade and investment policies is an important factor in our international competitiveness and in the dynamic nature of our economy ; export performance has played a notable and growing role in economic growth in recent years ( see Chapter ) Lower tax rates have also contributed to economic performance by easing the burden on labor and capital and enabling consumers to allocate resources more efficiently ( see Chapter ) There remains considerable opportunity to strengthen our economic position by enacting a short-term economic growth package and by addressing key challenges in the housing and credit markets rising health care costs infrastructure financing and the need to diversify our energy portfolios ( see Chapters and ) A mixed economic picture also underscores the need for accurate measures of economic performance Improvements to economic statistics programs could contribute to a greater understanding of the economy for public policymakers and private decision makers ( see Chapter ) Chapter : The Year in Review and the Years Ahead Economic expansion continued for the sixth consecutive year in This economic growth came despite a weak housing sector credit tightening and high energy prices. Sustained growth has resulted from U.S. economic flexibility openness and other pro-growth policies. Projections of weaker growth in the first half of and near-term risks of a broader economic slowdown however led the President to call on the Congress to enact a shortterm economic growth package. Chapter reviews the past year and discusses the Administration s forecast for the years ahead. The key points are : Real GDP posted solid percent growth during the four quarters of similar to the pace of a year earlier. Compared with the preceding years of the expansion the continued reorientation of aggregate demand resulted in more growth from exports and business fixed investment while residential investment flipped from contributing positively to GDP growth from to to subtracting from it in and Labor markets were tight in the first half of but conditions slackened somewhat in the second half with job growth slowing and the unemployment rate edging up to percent in the third quarter and to percent by December Energy prices dominated the movement of overall inflation in the consumer price index ( CPI ) with large increases toward the end of the year. Core consumer inflation ( which excludes food and energy inflation ) moved down from percent during the months of to percent in Food prices rose appreciably faster than core prices Nominal wage gains of percent for production workers were offset by the unexpected rise in energy prices. These nominal gains however exceeded measures of expected price inflation implying an expectation of real wage gains during the next several years The Administration s forecast calls for the economic expansion to continue in but at a slower pace. Slower growth is anticipated for the first half of the year and the average unemployment rate for is projected to move up from the level. In and real GDP growth is projected to grow at percent while the unemployment rate is projected to remain stable and below percent The contraction of the secondary market for some mortgage securities and the ensuing write-downs at major financial intermediaries are a new downside risk to this expansion. As of the end of however these developments had not greatly affected the nonfinancial economy outside of the housing sector | Economic Report of the President Chapter : Credit and Housing Markets In the summer of the ongoing contraction in the U.S. housing market worsened and credit markets experienced a substantial disruption Chapter reviews the developments in the housing and credit markets and describes public and private responses. The key points are : Rising delinquencies in subprime mortgages revealed an apparent underpricing of risk and raised concerns about which market participants were exposed to that risk but the subprime market was not the only cause for the contraction in credit markets The Federal Reserve provided liquidity and took measures to support financial stability in the financial markets in the wake of the disruptions in the credit markets The Administration focused its response on housing markets and helping homeowners avoid foreclosure in particular subprime borrowers facing increases in the interest rate on their adjustable-rate mortgages Participants in the credit and housing markets are actively addressing challenges that were revealed during the summer of Markets are generally better suited than government to adapting to changes in the economic environment ; markets can respond quickly to new information while government policy often reacts with a lag or has a delayed impact Financial innovations in the mortgage and credit markets have provided a range of economic benefits but not without some costs. Over time markets tend to retain valuable innovations and repair or eliminate flawed innovations The macroeconomic effects of the downturn in housing and the credit market disruptions may occur through several channels including the direct effect on residential investment the reduction of wealth on personal consumption and tighter lending standards on business investment Overview | Chapter : The Causes and Consequences of Export Growth One noteworthy development in recent years has been the rapid growth of U.S. exports. This growth has provided clear benefits to entrepreneurs and workers in export-oriented industries and to the economy as a whole Chapter identifies the primary factors that have driven recent export growth and discusses several longer-term trends that have lifted exports over time More broadly the chapter addresses the benefits that flow from open trade and investment policies as well as some related challenges. The key points of this chapter are : The United States is the world s largest exporter with $ trillion in goods and services exports in The United States was the top exporter of services and the second largest exporter of goods behind only Germany In recent years factors that have likely contributed to the growth in exports include rising foreign income the expansion of production in the United States and changes in exchange rates. One reflection of that growth is that exports accounted for more than a third of U.S. economic growth during and Over time falling tariffs and transport and communication costs have likely lowered the cost of many U.S. goods in foreign markets boosting demand for U.S. exports Open trade and investment policies have increased access to export markets for U.S. producers. Increased investment across borders by U.S companies facilitates exports Greater export opportunities give U.S. producers incentives to innovate for a worldwide market. Increased innovation and the competition that comes from trade liberalization help raise the living standard of the average U.S. citizen Nearly all economists agree that growth in the volume and value of exports and imports increases the standard of living for the average individual but they also agree that the gains from trade are not equally distributed and that some individuals bear costs. The Administration has proposed policies to improve training and support to individuals affected by trade disruption | Economic Report of the President Chapter : The Importance of Health and Health Care The American health care system is an engine for innovation that develops and broadly disseminates advanced life-enhancing treatments and offers a wide set of choices for consumers of health care. The health care system provides enormous benefits but there remain substantial opportunities for improvements that would reduce costs increase access and improve quality thus providing even greater health for Americans. Chapter examines the economics of health and health care. The key points in this chapter are : Health can be improved not only through the appropriate consumption of quality health care services but also through individual behaviors and lifestyle choices such as quitting smoking eating more nutritious foods and getting more exercise Health care has enhanced the health of our population ; greater efficiency in the health care system however could yield even greater health for Americans without increasing health care spending Rapid growth in health care costs and access to health insurance continue to present challenges to the health care system Administration policies focus on reducing cost growth improving quality and expanding access to health insurance through an emphasis on private sector and market-based solutions Chapter : Tax Policy Economists and policymakers have long debated the appropriate role of the government in a market economy. The government can provide public services and transfer payments to lower-income individuals but these benefits often come at the cost of higher taxes and lower economic output. The key points in this chapter are : The ratio of federal taxation in the United States to gross domestic product ( GDP ) has fluctuated around an average value of percent over the past years ; despite the President s and tax relief this ratio was percent in above the 40-year average. Under current law revenues are predicted to grow faster than the economy in coming years raising the level of taxation well above its historical average Overview | Tax reductions in and have considerably lowered the tax burden on labor and capital income and reduced distortions to economic decisions. Making these tax cuts permanent can greatly improve long-term economic outcomes In addition to contributing to growth the tax cuts of also improved the efficiency of the tax structure primarily by reducing the double taxation of corporate income The business tax structure in the United States still creates substantial distortions. To attract investment from abroad and compete more effectively in foreign markets the United States must consider how best to address distortions created by the structure of business taxes as other countries have done Chapter : The Nation s Infrastructure Our economy depends on infrastructure that allows goods people information and energy to flow throughout the nation. As our economy grows and our infrastructure faces growing demand policy should support investments that ensure that existing capacity is used as efficiently as possible Chapter discusses some of the economic issues associated with major transportation communication and power transmission systems. The key points in this chapter are : Infrastructure typically requires large capital investments to build and maintain capacity. Once built however the cost of allowing an extra person to use the capacity is typically low. This often means that infrastructure can not be provided efficiently by a competitive market and many types of infrastructure are instead provided by Governmentregulated companies or in some cases by the Government itself Demands on the U.S. infrastructure grow as the economy expands and Government policies often determine how effectively infrastructure can accommodate that growth. Properly designed user fees can help ensure efficiency by revealing information about what infrastructure consumers value most The price people pay for using infrastructure should reflect the extra cost associated with its use. This includes the cost of maintaining the infrastructure itself as well as delays caused by increased congestion The private sector plays an important role in providing infrastructure However lack of competition in markets for infrastructure raises concerns about market power so that Government oversight is sometimes necessary. The Government must continually reassess the need for oversight in the face of changing market conditions | Economic Report of the President Chapter : Searching for Alternative Energy Solutions Energy is used for many purposes in our economy : electricity generation transportation industrial production and direct uses by homes and businesses. Energy security and environmental concerns motivate the consideration of policies that diversify our sources of energy. Chapter outlines options for changing the way we produce and consume energy in two sectors of our economy : electricity generation and transportation. The key points in this chapter are : The current suite of available alternative energy sources is an important part of achieving our goal but a number of technical regulatory and economic hurdles must be overcome to use them fully There are several promising but currently unproven methods of producing and delivering energy that if successfully developed and deployed will greatly enhance our Nation s energy portfolio Appropriate and limited government action can play a useful role in helping to realize our energy security goals Chapter : Improving Economic Statistics Statistical systems have substantial value for both public policymakers and private decision makers. Chapter examines several key issues in economic statistics including the role of Federal statistical programs in a dynamic economy the importance of continuity in statistical series and ways to improve the value of existing statistical data The key points are : Robust statistical systems produce products that are important to understanding the changing state of the economy and to formulating sound policy. But statistical systems like physical infrastructures become obsolete or depreciate with time if they are not maintained Statistical measures must keep up with the changing nature of the economy to be relevant and useful. For example it is important that these measures reflect new and growing industries ( such as hightechnology industries or services ) and intangible capital ( such as research and development ) Disruptions in a statistical series render it much less useful to policymakers and other data users. Thus continuity in statistical series is an important goal Overview | More effective statistical use can be made of existing data. In particular amending relevant legislation to enable full implementation of the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act ( CIPSEA ) could greatly improve the quality of Federal statistics | Economic Report of the President C H A P T E R The Year in Review and the Years Ahead T he expansion of the U.S economy continued for a sixth consecutive year in Economic growth was solid at percent during the four quarters of the year slightly below the pace during Payroll job growth set a record for continuous growth eclipsing the previous record of months. This economic growth came despite a reorientation of the U.S economy away from housing investment and toward exports and investment in business structures. The persistent tumble in housing investment subtracted roughly a percentage point from real Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) growth during the four quarters of the year. Although the quarterly pattern of real GDP was uneven with strong growth in the second and third quarters and weak growth in the first and fourth quarters much of the quarter-to-quarter variation can be attributed to net exports a volatile component of GDP. In the wake of mounting problems with the performance of subprime ( defined as higher risk ) mortgages financial markets from August onward were unsettled because of concerns about the risk entailed in holding some types of mortgage-backed securities as well as fears about the financial health of some firms and the possibility of contagion to the nonfinancial economy. To insure against the downside risks from these financial and housing-related developments the President called for an economic growth package to boost consumption business investment and labor demand The core CPI ( consumer prices excluding food and energy ) as well as the price index for GDP ( covering everything produced in the United States ) suggested that inflation had moved lower and into the moderate range by the end of Food price inflation climbed however while energy prices jumped toward the end of the year. In response to these output and inflation developments the Federal Reserve held the Federal funds rate flat through August. The Federal Reserve then lowered its policy rate by a percentage point from September through December and another percentage point in January to ease liquidity concerns in financial markets disturbed by the mortgage market tumble and to bolster real activity. The Federal Reserve also took other liquidity-enhancing measures including cutting the discount rate at which it lends to banks and initiating a new auction approach to provide collateralized loans to banks This chapter reviews the economic developments of and discusses the Administration s forecast for the years ahead. The key points of this chapter are : chapter1.indd 2/5/08 : : PM Real GDP posted solid percent growth during the four quarters of similar to the pace of a year earlier. The reorientation of aggregate demand that began in continued in Compared with the preceding years of the expansion this reorientation included more growth from exports and business fixed investment while residential investment flipped from contributing positively to GDP growth from to to subtracting from it in and Labor markets were tight in the first half of with job growth averaging per month and the jobless rate at percent. Labor market conditions slackened somewhat in the second half with job growth slowing to per month and the unemployment rate edging up to percent in the third quarter and to percent by December Energy prices which tend to be volatile dominated the movement of overall inflation in the consumer price index ( CPI ) with large increases toward the end of the year. Core consumer inflation ( which excludes food and energy inflation ) moved down from percent during the months of to percent in Food prices rose appreciably faster than core prices Nominal wage gains of percent for production workers were offset by the unexpected rise in energy prices. These nominal gains however exceeded measures of expected price inflation such as those from the market for the Department of Treasury s inflation-protected securities about percent. As a consequence the pace of nominal wage increases implies an expectation of real wage gains during the next several years In the long run real wages tend to increase with labor productivity The Administration s forecast calls for the economic expansion to continue in but at a slower pace than in the earlier years of this expansion. Slower growth is anticipated for the first half of the year and the average unemployment rate for is projected to move up from the level. In and real GDP growth is projected at percent thereafter slowing while the unemployment rate is projected to remain stable and below percent in the period The contraction of the secondary market for some mortgage securities and the ensuing write-downs at major financial intermediaries are a new downside risk to this expansion. As of the end of however these developments had not greatly affected the nonfinancial economy outside of the housing sector ( which had already been in decline for a year or so before the onset of the mortgage financing problems ) To insure against the downside risks from these new financial developments the President proposed tax relief and changes to depreciation schedules that reduce the cost of business investment. The policy changes are expected to boost real GDP growth and job creation | chapter1.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Developments in and the Near-Term Outlook The economy went through a period of rebalancing that began in and extended into with faster growth in business structures investment and exports offsetting pronounced declines in homebuilding while consumer spending growth edged lower Consumer Spending and Saving Real consumer spending slowed to a percent growth rate during the four quarters of somewhat below the growth rates during the preceding years of expansion and below the average rates of the preceding years Nominal consumer spending ( that is consumer spending without adjusting for inflation ) pulled back from its 16-year pattern of rising faster than disposable income and the personal saving rate for the year as a whole ticked up from to percent. Factors that had pushed down the saving rate during recent years shifted into neutral : the wealth-to-income ratio plateaued and the unemployment rate ( which is related to consumer confidence ) stopped falling. Energy costs rose rapidly but consumers continued to purchase similar quantities of energy which kept the personal saving rate low. The general decline in the personal saving rate during the past years ( despite the uptick in ) continued a long-term trend that began in the 1980s Energy Expenditures World demand for crude oil increased by million barrels per day to million barrels per day between and the first three quarters of The United States accounted for only a fraction ( million barrels per day ) of this increase while demand in other OECD countries generally fell. ( The OECD or Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development comprises key developed economies. ) The increase in non-OECD demand totaled million barrels per day with China s per-day consumption alone growing by million barrels. In the face of this increase in world oil demand consumers paid higher prices to maintain their consumption Crude oil prices rose again in The spot price for West Texas Intermediate ( a benchmark variety of crude oil ) rose to an average of $ per barrel in the fourth quarter from an average of $ per barrel in The price of natural gas which rose sharply in then fell during was little changed on balance in while electricity prices continued their upward trend With the rise in energy prices the share of energy in total purchases rose sharply. From to consumer energy prices increased percent Chapter chapter1.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM relative to non-energy prices while real consumption of energy per household fell only percent ( according to data from the National Income and Product Accounts ) As a result energy expenditures which were about percent of consumer purchases in rose to percent of consumer purchases in and Between and consumers appear to have maintained both energy and nonenergy consumption by reducing their personal saving which by ( although up from ) averaged only percent of disposable personal income. This continued rapid rise in energy prices suggests that consumers adaptation to these prices remains unfinished. Consumers have chosen to respond to the energy-price shock by using savings to buffer some of its effects but this response is probably temporary Wealth Effects on Consumption and Saving Household wealth rose rapidly relative to disposable personal income from through the second quarter of supporting the growth of consumption and a decline in the saving rate. Over the period the ratio of household wealth to annual-income increased years to years of accumulated income ( that is consumers collectively accumulated an extra percent of a years income ) During the late 1990s and again during a strong rise in household net worth coincided with a sizable increase in consumer spending relative to disposable personal income ( Chart ) | chapter1.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Unlike recent years however the gains did not reflect large increases in housing wealth ( net of mortgage debt ) which peaked relative to income in the first half of and has edged lower since ( see Chart ) The housing price rise of percent during the year that ended with the third quarter of was a substantial deceleration from the percent annual rate during the preceding years and was less than the growth of income. Stock-market wealth rose during the four quarters through the third quarter of ( the most recent wealth data ) and accounted for all of the four-quarter gain. By the third quarter of the overall wealth-to-income ratio was well above its 50-year average Projected Consumer Spending Looking ahead the path of consumer spending is projected to reflect the recent flattening of the wealth-to-income ratio. Real consumer spending during the four quarters of is expected to grow percent down from an average of about percent during the past years. This projected rate is less than the projected growth of real disposable personal income ( household income less taxes adjusted for inflation ) and so the saving rate is forecasted to continue edging up in After that real consumption is projected to increase at about the same pace as real GDP and real income Housing Prices Nationally nominal house price appreciation slowed to a crawl in and house prices fell when corrected for inflation. An inflation-adjusted version of the housing price index ( the nominal version of which is compiled by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight ( OFHEO ) from home sales and appraisals during refinancing ) increased at an average annual rate of percent from to It then slowed to percent during the four quarters of and declined at a percent annual rate during the first three quarters of ( These inflation-adjusted prices are deflated by the consumer price index. ) The homes covered by this OFHEO-created housing price index are those which are financed or refinanced by one of the government-sponsored housing enterprises and must therefore have mortgages below the conforming loan limit ( currently $ ) Another relevant measure of home prices ( the S&P/Case-Shiller Index ) has fallen percent in real terms during the year that ended with the third quarter of ; this index covers a smaller portion of the country than the OFHEO measure but is more comprehensive with regard to homes with large mortgages The deceleration of housing prices along with falling standards for subprime mortgages in and has led to a rising delinquency rate for subprime adjustable-rate mortgages ( where the rate on the mortgages resets after an initial period ) which severely disrupted the secondary market for Chapter chapter1.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM nonconforming mortgages in In contrast the market for conforming mortgages continued to function well. ( Conforming loans must meet certain loan-to-value and documentation requirements in addition to being below the conforming loan limit. ) See Chapter Credit and Housing Markets for a more extensive analysis Residential Investment Every major measure of housing activity dropped sharply during and and the drop in real residential construction was steeper than anticipated in last year s Report. Housing starts ( the initiation of a homebuilding project ) new building permits and new home sales have fallen more than percent since their annual peaks in The drop in home-construction activity subtracted an average of almost percentage point at an annual rate from real GDP growth during the last three quarters of and the four quarters of Furthermore even if housing starts level off at their current pace lags between the beginning and completion of a construction project imply that residential investment will subtract from GDP growth during the first half of During as in employment in residential construction fell as did production of construction materials and products associated with new home sales ( such as furniture large appliances and carpeting ) Yet despite these housing sector declines the overall economy continued to expand ( see Box ) Box : Indirect Effects of the Housing Sector Thus far the sharp drop in homebuilding has not prevented robust activity outside of the housing sector. Employment fell in sectors related to new home construction and housing sales. Despite these repercussions overall payroll employment continued to increase and real consumer spending continued to move upward through the end of The unemployment rate however increased by percentage point during the months of the year Although residential investment fell sharply real GDP growth during was sustained by increases in other forms of investment. As shown in the chart below private and public nominal nonresidential construction ( that is construction of office buildings shopping centers factories and other business structures ) grew rapidly during the year continued on the next page | chapter1.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Box continued Nonresidential construction draws from some of the same resources ( such as construction labor and materials ) as the residential construction sector. The high level of residential investment during the past couple of years may have limited the growth of investment in nonresidential structures. While the case for housing crowding out other sectors is strongest for nonresidential investment residential investment competes with all other sectors of production in credit and labor markets. A drop in the share of the economy engaged in housing could provide some room for other sectors to grow The housing market could also affect the rest of the economy through the wealth channel. That is declines in housing prices could reduce household net worth and thereby reduce consumption. The increase in housing prices during contributed noticeably to the gain in the ratio of household wealth to income ( shown earlier in Chart ) and supported growth in consumer spending. In contrast gains in housing wealth came to a virtual halt during Chapter chapter1.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM In addition to incomes and mortgage rates the number of homes built is underpinned by demographics. Homebuilding during and averaged about million units per year in excess of the or 1.9-million unit annual pace of housing starts that would be consistent with some demographic models for a decade-long period leading to an excess supply of houses on the market. More recently the million unit pace during the fourth quarter of is well below this long-term demographic target. The pace of homebuilding has now been below this level for long enough that the above-trend production of and has been offset by the more recent below-trend production. Yet the construction of new homes continued to fall rapidly through year-end with the undershooting possibly reflecting uncertain prospects for house prices as well as elevated inventories of unsold new and existing homes. Once prices become firm and inventories return to normal levels home construction should rebound but it is difficult to pinpoint when this will occur. The residential sector is not expected to make positive contributions to real GDP growth until Business Fixed Investment During the four quarters of real business investment in equipment and software ( that is measured at constant prices ) grew percent a bit faster than the pace but notably slower than the percent average pace during the preceding years. Its fastest-growing components during included computers software and communication equipment while investment in industrial equipment grew slowly. Transportation equipment however fell substantially due to environmental regulations ( on particulate matter emissions issued in but effective in ) that raised truck prices in and led trucking firms to advance heavy truck purchases into from In contrast to residential investment real business investment in nonresidential structures grew at a strong percent annual rate over the four quarters of The gains during were the second consecutive year of strong growth which was a marked reversal from the declines during the period from to Nearly percent of total growth in nonresidential structures was accounted for by office buildings lodging facilities power facilities and petroleum and natural gas exploration and wells. This sector maintained its ability to borrow funds needed for construction as net borrowing for nonfinancial corporate commercial mortgages rose percent at an annual rate during the first three quarters of One risk to the near-term investment forecast is that the recent turmoil in the market for mortgage-backed securities may somehow reduce the funds available for business investment. Most new investment at least for the corporate sector as a whole is being financed with internally generated funds | chapter1.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM for new investment ( undistributed profits plus depreciation also known as cash flow ) which were at normal levels through the third quarter of As for the amount that nonfinancial firms must borrow to finance investment ( the financing gap ) the flows showed no shortfall at least through the third quarter of ( Chart ) A shortage of investment funds though possible appears unlikely. Corporations have been able to finance investment directly through the bond market without penalty as interest rates on 10-year highgrade corporate bonds in the second half of were little different from the first half of the year. Nevertheless the market for investment funds merits close attention as yields on lower-grade corporate bonds have edged up the number of newly announced leveraged buyouts have fallen sharply and the October survey of senior loan officers reported tighter lending standards for loans to large and small companies Business investment growth is projected to remain solid in although probably below the percent growth rate during the four quarters of Continued growth in output combined with a tight labor market is expected to maintain strong demand for new capital. In the longer run real business investment is projected to grow slightly above the growth rate of real GDP Chapter chapter1.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Business Inventories Inventory investment was volatile during the past year or so and had a noticeable influence on quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in real GDP especially the weakness in the first and fourth quarters and the strength in the third quarter. Inventories of motor vehicles on dealer lots and in transit were an important contributor to these fluctuations as they were liquidated during the first half of and built up in the third quarter before being liquidated again in the fourth quarter. Real nonfarm inventories grew at only an average percent annual pace during a growth rate that is well below the pace of real GDP growth over the same period. Coming off a long-term decline the inventory-to-sales ratio for manufacturing and trade ( in current dollars ) rose in late before being reduced sharply in Manufacturing and trade inventories appear to be roughly in line with sales as of November and do not appear to require dramatic swings in production. Inventory investment is projected to be fairly stable during the next several years as is generally the case for periods of stable growth. The overall inventory-to-sales ratio is expected to continue trending lower Government Purchases Real Federal consumption and gross investment grew percent during a slowdown from the pace. Quarterly fluctuations in this spending category were considerable with nearly all the volatility due to the defense component. Defense spending plunged in the first quarter of but grew rapidly during the second and third quarters of the year The defense appropriations act for fiscal year ( FY ) provided $ billion for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The FY supplemental appropriation for defense provided an additional $ billion for ongoing operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Another $ billion in emergency funding for FY was provided in the consolidated appropriations act. The first continuing resolution for FY and the defense appropriations act for FY provided $ billion for mine-resistant vehicles and other funding for Afghanistan and Iraq. Another supplemental appropriation for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq is likely for FY Nominal Federal revenues grew percent in FY and percent in FY These rapid growth rates exceeded growth in outlays and GDP as a whole and the U.S. fiscal deficit as a share of GDP shrank from percent in FY to percent in FY to percent in FY Real State and local government purchases rose percent during the second consecutive year of moderate growth. This followed years of little change. In the wake of the recession this sector fell sharply into deficit in Revenues began to recover in and the sector was out of deficit by allowing for an increase in state and local consumption and | chapter1.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM investment in and This pattern of delayed response to downturns resembles the pattern during the business-cycle recovery of the 1990s The State and local government sector slipped into a small deficit over the first three quarters of reflecting strong growth in outlays that were not matched by an increase in revenues. In only slow growth can be anticipated for this sector s consumption and gross investment because of decelerating housing prices and their effects on property tax receipts which comprise about percent of this sector s revenues Exports and Imports Real exports of goods and services grew percent during the four quarters the fourth year of annual growth in excess of percent. The pace of export expansion reflects rapid growth among our trading partners expanded domestic production capacity and changes in the terms of trade associated with exchange rate trends between and that made American goods cheaper relative to those of some other countries ( Chapter analyzes recent export growth in greater detail ) Real GDP among our advanced-economy trading partners ( that is the other member countries of the OECD ) is estimated to have grown at rates of and percent during the four quarters of and respectively after growing at an average pace of percent during the preceding years. In addition the economies of some of our major emerging-market trading partners such as China Singapore and India are growing at rates of to percent per year although these countries receive only about percent of our exports. The OECD projects that real GDP among our advanced-economy trading partners will slow to a still-solid percent growth rate during the four quarters of The International Monetary Fund projects that real GDP among the group of emerging market economies will slow to a still-strong percent growth rate for as a whole The fastest growth in U.S. goods and services exports was to India but exports to China Africa and the Middle East also grew rapidly. Despite the rapid growth of exports to these emerging economies the European Union ( EU ) remains the major overseas export destination consuming over percent of our exports. By country Canada accounts for the largest share of U.S. exports at over percent Real imports grew percent annual rate during the slowest pace since Real imports of nonpetroleum goods grew percent during also the slowest rate of increase since Real petroleum imports have edged up percent during while nominal imports surged percent due to rising oil prices. The rise in oil prices has been less of a drag on the U.S. economy than similar rises have been because it has been offset by the strong growth in foreign economies which has boosted U.S. exports Chapter chapter1.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Indeed the growth in foreign economies is what has largely induced the multi-year increase in oil prices ( Box ) Box : Macroeconomic Effects When Oil Price Increases Are Induced by Foreign Demand The cost of imported crude oil increased nearly $ per barrel from to the largest dollar increase on record. Earlier price increases in and were followed by recessions a development that has not occurred during the current episode. What has happened recently that has allowed the United States to maintain strong growth in the face of this price surge ? Economic growth outside the United States increased about percentage points from the percent annual growth rate during the years from to to a percent annual rate during the years from to according to estimates from the International Monetary Fund. The increase in real GDP growth among our trading partners probably caused an increase in both the demand for oil and the price of oil and also an increase in U.S. exports to our trading partners Rapidly growing countries ( China Russia India and Thailand ) accounted for much of the increase in oil demand during the years from to continued on the next page | chapter1.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Box continued as shown in the chart. Countries showing the largest increases in oil consumption tended to be those showing the largest growth rates during the past years. In addition U.S. exports grew rapidly to those countries that have recently signed and implemented free trade agreements with the United States ( as discussed in Chapter ) An increase in real output growth among our trading partners of about percent can be expected to increase our exports by about percent as well. The cumulative percent higher growth among our trading partners ( percent for each of years ) could thus have generated as much as $ billion per year of exports. In comparison the $ 40-per-barrel oil price increase added about $ billion per year to the Nation s bill for oil imports ( at billion barrels of oil per year ) The current account deficit ( the excess of imports and income flows to foreigners over exports and foreign income of Americans ) averaged percent of GDP during the first three quarters of down from its average of over percent. The decline in the current account deficit reflects strong export growth and moderate import growth although domestic investment continues to exceed domestic saving with foreigners financing the gap between the two Employment Nonfarm payroll employment increased by million jobs during an average pace of about jobs per month. The unemployment rate rose slightly over the same period ticking up percentage point to percent. The average unemployment rate in was percent equal to the average. Both the average and the December level of the unemployment rate were below the prevailing rates in each of the three decades of the 1970s 1980s and 1990s The service-providing sector accounted for all of the year s job gains as construction employment fell due to continued weakness in the housing market and manufacturing employment continued its downtrend for the tenth consecutive year. ( Despite the job losses manufacturing output continues to increase because of rapid productivity growth. ) Employment in mining ( which includes oil drilling ) rose percent during The goodsproducing sector has accounted for a diminishing share of total employment in each of the past five decades. Education and health services ( which constituted percent of employment at the end of ) added the largest number of jobs accounting for percent of total job growth Chapter chapter1.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM During the months of the unemployment rate for the major education groups edged up ; it increased percentage point for those holding at least a bachelor s degree percentage point for those whose education ended with a high school degree or those with some college and percentage point among those who did not finish high school. By race and ethnicity the unemployment rate for black Americans rose by percentage point and was about percentage points above the rate for whites a smaller margin than during most of the past years. Unemployment rates among whites rose percentage point and among Hispanics rose percentage points. By sex the jobless rate for both adult men and adult women increased percentage point to percent in December The median duration of unemployment edged up from to weeks during the months of following a substantial decline during the preceding years. The number of long-term unemployed ( those who are jobless for weeks or more ) rose by over the same period Although this is not a welcome development increases in unemployment rates ( and implicitly increases in duration as well ) were built into last year s Administration forecast as the low jobless rates at the end of were not judged to be sustainable in the long run The Administration projects that employment will increase at an average pace of jobs per month during the four quarters of before picking up to jobs per month in In the longer run the pace of employment growth will slow reflecting diminishing rates of labor force growth due to the retirement of the baby-boom generation. The Administration also projects that the unemployment rate will edge up from to as a whole before returning to percent in the middle of the range consistent with stable inflation in the long run Productivity Productivity growth has a standard cyclical pattern. It usually falls during a recession grows rapidly during the early stages of a recovery but then slows as the recovery matures. The current business cycle began on an unusual note with strong productivity growth of percent at an annual rate ( rather than the usual decline ) during the three quarters of the recession. After that the pattern of productivity followed a more-usual business-cycle pattern with strong ( percent annual rate ) growth during the first years of the expansion followed by a slowing to a percent annual rate during the most recent 3-year period. Averaging across the entire -year period since the business-cycle peak in the first quarter of labor productivity has increased at a percent annual rate. This pace is not significantly different from the pace between and As can be seen in Chart a trend | chapter1.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM line with a percent annual rate of growth from to captures most of the movement of productivity over this period The continuation of this roughly percent growth in labor productivity is striking given a flat or diminished contribution from capital deepening ( the increase in capital services per hour worked ) The to acceleration may be plausibly accounted for by a pickup in capital deepening and by increases in organizational capital ( the investments businesses make to reorganize and restructure themselves in this instance in response to newly installed information technology ) After a reduced rate of capital deepening on its own would have suggested a slowing in the rate of productivity growth. Productivity growth in the recent period therefore appears to be supported by factors that are more difficult to measure than the quantity of capital such as intangible investments in technology and business practices Productivity growth is projected to average percent per year during the 6-year span of the budget projection ( Table later in this chapter ) which is about the same as the average annual pace since The projected growth rate is slightly below the percent annual pace discussed in last year s Report and reflects the downward revisions to real GDP and other Chapter chapter1.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM output measures announced in the annual revisions to the National Income and Product Accounts in July and July Prices and Wages As measured by the consumer price index ( CPI ) overall inflation rose from percent during the months of to percent during ( Chart ) with the increase due to an acceleration of food and energy prices. Energy prices accelerated from a percent increase in to a percent increase in Food prices increased percent during up sharply from the percent pace of the previous year. Core CPI prices ( that is excluding food and energy ) increased percent during down from a percent increase a year earlier Prices of petroleum products climbed percent during while natural gas prices fell slightly. Electricity prices increased percent which was less than the rate of increase a year earlier. As of late-January futures prices show that market participants expect crude oil prices to edge down during from their current high level while natural gas prices are expected to rise The rapid increase in food prices during reflects worldwide agricultural supply and demand conditions such as the drought in Australia ( a major wheat exporter ) the demand for corn-based ethanol and short-supply | chapter1.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM conditions for dairy herds. The supply constraints during for wheat and dairy products appear temporary and are expected to return toward normal during The percentage point deceleration of core CPI prices was accounted for primarily by rent of shelter which slowed to a percent rate of increase from a percent rate of increase during the months of The Administration projects that the CPI will increase percent in slightly less that the percent rate of increase of the core CPI during ; energy and food prices are expected to be little changed in following their recent large increases Hourly compensation ( which was about percent of nonfarm business output ) has increased at roughly the same percent rate in as during the preceding years according to the Employment Cost Index ( ECI ) for the private sector. The wage and salary index grew percent little changed from percent a year earlier while growth of hourly benefits slowed to percent. Another measure of hourly compensation from the productivity and cost dataset increased slightly faster than the ECI Unit labor costs ( labor compensation per unit of output ) have put little if any upward pressure on inflation thus far and it appears unlikely that they will over the next year. Unit labor costs grew only percent at an annual rate during the first three quarters of which is less than the percent growth in the GDP price index during the same interval Average hourly earnings of production or non-supervisory workers ( who constitute about percent of total employment on nonfarm payrolls ) increased percent ( in nominal terms ) during the months through December somewhat below the pace a year earlier of percent These nominal hourly earnings were outstripped by the percent increase in the overall CPI for wage earners and so real earnings fell percent during ( following a percent gain in ) Even so the recent pace of these nominal wage increases is above various measures of expected price inflation ( such as those implied by the market for inflation-indexed Treasury securities ) and suggests that employers and employees expect a gain in real earnings in The situation is similar to a year ago but during price inflation was higher than expected because of sharp and unanticipated increases in food and energy prices. In the long run real hourly compensation increases with productivity growth which is projected to remain solid Among the many available measures of inflation the Administration forecast focuses on two : the consumer price index and the price index for GDP. The CPI measures prices for a fixed basket of consumer goods and services. It is widely reported in the press and is used to index Social Security benefits the individual income tax Federal pensions and many privatesector contracts. The GDP price index covers prices of all final goods and services produced in the United States including consumption investment Chapter chapter1.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM and government purchases. In contrast to the CPI its weights are not fixed but move to reflect changes in spending patterns. Of the two indexes the CPI tends to increase more rapidly in part because it measures a fixed basket of goods and services ; the GDP price index increases less rapidly because it reflects the shifting of household and business purchases away from items with increasing relative prices and toward items with decreasing relative prices. Additionally the GDP price index ( which includes investment goods ) places a larger weight on computers which tend to decline in price ( on a quality-adjusted basis ) while the CPI places a much larger weight on rent and energy The wedge or difference between the CPI and the GDP measures of inflation has implications for Federal budget projections. A larger wedge ( with the CPI rising faster than the GDP price index ) raises the Federal budget deficit because Social Security and Federal pensions rise with the CPI while Federal revenue tends to increase with the GDP price index. For a given level of nominal income increases in the CPI also cut Federal revenue because they raise the brackets at which higher income tax rates apply and affect other inflation-indexed features of the tax code Is rising inflation a problem for the United States ? Although the CPI accelerated to a percent rate of increase during the acceleration was entirely a result of food and energy price increases that are not likely to be repeated. Nor do market participants expect it to be repeated as is evident from the well-anchored long-run consumer price inflation expectations in the market for inflation-indexed securities. Furthermore most of the price increases for petroleum do not reflect prices charged by workers or firms in the United States because percent of petroleum is imported. The GDP price index better captures the prices that Americans are charging for their labor and services and it decelerated to a percent increase during from a year-earlier pace of percent. Prices for business investment which is not captured in the CPI slowed noticeably in In sum long run inflation expectations remain stable and inflation as measured by the broadbased GDP price index remained moderate in Financial Markets The Wilshire ( a broad stock market index ) increased percent during while the Standard and Poor ( an index of the largest corporations ) increased percent. This was the fifth consecutive year of stock market gains and it followed years of declines Yields on 10-year Treasury notes ended at percent near the low end of the historical range and fell another basis points during These yield dropped further in January. The low level of these long-term interest rates was due in part to low and stable long-run inflation expectations | chapter1.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM The Administration s forecast of short-term interest rates is roughly based on financial market data as well as a survey of economic forecasters at the date that the forecast was developed in mid-November. The near-term forecast has been overtaken by events as interest rates have fallen notably since the forecast was finalized. Whatever the starting point the Administration projects the rate on 91-day Treasury bills to edge up gradually to percent by and then remain at that level. At that level the real rate ( that is the nominal rate less the rate of inflation ) on 91-day Treasury bills would be close to its historical average The yield on 10-year Treasury notes on November ( when the forecast was finalized ) was percent. The January decline in this yield means that this near-term forecast has also been overtaken by events. The Administration expects the 10-year rate to increase eventually reaching a normal spread of about percentage points over the 91-day Treasury-bill rate by An increase in yield also appears to be expected by market participants ( as evidenced by higher rates on 20-year Treasury notes than on notes with 10-year maturities ) As a result yields on 10-year notes are expected to increase somewhat further reaching a plateau at percent from onward The Long-Term Outlook Through During the sixth year of expansion in the composition of demand was reshuffled a process that is likely to continue in The period of somewhat slower-than-normal growth that began in is likely to continue into Thereafter the economy is projected to expand at a roughly steady rate at or just below percent. Having reached a level of resource utilization consistent with stable inflation by the end of inflation will remain in the low-to-moderate range currently suggested by core inflation rates Payroll job growth is expected to remain solid while the unemployment rate is expected to be little changed over the projection interval ( Table ) The forecast is based on conservative economic assumptions that are close to the consensus of professional forecasters. These assumptions provide a sound basis for the Administration s budget projections Growth in GDP over the Long Term The Administration projects that following a slight pickup of growth from to real GDP will increase at a slowly diminishing rate from through due to the expected retirement of the baby-boom generation Indeed real GDP is projected to decelerate from a percent growth rate during the four quarters of to percent by The average growth rate during this interval is roughly in line with the consensus of private Chapter chapter1.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Table Administration Economic Forecast Year Nominal GDP Real GDP ( chaintype ) GDP price index ( chaintype ) Consumer price index ( CPI-U ) Unemployment rate ( percent ) Percent change Q4-to-Q4 ( actual ) Interest rate 91-day Treasury bills2 ( percent ) Interest rate 10-year Treasury notes ( percent ) Nonfarm payroll employment ( average monthly change Q4-to-Q4 thousands ) Level calendar year Based on data available as of November Secondary market discount basis The gures do not re ect the upcoming BLS benchmark which is expected to reduce and job growth by a cumulative jobs Sources : Council of Economic Advisers Department of Commerce ( Bureau of Economic Analysis and Economics and Statistics Administration ) Department of Labor ( Bureau of Labor Statistics ) Department of the Treasury and Of ce of Management and Budget forecasters for those years. After the year-by-year pace is close to the estimated growth rate of potential real GDP a measure of the rate of growth of productive capacity. ( An economy is said to be growing at its potential rate when all of its resources are utilized and inflation is stable. The supplyside components of potential GDP growth are presented in Table and are discussed below. ) The unemployment rate is projected to be roughly flat in and at around its December level before edging back down to percent thereafter. As discussed below potential GDP growth is expected to slow in the medium term as productivity growth reverts toward its long-run trend ( about percent per year ) and to slow further during the period from to as labor force growth declines due to the retirement of the baby-boom generation The growth rate of the economy over the long run is determined by its supply-side components which include population labor force participation the ratio of nonfarm business employment to household employment the length of the workweek and labor productivity. The Administration s forecast for the contribution of the growth rates of different supply-side factors to real GDP growth is shown in Table The labor force participation rate generally fell from to and is projected to trend lower through The recent behavior stands in contrast to the long period of increase from through Looking | chapter1.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Table Supply-Side Components of Real GDP Growth [ Average annual percent change ] Q2 to Q4 Q4 to Q2 Q2 to Q1 Q1 to Q3 Q3 to Q4 ) Civilian noninstitutional population aged ) PLUS : Civilian labor force participation rate.............................. ) EQUALS : Civilian labor force2..................................................... ) PLUS : Civilian employment rate ) EQUALS : Civilian employment2 ) PLUS : Nonfarm business employment as a share of civilian employment2,3 ) EQUALS : Nonfarm business employment ) PLUS : average weekly hours ( nonfarm business ) ) EQUALS : Hours of all persons ( nonfarm business ) ) PLUS : Output per hour ( productivity nonfarm business ) ) EQUALS : Nonfarm business output4 ) PLUS : Ratio of real GDP to nonfarm business output5............... ) EQUALS : Real GDP Item Adjusted by CEA to smooth discontinuities in the population series since BLS research series adjusted to smooth irregularities in the population series since Line translates the civilian employment growth rate into the nonfarm business employment growth rate Nonfarm employment workweek productivity and output sourced from the BLS productivity and cost database Line translates nonfarm business output back into output for all sectors ( GDP ) which includes the output of farms and general government Note : Q2 Q4 and Q1 are NBER business-cycle peaks Detail may not add to total because of rounding Sources : Council of Economic Advisers Department of Commerce ( Bureau of Economic Analysis ) and Department of Labor ( Bureau of Labor Statistics ) Box : Aging and the Pattern of Labor Force Participation The overall labor force participation rate trended up to percent in and after holding steady between and has generally edged lower during the past years. Men s labor force participation rates fell fairly steadily through Women s labor force participation rose steadily through and has edged lower since then continued on the next page Chapter chapter1.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Box continued Participation in the labor force ( by working or by looking for a job ) declines as people age through their 50s and 60s as is shown for women in the chart below. As a result the overall rate of labor force participation is projected to decline as the baby-boom cohorts ( those born between and ) advance into age brackets with much lower participation rates Female participation rises rapidly from age to drops off during the child-rearing years and then rises again to a maximum in the to age bracket as shown in the chart above. Looking at how the shape of this age-participation profile has evolved shows some striking changes : The participation rates of women in their 40s moved upward rapidly from the cohorts born in to those born in but has not risen any further in the years since. Also the dip in participation during the child-rearing years has become less pronounced. Neither of these patterns of evolution suggests that the pre-1999 trend of rising female participation will re-emerge. Although participation of women over age rose dramatically from the cohort born in to the cohort born in the age-participation profile of the cohort born in suggests that this trend of rising participation of older women is unlikely to continued on the next page | chapter1.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Box continued continue. This follows because the cohort shows no advance in participation at age ( their age in ) compared with somewhat older cohorts ( such as the or cohorts shown in the chart ) hinting that the rising participation rates for older women has plateaued Also the drop in participation during the child-rearing years has almost vanished leaving only a little room for further increase among to-35year-old women ahead the participation rate is projected to decline reflecting the aging of the baby-boom cohorts leading to more retirements and a likely increase in the share of people on disability pensions ( Box ) The Composition of Income over the Long Term The Administration s economic forecast is used to estimate future government revenues a purpose that requires a projection of the components of taxable income. The income-side projection is based on the historical stability of labor compensation as a share of gross domestic income ( GDI ) During the first half of the labor compensation share of GDI was percent ( according to the preliminary data available when the projection was Chapter chapter1.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM finalized ) below its average of percent. From this jumpoff point the labor share is projected to slowly return toward its historical average reaching percent by ( Another definition of the labor share including the imputed wages of the self-employed is higher about percent for the nonfarm business sector. ) The labor compensation share of GDI consists of wages and salaries ( which are taxable ) nonwage compensation ( employer contributions to employee pension and insurance funds which are not taxable ) and employer contributions for social insurance ( which are not taxable ) The Administration forecasts that the wage and salary share of compensation will change little between and As the labor share of GDI increases toward its historical average the capital share of GDI is expected to edge down from its currently high level before eventually reaching its historical average in Profits during the first half of were about percent of GDI well above their post-1959 average of roughly percent. Book profits ( also known in the national income accounts as profits before tax ) are expected to decline as a share of GDI. The GDI share of other taxable income ( rent dividends proprietors income and personal interest income ) is projected to edge up slightly over the next years Conclusion The economy entered a period of rebalancing in and as higher growth of nonresidential investment and exports offset the lower rates of housing investment. This rebalancing and the reduced rate of growth that goes with it is projected to continue in The bipartisan economic growth package called for by the President would provide insurance against the near-term risks of any broader economic slowdown related to financial and housing-related developments by providing a boost to consumption business investment and job creation. The economy is projected to settle into a steady state in which real GDP grows at about percent per year the unemployment rate stays around the level consistent with stable inflation ( about percent ) and inflation remains moderate and stable ( about on the CPI ) Consumer spending is projected to grow in line with disposable income and business investment and exports are projected to grow a bit faster than GDP as a whole. Economic forecasts are subject to error and unforeseen positive and negative developments will affect the course of the economy over the next several years. Given the economy s strong basic structure free mobility of labor relatively low taxes well-balanced capital markets and openness to trade prospects for continued growth in the years ahead remain | chapter1.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM good. Later chapters of this Report explore how pro-growth policies such as tax reform fiscal restraint open commerce and market-based reforms can enhance our economic performance Chapter chapter1.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM chapter1.indd 2/5/08 : : PM C H A P T E R Credit and Housing Markets I n the summer of the contraction in the U.S. housing market worsened and credit markets experienced a substantial disruption. Default rates on subprime mortgages particularly more recent vintages of adjustable-rate mortgages rose rapidly. As a result investors became worried about how much risk they had exposed themselves to by purchasing financial securities backed by these mortgages. Financial disruptions rippled through the U.S. and world financial markets as yields on many private debt securities rose sharply while investor demand for those securities dramatically fell As investors sought the safety of government securities demand for U.S Treasury securities spiked upward driving down their yields The Administration and the Federal Reserve independently responded to the subprime mortgage problem and the financial market disruptions. The Administration s policy response addressed problems in the subprime lending market and sought to improve the long-run functioning of the housing and credit markets through programs such as FHASecure and HOPE NOW FHASecure expands the Federal Housing Administration s ( FHA ) ability to offer home mortgage loan refinancing options by giving it the additional flexibility to help not only homeowners who are current on their mortgage payments but also borrowers in default who had made timely mortgage payments before their loan interest rates reset. HOPE NOW is an example of the government encouraging members of the private sector including lenders loan servicers mortgage counselors and investors to identify and reach out to at-risk borrowers and help more families stay in their homes The Federal Reserve addressed the risks to the economy from financial market disruptions by increasing liquidity and lowering interest rates and it addressed problems in the subprime mortgage market by joining with its fellow supervisory agencies to work on new consumer protection rules and to issue guidance to lending institutions Despite the magnitude of the disruption in financial markets the impact on the broader real economy was at least through the fourth quarter of largely confined to residential investment which had been weak for about years. Nonetheless the tightening of credit standards raises the possibility that spending by businesses and consumers could be restrained in the future Declines in housing wealth may also limit consumer spending chapter2.indd 2/5/08 : : PM The credit market disruptions appear to reflect a general repricing of risk that was triggered though not solely caused by subprime mortgage delinquencies which were in turn a partial result of declines in housing appreciation. New financial products such as certain mortgage-backed securities also added a layer of complexity to the recent credit market disruptions. These securities markedly expanded liquidity in the mortgage markets and provided many Americans a previously unavailable opportunity to own their own homes The key points from this chapter are : Rising delinquencies for subprime mortgages revealed an apparent underpricing of risk and raised concerns about which market participants were exposed to that risk but the subprime market was not the only cause for the contraction in credit markets The Federal Reserve provided liquidity and took measures to support financial stability in the financial markets in the wake of the disruptions in the credit markets The Administration focused its response on housing markets and helping homeowners avoid foreclosure in particular subprime borrowers facing increases in the interest rate on their adjustable-rate mortgages Participants in the credit and housing markets are actively addressing challenges that were revealed during the summer of Markets are generally better suited than government to adapting to changes in the economic environment ; markets can respond quickly to new information while government policy often reacts with a lag or has a delayed impact Financial innovations in the mortgage and credit markets have provided a range of economic benefits but not without some costs. Over time markets tend to retain valuable innovations and repair or eliminate flawed innovations The macroeconomic effects of the downturn in housing and the credit market disruptions may occur through several channels including the direct effect on residential investment the reduction of wealth on personal consumption and tighter lending standards on business investment What Are Credit Markets ? There are two primary ways to finance any economic activity : through equity or through debt. With equity financing investors take ownership shares in an economic venture such as investing in a new company and receive some fraction of the future returns. With debt or credit financing a creditor | chapter2.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM lends a debtor money today which the debtor must repay with interest in the future. Credit comes in many different forms : credit cards automobile loans mortgages corporate bonds and government bonds. Securities whose value is derived from underlying assets are called derivatives or derivative securities Credit markets are the markets in which loans and their derivative securities are traded Consider mortgages. Suppose a person wants to purchase a house but does not have enough cash on hand to buy it. The prospective borrower ( the debtor ) uses his available cash as a down payment and approaches a lender ( the creditor ) who lends the borrower the remaining money needed to cover the cost of the house. Over time the borrower earns income from his job and pays off the mortgage ( debt ) Because money today is worth more than money tomorrow the lender charges interest on the amount of the loan ( the principal ) The interest rate must be set high enough to compensate the lender for bearing the risks associated with the loan but low enough to make the loan attractive to the borrower Mortgages like most forms of credit are subject to three forms of risk : credit risk ( the risk that the debtor will default on the loan ) interest rate risk ( the risk that market interest rates will fluctuate ) and prepayment risk ( the risk that the borrower will pay off the loan early ) Lenders make money by charging borrowers interest payments on top of the periodic repayments of principal. Therefore the lender is worse off if these interest payments stop such as when the borrower defaults on a loan or pays off the loan early in an environment of low interest rates. Mortgage lenders may also face the risk of a loss of principal if a property is foreclosed upon. Loans with greater risk have higher interest rates to compensate the lender for bearing more risk Recent Developments in Mortgage Markets From to there was a substantial increase in the use of subprime mortgages. ( Box defines subprime mortgages and other mortgage market terminology. ) The share of mortgage originations that were subprime increased from percent in to more than percent in Subprime mortgages carry a greater risk than prime mortgages. Many subprime borrowers have poorer credit histories and less reliable sources of income than prime borrowers ; they may provide little or no documentation of income or assets from which they can pay the mortgage ; and they tend to have high loan-to-value ratios. As a result compared with prime borrowers subprime borrowers are more likely to default on their loans Chapter chapter2.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Box : Definitions of Select Mortgage Terms Adjustable-rate mortgage ( ARM ) : Adjustable-rate mortgages have an initial period with a fixed interest rate after which the interest rate adjusts at set periods. For example a 3/1 ARM would have a set interest rate for years but after that the interest rate would adjust every year The adjusted interest rate is a function of some index market interest rate such as the London Interbank Offer Rate Conforming loan limit : The charter-required limit as determined by Federal regulators placed on the size of loans that can be purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Default : A borrower defaults on a mortgage when he or she fails to make timely monthly mortgage payments or otherwise comply with mortgage terms. A mortgage is generally considered in default when payment has not been made for more than days. At this point foreclosure proceedings against the borrower become a strong possibility Delinquency : A borrower is delinquent on a mortgage when he or she fails to make one or more scheduled monthly payments Fannie Mae : Fannie Mae is the registered service mark of the Federal National Mortgage Association a U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise. Fannie Mae buys mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from primary mortgage lenders and sells mortgage-backed securities with guaranteed principal and interest payments. In return for this guaranty investors pay a fee to Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae also holds some of the mortgages it purchases and mortgage-backed securities it originates in its portfolio Fixed-rate mortgage ( FRM ) : A mortgage with an interest rate that remains the same throughout the life of the loan Foreclosure : A legal process in which a lender seeks recovery of collateral from a borrower ( in the case of home mortgages the home itself is the collateral ) with several possible outcomes including that the borrower sells the property or the lender repossesses the home Foreclosure laws are based on the statutes of each State Freddie Mac : Freddie Mac is the registered service mark of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation a U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise. Freddie Mac buys mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from primary mortgage lenders and sells mortgage-backed securities with guaranteed principal and interest payments. In return for this guaranty investors pay a fee to Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac also holds some of the mortgages it purchases and mortgage-backed securities it originates in its portfolio Jumbo loan : A loan that exceeds the conforming loan limit continued on the next page | chapter2.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Box continued Prime loan : Loans made to borrowers that meet stringent lending and underwriting terms and conditions. Prime borrowers have good credit records and meet standard guidelines for documentation of debt-toincome and loan-to-value ratios Reset : An interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage is said to have reset whenever it is adjusted or moved in the direction of the market interest rate that it tracks Subprime loan : Loans that meet less stringent lending and underwriting terms and conditions. Subprime borrowers may have weaker credit histories characterized by payment delinquencies ; previous charge-offs judgments or bankruptcies ; low credit scores ; high debtburden ratios ; high loan-to-value ratios ; or little to no documentation to prove income Workout : An adjustment to or renegotiation of a loan a lender makes with a borrower usually with the purpose of avoiding a default or foreclosure on the loan. Types of workouts include modifications to the original loan contract forbearance agreements ( agreements that postpone payments ) forgiveness of some debt and short sales ( the lender accepts the proceeds from the home s sale as settlement for the debt even if the proceeds do not cover the entire mortgage amount ) Strong house price appreciation in much of the country beginning in provided confidence that riskier borrowers could easily refinance mortgages using their built-up equity should they be unable to keep up with their monthly mortgage payments. This expectation of house price appreciation coupled with an increasingly competitive lending environment led lenders to relax their underwriting standards and offer products with features that lowered monthly payments. Loans with low initial payments including subprime loans helped further feed house price appreciation and increased the risk of eventual default and foreclosure due to their future interest rate resets. Some subprime loans were traditional fixed-rate mortgages ( FRMs ) that specified a fixed interest rate throughout the life of the loan while others were adjustable-rate mortgages ( ARMs ) with interest rates that followed a market interest rate such as the London Interbank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) the interest rate at which banks lend to one another using the London market About percent of subprime ARMs were 2/28 or 3/27 hybrid ARMs. A 2/28 hybrid ARM for example has years of payments at a fixed introductory interest rate after which it resets to a higher floating rate and then floats for the remaining years Chapter chapter2.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM At the same time the dollar volume of private mortgage-backed securities issued by private sector entities grew rapidly beginning in Investors were attracted to these securities because of their seemingly high risk-adjusted returns ; ARMs apparently shifted interest rate risk from the lender to the borrower whose mortgage payments would vary according to market interest rates. This provided continued liquidity support for the further expansion of mortgage lending including poorly underwritten subprime lending. Lenders sold loans on the secondary market passing risks on to investors who relied primarily on ratings of the securities provided by third-party rating agencies There are two important caveats to keep in mind when thinking about credit risk in the mortgage markets. First defaults and foreclosures are expected even in the best of times. Some individual borrowers will experience difficulties such as job loss that may lead them to default on their mortgages Eliminating defaults and foreclosures caused by such difficulties would be nearly impossible and efforts to do so by raising credit thresholds would have the unfortunate effect of restricting access to credit and therefore to home ownership for many prospective borrowers. Second in well-functioning markets risks are priced. There is nothing wrong or unnatural about the possibility of higher default and delinquency rates provided the borrower and lender enter the transaction fully informed. Lenders and investors can compensate for increased risk by setting an appropriately high interest rate Of course if information on credit risk is imperfect the demand for loans in the secondary market will be affected. For example if credit rating agencies or investors underestimate the default risk of subprime securities the market may underprice subprime risk leading to an excess quantity of subprime credit. See Box for background on the credit rating agencies Box : Credit Rating Agencies The securities credit rating industry began in but it was not until the 1930s that regulators began mandating the use of credit ratings. For example banks can not invest in bonds that are rated below investment grade ; insurance companies are required to link their capital requirements to the ratings of the bonds they invest in ; and the Securities and Exchange Commission s capital requirements require broker-dealers to hold investment-grade bonds in their portfolios In order to regulate these ratings the Securities and Exchange Commission created the National Recognized Statistical Rating Organization designation ( NRSRO ) in Since then the NRSRO category has become a de facto license and like all licenses it aims to enforce quality but in fact restricts quantity by granting monopoly power to the incumbent firms. Currently seven firms are designated continued on the next page | chapter2.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Box continued NRSROs. Critics have described the criteria for entry into the NRSRO designation as opaque effectively blocking new entry The industry came under scrutiny after a large energy company was rated investment grade days before its bankruptcy. In September the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act was passed to increase transparency and competition in the rating industry. Under the new act a credit rating firm whose ratings have been used by at least investors for years can apply for registration as an NRSRO Although the new law is still being implemented some contend that barriers to entry are still high and conflicts of interest between the rater and the issuer persist. The President s Working Group on Financial Markets is examining the need for reform of the credit rating agencies In defaults on mortgages began to increase but as shown in Chart the rise in default rates was concentrated in ARMs particularly subprime ARMs while default rates for FRMs were relatively unchanged The performance of subprime mortgages was particularly poor for more recent vintages. Subprime mortgages originated in and have defaulted much more quickly than those originated in and for example. By July of escalating subprime ARM default rates led lenders to sharply curtail new originations of subprime loans Chapter chapter2.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM The current rise in defaults reflects a combination of factors including flat or falling home prices weaker underwriting standards ( including higher loan-to-value ratios ) regional economic weakness and interest rate resets on subprime ARMs. About million owner-occupied loans in subprime mortgage pools are scheduled to reset in and For mortgages issued in the past several years defaults are occurring well before interest rates reset which suggests soft housing prices and weak underwriting standards may be more important factors. As housing prices began to falter flat or falling home prices combined with weaker underwriting standards meant that borrowers lost their equity cushion and had more difficulty refinancing or selling their homes. Borrowers who had purchased homes ( particularly homes for investment purposes ) but now owed more than the properties were worth had incentives to stop making mortgage payments in order to minimize their financial losses. Rising interest rates increased the probability of default and foreclosure for borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages because their monthly payments grew as rates were climbing. The relative importance of these factors may vary geographically as discussed in Box Worries in late summer about exposure to risk increased in the markets for other mortgages as well. In particular interest rates on jumbo mortgages ( mortgages in excess of the conforming loan limit of $ ) rose and jumbo mortgage originations slowed. Chart shows the increase since the summer of in interest rates for fixed-rate jumbo mortgages relative to fixed-rate conforming mortgages Box : Geographic Variations in Housing Markets Home prices vary significantly from neighborhood to neighborhood State to State and region to region. In for example the median sale price for an existing home sold in the western United States was well over $ compared with just $ in the Midwest. Within California the median price in San Jose was $ while the median price a few hours away in Sacramento was only $ Home prices increased from to and boomed from to rising over percent on average across the Nation but those gains also showed large regional variations. House prices rose most dramatically in the southeastern and western United States and to a lesser extent in New England and the mid-Atlantic. Likewise the subsequent deceleration ( or outright declines ) in house prices in also varied with the largest changes occurring in those places that had previously shown the most rapid appreciation or were experiencing prolonged economic weakness continued on the next page | chapter2.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Box continued Mortgage default rates have also varied substantially across regions Falling house prices and high loan-to-value ratios have likely lifted delinquency rates in places that had experienced substantial run-ups in prices ( such as Las Vegas and Miami ) while economic weakness has likely lifted delinquencies in some Midwestern cities Concerns about risk also affected the secondary market in which mortgages are bought and securitized that is bundled together and sold as a single security ( see Box ) The government-sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securitize the majority of prime mortgages below the conforming loan limit. The secondary market for GSE-securitized mortgages remained active through presumably largely because some investors believe that these securities have an implicit guarantee from the U.S. Federal Government even though no such guarantee exists. In contrast the securitization of jumbo mortgages slowed as investors shied away from securities not created by the GSEs Chapter chapter2.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Box : Securitization and Structured Finance Securitization is the transformation of a collection of individual assets into tradable securities. These asset-backed securities are created by financial institutions including banks and government-sponsored enterprises from pools of assets such as mortgages car loans credit card loans corporate receivables and student loans Mortgages make up a large fraction of asset-backed securities Traditionally a lender makes a loan to a borrower in what is called the primary market. In the secondary market a financial institution buys multiple loans which taken together are essentially a bundle of cash flows. The simplest mortgage-backed security is a pass-through security for which the interest and principal payments of the individual loans pass through to the holders of the new securities Securitization has two major economic benefits : increased risk diversification and increased available capital. With securitization an investor with $ can own percent portions of $ mortgages rather than having to purchase a single such mortgage. If a single continued on the next page | chapter2.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Box continued mortgage defaults the investor bears a $ loss instead of a full $ loss. If investors are risk-averse this diversification makes them better off. A security can also include portions of diverse types of mortgages which further spreads risk if the payment performance on the individual mortgages is not perfectly correlated. Securitization benefits lenders by enabling them to sell loans to those investors who can better handle the risks associated with mortgage borrowers. The sale of mortgages provides lenders with cash that they can then use to supply more mortgages. Investors benefit from the availability of additional securities The second economic benefit of securitization is an increase in available capital. More risk-diversified securities draw additional investors into the market expanding the amount of capital in the market This increased supply of credit may result in a lower cost of credit for borrowers which everything else remaining equal makes home ownership more accessible Credit Market Disruptions in There were significant disruptions in financial markets in the summer of Problems became evident in June and July when several hedge funds reported large losses and a large mortgage lender faced mounting problems In late July demand for U.S. Treasury securities jumped due to a flightto-quality as investors shied away from mortgage-related assets and to a lesser degree corporate bonds and other relatively riskier assets. The shift away from corporate bonds resulted in a wider spread between interest rates on U.S. Treasuries and those on corporate bonds following several years of narrow spreads. Conditions in financial markets worsened in early August when several hedge funds experienced large losses. One European fund even stopped investor redemptions saying that it was not possible to value certain securities. The disruptions led investors to try to maintain highly liquid positions and to focus on assets that were perceived as less risky and more easily priced Credit Market Link to Mortgages The housing and credit markets are linked through the securitization of mortgages. The resulting mortgage-backed securities are often further packaged into other more complicated financial securities. Originations of mortgages that could not be purchased and securitized by Fannie Mae Chapter chapter2.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM and Freddie Mac slowed sharply in the summer as investors worried about exposure to risk. This contraction in the secondary market for mortgages had implications for mortgage originations : When banks are unable to sell mortgages they originate they have fewer funds available for further originations. In addition banks may be unwilling to hold some of the mortgages they originate because their appetite for risk may differ from that of the investors who previously bought their loans. Securitization problems also emerged for jumbo mortgages which are not purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Flight to Quality When credit markets became disrupted investors engaged in a flight to quality as indicated by the large increase in demand for U.S. Treasury securities. Because investors have high confidence that the U.S. Government will not default on its debt the demand for U.S. Treasury securities which include a variety of bills notes and bonds tends to rise during periods of increased financial uncertainty. This increased demand pushes down Treasury yields ( which move inversely with prices ) relative to private lending rates such as the London Interbank Offered Rate as shown in Chart | chapter2.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Corporate bond yields also rose relative to U.S. Treasury securities. The higher yield on a corporate bond reflects among other things the relatively higher likelihood of default ( credit risk ) the risk of not being able to find a buyer for the bond ( liquidity risk ) and the potential for default to be correlated with other macroeconomic factors ( systemic risk ) The spread between the interest rates on corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury notes is therefore a barometer of risk in the market. In late July these credit spreads spiked upwards even though they still remained low by historical standards as Chart illustrates Financial market participants also showed a preference for making shorterterm rather than longer-term loans to one another. This preference reflected a concern among some participants that they might unexpectedly need cash and therefore did not want to have it wrapped up in longer-term loans. Some participants also worried about the potential risk of default among their borrowers. As a result the costs of borrowing for longer terms rose relative to overnight borrowing Chapter chapter2.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Contraction of the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Market Another credit market that contracted in was the asset-backed commercial paper ( ABCP ) market. As of January the ABCP market was an $ billion market roughly percent of the $ trillion U.S commercial paper market which itself is roughly one-fifth the size of the $ trillion U.S. corporate bond market. Corporations issue short-term loans called commercial paper to smooth temporary fluctuations in cash flows ; the commercial paper market is one market for short-term financing for firms For example suppose a firm needs to make certain seasonal payments and has a current cash flow constraint. The firm issues commercial paper into the market in exchange for cash then repays the loan in or days. This loan is unsecured in that it does not specify collateral in case of default. For blue-chip firms default is unlikely. However any firm that defaults on a commercial paper loan is almost surely on the brink of bankruptcy because the default signals to the market that it doesn t have enough cash to pay off the most immediate of its financial obligations Commercial paper that is secured by assets ( such as a firm s receivables auto loans or mortgage-backed securities ) is known as asset-backed commercial paper. For example if an automobile manufacturer sells cars but does not receive payment for the cars for month its receivables account will document the expected cash flow month into the future. Therefore a bank can issue to the market commercial paper backed by the receivables of the firm. If the firm defaults on its obligations the holder of the ABCP can receive some payment from the receivables of the firm Usually ABCP is issued by a special-purpose vehicle or conduit sponsored by a bank that buys assets such as receivables from multiple corporations and issues commercial paper backed by these assets to the outside market. Because ABCP conduits issue short-term debt to finance longer-term assets they must continue to issue new commercial paper to repay maturing commercial paper ( a process called rolling ) Special-purpose vehicles can provide corporations with relatively low-cost access to the short-term financing available in commercial paper markets. These vehicles are not subject to the regulatory capital charge that is mandated for banks that extend credit directly to borrowers. For example a bank that makes a direct loan to an automobile manufacturer would have to hold capital against that loan. But a bank that sponsored a special-purpose vehicle ( which it did not own ) could keep the manufacturer as a customer ( and earn some fees ) without bearing the credit risk of a direct loan and without facing a capital charge. Structured investment vehicles ( SIVs ) are a type of conduit that issues both commercial paper and medium-term notes to finance the purchase of assets. SIVs differ from ABCP | chapter2.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM conduits in that SIVs have less access to backup credit facilities ( called liquidity support ) in case they are unable to meet their short-term debt obligations The credit market disruptions seriously shook the ABCP markets. Investors began to differentiate more between the various types of ABCP and they demanded higher returns on ABCP that had less liquidity support. As a result of this greater investor scrutiny and investor reluctance to purchase commercial paper issued by entities with limited or no backstop liquidity the volume of outstanding ABCP shrank more than percent from $ billion in early August to about $ billion in late December ( Chart ) Increased concern about risk associated with ABCP and risk in general prompted a flight to quality as investors shifted to low-risk short-term Treasuries. Because ABCP is used to fund SIVs the reduced demand for ABCP forced banks to either bring the underlying assets ( and their associated liabilities ) back onto their balance sheets or reduce the size of their SIVs by selling off the assets Slower Merger and Acquisition Activity The relatively low cost of credit contributed to a boom in mergers and acquisitions ( M&A ) in recent years but announced M&A deals slowed Chapter chapter2.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM sharply following the credit disruptions in mid-2007. The aggregate value of announced M&A deals fell off sharply in late summer after having climbed to the highest levels since as shown in Chart Over the months through August the value of M&A deals were about $ trillion but over the following months these deals totaled just $ billion at an annual rate. Banks that were underwriting leveraged buyouts ( LBOs ) whereby a company or investor uses debt to finance the purchase of another company s assets found that buyers were no longer as willing to purchase the debt associated with LBOs which meant that banks had to keep more of the debt on their own books possibly limiting the ability of some banks to make further loans Equity Markets Equity markets continued to function amid the disruptions in the credit markets but implied stock price volatility an indicator of investor uncertainty jumped during the summer and remained sensitive to news about credit market developments. Unlike many credit market instruments that trade infrequently and are hard to price stocks trade in high volumes and are continually repriced making them much more transparent financial instruments | chapter2.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM International Implications A notable aspect of the disruptions in the U.S. credit and housing markets was that it was felt globally. Subprime losses appeared not only in the United States but also in the portfolios of banks and investors in Europe Australia and Asia demonstrating how interconnected global capital markets have become. This international diversification provided a clear benefit as the impact of subprime losses were shared rather than concentrated solely on U.S. investors and financial institutions. In some cases European banks were more severely affected at least initially by the credit market disruptions than were U.S. banks. Lastly both the European Central Bank and the U.S Federal Reserve boosted liquidity in similar and effectively simultaneous actions ( discussed later in this chapter ) Policy Response to Credit Market Disruptions The mortgage and credit market disruptions of the summer of shook investor confidence. As in previous financial disruptions however these markets again demonstrated their resilience and flexibility. The possibility of gains from trade forces markets to adjust quickly and self-correct. In many cases the Federal Reserve has better tools at its disposal for addressing certain credit market problems than do fiscal policymakers. For example the Federal Reserve can act to stave off certain types of liquidity problems such as short-term cash availability at major banks but not other liquidity problems such as a lack of trading in asset-backed commercial paper that results from investors doubts about the value of the paper The Federal Reserve took a variety of actions in the second half of to maintain financial stability and encourage continued economic growth In early August the Federal Reserve used open market operations to inject large amounts of liquidity into financial markets. The Federal Funds rate the interest rate at which U.S. banks lend to other banks overnight fell below the target rate. On August the Federal Reserve made credit more easily available by enacting a 50-basis-point reduction in the discount rate the interest rate that banks are charged when they borrow from the Federal Reserve s discount window. The Federal Reserve also permitted the provision of term financing for terms as long as days and reiterated the Federal Reserve s policy of accepting a broad range of collateral for loans from the discount window including home mortgages and related assets On September the Federal Reserve reduced the discount rate by an additional basis points and lowered the target Federal Funds rate by basis points. On October the Federal Funds rate and the discount rate were lowered another basis points Chapter chapter2.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM The Federal Reserve Bank of New York s Open Market Trading Desk announced on November that it would increase the availability of credit in financial markets by conducting certain open market operations for terms that extended past the end of the year. On December the Federal Funds rate and discount rate were cut another basis points. The following day the Federal Reserve announced two new actions in coordination with other central banks actions that were designed to boost liquidity. The first action was a series of term fund auctions short-term loans to depository institutions. The second action was the establishment of temporary currency arrangements with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank that make dollars available to these banks to alleviate dollar funding pressures in their jurisdictions. The Federal Reserve cut rates further in January Policy Response to Housing Market Challenges Housing market policies have been of two types. First are policies that are created to encourage market participants to make use of tools they already possess and provide targeted assistance to borrowers. Second are those that are designed to make changes to the future functioning of the housing market Policies should be crafted in a manner that avoids unnecessarily restricting access to credit and financial market innovation. Some policies encourage developing private market solutions such as recommending that lenders develop a mortgage workout plan with borrowers rather than progressing through the foreclosure process. Box discusses the challenges of workouts Policies may also be designed to offer targeted assistance such as increasing access to FHA-insured loans for subprime borrowers facing interest rate resets. To strengthen the market for the future other policies address fundamental problems that markets may be slow to address themselves such as better disclosure of loan terms total settlement charges and other mortgage characteristics. In addition policies that require or provide incentives for lenders and investors to perform quality due diligence would promote true risk-based pricing in the subprime sector and could make this sector more competitive Addressing Current Challenges The Administration has worked with lenders loan servicers mortgage counselors and investors to develop private sector solutions. The HOPE NOW initiative is an effort to encourage private sector servicers housing counselors and investors to work together. The goal is to provide relief to homeowners. The Administration has encouraged market participants who historically have not shared information resources or business practices to | chapter2.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM come together to create a coordinated plan to help homeowners. Importantly HOPE NOW has no budgetary cost to the Federal Government. HOPE NOW participants have agreed on a new set of industry-wide standards designed to help streamline the mortgage workout process for borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages who can afford their current mortgage payments but will have trouble when their interest rates rise. The standards aim to help keep these borrowers mortgages affordable in three ways : refinancing their existing loans into new private mortgages moving them into FHASecure loans or freezing their current interest rates for years. HOPE NOW also has an informational component which has increased outreach to borrowers through mailings and has supported a toll-free hotline 1-888-995-HOPE to provide 24-hour mortgage counseling in multiple languages Box : Mortgage Lending Today Securitization has helped drive the expansion of home ownership available credit and the selection of mortgage products throughout the Nation. Before securitization was a prominent market force the mortgage industry was characterized by the portfolio lending model. Under this model a bank made a loan to a borrower and the loan remained on the bank s balance sheet until the loan was paid off. The bank serviced the loan meaning that it collected interest and principal payments from the borrower throughout the duration of the loan. If the borrower became delinquent or defaulted on the mortgage the bank would evaluate the economic feasibility of a mortgage workout plan with the borrower perhaps by modifying terms or establishing a repayment program for missed payments versus working through the foreclosure process Expanded use of mortgage securitization has partly eclipsed the portfolio lending model and has drawn in new market participants. Now a German businessperson can invest in a hedge fund that purchases mortgage-backed securities which themselves are pools of mortgages from lenders in Minnesota. The German businessperson is investing in mortgages and supporting the availability of credit for a teacher in Minnesota who wants to buy her first home. Thus securitization provides liquidity and risk diversification in an increasingly integrated world The rise of securitization has meant that a third party is needed to service the bundled loans that is collect payments from borrowers and distribute payments to investors. Loan servicing has developed into a sophisticated industry. Loan servicers can be commercial banks community banks investment banks and/or third-party corporations Servicers typically transfer interest and principal payments to master servicers or loan trustees before these payments reach the actual continued on the next page Chapter chapter2.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Box continued investors. The servicer makes mortgage payments on behalf of the borrower and retains a portion of the payment as its own revenue A Pooling and Servicing Agreement ( PSA ) dictates the rules on loan modifications between the lender the investor and the servicer One challenge is that PSAs often have different terms which may make large-scale loan modifications more difficult for servicers to accomplish. To solve this problem there has been a recent movement to allow servicers more freedom to modify loans for distressed borrowers In the summer of a private sector group representing servicers lenders and financial institutions issued guiding principles for the securitization and servicing industries. These principles are intended to increase the uniformity of contracts across the Nation. Less variation in contracts allows servicers to develop uniform practices for dealing with renegotiation lowering the costs of modifying loans The Administration launched a new program at the FHA called FHASecure as a targeted response aimed at keeping families in their homes. The FHA was created in to insure ( but not originate ) mortgages for qualified low- and moderate-income borrowers with less-than-perfect credit and little savings for a down payment. This insurance boosts home ownership by enabling borrowers who may have been priced out of the mortgage market to acquire housing on more affordable terms. The FHA works through a network of approved lenders and guarantees that if the borrower defaults on the loan the FHA will pay the lender the full outstanding balance of the loan. Unlike many subprime lenders most of the FHA s risk is covered by charging mortgage insurance premiums not through significantly higher interest rates FHASecure can help some creditworthy borrowers who are affected by subprime interest rate resets to refinance their mortgages. The FHASecure program applies both to homeowners who are current on their mortgage payments and borrowers who made timely mortgage payments before their loans reset but are now in default. A borrower in default must also have sufficient income to make future mortgage payments under a fixed-rate FHA-insured loan and a history of on-time mortgage payments before their current loan reset. Making FHA mortgage refinancing options available to more homeowners will help reduce the number of foreclosures and can help bring greater stability to local housing markets The President signed a bill to temporarily change the current Federal tax code so that cancelled mortgage debt is not treated as taxable income. Under prior law if the value of a home declines and a portion of the debt on the | chapter2.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM home is forgiven that portion is treated like taxable income for the borrower For example suppose a homeowner owes $ on a mortgage and the home s value falls to $ If the mortgage lender agrees to take $ from the proceeds of the home s sale and forgive the rest of the debt the old tax code treated the $ of forgiven debt as income on which the homeowner must pay taxes. Under the new law the homeowner need not pay taxes on the forgiven debt The Administration has also proposed legislation to allow State and local governments to temporarily broaden their tax-exempt bond programs to include mortgage refinancings. Under current law State and local governments are allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds called qualified mortgage bonds to finance new mortgage loans to first-time home buyers with some limits on which mortgages can be covered. If passed this legislation would reduce the cost of State and local housing agency programs that aim to refinance borrowers facing unaffordable rate resets into lower-cost fixed-rate mortgages Strengthening the Mortgage Market for the Future High default rates which have contributed to recent market disruptions are more likely if consumers do not understand the terms of their loans Transparency in mortgage lending helps borrowers find affordable mortgages and avoid predatory lending. Transparent markets lower the chance that borrowers will default on loans. The Administration is working on a new rule under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) that would simplify shopping for loans and reduce settlement costs for consumers. RESPA was originally passed in to protect mortgage borrowers from unnecessarily high settlement charges. This new rule would simplify and improve disclosure requirements for mortgage settlement costs making it easier for borrowers to shop for loans. The rule would establish a new standard Good Faith Estimate form that loan originators would be required to provide to borrowers in all RESPA-covered transactions. The aim of the rule is to communicate complex information to borrowers so that borrowers will be able to shop effectively for the best loan for them and understand the obligations they are undertaking when financing a home with a mortgage The Federal Reserve is also working to improve transparency through a review of the rules for mortgage lending under the Truth in Lending Act In December the Federal Reserve published proposed rules under Regulation Z of the Truth in Lending Act to make mortgage lending more transparent. The new rules would prohibit seven misleading advertising practices such as using the term fixed to refer to a rate that can change and would require truth-in-lending disclosures to borrowers early enough to use while shopping for a mortgage Chapter chapter2.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM The Federal Reserve is using its rule-making authority under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act ( HOEPA ) to address unfair or deceptive mortgage lending practices. In December the Federal Reserve proposed in addition to the rules regarding transparency discussed above new rules under the Truth in Lending Act that would address unfair mortgage lending. For example the rules would require subprime lenders to verify income and assets before making a loan and would prohibit subprime lenders from making loans without considering borrowers ability to repay them. The rules would also prohibit all lenders from paying mortgage brokers yield spread premiums fees paid by a lender to a broker for higherrate loans without notifying the consumer in advance and from coercing appraisers to misrepresent the value of a home The Administration s proposed FHA Modernization legislation aims to reform the FHA to better reflect the way in which the private mortgage market operates particularly the way it prices risk. From September to February FHA loan volume fell precipitously from mortgage endorsements in September to just in February as Chart shows. The drop reflects several factors including low interest rates that made unassisted mortgages affordable for more families the private sector s increased use of automated underwriting that allowed the private sector to offer loans on favorable terms to more home buyers and the increased use of subprime mortgages. In general it is a positive development when the private sector is offering favorable terms to borrowers who previously would have turned to the FHA. Unfortunately some borrowers are still underserved particularly in the subprime market. The FHA s mission is to serve borrowers who are at the margins of home ownership by offering safe affordable options without compromising underwriting standards. In recent years the FHA s outdated statutory authority has limited the agency s ability to keep pace with the evolving mortgage market. As a result borrowers opted for the innovative products and risk-based pricing that were available in the private sector FHA Modernization which was first proposed in the Administration s budget is designed to restore a choice to home buyers who can not qualify for prime financing. The three major elements of FHA reform are to : ( ) Allow the FHA to price insurance premiums based on borrower risk ; ( ) Raise loan limits in high-cost markets so that more families can be served ; and ( ) Lower the down payment requirements Currently the premiums for FHA mortgage insurance do not vary according to a borrower s credit risk or to the expected cost from defaults This causes better borrowers to subsidize weaker borrowers ( a process called cross-subsidization ) Charging the same price for all borrowers is a form of average-cost pricing while charging different prices according to cost ( here risk ) is a shift toward marginal-cost pricing which is more efficient On top of this cross-subsidization has driven lower-risk borrowers to seek | chapter2.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM alternatives offered in the conventional market. The proposed risk-based pricing addresses this issue by reducing the cost of FHA mortgages for lowerrisk borrowers. Risk-based pricing will also enable borrowers to know why they are paying certain costs and what they can do to help lower these costs in the future. The incentives for families to improve their credit histories or save for a down payment are important elements of risk-based pricing. While full risk-based pricing requires a Congressional act to raise the premium caps a partial limited version of risk-based pricing can take place through regulation. The new flexibility under the FHASecure program includes these regulatory changes in risk-based pricing and the Administration has called on Congress to pass the broader FHA Modernization legislation to fully implement risk-based pricing The second piece of FHA modernization would allow the FHA to insure higher-priced homes. Under current law the FHA may insure loans that are up to percent of the conforming loan limit. In certain high-cost States this limit is below the median home price in the State. For example in California the median home price in was $ which is more than the current FHA cap of $ Therefore in certain States the FHA can not insure many of the homes in the State. The Modernization bill broadens the reach of the FHA program by removing the percent cap and allowing the FHA to insure up to percent of the conforming loan limit Chapter chapter2.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Finally the third piece of FHA modernization would eliminate the down payment requirements. Currently an FHA mortgagor is required to make a percent cash contribution at settlement to be applied to the cost of acquisition of the property. The Administration s proposal removes this percent requirement. Just like risk-based pricing the change in down payment requirements moves away from the one size fits all approach and provides the FHA with the flexibility to insure a variety of mortgage products for different purposes and different borrowers Macroeconomic Implications The potential macroeconomic effects of the housing market weakness and the credit market disruptions may operate through several channels including residential investment personal consumption and business investment. In addition the production of some manufactured goods used in construction has been weak and employment in some finance-related sectors has fallen off. Many economists would agree that the downturn in the housing market has likely had some effects on consumption and business investment but the magnitude of the effects are unknown The effect on residential investment is the easiest to quantify. Between the fourth quarter of and the fourth quarter of real residential investment dropped about percent and subtracted an average of nearly percentage point per quarter at an annual rate from real GDP growth Single-family housing starts peaked at more than million units in January and then fell more than percent to below units in December Inventories of unsold homes are at elevated levels : the inventory-to-sales ratio for existing single-family homes in December at months supply was down from the previous few months but still near highs last reached in As prices for new and existing homes adjust to clear excess inventories housing starts will stop declining and the drag on GDP growth from residential investment will lessen A second effect of the downturn in housing is the potential effect on personal consumption and saving. For many households their house is their primary asset and a significant source of wealth. A considerable academic literature has shown that increases in wealth tend to boost consumption though the estimated magnitude of these so-called wealth effects is imprecise and may depend upon the type of asset ( such as stock market wealth versus housing wealth ) In the case of housing wealth some calculations suggest that a $ billion decline in the value of the housing stock would reduce the long-run level of annual consumption by between $ billion and $ billion. Importantly consumption responds only gradually | chapter2.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM to such a change in wealth which affords fiscal and monetary policy the time to provide an offset A third effect of the recent credit market disruptions is that lending standards have been tightened ( Chart ) for mortgages and other types of consumer loans as well as for commercial real estate and other types of business lending Tighter lending standards tend to reduce residential investment by making it more difficult to obtain mortgages. Consumption expenditures are also likely to be lower for two reasons. First new homeowners may need to save more for their down payments than had previously been the case which reduces consumption during the period in which they are saving. Second existing homeowners may find it more difficult to borrow against their home equity or to engage in cash-out refinancings that previously might have boosted their short-term consumption On the business side tighter lending standards would tend make investment more expensive. Historically business fixed investment has exceeded the internally generated funds of corporations ( also known as cash flow ) by a substantial margin. The gap between these two measures is financed by issuing equity or taking on corporate debt such as corporate bonds or bank loans. In recent years this gap has been considerably smaller which suggests Chapter chapter2.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM corporations have not needed to borrow funds from other sectors as much as they did in the past. However this gap is reemerging and firms may need to borrow more in the future at which point tighter lending standards might become more limiting though this effect has not been apparent through the third quarter of Conclusion All economic activity requires flows of capital between different parties at different times. This borrowing and lending activity takes place constantly in the world credit markets. These markets are essential to every well-functioning economy because they shift capital from those who supply it ( creditors ) to those who demand it ( debtors ) Credit markets include a wide variety of instruments such as corporate bonds government bonds and money market instruments ( commercial paper certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements among others ) The Federal Reserve s monetary policies influence the general price of borrowing and lending in the economy. Lenders can charge a higher interest payment to compensate themselves for bearing additional risk Like any market the credit markets bring together a diverse set of buyers and sellers and the price of the debt instrument represents an exchange between these two parties The summer of witnessed a contraction in the credit markets that caused the price of borrowing to rise and the quantity of some types of debt offered to the market to shrink. This contraction took place in several markets including the mortgage lending market and the asset-backed commercial paper market. As markets evolve and adapt to economic conditions prices and quantities will adjust. The impact on the nonfinancial real economy has been muted to date notwithstanding the decline in residential investment over the past years. However the effects of declining home prices in some parts of the country and the tightening of credit standards is likely to have at least some effect on consumer and business spending as time passes Monetary policy actions can offset some of the weakening in aggregate demand that results from disruptions in the housing and credit markets and other government policies can offer targeted assistance. FHASecure and FHA Modernization are leading examples of targeted assistance to homeowners and subprime borrowers facing the possibility of foreclosure on their homes These borrowers purchased their homes during a period in which lenders underpriced risk and offered subprime mortgages at low prices to too many borrowers. FHASecure can help those eligible borrowers who were caught off guard by rapidly evolving credit markets and in some cases predatory | chapter2.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM lending. FHA Modernization will encourage a more flexible and better functioning risk-based mortgage lending market for those with low and moderate incomes Beyond such targeted responses the best course of action is often to simply allow markets to adjust. Financial markets are in a constant process of pricing risk. Economic factors fluctuate daily and the prices of traded debt instruments reflect investors attitudes toward the risks associated with these fluctuations. By their very nature markets have a remarkable resilience and can adapt rapidly to changing economic circumstances as demonstrated by the response of the markets to the credit market disruptions that began in the summer of Policies that attempt to protect market participants from the discipline of the market risk delaying necessary adjustments and creating a potential moral hazard problem by giving lenders and borrowers less incentive to make prudent financial decisions in the future Markets naturally self-correct rewarding good strategies and punishing bad ones. Government actions may be less effective at differentiating between the two and may prevent markets from creating products that benefit consumers In addition any government actions mitigating the outcomes of risky behavior may create perverse incentives for reckless decisions by borrowers and investors who may come to rely on government interventions. Allowing the market to price mortgage risk will help ensure that subprime mortgages are available to those who can afford to repay them. With enhanced transparency the market can weed out poor financial products while encouraging positive financial innovations a process that is crucial to maintaining U.S. competitiveness in the global financial community Chapter chapter2.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM chapter2.indd 2/5/08 : : PM C H A P T E R The Causes and Consequences of Export Growth T he rapid growth of U.S. exports has been one of the most important economic developments of the past few years. In the years from the end of to the end of real exports grew at an annual average rate of percent more than twice as fast as the overall U.S. economy. This growth has provided clear benefits to the entrepreneurs owners and workers of firms in export-oriented industries and more broadly to the U.S. economy as a whole. This chapter identifies the factors that have driven recent export growth and discusses several longer-term trends that have lifted exports over time. More broadly the chapter also addresses the benefits that flow from open trade and investment policies as well as some related challenges The key points of this chapter are : The United States is the world s largest exporter with $ trillion in goods and services exports in The United States was the top exporter of services and second-largest exporter of goods behind only Germany In recent years factors that have likely contributed to the growth in exports include rising foreign income the expansion of production in the United States and changes in exchange rates. One reflection of that growth is that exports accounted for more than a third of U.S. economic growth during and Over time falling tariffs and transport and communication costs have likely lowered the cost of many U.S. goods in foreign markets boosting demand for U.S. exports Open trade and investment policies have increased access to export markets. Increased investment across borders by U.S. companies facilitates exports Greater export opportunities give U.S. producers incentives to innovate for a worldwide market. Increased innovation and the competition that comes from trade liberalization help raise the living standard of the average U.S. citizen Nearly all economists agree that growth in the volume and value of exports and imports increases the standard of living for the average individual but they also agree that the gains from trade are not equally distributed and some individuals bear costs. The Administration has proposed policies to improve training and support to individuals affected by trade disruption chapter3.indd 2/5/08 : : PM Economists often call attention to the benefits of trade that result from importing goods and services benefits that have been well-documented in previous issues of the Economic Report of the President. Building on that prior work this chapter focuses on exporting and the benefits that arise from exporting goods and services. Some of the benefits are well known. Others however have come to be known more recently as researchers have combined new data with trade theory to provide a better understanding of international trade and international transactions The Causes of Recent Export Growth In the United States exported nearly $ trillion worth of goods and services. Nominal exports grew by percent from to while nominal gross domestic product ( GDP ) grew percent ; was the third consecutive year in which nominal exports grew faster than the economy as a whole. Chart which displays nominal exports as a share of nominal GDP shows that such rapid export growth is impressive but also that it is not uncommon for growth in exports to outpace growth in GDP. Exports have grown faster than the economy for much of the past years. That trend was interrupted by the worldwide economic slowdown in and but resumed in | chapter3.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM From to the countries and regions contributing to our export growth were also relatively dispersed. Chart displays the average annual growth rate of nominal exports to eight different regions. Export growth was positive in each of these regions and with the exception of Japan exports increased faster than nominal U.S. output. The fastest-growing markets for U.S. exporters were India and China where U.S. exports grew at an average annual rate of nearly and percent respectively. These growth rates imply that exports to India more than doubled and exports to China nearly doubled over this period. Export growth to Eastern Europe and Africa also exceeded percent per year America s export growth has occurred not only in traditional export sectors such as machinery high-technology products and agricultural goods America s services exports have been growing strongly as well especially private services such as education finance business services professional services and technical services ( Box ) Between and the nominal value of private services exports increased by percent compared with percent for goods exports. Private services comprise percent of U.S. private GDP so expanding services markets is important to enable continued export growth Chapter chapter3.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Box : Trade in Services Discussions of trade often focus on goods but trade also involves a wide variety of services such as banking and finance insurance information management medical legal tourism and transportation services The United States is the world s largest exporter of services exporting more than $ billion worth of services in almost double the amount exported by the United Kingdom the second largest exporter The United States runs a trade surplus in services one indicator that it has a relative advantage over other countries ; in U.S. services exports exceeded imports by nearly $ billion. Still services are not traded to the same extent that goods are. Even though private services account for percent of U.S. private GDP they account for only percent of U.S. exports Services have some features that make them more complicated to trade than goods. Most important goods can be produced stored shipped and consumed at different points in time but many services must be produced and used simultaneously. Nevertheless the same basic economic principles that apply to trade in goods also apply to trade in services. The main factors used in the production of many services are skilled labor and high-tech capital two resources the United States has in abundance. As a result the United States has an advantage compared to other countries in producing many types of goods and services that rely heavily on these two resources Trade in services has benefited from two relatively recent developments. First advances in telecommunications and information technology have lowered the costs of providing and acquiring services Thus while these technical advances may have resulted in the relocation of some business professional and technical services the United States still maintains a sizable trade surplus in these services. In exports of business professional and technical services grew almost percent to more than $ billion and trade in those services generated a surplus of $ billion. Second the establishment of facilities abroad by U.S. companies has allowed our business-services providers more direct contact with their customers in other countries However large barriers to trade in services remain. In order to remove these barriers the Administration is pursuing further liberalization of services trade in the Doha Development Agenda negotiations multilateral negotiations by members of the World Trade Organization aimed at lowering trade barriers worldwide. Recent free-trade agreements have also included substantial liberalization of the services sectors. One study estimates the long-run effect of a worldwide move to completely free trade in services could translate into enormous economic gains for continued on the next page | chapter3.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Box continued the United States boosting real GDP by percent. In today s dollars GDP would increase by about $ billion roughly $ per person The large income gains that are estimated to come from liberalizing services trade reflect the advantage the United States has in producing services relative to other countries the large share of the U.S. economy represented by services and the world s relatively high barriers to services trade Four factors have contributed to the strong U.S. export performance. First our trading partners income growth has boosted their demand for U.S products. Second increased productive capacity in the United States has expanded our ability to serve foreign demand. Third changes in exchange rates since made American goods cheaper on world markets. Finally the longer-run decline in transportation costs lower tariffs and the removal of other barriers to trade have made it easier for U.S. products to penetrate export markets. Together these factors not only affect exports but they also influence the current account a broader measure of trade and a part of the balance of payments between the United States and the rest of the world ( see Box ) Foreign Income Growth Perhaps the most important factor driving the recent increase in exports has been the growth of income of our main trading partners. As income increases around the world demand for U.S. products increases as well. This relationship is depicted in Chart which shows the real growth of exports and foreign GDP. There are several aspects of this graph that are noteworthy First foreign GDP growth and U.S. export growth tend to rise or fall together. As other countries become richer they demand more goods and services including U.S. goods and services. Strong worldwide expansions such as those in the late 1980s and the mid-1990s led to strong U.S. export growth Weakness in the world economy such as that during and led to weak export growth or even declines. Recent years have experienced a period of strong worldwide growth led by fast-growing emerging markets such as China relatively strong growth in Europe and faster GDP growth in Latin America ; this growth has been a key driver of rapid U.S. export growth Chapter chapter3.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Box : The Current Account Deficit The current account measures the value of international trade in goods and services investment income flows and unilateral international transfers. Trade in goods and services is the single largest component of the current account. In the trade deficit was $ billion and the current account deficit was $ billion ; that is the trade deficit accounted for percent of the current account deficit. Exports have grown much faster than imports and this helped narrow the current account deficit in absolute terms and relative to GDP as shown in the chart. In the fourth quarter of the current account deficit totaled $ billion at an annualized rate or percent of GDP. In the third quarter of the current account deficit fell to $ billion at an annualized rate or percent of GDP as export growth greatly exceeded import growth | chapter3.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Second export growth is much more volatile than foreign GDP growth Exports grew much faster than the world economy during the expansions of the 1980s the mid-1990s and the past few years. But export growth fell below worldwide economic growth during the worldwide slowdowns in and This type of volatility occurs because changes and expected changes in foreign output typically lead to large changes in investment in those economies ; investment is strongly related to demand for capital goods plants and equipment used in production and consumer durables goods used over time such as refrigerators which U.S. production helps satisfy. Most U.S. exports of goods are capital goods consumer durable goods and inputs that are used to produce them and are therefore very sensitive to changes in foreign GDP. Capital goods and consumer durables account for percent of nonenergy U.S. merchandise exports Industrial supplies which are often used in the production of capital goods and durable goods account for percent of nonenergy U.S. exports. For example in the United States exported almost $ billion worth of automobiles auto parts tractors and trucks ; $ billion worth of electronic circuits ; more than $ billion worth of airplanes and aircraft ; and nearly $ billion worth of parts and components for office machinery Chapter chapter3.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Growth in Domestic Production A second factor that has contributed to the growth in exports is the expansion of the U.S. economy. As the U.S. economy s productive capacity expands its ability to produce goods and services for export likely expands as well. A key factor in increasing U.S. production and therefore U.S. capacity to export has been the growth of labor productivity. Gross output produced per hour of work increased in percent of manufacturing industries from to the most recent years for which data are available. Over a longer horizon output per worker increased in all but of about manufacturing industries. In percent of manufacturing industries had labor productivity increases of at least percent. The gains were especially high in computer and computer-peripherals manufacturing apparel and knitting mills and agricultural chemicals. The growth in output in these sectors has helped to satisfy world demand Exchange Rates From January through December the dollar has depreciated percent in nominal terms against a weighted average of currencies. In other words the cost of buying other currencies has increased by about percent on average. In real terms controlling for international differences in inflation rates the average real exchange rate has depreciated by nearly percent ; that is individuals abroad can exchange goods produced in their country and receive about percent more U.S. goods now compared to Changes in the terms of trade associated with recent exchange rate trends made American goods cheaper relative to those of some other countries Trade Costs and Barriers Falling transportation costs improved communications and the removal of tariff and nontariff barriers have also supported the growth in trade. Both exports and imports have benefited Over the last half century there have been dramatic declines in shipping costs as well as striking improvements in the quality of shipping among developed economies. The nature of trade for some emerging economies may now be changing to take advantage of these improvements. Studies indicate that improvements in infrastructure may lower the costs of trade a great deal The ratio of the value of exports upon arrival to the value when shipped gives a rough measure of the costs associated with freight and insuring the good while in transport. For some export markets there have been noticeable declines in transportation costs as measured by this ratio. For example from to the average cost of shipping goods to Africa and China decreased by and percentage points respectively. From to | chapter3.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM for five of the eight regions identified in Chart the cost of importing goods from the United States has fallen In addition to falling transportation costs communication costs have declined facilitating the growth in trade. One example is the growth of e-commerce. One study finds that on average the growth in the number of Internet hosts in an economy helped increase that economy s annual export growth from to As more of the world s population has gained access to the Internet the market for U.S. goods and services has expanded and exports have likely increased as well Trade liberalization has also been important. Some of the growth of trade can be attributed to successful multilateral reductions in trade barriers through the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) and its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The United States continues to work with other nations to advance the Doha Development Agenda negotiations as well as to liberalize trade regionally and bilaterally. When this Administration took office the United States had free-trade agreements ( FTAs ) implemented with only countries Canada Mexico and Israel ; a fourth with Jordan had been signed but was not yet approved by Congress. Through the Administration has implemented FTAs or completed negotiations with countries. Congress has approved agreements with of these countries most recently with Peru while those with Colombia Panama and South Korea are awaiting Congressional approval Do FTAs contribute to export growth ? Over the last years there has been a virtual explosion in the number of FTAs. Worldwide there are now more than regional FTAs in force. For many of these FTAs the removal of tariffs and other trade barriers occurs over 5-year phases and often takes nearly years to have full effect. Recent research shows that in the short run the average FTA has increased trade between bilateral trading partners by percent after years percent after years and percent after years. After years the average FTA appears to have had no additional effect on trade growth. Therefore the long-run effect of the average FTA has been roughly a doubling of trade between the two trading partners. In the case of recent U.S. FTAs nearly all of the tariff cuts and nontariff liberalization occur early in the agreement and later stages have more modest phase-outs As a result we may expect to see much of the increases in trade coming in the first to years of the agreement. As is evident from Chart U.S. export growth to recent FTA partners in from has for most countries been higher than total U.S. export growth. Overall the FTA partners have been major contributors to the growth in exports. In the United States exported goods to more than economies. Exports to our trading partners in the FTAs that had been signed and implemented through that year accounted for one-third of the growth of U.S. goods exports between and Chapter chapter3.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Exports and Foreign Direct Investment Many different types of companies engage in international trade. In one form of international trade U.S. companies invest abroad and operate facilities in foreign countries. Cross-border investment to control a business ( with control generally defined as having a percent or greater ownership stake ) is known as foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and FDI facilitates exports The United States is strongly committed to open investment ( Box ) and the world is more aware of the benefits of open investment today than it was in the past. For much of the early post World War II era many countries placed heavy restrictions on investment in both directions. Policies on inbound investment restricted the sectors in which foreign businesses could invest or the level of ownership they could take. Some policies barred acquisitions and others made it difficult for investors to send profits or capital home Spurred in part by the rapid growth of the internationally oriented East Asian economies by European integration and by the stagnation of many closed economies countries have reduced barriers to foreign investment and most now actively seek it. Today liberalization continues in both developing and advanced economies. In the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development recorded national regulatory changes around the | chapter3.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Box : Open Investment and the United States As a matter of policy the United States has a longstanding commitment to welcoming foreign direct investment and securing fair equitable and nondiscriminatory treatment for U.S. investors abroad. On May the President issued a Statement on Open Economies reaffirming this commitment and noted that the Administration is committed to ensuring that the United States continues to be the most attractive place in the world to invest This policy stems from recognition of the benefits of open investment These benefits include the introduction of new technologies processes and management techniques into the economy ; increased competition that lowers prices for consumers and leads to quality improvements ; and the creation of greater international trade and knowledge linkages Foreign affiliates in the United States tend to have more need for higher-skilled labor than many other firms paying at least percent greater compensation than private firms that are domestically owned thus creating an incentive for U.S. workers to keep building skills and to compete for these well-paying jobs. U.S. investment abroad can also strengthen the U.S. economy. It can increase exports thereby improving U.S. job opportunities. Increased exports provide incentives for firms to hire more people into the more productive higher-wage industries Increased trade thereby results in higher average wages for U.S. workers In addition there is evidence that firms that invest abroad also increase their domestic investment and that one activity helps the other world that were favorable to FDI. It recorded a peak of such changes in both and and a still-robust level of in But the move toward openness has experienced setbacks as well. In countries made regulatory changes that were unfavorable to FDI ( percent of all changes ) the highest rate since Some of these unfavorable changes included restrictions in certain sectors or efforts to nationalize certain sectors especially natural resource industries Another issue facing open investment is that in some limited circumstances the acquisition of a domestic company by a foreign investor could pose risks to the national security of the host country. For example such a problem could arise if an adversary of the host country wanted to buy a domestic military contractor. The United States addresses this issue through the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS ) which considers only genuine national security concerns not economic or other interests. The Foreign Investment and National Security Act of ( FINSA ) clarified and improved the CFIUS process and the Act was passed by Congress with strong bipartisan support reaffirming Congressional trust Chapter chapter3.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM in CFIUS s role in protecting national security in a manner consistent with the U.S. commitment to open investment. In passing FINSA Congress stated that the new law is meant to ensure national security while promoting foreign investment and the creation and maintenance of jobs. Multinationals and Trade The United States is both the single leading recipient and leading source of foreign direct investment in the world. In total cumulative FDI in the United States was almost $ trillion percent of the world total. That same year total cumulative FDI from U.S. companies to the rest of the world was almost $ trillion or percent of the world total To understand FDI and how it creates channels for trade understanding some terms is useful. Firms that carry out direct investment abroad and own companies or branches in more than one country are known as multinational companies or multinationals. The company that is the headquarters of the firm does the investing and is known as the parent. The parent company is located in the home country. The foreign company that the parent owns is known as the foreign affiliate and is located in the host country. The parent might own as much as percent or as little as percent of the foreign affiliate and still be considered a direct investor. Affiliates that are more than half-owned by direct investors are known as majority-owned foreign affiliates Ownership chains can be complicated : Sometimes a U.S. parent is owned by foreign investors and is therefore also a foreign affiliate The vast majority of U.S. trade is carried out by companies that are part of multinationals. In the export of goods by U.S. parent companies by U.S. affiliates of foreign companies and by unaffiliated companies in the United States to U.S.-owned affiliates abroad amounted to $ billion or percent of all U.S. goods exports. Most of these exports $ billion came from U.S. parent companies not otherwise owned by foreign companies but foreign-owned affiliates in the United States also exported a great deal $ billion. A large portion of this multinationalrelated trade took place within multinationals that is between parent companies and affiliates. Goods exports from U.S. parent companies to their foreign affiliates and U.S.-based affiliates to their foreign parent companies totaled $ billion percent of all U.S. goods exports Multinationals are not only goods exporters. They also play an increasing role in the export of services. Between and services exports from U.S. parent companies to their foreign affiliates and from U.S. affiliates to their foreign parent companies grew from $ billion to $ billion or from percent to percent of all U.S. private services exports. Together they accounted for almost one-third of all the growth in U.S. private services exports. Of the $ billion U.S. parent companies sold $ billion | chapter3.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM worth of services to their foreign affiliates percent more in nominal terms than in Services exports from U.S.-based affiliates of foreign companies to their foreign parent companies grew even faster. In these affiliates sold $ billion worth of services to their foreign parent companies a 175-percent nominal increase from The Benefits of Trade and Expanding Export Markets Promoting free trade is a top priority of this Administration. Trade liberalization whether it involves multilateral agreements that lower barriers among all the world s countries or bilateral agreements that permit deeper integration such as by harmonizing laws or institutions provides a host of economic benefits : lower prices and expanded consumer choice a larger market for U.S. exports increased domestic productivity and closer ties to people and nations around the world. Economists often emphasize the gains from trade from importing goods and services that are relatively more difficult for the domestic economy to produce but there are also benefits to be gained through exporting International trade involves transactions between individuals or firms that reside in different countries. As in any voluntary transaction the participants in international trade expect to benefit because they value what they receive in the exchange more than what they give. The gains in each individual transaction then aggregate into gains for the economy as a whole. The United States benefits from exporting because it allows us to trade goods that are abundant in national production for goods that are relatively more costly to produce domestically Another benefit of policies that encourage free trade and expand markets is that trade encourages specialization and the division of labor. Specialization provides near-term benefits because economies have different endowments of resources and their workforces possess different skills and talents. For example the United States has a relatively large population of highly skilled workers but very little tropical land. As a result the United States exports business and financial services to the world and imports coffee from a variety of tropical countries such as Colombia Specialization raises the living standard for the average citizen because it allows people to consume more goods and services. Exporting allows an economy to use its relatively abundant resources to produce goods and services and export them to economies where the resources required to produce such goods and services are relatively scarce. Because goods are shipped to markets where they are relatively scarce the United States receives a higher price for Chapter chapter3.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM these goods than if they were produced and sold only in domestic markets This increased income allows U.S. citizens to buy more goods and services including goods and services that are produced in other countries. One study finds that the two major trade agreements of the 1990s the Uruguay Round of the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement contribute between $ and $ in annual benefits for the average American family of four Some specialization takes the form of interindustry specialization one country specializes in some goods ; another country in others. However a large proportion of trade involves similar goods within an industry. Such intra-industry trade can occur for several reasons. One of the primary reasons for intra-industry trade is that each producer tailors a product to a specific target audience. In doing so their output is consumed by a fraction of the total market for that product. Therefore intra-industry trade typically leads to more varieties ; that is different countries produce goods within the same industry but they may produce a product with different features or a different style. One recent study that investigates the growth of new varieties from all types of products imported by the United States from to finds that new varieties have increased threefold. The welfare gain from this increase in varieties is roughly equal to $ per person The innovation introduction of new varieties and expanded competition that come from broadening trade also promote world economic development As resources are shifted from unproductive sectors to more productive sectors as a result of innovation in an economy such as that of the United States it becomes more difficult for the country to produce all the goods new and old. The new goods typically use skilled labor more intensively than the older goods. The production of these new goods in the United States increases the demand for skilled workers and the wages paid to those workers. The increase in the wage paid to skilled workers benefits the United States not only because it raises the incomes of our workers but also because it increases the incentives for individuals to acquire more skills. Human capital accumulation is one of the engines that drives economic growth. When the United States begins devoting more resources to producing the new more profitable goods it will likely discontinue producing older less skill-intensive goods and these goods will need to be produced abroad. Although these older goods were less skill-intensive in the United States they typically are more skill-intensive in the economy that begins to produce them. This creates greater rewards for skilled workers which encourages human capital accumulation and promotes growth as well for both trading partners. These benefits are not necessarily equally distributed as will be discussed in the next section Specialization the division of labor innovation of products for world markets and the upgrading of skill that is brought about by trade all create gains in the economy. Are these gains from trade measurable ? In fact research | chapter3.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM does show that across countries relative to their income countries that trade more tend to have higher per capita incomes than those that trade less and that more trade is a cause of this higher income Trade and Labor Markets The United States has long been committed to free trade and continues to pursue policies and agreements to promote trade liberalization. The consensus among economists is that in the aggregate the economic benefits of trade liberalization greatly outweigh its costs. At an individual level however those benefits and costs may not be evenly distributed. Some people may particularly benefit for example workers who get higher-paying jobs when exporters expand their production while others bear costs for example workers who are displaced because of import competition It is important to consider the distributional implications of trade liberalization and in particular the impact on workers who may be displaced by import competition. However it is also important to emphasize that trade liberalization has little if any effect on overall employment. In particular increases in imports are not associated with a higher unemployment rate or lower workforce participation. Chart shows the ratio of imports to GDP since along with the unemployment rate. If trade were a major factor affecting the economy s ability to maintain full employment these measures would tend to move in tandem. The increase in imports as a percentage of GDP over the past several decades has not led to any noticeable trend in the unemployment rate. Over the past decade the U.S. economy has experienced historically low unemployment while imports have grown considerably Indeed in recent years imports as a share of GDP have increased but this has not resulted in any significant trend in the overall unemployment rate Along with trade and trade policies other factors such as changes in consumer tastes domestic competition and productivity increases contribute to the churning of the labor market. These other factors can have effects that are similar to those of import competition on the labor market often on similar individuals and sectors. For example the United States has seen a vast increase in domestic manufacturing output while the manufacturing workforce has been declining. Import competition in manufacturing industries has played less of a role in the decline of manufacturing employment than has the rapid increase in labor productivity The cost for workers in import-competing industries is that increased imports due to changes in the world economy or policy efforts to liberalize trade may cause some to lose their jobs or receive lower wages. Among manufacturing industries the U.S. industries that appear to be most affected Chapter chapter3.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM by import competition are electrical machinery apparel motor vehicles and non-electrical machinery. Similar to workers displaced from manufacturing more generally workers displaced from import-competing manufacturing industries tend to have lower earnings upon reemployment. These adverse effects are more a function of such factors as education skills and age rather than something intrinsic to the increase of imports due to trade liberalization In this way such trade-induced effects are similar to labor market effects induced by technological change While trade liberalization may lead to job loss in some import-competing sectors it also creates jobs in the industries that produce the goods and services the United States exports and in industries that use imported inputs and the benefits to the economy resulting from trade liberalization are far greater than the costs. Increased trade does however adversely affect some workers The President recognizes that these workers need help with retraining and reemployment and has called for a reauthorization and reform of the Trade Adjustment Assistance ( TAA ) program to meet the needs of these displaced workers. The Administration is committed to supporting effective and improved trade-adjustment assistance to workers who are displaced due to import competition | chapter3.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Despite the overall benefits of trade there are some who propose suspending our efforts to liberalize trade and even increasing trade barriers as a remedy for the adverse effect of trade on some workers. Increased protectionism however has proven itself ineffective as a means to address these concerns In fact the cost of protectionism often greatly outweighs the benefits. One study reports that at the time of the analysis on average each job saved in sectors protected by such trade restrictions as high tariffs import quotas and other measures cost consumers $ per year in higher prices and reduced purchasing Increased protectionism can also have unintended negative effects on domestic industries that use goods produced by protected industries as inputs to their own production. The majority of U.S. imports are intermediate goods ; trade restrictions raise the price of these goods and directly harm other domestic industries. By increasing the cost of inputs protection of one industry can have adverse effects on employment of other industries Protectionism can also cause companies that use the protected inputs to move jobs and production out of the United States Conclusion Over the last few years there has been a dramatic increase in U.S. exports This growth is in large part due to increases in foreign demand increased domestic production changes in the terms of trade and reductions in the cost of international transactions. The U.S. economy has benefited substantially from increased trade and in particular from the rapid growth of its exports. Exporting firms are typically fast growing and pay higher wages Thus increased exports translate into positive benefits for workers in exportoriented industries Being more engaged in global trade provides other benefits as well. Trade helps keep prices low and allows for a wider variety of goods and services Several studies have revealed that there are sizable costs to limiting trade and benefits to expanding trade. The Administration has worked to lower trade barriers and open markets for U.S. producers through multilateral regional and bilateral negotiations. At the global level the Administration is aggressively pursuing a successful conclusion to the World Trade Organization s Doha Development Agenda which has the potential to lower trade barriers around the world and help millions of people escape poverty The Administration is also seeking to advance broad trade agreements in the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region and bilateral free-trade agreements Bilateral free-trade agreements have been especially progressive in terms of opening markets for services trade an area in which the United States has a distinct advantage relative to other countries Chapter chapter3.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM chapter3.indd 2/5/08 : : PM C H A P T E R The Importance of Health and Health Care T he American health care system is an engine for innovation that develops and broadly disseminates advanced life-enhancing treatments and offers a wide set of choices for consumers of health care. The current health care system provides enormous benefits but there are substantial opportunities for reforms that would reduce costs increase access enhance quality and improve the health of Americans An individual s health can be maintained or improved in many ways including through changes in personal behavior and through the appropriate consumption of health care services. While there is substantial health care spending in the United States the importance of health does provide a strong rationale for this level of spending. But because health care financing and delivery are often inefficient there are opportunities to advance health and access to health care services without further growth in spending. To improve the efficiency of health care financing and delivery the Administration has pursued policies that would increase incentives for individuals to purchase consumer-directed health insurance plans. The Administration has also worked to link provider payments to performance thus rewarding efficient delivery of health care. In the President s State of the Union Address he proposed changing the tax treatment of health insurance offering all Americans a standard deduction for buying health insurance. Such a change could play an important role in increasing the efficiency of the American health care system and expanding health insurance coverage The key points in this chapter are : Health can be improved not only through the consumption of health care services but also through individual behavior and lifestyle choices such as quitting smoking eating more nutritious foods and getting more exercise Health care has enhanced the health of our population ; greater efficiency in the health care system however could yield even greater health for Americans without increasing health care spending Rapid growth in health care costs and limited access to health insurance continue to present challenges to the health care system Administration policies focus on reducing cost growth improving quality and expanding access to health insurance through an emphasis on private sector and market-based solutions chapter4.indd 2/5/08 : : PM Health and the Demand for Health Care The demand for health care is unlike the demand for most consumer products and services because while the desire for consumer products and services comes from direct consumption the desire for health care is not derived directly from the consumption of the medical procedures themselves ; rather it comes from the direct value of improved health that is produced by health care. For example demand for an MP3 player is based on the enjoyment that an MP3 player brings to a consumer but few would choose to get a laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the same reason. Rather a consumer s desire to have her gallbladder removed is directly related to the positive impact the operation is likely to have on her health. Understanding how health is produced demanded and valued is a useful starting point for evaluating the health care system and health care policy Demand for Health People demand health because of its role in facilitating and providing happiness. Health can be defined along two dimensions : the length of life ( longevity ) and the quality of life. A person derives value from the quality of life directly and indirectly : directly because one s level of health affects the enjoyment of goods and leisure and indirectly because one s level of health enhances productivity ( Box ) Enhanced productivity can be rewarded in the labor market through higher wages. The indirect effect of health on productivity suggests that health is an important component of human capital investment. Consistent with the basic principle of our economic system consumers exercise choice in purchasing health care and other goods and services The Production of Health Health care is only one of the factors that determine health. Other factors include individual behaviors environmental factors social factors education income and genetics. If we think of an individual as a producer of health the key production inputs are the time and money spent on health-improving activities and health care. Health-improving activities can include individual choices regarding exercise nutrition and lifestyle. Health care can include hospital care outpatient visits to medical providers nursing home care and medication. Because health can deteriorate from accidents sudden disease and the effects of aging health care inputs are needed not only to maintain current levels of health but also possibly to restore health following an illness or injury | chapter4.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Box : Health Effects on Job Productivity Health can affect job productivity through absenteeism and presenteeism. Absenteeism not being present at the place of work as a result of injury or illness prevents an individual from contributing to output and may also affect the ability of coworkers to be productive when tasks require collaboration. Presenteeism is the loss of at-work productivity caused by a lack of physical or mental energy needed to complete tasks increased workplace accidents and the possible spread of illness to fellow employees. There is evidence that both of these factors are costly. According to the Current Population Survey ( CPS ) percent of workers will have an absence from work during a typical week due to injury or illness. Several studies estimating the extent to which presenteeism affects productivity indicate that on average the productivity loss caused by some of the most common conditions ( such as allergies depression musculoskeletal pain and respiratory disorders ) is between and percent Investment in improving and managing health offers opportunities to mitigate some of these costs. An increasing number of employers are instituting at-work wellness programs that provide targeted health management. These programs range from monetary penalties for those with unhealthy lifestyles ( such as smoking or uncontrolled diabetes ) to subsidizing access to exercise facilities. The benefits are shared by the worker ( higher earnings better quality of life ) and the employer ( enhanced productivity and decreased health care expenditures ) Evidence of the success of these programs while incomplete and variable suggests that at-work wellness programs can improve worker health outcomes and provide a positive return to employers. One long-term study of a particularly comprehensive wellness program shows that health care expenditures fell by an average of $ per employee per year ( mostly due to fewer doctor visits and hospital stays ) but it took several years to realize these benefits Studies of trends in health-improving activities show a mixed picture on whether Americans are investing more in their health. A recent study finds that Americans are smoking less and controlling their cholesterol and blood pressure better ( through a combination of health-improving activities and medical inputs ) In contrast there has been a dramatic increase in obesity in the United States in both adults and children during the past few decades Obesity has more than doubled since the late 1970s from percent to percent among adults. Among children ages to the incidence of Chapter chapter4.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM being overweight has tripled. Obesity is an indicator of unhealthy behavior because it often reflects a lack of exercise and overconsumption of unhealthy foods. Also obesity is associated with a higher risk of many diseases and health conditions including hypertension Type diabetes coronary heart disease and some cancers Trends in Health Spending Americans are investing more in their health as measured by health care expenditure. In Americans spent over $ per capita on health care up from $ in and $ in ( all in dollars ) National health care spending has grown more rapidly than the economy as a whole so health care accounts for an increasing share of the overall economy ( Chart ) National health care spending now accounts for about percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) up from percent in and only percent in The primary factor that tends to drive health care expenditure growth is the development and diffusion of new technologies. Knowledge about health and health care conditions continues to expand over time generating an expanding inventory of new or improved products techniques and services Medical technology may account for about one-half or more of real long-term | chapter4.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM health care spending growth. Rising incomes are a second important factor because as income increases a greater proportion of income is typically spent on health care. The aging of the population and increasing disease prevalence is a third important factor contributing to expenditure growth in the United States. Other cited factors include more rapid wage growth in the health sector greater insurance coverage supported by large government subsidies through both government-sponsored programs and tax subsidies and the low share of health expenses paid out-of-pocket by health consumers Trends in Life Expectancy Life expectancy is only one of many outcome measures for health but because it has been reliably and consistently measured over time it offers a unique historical view of trends in health. United States life expectancy trends since both from birth and from age are shown in Chart In the two panels of this chart we see life expectancy gains throughout the century Progress in life expectancy at birth was rapid in the first half of the century growing from to years. Between and life expectancy at birth grew gradually reaching only by Progress picked up in the 1970s with life expectancy reaching age by There is a contrasting pattern for the life expectancy among those who live to age Life expectancy at age Chapter chapter4.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM showed little progress until the 1930s ; in the subsequent decades life expectancy at rose years to ( meaning that in a person who was could expect to live to age while in a 65-year-old person could expect to live to age ) Starting in the 1970s the pace of improvement accelerated. By life expectancy at age was additional years ; a gain of years of life over the past decades Innovations in health and health care can explain the patterns in longevity Changes in the first half of the 20th century came largely through progress in reducing malnutrition improving sanitation and containing infection through improved public health measures and the use of antibiotic agents such as penicillin. After about years of gradual improvement in life expectancy the rising longevity from reflects progress in treating life-threatening ailments prevalent among those over As shown in Table the largest single contributor to increased longevity has been reduced mortality from heart disease ( years ) ; reduced mortality from strokes added another years to life expectancy. Reduced mortality from those two conditions has thus added nearly years to the life expectancy of Americans Research suggests that the lower mortality from heart disease and strokes is primarily attributable to advances in intensive medical therapies non-acute medications to manage high blood pressure and high cholesterol and changes in individual behavior to reduce risk factors such as smoking and high-fat diets. Improvements in medical treatments alone are believed to account for at least of the years of the life expectancy gain that is attributable to reduced mortality from heart diseases and strokes To put these substantial benefits of extending life into a perspective that accounts for the increased spending on health care it is useful to assess the tradeoff between the cost of the treatments and the benefits of longer life. An influential study has done this and found the benefits of increased spending on cardiovascular treatments to be about four times as large as the costs Table Additional Life-Years Due to Reduced Mortality from Selected Causes for US by Decade ( years ) Infant Mortality Heart Disease................. Cancer Stroke Accidents........................ Other............................... Total................................ Total Source : Murphy K.M. and Topel R.H. The Value of Life and Longevity ( ) Journal of Political Economy vol. No. | chapter4.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM While the study focused on spending on cardiovascular disease the basic conclusion aggregate health-spending increases have provided positive returns is true more broadly. Using the same framework the total increase in health care spending since can be justified in monetary terms by the life expectancy gains from cardiovascular treatment and neonatal care alone. Gains from other treatment advances ( not to mention benefits other than life extension such as a higher quality of life ) thus imply that over the past half-century the benefits from greater health care spending in the United States have exceeded their costs. However the benefits of greater health care spending in relation to costs have not been as favorable since suggesting potentially diminishing returns from health care spending Trends in Health Insurance Coverage Health insurance helps shield families from the financial risk of the unanticipated health expenses of serious illness or injury and facilitates access to the health care system thereby improving health outcomes. Given those benefits it is a major concern that at any given time percent of Americans report that they lack health insurance. The primary driver of declining enrollment in private insurance has been the increasing cost of health care and this decline contributes to the rising proportion of uninsured ( Chart ) Chapter chapter4.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Addressing Challenges in the Health Care System The trends in the U.S. health care system suggest that the rapid growth in health care costs will persist. Health care costs will pose an increasing challenge for consumers of health care and health insurance as expenditures in this sector make up a greater share of household consumption. Taxpayers will also face an increasing challenge as the budgetary burden of Federal and State health care programs continues to expand. ( See Box for an overview of government health care programs. ) Reducing health care cost growth and increasing access while improving health care quality are the goals of Federal health care policy The Administration s objective has been to develop market-oriented policies to meet these goals by fostering the innovation flexibility and choice that are the best aspects of the American health care system. Market-oriented policies must address potential market failures that are at the root of the challenges in the health care system. These problems include insufficient information available to patients health providers and insurers ; access barriers for lower-income or disadvantaged Americans ; and two specific market failures that arise in insurance markets : moral hazard and adverse selection. Moral hazard is the tendency for individuals to overuse certain types of health care when insurance covers a sizable fraction of the costs ; adverse selection is the tendency for insurance to be purchased by those persons who are most likely to need it ( and who thus have higher costs ) Policies aimed at mitigating these problems can enhance the ability of our market-oriented health care system to achieve the goals of controlled cost growth improved access to health insurance coverage and high-quality health care Box : Government Health Care Programs About percent of health care spending is funded by Federal and State Governments through various health programs. The main government-funded health programs are designed to serve specific populations and include Medicare Medicaid the State Children s Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) and the Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) Medicare was enacted in and covers nearly all individuals aged and older ( as well as some younger individuals with disabilities or specific illnesses ) Medicare today consists of three basic parts. Part A is hospital insurance which covers stays in hospitals and nursing facilities Part A is primarily funded by a percent payroll tax ( percent each for workers and employers ) Part A is generally provided automatically continued on next page | chapter4.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Box continued and without premiums for persons age and older who are eligible for Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits. Part B is supplementary medical insurance which covers doctor visits and other outpatient services. Part B is voluntary and enrollees pay a monthly premium yet percent of those eligible elect to enroll. Part D Medicare s prescription drug benefit which started in is available on a voluntary basis to individuals who qualify for Medicare Part A and requires a monthly premium for those beneficiaries who do not qualify for the low-income subsidy. Unlike other parts of Medicare Part D is administered by a partnership between private insurers and Medicare officials to provide choice of prescription drug plans to beneficiaries and to allow for price competition. Part B and Part D are funded by a combination of premiums from beneficiaries and government revenues ( Part D also receives some resources from the States ) In there were million beneficiaries enrolled in Part A million in Part B and million in Part D Under Fee-for-Service Medicare health care providers are reimbursed by the Federal Government at predetermined rates for services provided. However Medicare beneficiaries can opt to enroll in a private Medicare plan under Medicare Advantage through local coordinated care plans offered mostly by local health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) and preferred provider organizations ( PPOs ) regional PPOs and private fee-for-service providers. Local coordinated care plans make up percent regional PPO plans percent and private fee-for-service plans percent of Medicare Advantage plans Medicaid was also established in as a health care program for low-income individuals in particular those with children. Medicaid is administered by the States and is funded by both the Federal Government and the States. Like traditional Medicare Medicaid also reimburses private providers for services at predetermined rates and allows recipients to enroll in Medicaid managed care plans in many States. However unlike Medicare these predetermined rates are determined at the State level. In there were million enrollees in Medicaid of whom percent were in managed care plans. The State Children s Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) was created in to cover children from low-income families who do not qualify for Medicaid. SCHIP is also administered by the States and funded by both Federal and State Governments but the Federal contribution towards spending is higher for SCHIP than for Medicaid. In there were million enrollees in SCHIP While Medicare Medicaid and SCHIP are publicly funded programs most health care services are delivered by private providers not employed by the government. In contrast the Veterans Health Administration continued on next page Chapter chapter4.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Box continued ( VHA ) delivers health care to veterans through a system that is run by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VHA is a truly public health care system in the sense that the Federal Government owns the VHA hospitals and employs the health care providers Rising health care costs are creating budget pressures for government health care programs. Currently Federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid totals about percent of GDP or about percent of the Federal budget. Rising health care costs however will likely raise those figures in coming decades. If spending grows percent per year faster than GDP ( which is somewhat slower than the historical rate of growth over the past years ) for example the Office of Management and Budget projects that in years spending on these two programs alone could reach percent of GDP. Such spending growth if it came to pass would require either unprecedented levels of taxation or dramatic reductions in other government activities Moral Hazard and Cost Control In most markets consumers decide what to purchase by comparing the benefit of a good or service relative to its cost. In the health care sector however consumers often do not learn the prices of goods and services until bills are received weeks or months later. Because health insurance polices cover most health care costs including the costs of routine predictable health care services consumers have little incentive to try to access and act on price information. This moral hazard effect encourages overuse of certain types of heath care gives little incentive for consumers to consider costs in their search for a provider and distorts incentives for technological change Overuse of health care can occur when the perceived cost of a service is less than the actual cost and as a result the service may be used even when its value is less than its cost. This happens for example with health insurance coverage that shields consumers from the true cost of a service by having them pay none or only a portion of its cost. To illustrate consider a consumer s decision to purchase a migraine therapy that costs $ to produce. If the symptoms are serious enough and would be relieved by the therapy the consumer might be willing to pay more than $ for the therapy. The consumer would thus purchase the therapy regardless of how much of the $ cost was covered by insurance and the purchase would not be overconsumption. If the customer had milder symptoms however insurance may induce overconsumption Suppose for example that the consumer would only be willing to pay $ to relieve the symptoms. If insurance covered the entire $ cost the consumer would purchase the therapy since the $ benefit exceeds the consumer s | chapter4.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM effective price of zero. Even if a $ copayment was required by the insurance benefit the purchase would still take place. Because the social cost of $ exceeds the $ benefit this purchase would not be socially beneficial and would therefore be considered overconsumption Because consumers are less sensitive to the prices of the health care services they consume the competitive forces that typically keep prices down are weakened. Imagine two hospitals that provide the same service but hospital A charges $ and is located in an older facility while hospital B charges $ but is located in an updated facility with a wide array of amenities and equipment on site. Given these choices a consumer facing the actual price may prefer hospital A but in a world where few costs are shared with the patient most people would choose hospital B. This gives hospital B few incentives to control costs given that convenience or amenities have a greater influence on consumer choice than price New technological innovations enter a market in which consumers rarely pay more than to percent of the market price out-of-pocket. This influences the value of the innovations that are developed and marketed. If a new product is only slightly more effective than an existing product for example it may be highly demanded even if it is priced well above existing alternatives Because there is a market for new technology with little additional benefit over existing treatments innovators have sufficient incentive to create new technologies with little marginal value Health insurers and their sponsors ( employers ) recognize that insurance reduces consumer incentives to be responsive to costs. Insurers use a variety of cost-control mechanisms such as utilization review pre-approval and drug formularies to attempt to manage costs and in part counteract the lack of cost consciousness by consumers. But those mechanisms can only partly offset the problem. In addition insurance benefits are designed to limit moral hazard by sharing the costs of services received with the beneficiary. Design features to accomplish this goal include deductibles copayments and coinsurance Deductibles the dollar amount that a consumer will have to pay before the insurer pays for any medical expenses are often less than $ Copayments are a fixed fee paid per visit or per prescription. Coinsurance is a percentage of the cost of the service that is the responsibility of the consumer These cost sharing mechanisms are underutilized because of a bias created by the tax code. The health insurance premium of employees paid by employers is exempt from income and payroll taxes but individual spending through deductibles copayments and coinsurance is taxable. As a result there is a tax incentive for employers to compensate employees through generous health insurance plans that limit cost sharing. Thus the tax code reduces the incentive for optimal health insurance design and ultimately encourages individuals to purchase more health care services than they would otherwise Health Savings Accounts ( HSAs ) enacted into law by this Administration Chapter chapter4.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM in and the standard deduction for health insurance first proposed by this Administration in both provide a mechanism for eliminating the tax bias against greater cost sharing. These policies are intended to offer the private sector more opportunities to control costs through greater consumer awareness of the cost of health insurance premiums and health care services Health Savings Accounts Health Savings Accounts are savings accounts of pre-tax dollars funded by individual or employer contributions that can be used toward current and future out-of-pocket medical expenses. HSAs are designed to be used in conjunction with high-deductible health plans reducing reliance on insurance for routine health expenses. The funds in the HSA can be used to pay these routine health expenses directly. Because unspent funds belong to the individual and can accumulate over time HSAs lead the individual to play a more active role as a health care consumer. In January HSAs covered million people which is an increase of million since January and million since March As the consumer plays a greater role and becomes more aware of routine health expenses provision of inefficient care should be reduced ; incentives for providers to adopt cost-effective therapies should increase ; and possibly some health care prices may decline which may even benefit consumers in traditional insurance plans. Yet the benefit of moving to a high-deductible policy with an HSA will vary in that chronically ill individuals with persistently high spending may find these policies less desirable because their out-of-pocket spending would be consistently high. Consumers in lower tax brackets will derive a smaller tax benefit from HSAs because the value of tax exemption depends on a consumer s marginal tax rate ( the tax paid on the next dollar a worker earns ) A Standard Deduction for Health Insurance to Replace the Tax Exemption The lack of consumer sensitivity to health care prices occurs not just through the consumption of health care services but through the consumption of health insurance as well. The tax exemption of employer-sponsored health insurance premiums is inefficient because by providing a larger tax break to families with more-generous employer-sponsored health insurance policies there is an incentive for health insurance to cover more services than employees would otherwise demand. This occurs because employees can increase after-tax compensation by accepting more of their compensation in the form of health insurance The President has proposed to replace the current open-ended tax exclusion for employment-based health insurance with a flat $ standard | chapter4.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM deduction for health insurance to all families ( or $ for individuals ) whether that insurance was obtained through their employer or on their own The amount of this standard deduction would be independent of the actual amount spent on the premium so families who obtain insurance policies for less than $ ( but whose policy satisfies a set of minimum requirements for catastrophic coverage ) would still have an exemption for the full $ of compensation from income and payroll taxes. The annual increase in the standard deduction for health insurance would be linked to inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index This policy has two key effects : ) It would reduce the inefficiency of the current tax treatment of employment-based health insurance and would allow individual consumers to benefit from reducing the cost of their insurance ; and ) it would provide for equitable tax treatment for health insurance purchased inside and outside of employment. The first effect can be shown in the following example. Consider a family of four with an annual income of $ and a health insurance policy worth $ that is sponsored by an employer. Because the marginal tax rate of this family is roughly percent the current tax exemption for the cost of this insurance policy provides a $ tax break to the family. Another family with the same income and an employer-sponsored health insurance policy worth $ currently receives a tax break of $ One advantage of the proposed standard deduction is that it provides the same tax treatment to all types of health insurance plans Under the proposed plan both families would qualify for the flat $ standard deduction and receive the same tax savings of $ The flat tax break provides a strong incentive to obtain health insurance coverage and it would allow families to reap the tax benefits of health insurance policies with optimal cost-sharing features. Because the tax break is not more generous for those who choose expensive health insurance plans ( unlike the tax exemption ) consumers will become more conscious of cost when purchasing health insurance and health care Health insurance purchases by families and individuals with or without access to employment-based health insurance would receive the same tax benefits under this policy. Currently tax treatment of health insurance premiums is inequitable because it does not offer the same tax break to families and individuals without access to employment-based insurance who must instead purchase a private plan in the individual health insurance market. The family considered above with an annual income of $ receives a $ tax break for a health insurance policy worth $ sponsored by an employer but no tax break for a similar health insurance policy purchased through the individual insurance market. Under the Administration s proposal those who are currently insured in the individual health insurance market would see a reduction in taxes commensurate with those insured in the group market. As Chapter chapter4.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM a result those who are currently uninsured because they have no access to employment-based insurance would be given a strong incentive to purchase coverage. An uninsured family of four earning $ for example would receive a tax benefit of $ if they purchased health insurance in the individual market ( the value of the $ standard deduction if the family faces a percent marginal tax rate ) That tax break would cover nearly half the cost of a family health insurance plan costing $ The availability of a tax deduction for the purchase of health insurance for individuals and families who are not offered employer-sponsored coverage will make health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans. The Administration estimates that the standard deduction would provide to million individuals with health insurance who did not have it previously Even with a standard deduction challenges for affordable coverage remain for individuals with low incomes or with substantial risk of high health expenditures. The Administration s Affordable Choices Initiative addresses these remaining challenges. The initiative facilitates State efforts to make health insurance more affordable for individuals with persistently high medical expenses or limited incomes. Currently subsidies and payments from the Federal Government are funneled through providers ; the objective is to redirect funding toward individuals Controlling Costs Through Competitive Insurance Markets The effective functioning of a competitive marketplace for health insurance requires addressing adverse selection. Adverse selection arises when insurance is most attractive to those persons most likely to need it. If the premium is based on the population average and the policy disproportionately attracts those who spend more than the average the policy will lose money for the insurer. The policy will then either increase in price or not last in the market In the extreme some consumers do not purchase insurance because the only policy available to them is priced for the most expensive consumers The problems can be most severe in insurance markets involving small firms and individuals without access to group coverage because large risk pools mitigate many of the forces that can lead to adverse selection. ( However adverse selection can arise in broad risk pools when competing health plan choices are made available. ) To varying degrees States can minimize adverse selection by permitting providers in the market for individual insurance to rate each individual on the basis of his or her medical risk and past health care expenditure. As a consequence individuals with chronic illnesses have to pay higher premiums be denied coverage altogether or be denied coverage for the condition which is making them ill | chapter4.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM To reduce the extent to which high-risk individuals face higher premiums and to improve the availability of certain health insurance benefits States have imposed a range of restrictions on insurance underwriting practices as well as coverage mandates on nongroup ( and in many cases on group ) health insurance plans. These regulations generally include guaranteed issue laws that require insurers to issue insurance to any eligible applicant without regard to current health status or other factors and community rating laws that prohibit insurers from varying premium rates based on health status and restrict the amount by which insurers are allowed to vary rates based on characteristics such as age or gender. Although these regulations tend to reduce insurance premiums for high-risk individuals they also increase premiums for lower risk individuals. Those premium increases can have the unintended consequence of encouraging people to wait until they have a health problem before enrolling. If such adverse selection reduces participation of healthier people premiums will increase and the voluntary insurance market may cease to operate effectively. The result may be less insurance coverage and only limited premium reductions for those who are chronically ill as those who are healthier choose to forgo coverage entirely rather than pay higher premiums The approach of the Administration is one that encourages lower premiums particularly in the individual and small group markets where adverse selection poses the greatest challenges for competitive insurance markets The Administration supports a national market for health insurance rather than State-specific markets. This would effectively make insurance available to individuals and small groups under conditions that resemble those now available to employees of many large corporations which by self-insuring are exempt from State insurance regulations and instead operate under the Federal insurance law provisions of the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act ( ERISA ) Health insurance policies with lower premiums would be more readily available because health insurance policies would not be subject to costly State mandates and regulations. The Administration also supports Association Health Plans plans that allow small groups to band together to purchase insurance subject to Federal rather than State regulations because they would reduce adverse selection problems encountered by small employers achieve economies of scale in negotiating lower rates with participating insurers and allow for greater participation in a competitive choice system of health insurance plans Improving Quality and Costs Through Information and Reimbursement Because of the complexities of medicine patients must often rely on experts to determine their diagnosis and select treatments. If the incentives for the expert are different from those that would produce the greatest benefit for the Chapter chapter4.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM patient however the services delivered by the expert may not always be of the greatest benefit to the patient. For example doctors may have incentives to overstate the value of expensive tests and most patients lack the expertise to assess these claims Physicians determine needed services for patients. Because these decisions are in part subjective diagnoses and treatments often differ across physicians sometimes in ways that are not in the patient s or society s best interest For example the frequency of spinal surgery is almost eight times higher in some parts of the United States than in others even though the percentage of people who have back problems does not vary widely between regions These types of geographic variations in quantity of care exist across a wide range of treatments yet few differences in outcomes can be detected. Overuse of health care services is one problem and underuse is another. A classic study evaluated the rate at which clinicians followed processes of care widely recommended through national guidelines and the medical literature. When averaged across all phases of care for the most common or lethal conditions it was determined that nearly half of patients who met conditions for effective clinical care failed to receive appropriate care There is great potential to improve quality and/or reduce costs through reforms that improve information on quality and costs and align provider payments so that providers are rewarded for the health outcomes of the patients rather than just for the services they perform Information on Effectiveness One of the key impediments to more effective health care delivery is a lack of relevant information for patients providers and payers on the comparative effectiveness and efficiency of health care options. Such information would be particularly useful for services that are in common practice generate high costs employ rapidly changing technologies for which multiple alternative therapies exist and are in areas with substantial uncertainty The wide geographic variations in the use of procedures suggest that better information on the effectiveness of different styles of medical practice could result in substantial cost savings Health Information Technology Health information technology ( health IT ) allows comprehensive management of medical information and the secure exchange of medical information between health care consumers and providers. Broad use of health IT has the potential to help dramatically transform the delivery of health care making it safer more effective and more efficient. While a number of large health care organizations have realized some of these gains through the implementation of multifunctional interoperable health IT systems to date experimental evidence supporting the broad benefits from health IT is more limited. The | chapter4.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Administration supports broad adoption of health IT as a normal cost of doing business including policies that will encourage physicians and others to adopt electronic health records and through furthering technologies for safe secure health information exchange Value-based Purchasing Pay for performance or value-based purchasing is a payment model that encourages health care providers to meet certain performance measures for quality and efficiency. A recent example is eliminating payments for negative consequences of care. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) implemented a provision of the Deficit Reduction Act of which prevents Medicare from giving hospitals higher payment for the additional costs of treating certain hospital-acquired conditions conditions that result from medical errors or improper care and that can reasonably be expected to be averted. Now big insurers are following Medicare s lead and are moving to ban payments for care resulting from grave mistakes. These changes remove a perverse incentive for hospitals : improving patient safety could reduce revenues and profits. As a result these reforms should trigger safety improvements and enhance the efficiency of the health care system Transparency of Price and Quality Information Transparency of information on price and quality has been a priority of this Administration. Medicare has provided incentives to providers to submit performance information to CMS and many of these performance measures have been made available on the CMS website so that consumers can compare the quality of providers as they seek care. The administrators and sponsors of Medicare and other Federal health insurance programs have been directed to share with beneficiaries information about prices paid to health care providers and the quality of the services they deliver. The commitment is to transform Medicare by always seeking to improve the connection between expenditures and positive health outcomes without increasing Medicare spending Promoting Healthy Behavior Encouraging healthy behaviors such as exercising more eating better controlling weight gain and quitting smoking may be a cost-effective alternative to increased spending on health care. One way to encourage healthy behavior is through health education. For example much of the beneficial effect of prenatal care is simply related to education about healthy behavior while pregnant. A better understanding of the risks of high cholesterol and blood pressure ( and how to reduce those risks through healthy behavior ) is credited with being a very highly efficient way to improve health outcomes Administration policies that aim to increase consumer sensitivity to health Chapter chapter4.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM care costs have a positive indirect consequence in that they may induce an increase in healthy behaviors Conclusion The health care system in the United States has helped improve the health and well-being of Americans. As health care costs continue to rise enormous opportunities exist to increase the value of health care and improve health insurance coverage. Addressing these fundamental problems and fulfilling the potential of our health care system will require innovative polices to help Americans get the care that best meets their needs and to create an environment that rewards high-quality efficient care. While Federally sponsored health insurance for the most vulnerable Americans through Medicare Medicaid and SCHIP remains a priority private markets offer the best opportunities for controlling costs and providing innovative policies to enhance efficiency quality and access. Efficiency of health spending would be improved if tax code reforms were enacted. Reforms could level the playing field between employer-provided and individual health insurance thus boosting insurance coverage. At the same time reforms could reward consumers for purchases of higher deductible plans with reasonable copayments that provide insurance for costly medical necessities but do not encourage unwarranted procedures By addressing concerns of adverse selection insurance markets can become more competitive thereby promoting innovation choice access and efficiency. Finally health care quality can be addressed by improving the transparency of health care information and by tying reimbursement to the performance of providers | chapter4.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM C H A P T E R Tax Policy S ocieties face two basic questions with regard to tax policy. The first question concerns the amount of revenue that should be raised. That is what is the appropriate level of taxation ? The level of taxation ultimately reflects views about the appropriate size of government. If a society believes that the government should play a large role in the economy then a high level of tax revenue is necessary. While taxes are necessary to finance the public sector they have a considerable cost to the economy because they distort incentives and result in lost value of output to society. Without taxes individuals would decide where to allocate resources depending on where those resources are most productive. Taxes give individuals an incentive to reduce their tax burden by avoiding activities that are taxed ; as a result decisions about working saving investing and spending are influenced by tax considerations resulting in the loss of output that would have created value for producers consumers and workers. The distortions created by taxes have important implications for economic growth and the well-being of Americans The second question about tax policy concerns how the tax burden should be distributed across different members of society and different types of activities. That is what is the appropriate structure of taxation ? Different tax structures impose different costs on the economy in terms of the distortions they create. A more efficient tax structure raises a given amount of revenue with less distortion. Different tax structures also give rise to different distributions of after-tax income and some distributions of income may be viewed as more fair than others. A related issue is the timing of taxes. The use of government debt allows the tax burden to be spread across time raising questions about how to tax different activities and individuals at different points in time The key points of this chapter are : The ratio of Federal taxation in the United States to gross domestic product ( GDP ) has fluctuated around an average value of percent over the past years ; despite the President s and tax relief this ratio was percent in above the 40-year-average. Under current law revenues are predicted to grow faster than the economy in coming years raising the level of taxation well above its historical average Tax reductions in and have considerably lowered the tax burden on labor and capital income and reduced distortions to economic decisions. Making these tax cuts permanent can greatly improve long-term economic outcomes chapter5.indd 2/5/08 : : PM In addition to contributing to growth the tax cuts of also improved the efficiency of the tax structure primarily by reducing the double taxation of corporate income The business tax structure in the United States still creates substantial distortions. To attract investment from abroad and compete more effectively in foreign markets the United States must consider how best to address distortions created by the structure of business taxes as other countries have done The Size of Government : A Historical View Economists and policymakers have long debated the appropriate role of the government in a market economy. The government provides some services such as national defense and law enforcement that are clearly essential for economic growth but other functions of government such as large redistributions of income are more controversial. A large public sector imposes a cost on the economy primarily because the taxes that are required to finance government programs distort labor supply saving and investment decisions resulting in lost value of output to society. Thus our Nation faces a tradeoff : a larger government can provide more public services and transfer payments ( payments that are not in exchange for goods or services ) to lower-income individuals but these benefits often come at the cost of lower economic output and well being The cost from tax distortions can be considerable. One recent study suggests that raising an additional dollar of revenue from the individual income tax costs the economy approximately to cents. That is if taxes increase by $ taxpayers bear a cost of $ to $ the $ in revenue and to cents from accompanying distortions. This additional cost of cents is known as deadweight loss. Any government services that are funded with this revenue would have to have a benefit to society of at least $ to justify the increase in taxes One measure of the role of government is the size of government spending relative to the economy. Over the past years Federal expenditures have averaged percent of GDP. Government activities can be financed by current taxes or borrowing ( which will necessitate higher future taxes or lower future spending ) Chart shows that over the past years the ratio of Federal taxes to GDP has fluctuated around an average value of percent The ratio rose well above that level in the late 1960s the early 1980s and the late 1990s. Each of these periods was then followed by several years in which the ratio fell below its long-term average. Recent swings have been particularly pronounced with the ratio reaching a post-World War II high of percent | chapter5.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM in Tax revenues increased strongly relative to GDP from to as a result of rising real incomes increases in capital gains realizations and the tax increases of the early 1990s. Tax revenues as a share of GDP tend to rise when real incomes rise and fall when real incomes fall. Beginning in tax revenues began to decline as the economy slipped into recession and real incomes declined. The ratio of tax revenues to GDP fell to percent ( a 40-year low ) in Since that time tax revenues have grown faster than the economy resulting in a tax-to-GDP ratio of percent in once again above its 40-year average While the Federal tax-to-GDP ratio has not exhibited any consistent trend in the past years it is projected to grow over the next years. Under current law the President s tax relief of and will expire at the end of At this time there will be a significant increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio. Moreover even in the absence of any legislative changes there is a tendency for the tax-to-GDP ratio to rise. ( While the ratio may not rise every year there is an upward trend over time. ) In the past significant tax cuts ( in and to ) have maintained the tax-to-GDP ratio at a relatively stable level. The solid line in Chart shows the projected tax-to-GDP ratio if the President s and tax relief is not extended Chapter chapter5.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Several factors will contribute to rising revenue in the near term including the expiration of the and tax cuts the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) real tax bracket creep and withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts Expiration of the and Tax Cuts The tax cuts of and ( discussed in detail below ) reduced individual tax rates on ordinary income dividends and capital gains ; increased the child tax credit ; reduced the marriage penalty ( the additional tax that some couples pay as a result of getting married ) ; and began a phase-out of the estate tax. These provisions are set to expire at the end of If they do the tax-to-GDP ratio would climb from the percent it reached in to approximately percent. Making the tax cuts permanent would lower this ratio to the to percent range ( the dashed line in Chart ) although the ratio would still continue above the 40-year average of percent by the end of the 10-year period depicted in the figure | chapter5.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Alternative Minimum Tax Prior to a handful of high-income taxpayers used deductions and exemptions to substantially reduce or eliminate their income tax liability This outcome was perceived as unfair and to address this problem the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) was established. In its current form the AMT requires taxpayers to compute their tax liability a second way using a broader definition of income that reduces or eliminates many of the deductions and exemptions allowed in the calculation of regular income tax. The taxpayer must pay the greater of the two tax liabilities. In only taxpayers were subject to the AMT. However in recent years the AMT increasingly affects middle-income families primarily because its parameters are not indexed for inflation. Those who are most vulnerable include families with many children ( giving rise to a large number of exemptions ) and families in high-tax states ( giving rise to a large deduction for state taxes ) The solution thus far has been to pass a series of temporary patches to limit the scope of the AMT. The most recent patch keeps the number of AMT filers stable through at about million the same as in instead of the increase to million that would have occurred had the patch not been enacted. The Administration proposes a similar patch for in the Budget that will continue to keep the aggregate number of AMT taxpayers roughly constant. If the AMT is not patched in future years the number of taxpayers affected will continue to climb resulting in a rising tax-to-GDP ratio. Indexing the AMT parameters for inflation and extending the tax cuts would lower the tax-to-GDP ratio below the dotted line in Chart unless the revenue loss from AMT indexation were made up via additional taxes Real Bracket Creep Federal taxes as a whole are progressive meaning that a family s average tax rate ( total taxes paid as a percentage of income ) rises as its income rises Recently released estimates suggest that in taxpayers in the bottom percent of the income distribution faced an average Federal tax rate of percent while taxpayers in the top percent faced an average Federal tax rate of percent. ( This analysis takes into account individual income taxes payroll taxes corporate income taxes and excise taxes. ) Over time people s nominal incomes ( not adjusted for changes in purchasing power ) tend to grow. Part of this growth is due only to inflation but part of it represents an increase in purchasing power ( real income growth ) as productivity improves and we become more prosperous as a nation. Regular income tax brackets ( but not AMT brackets ) are indexed for inflation which prevents people from moving up to higher brackets because of inflation ( a phenomenon called nominal bracket creep ) However as people s real incomes grow they become subject to higher tax rates. This is called real bracket creep. The implication is Chapter chapter5.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM that even without explicit tax increases the median income family ( that is the family whose income places them in the middle of the income distribution ) will face a rising average tax rate over the years because median incomes are likely to grow faster than inflation. This will tend to increase the ratio of Federal revenues to GDP Withdrawals from Tax-Deferred Accounts A large amount of individual saving occurs through tax-deferred savings vehicles including defined benefit pension plans ( which provide a specified benefit at retirement ) and tax-deferred savings accounts such as ( k ) plans and traditional Individual Retirement Accounts ( IRAs ) Individual and employer contributions to these tax-deferred savings vehicles are deductible at the time the contribution is made and accumulate tax free until retirement After retirement payments from these savings vehicles including benefits paid by defined benefit plans and withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts are taxable. In comparison withdrawals from other types of accounts for example ordinary savings accounts and Roth IRAs do not require payment of income tax on the withdrawal and deposits in these accounts are not tax deductible. At the end of there was about $ trillion in tax-deferred retirement plans on which tax would be paid at withdrawal. With the aging of the population that is projected to occur there will be an increase in such payments resulting in increased government revenue. These withdrawals are different from the previous three factors for two reasons. First they cause a temporary surge in revenue driven by a demographic shift. Second their impact will occur over a somewhat longer period than depicted in Chart According to a recent study these withdrawals are likely to increase income tax receipts by about percent of GDP over the next years and twice that amount by the end of years The factors discussed above the expiration of the and tax cuts the expansion of the AMT real bracket creep and withdrawals from tax-deferred savings accounts are built into the tax code. In addition to these internal factors there are also external pressures for taxes to increase in the future. Total Federal expenditures in were percent of GDP However entitlement programs like Medicare Medicaid and Social Security are facing financial pressures from rising medical costs and an aging population. Based on current law projected benefits under these programs could push entitlement spending alone to percent of GDP in compared to percent in In the absence of needed reforms to reduce projected spending this would necessitate unprecedented levels of taxation deficit spending or dramatic reductions in the fraction of economic activity devoted to other government activities | chapter5.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM The Impact of Recent Tax Reductions Taxes transfer resources from individuals to the government. The transfer itself does not represent a net cost to society : any money given up by taxpayers is gained by the government and can be used to fund government programs or transfer payments. However taxes impose a considerable burden on the economy for several reasons. First taxes interfere with the efficient allocation of resources by changing the rewards from working saving and investing In the absence of taxes individuals and firms would allocate resources to activities where they would be most productive. When taxed individuals alter their behavior. For example high tax rates on labor income induce individuals to reduce their labor supply because the incentive for working is lower. High tax rates on capital income ( the return earned on capital investments ) discourage investment in new capital. A reduction in investment lowers the ratio of capital to labor and in turn reduces worker productivity and wages. As a result of these distortions to work saving and investment behavior output is lost output that would have created value for producers consumers and workers. This loss of output is called the deadweight loss of taxation. As discussed above raising an additional dollar via the individual income tax imposes a direct cost of $ on taxpayers ( which merely represents a transfer to the government ) and a deadweight loss of to cents from the lost value of output to society. Second high tax rates may also encourage some taxpayers to underreport their incomes giving rise to equity concerns and requiring higher taxes on those who do comply in order to maintain revenue. ( While most taxpayers pay the taxes they owe there is still a gap between the amount of taxes that should be paid and the amount that is actually paid. ) Finally taxes have large compliance costs that reflect the resources taxpayers use to determine and pay their tax liability ( including the value of time spent keeping records and doing calculations ) In compliance costs were estimated to be $ billion for individual income taxes and $ billion for businesses other than sole proprietorships The tax cuts of and significantly lowered the tax burden on labor and capital income and reduced distortions. The dividend and capital gains rate cuts enacted in had an additional benefit to the economy by improving the efficiency of the tax structure. By reducing the existing preference for corporate debt financing over equity financing these tax cuts reduced the distortion of corporate finance decisions and improved corporate governance Chapter chapter5.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Labor Supply Taxes effectively decrease the wage that workers receive for providing labor and therefore distort labor supply decisions by changing the incentive for working. These distortions create efficiency losses. The tax cuts of significantly decreased the tax rates that workers pay on their earned income thereby reducing the efficiency losses created by the distortion of their labor supply decisions Individuals decide to work based upon whether take-home earnings exceed the value of the leisure they forgo ( for this discussion leisure includes any activities outside the labor market ) Take-home pay declines as the average tax rate that is the fraction of income paid in taxes rises. Hence higher average tax rates mean that fewer individuals choose to work. Moreover higher marginal tax rates the fraction of additional income paid in taxes reduce the incentive for working more hours or in a higher-skilled profession Increases in both average and marginal tax rates distort labor supply and skill investment decisions and thus generate efficiency losses Individuals vary in their responsiveness to average and marginal tax rates so the efficiency losses from taxes differ by group. Studies show that single mothers and married women are particularly sensitive to high average tax rates. Their cost of working is higher because of child care and other home production demands. The tax cuts lowered average tax rates at all points of the income distribution thereby making work decisions more efficient ( that is closer to what they would be in the absence of tax distortions ) A recent study suggests that the tax cuts led single mothers to allocate more of their time to market work. In contrast several studies suggest that men and single women without children are not affected much by average tax rates when deciding whether to work. The responsiveness of married women to high average tax rates has been falling over time as they become more attached to the labor market ( as men have more traditionally been ) High marginal income tax rates may discourage workers from working more hours choosing higher-paid occupations and investing more in education and other skills that would increase their earnings. To see why higher marginal tax rates have these effects imagine a worker with only a bachelor s degree deciding between a career as a 40-hour-per-week accountant in a small firm paying around $ per year versus a career as a 70-hourper-week self-employed consultant with an MBA earning around $ per year. Suppose that the worker would pay $ per year in taxes in the accounting job and $ per year in the consulting job. After taxes the additional income for the more demanding career would be $ per year The marginal tax rate would be percent ( see Table ) Now suppose a change in tax policy reduces taxes for the accounting job to $ and increases taxes for the consulting job to $ Instead of a | chapter5.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM percent marginal tax rate on the additional $ in pre-tax income there would be a percent marginal tax rate. This change in tax policy reduces the additional return to the more demanding career from $ to just $ per year a percent drop in the return to the more lucrative career ( see Table ) Factoring in more hours per week working the greater stress in the consulting job and the costs of getting the MBA this tax policy change could induce this worker to choose the less demanding career thereby creating an efficiency loss. So even if this change in tax policy is revenue neutral ( that is the policy does not change overall average tax rates ) the higher marginal taxes would reduce overall economic efficiency because they alter the way wages allocate workers to jobs and decrease incentives to choose higher-paying careers with longer hours greater intensity demands and more costly skill investments. The tax cuts in and generally reduced marginal tax rates and reduced these distortions thereby encouraging workers to become more productive Saving and Investment When individuals receive income they can either spend it on current consumption or save it to fund future consumption. Individual savings gets channeled into capital investments. For example an individual may save by buying financial assets such as stocks or bonds. Firms use the funds raised from selling stocks and bonds to finance capital investments such as buildings or equipment. These investments generate income which individual savers receive in the form of interest payment on bonds or dividends and capital gains on stocks. Investment plays an important role in improving the wellbeing of Americans as increases in the amount of capital per worker result in productivity increases and economic growth Table Comparing the Marginal Tax Rate for a Career Changer Under Two Illustrative Tax Policies Earnings........................................... Taxes After Tax Earnings Change in Earnings ( MBA minus Accountant ) Change in Taxes Marginal Tax Rate Change in After Tax Earnings.......... Initial Tax Policy Accountant MBA Consultant $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ % $ New Tax Policy Accountant MBA Consultant $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ % $ Chapter chapter5.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM An important tax policy issue concerns the treatment of income generated by capital investments. Taxes on capital income discourage saving by individuals and investment by businesses. This lowers the capital-to-labor ratio and harms long-run economic growth. Currently when firms earn income from their capital investments they may be subject to a firm-level tax on this amount ( after subtracting depreciation and interest costs ) In addition individual savers who provide the funds used to finance these investments pay income tax on the return on their savings ( which includes dividends capital gains interest and rent ) As a result capital income is often taxed at both the firm and the individual level resulting in double taxation Individuals save so they can consume resources in the future rather than today. Firms invest so that they will be more productive and profitable in the future. Taxes on capital income lower the return to saving and investment thereby favoring current consumption over future consumption. For example suppose a corporation is considering the purchase of a machine that will be financed by selling additional shares of stock and that the rate of return on the investment net of depreciation or the reduction in the value of the machine is percent. Suppose further that individual savers are willing to purchase the shares if they receive a return of at least percent. That is they are willing to sacrifice $ of current consumption ( by buying the shares ) in exchange for $ of consumption year from now. The investment is socially beneficial because it generates a percent rate of return and the savers providing the funds would have settled for percent. At the firm level the income generated by the machine is subject to the corporate income tax. If the corporate tax rate is percent and the firm is allowed to deduct actual depreciation then the after-tax return generated by the machine is percent. Suppose the firm then pays its shareholders the entire percent return in the form of dividends. If the dividend income tax rate is percent savers are left with a percent after-tax return. The rest of the initial percent return ( percent ) goes to the government. Because the percent after-tax return is less than the percent that the individual savers require to be willing to forgo current consumption the investment is not made even though the total return is still percent ( percent to the government plus percent to the savers ) Consequently taxes on capital income distort saving and investment decisions. Longer time horizons tend to magnify this distortion because lower after-tax returns get compounded over time Firm-level taxes on capital income vary depending on the organizational form of the firm. Some business income including that of sole proprietorships Subchapter S corporations and partnerships is taxed under the individual income tax system. These firms are known as flow-through businesses because they face no firm-level tax ; instead the firms income flows through to their owners who pay personal income tax on it. On the other hand Subchapter | chapter5.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM C corporations fall under the corporate tax system. C corporations ( hereafter simply referred to as corporations ) pay a firm-level tax on the firm s income after deducting costs including wages interest payments raw materials and depreciation Current U.S. tax policy is a hybrid of an income tax and a consumption tax. Some capital income is exempt from tax as it would be under a consumption tax. For example at the individual level the return to saving through individual retirement accounts ( IRAs ) and employer-sponsored retirement plans accumulates free of tax. According to recent estimates about percent of the return to household financial assets effectively receives consumption tax treatment. The remainder is subject to income tax treatment. At the firm level firms can often take advantage of accelerated depreciation provisions which allow them to deduct depreciation from their income before it actually occurs to lower their tax liability. Accelerated depreciation lowers the tax burden on investment The tax reductions of and have significantly reduced the tax burden on capital income. By lowering individual income taxes the tax cut lowered the top marginal tax rate on flow-through businesses from percent to percent. Individuals also pay these reduced tax rates on their interest income. The tax cuts also included a phased-in elimination of the estate tax ( or tax imposed on assets left to one s heirs ) Since the estate tax is a tax on wealth if it were permanently eliminated it could be expected to increase saving and investment. The tax cuts of included cuts in dividend and capital gains taxes. As discussed below if these tax cuts are made permanent they will have a substantial impact on investment and long-run economic growth Corporate Financial Policy and Governance Tax reforms can result in considerable economic benefits even when they do not lower the overall tax burden. This outcome is accomplished by improving the efficiency of the tax structure so that the same amount of revenue can be raised with less distortion. The reverse can be true as well : a revenue neutral change or even a tax cut can reduce well-being if it is poorly structured The tax cuts of improved the efficiency of the business tax structure by reducing the high tax burden on corporate equity that results from double taxation. For funding investment in new capital firms generally have a choice between debt ( issuing bonds ) and equity ( retaining earnings or issuing new shares of stock ) Corporations pay tax on their revenue minus their costs Costs include wages interest raw materials and depreciation. Corporate profit is then either paid out to shareholders as dividends or reinvested in the company ( eventually resulting in capital gains for shareholders ) Shareholders are taxed at the individual level on any dividends they receive Chapter chapter5.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM and on any capital gains they realize when they sell the stock. Double taxation of corporate income imposes a particularly high burden on equity-financed corporate investment. In comparison because interest payments are deductible to the firm ( and taxable to bondholders ) corporate debt is only subject to one layer of taxation. Therefore corporations have a strong incentive to use debt financing rather than equity financing for new investment. The overuse of debt financing increases the chances of bankruptcy : when a firm has high debt payments there is a greater probability that the firm s income will be insufficient to cover these payments. Bankruptcies subject investors to additional costs and risks The tax cuts of also reduced the tax bias against paying dividends compared to retaining earnings. Prior to long-term capital gains were taxed at a maximum rate of percent while dividends were potentially subject to the top individual income tax rate ( % in ) In addition capital gains income has another tax advantage over dividend income : taxes are deferred until the asset is sold. Thus capital gains can accumulate tax free while dividends are taxed when they are paid out. Through compounding the difference in tax can be substantial especially over a long period of time The tax cuts of lowered the top tax rate on both qualified dividends and long-term capital gains ( capital gains on assets held for more than a year ) to percent. While capital gains still have a tax advantage over dividends as a result of deferral the differential treatment has been reduced considerably This policy change appears to have had a marked impact on firm behavior. As shown in Chart the growth in dividend income received by households increased substantially after In the years prior to dividend income grew at an average rate of percent per year ; following the tax cut growth increased to an average of percent per year. This result has been confirmed in a number of formal studies. ( The spike in the graph represents a special one-time dividend paid by Microsoft Corporation. ) This increase in dividend payments reflects the reduction in the tax bias against dividends. Paying dividends can have a number of benefits for corporate governance and there is an efficiency loss when the tax code discourages firms from using dividends when they are appropriate. First dividends can be used to return funds to shareholders who can decide how to reinvest them rather than leaving funds in the hands of corporate managers Because a portion of managers pay is independent of the firm s performance managers interests generally differ from the interests of shareholders so managers may have an incentive to use retained earnings in a way that does not maximize the value of the firm. Second paying dividends can help firms signal their profitability to investors. Thus corporate governance may suffer if the tax code penalizes dividends relative to capital gains | chapter5.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Significance of Tax Cuts to Individuals The tax cuts since lowered taxes overall and across all income groups Average Federal tax rates ( which include income payroll corporate and estate taxes ) are estimated at percent in but would have been percent in the absence of the tax cuts ( see Table ) For taxpayers in the bottom percent of the income distribution Federal tax rates are percent which is lower than the percent they would be in the absence of the tax cuts In addition over million taxpayers in are projected to have had their Federal income tax liability completely eliminated by the tax cuts Table Estimated Distributional E ects of Tax Cuts in Average Federal Tax Rates Lowest Quintile With Tax Cuts Without Tax Cuts................................

As discussed in Box a progressive tax system can not simultaneously treat all families with the same income equally and be marriage-neutral. This has resulted in a tax system with marriage bonuses ( mostly for couples with dissimilar incomes ) and marriage penalties ( mostly for couples with similar incomes ) although on net it encourages marriage ( even before the tax cuts ) It should be noted that both marriage bonuses and penalties distort marriage decisions and potentially generate efficiency losses. However if marriage generates some greater social good that should be subsidized marriage bonuses may improve efficiency on net The tax cuts in general increased marriage subsidies and reduced marriage penalties in the tax system by : ( ) expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) for married couples only ( ) expanding the percent bracket only for married couples ( ) expanding the standard deduction only for married couples and ( ) doubling the child tax credit and making it partially refundable. Recent research estimates that the tax cuts on average increased the subsidization of marriage by the tax system by about $ per year although the effect for a particular family depends on family income number of children and the share of family income earned by each spouse. It is estimated that these tax changes should eventually increase marriage rates by about to percentage points Economic Benefits of Lower Taxes The previous sections focused on specific ways in which taxes can distort individual behavior. The analysis suggests that recent tax cuts have reduced distortions to labor supply saving investment and corporate governance. A recent study projects that the introduction of the tax cuts resulted in an immediate increase in GDP in But because the cuts are temporary they will have less impact on decisions that generate payoffs far in the future than they would if they were permanent. For example the decision to undertake education depends on the effect of education on wages over potentially long careers. Thus they can only have a limited impact on long-term economic | chapter5.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Box : Marriage Penalty Basics It is widely acknowledged that a tax system can not simultaneously accomplish the following three goals : Progressivity : average income tax rates rise with family income Family neutrality : families with equal incomes pay equal taxes Marriage neutrality : taxes paid by a family do not depend on marriage The inherent conflicts in these three goals can be illustrated by considering a few examples. Consider a couple without children with one spouse who earns $ and another who does not work. Under tax law that couple pays $ in Federal income taxes but would pay a total of $ if they were not married and both were filing individually. The resulting marriage bonus of $ is generated because the nonworking spouse serves as a tax deduction for the higher earning spouse. The current tax system is not marriage-neutral Alternatively suppose that each spouse earns $ resulting in the same family income of $ Current tax law is family-neutral so this couple pays the same $ as above. If the tax system is changed so that all individuals file separately each spouse pays $ for a total of $ That is the same as they would pay on a family income of $ but is $ less than the combined tax liability of the family above. A progressive tax system that has all taxpayers file individually can not be family-neutral Finally if the tax system is changed so that all taxpayers pay percent on all of their income taxes are $ for each family regardless of whether the couple is married or how the earnings are split between the two spouses. The tax system is marriage- and family-neutral but it would no longer be progressive because the average tax rate would be percent for all taxpayers performance. Making them permanent can substantially improve economic efficiency. The Treasury Department estimates that if the tax cuts of and were made permanent and paid for by reductions in future government spending economic output would increase by percent in the long run However the benefits to the economy might be offset if the extension of the tax cuts results in additional government borrowing or future tax increases rather than spending cuts. The Treasury Department also estimates that if the tax cuts were made permanent but offset by other revenue raising tax measures in the future then economic output would decline by percent Chapter chapter5.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM in the long run. The concern about long-term financing for the tax cuts is particularly important because of the likelihood of rising spending pressures in the future. The Office of Management and Budget projects for example that under current law total noninterest Federal spending could reach percent of GDP by compared with percent today. The breakdown of projected spending in Chart shows that the main driving force behind this increase is the growth in spending on entitlement programs primarily Medicare Medicaid and Social Security which could reach approximately percent of GDP by The benefits of making the tax cuts permanent might also be offset if the tax cuts are financed by a reduction in efficient government spending ( spending whose benefits exceed both the direct cost to the taxpayer and the deadweight loss ) | chapter5.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM The Structure of Business Taxes Despite recent reforms the business tax structure still creates a number of distortions in its treatment of capital income. To the extent that the U.S. tax system resembles an income tax it encourages current consumption rather than saving. Beyond this however the tax system imposes differential tax burdens on different types of investments thereby leading to a misallocation of resources. Ideally firms should undertake investments that generate the highest rate of return independent of taxes. If all investment returns are taxed at the same rate then the projects with the highest returns will still be selected ( although investment overall will fall because investment returns overall are taxed ) However if different kinds of investments face different tax rates then a lower-return project may be selected over a higher-return project because the after-tax return could be higher for the lower-return project As noted above the tax burden on investment is affected by both firm-level taxes ( such as the corporate income tax ) and individual-level taxes on the return to saving ( such as dividend and capital gains taxes ) The complexity of the tax code makes it difficult to measure the true tax burden on investment returns. For example corporate earnings are taxed at a maximum Federal rate of percent. However that tax burden is reduced by accelerated depreciation special tax preferences for certain activities and the interest deduction. Also while some kinds of savings are subject to personal income tax other kinds ( for example retirement savings accounts ) accumulate tax free. A standard approach to quantifying the distortions is to compute the effective marginal tax rate which measures the percentage difference between the before-tax and after-tax returns on a new investment taking into account the complexities of the tax code and both firm- and individual-level taxes The effective marginal tax rate is most relevant when a firm decides whether to undertake a new investment Table shows the effective marginal tax rates on different kinds of investments. It is clear from the table that tax rates vary considerably across investments depending on the type of capital involved and the method of financing. Equity-financed corporate investment faces the highest effective tax rate of percent. This is still the case even though the tax cuts of substantially reduced the double taxation of corporate equity. The tax rate on debt-financed corporate investment is actually negative a result of the interest deduction combined with accelerated depreciation allowances. Noncorporate investments face a low tax rate because noncorporate firms are treated as flow-through entities and are not subject to double taxation. Owner-occupied housing faces a very low tax rate. The return to an owner-occupied home is the rental value of the home to the occupant which is not subject to income tax Chapter chapter5.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM These results suggest several distortions. First housing is favored relative to other capital. While there may be reasons to favor owner-occupied housing its benefits must be weighed against the value of other kinds of capital Second there is a distortion across different types of business investment For example equipment is lightly taxed relative to structures and inventories Third taxes distort a firm s choice of organizational form. The corporate form of organization is unattractive from a tax standpoint leading firms to become flow-through entities even in situations in which the corporate form would allow the most effective use of resources. Finally there is a distortion to corporations financing decisions with debt receiving a tax advantage over equity There are two broad directions for reform. First efficiency could be improved by reducing the disparate tax treatment of different kinds of investment. There are a number of reforms that could help to achieve this goal For example the Treasury Department estimates that if special preferences were eliminated the corporate tax rate could be reduced from percent to percent and still raise the same amount of revenue. Further integration of the personal and corporate tax systems would alleviate the double taxation of corporate income. For example some countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) including the United Kingdom Canada and Mexico address the double taxation of capital income by giving investors a tax credit for taxes paid at the corporate level. Second reducing the tax burden on investment can improve long-run economic performance by increasing the ratio of capital to labor thereby boosting labor productivity and earnings. There are two ways to reduce the tax burden on investment at the firm level. One is to reduce the corporate tax rate and the other is to allow full or partial expensing of new investment. Full expensing allows the firm to fully deduct the cost of new investments at the time the Table E ective Marginal Tax Rates on Investment Type of Investment Economy ( overall ) Business Sector......................................................................

Noncorporate sector Owner-occupied housing Effective Marginal Tax Rate % Source : Department of the Treasury ( Of ce of Tax Analysis ) | chapter5.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM investments are made. A more modest approach would be to allow partial expensing under which a firm could immediately deduct a fraction of the investment s cost. As shown in Box full expensing reduces the firm-level tax on new investments to zero Box : Expensing versus Corporate Rate Reductions Consider a firm that purchases a machine for $ A year later the machine produces output worth $ The firm then sells the machine for $ Thus the return from investing $ in the machine is percent ( the firm earns $ $ = $ ) The firm can finance the initial $ investment by borrowing ( debt ) by reinvesting earnings or by issuing new shares Assume that the firm either reinvests earnings or issues new shares ( equity financing ) Under an income tax the firm s net income is $ the value of the machine s output ( $ ) plus the proceeds from selling the machine ( $ ) minus the cost of the machine ( $ ) If the corporate income tax rate is percent the firm pays $ in tax on its $ income leaving it with $ after taxes ( a percent after-tax return ) Thus an income tax creates a distortion to the investment decision by lowering the after-tax return on the investment In contrast full expensing allows the firm to deduct the entire $ cost of the machine up front. Thus the firm s taxes go down by $ when it makes the investment and the effective cost of the machine is $ rather than $ The firm earns $ from the machine s output plus $ from the sale of the machine and the total income of $ is taxed at a rate of percent ( because the firm already deducted the cost of the machine upon purchase ) Thus the tax paid is $ and the firm s after-tax income is $ The rate of return is ( $ $ ) / $ = percent which is the same as it would have been without a tax Effectively full expensing makes the government a partner in the investment : the government pays for percent of the investment s cost ( via the deduction ) and receives percent of its return To be most effective in reducing distortions full expensing would need to be combined with elimination of the interest deduction. Suppose interest payments remain deductible under the full-expensing approach described above and the firm borrows money to fund half of the machine s cost ( $ ) at a percent interest rate. The effective cost of the machine is $ due to expensing. Therefore the firm spends $ of its own funds ( $ $ = $ ) for the machine. Next year the machine generates $ of income and the firm pays $ to the lender ( principal continued on next page Chapter chapter5.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Box continued plus interest ) The firm deducts the interest payment of $ from its income resulting in taxable income of $ At a percent tax rate the firm s tax liability is $ The firm is left with a profit of $ a return of percent on its initial $ investment. Thus the tax on the investment s return is negative ( the investment receives a subsidy from the government ) If the interest deduction were not allowed the firm s tax bill would be $ ( just as above ) and the profit after repaying the lender $ and paying taxes would be $ a percent rate of return With full expensing and no interest deductibility there is no distortion to either the investment decision or the financing decision Another alternative is to reduce the corporate rate. Using the same example as above consider the impact of reducing the corporate tax rate from percent to percent. The firm makes its $ investment and next year pays tax on its net income of $ This leaves the firm with an after-tax return of percent. Since the after-tax return is still below the before-tax return there is a distortion to the investment decision However there is less of a distortion than with the percent tax rate In recent years other countries have taken the approach of cutting the corporate tax rate. A tax rate cut affects all capital both new and old. In comparison expensing is targeted to new investment only. Thus expensing generates a greater increase in investment for any given revenue reduction Another difference between tax rate cuts and expensing arises because firms sometimes earn returns on their investments that are above the normal ordinary return. To illustrate this consider the example in Box in which a $ investment yields a percent rate of return. Suppose that the next best use of the firm s funds would produce a return of percent The return of percent represents the opportunity cost of the funds also known as the normal return. As long as the investment return is above the normal return the firm will undertake the project ; thus taxing any returns that exceed the opportunity cost of funds ( called supra-normal returns ) does not create any distortions. Expensing exempts only the normal return from taxation ; supra-normal returns are subject to taxation. In the example $ of the investment s payoff represents compensation for the firm s opportunity cost and $ represents a supra-normal return. If the corporate tax rate is percent full expensing would give the firm a deduction worth $ this year and require it to pay a tax of $ next year. Effectively the firm is | chapter5.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM able to defer $ of tax liability for year. The value to the firm of deferring the tax until next year is $ ( percent of $ ) However next year the firm must pay $ in additional taxes. Thus the firm has effectively paid a tax of $ ( the $ of additional taxes minus the $ value of deferral ) which represents a tax of percent on the $ supra-normal return. Note that taxing the supra-normal return does not result in any distortions because the firm s decision to undertake the investment does not depend on the tax. If the normal return were instead percent then the deferral of tax would be worth $ to the firm and there would be no effective tax on the investment return. In contrast to expensing a corporate tax rate cut lowers the tax on both normal and supra-normal returns The efficiency of the business tax structure in the United States is particularly important as other countries undertake major corporate tax reforms. Capital is mobile across international borders and the business tax environment is important in ensuring that the United States continues to attract investment from abroad and that U.S. firms can compete effectively in foreign countries In the mid-1980s the average statutory corporate tax rate ( weighted by GDP ) across OECD countries was percent. The U.S. tax reform of which reduced the corporate tax rate from percent to percent made the United States a relatively low-tax country at the time of the reform. Since that time however the OECD-average corporate tax rate has fallen below that of the United States. These comparisons refer to statutory tax rates. The United States has relatively generous accelerated depreciation provisions and a multitude of business-level exemptions and deductions that reduce the tax burden on investment below the statutory rate. However the effective marginal tax rate on corporate investment is still high : compared to other G7 countries ( France Germany the United Kingdom Canada Italy and Japan ) the United States imposes an above-average marginal effective tax rate on corporate investment for domestic debt and equity holders in the top individual income tax bracket. In contrast the U.S. average corporate tax rate ( the total amount of corporate taxes paid as a percentage of corporate operating surplus ) is low relative to other countries. This fact highlights the inefficiency and complexity of the corporate tax system. The marginal tax rate represents the additional tax burden a firm faces when it undertakes a new investment ; therefore it is the relevant tax rate for new investment decisions This distortion is larger in the United States than in other countries. Despite the larger distortion the corporate tax raises less revenue in the United States than in other countries as evidenced by the fact that the average tax rate is lower. The implication is that investment incentives could be improved without a reduction in government revenue Chapter chapter5.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Conclusion The analysis in this chapter has focused on both the level and structure of taxation. Over the past years Federal revenues have fluctuated around % of GDP. Under current law however tax revenues are scheduled to rise much faster than GDP in coming years. Furthermore over longer periods of time projected growth in entitlement spending will put pressure on taxes to rise. Because taxes distort incentives these trends have important implications for economic growth. Extending the tax cuts of and would improve labor supply and savings incentives and result in less distortion of corporate finance decisions. Combined with control of entitlement spending and a long-term solution to the Alternative Minimum Tax this can have a beneficial effect on long-run growth The tax cuts of and have also improved the efficiency of the tax structure particularly with respect to the double taxation of corporate income. However the structure of business taxation still creates a number of distortions and puts the United States at a competitive disadvantage globally Even revenue-neutral reforms can result in economic gains if they remove unnecessary distortions | chapter5.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM C H A P T E R The Nation s Infrastructure O ur economy depends on infrastructure that allows goods people information and energy to flow throughout the Nation. This infrastructure ports roads airports communication networks power lines and many other systems represents an important input into the economy. Just as firms must use labor and raw materials to produce output they must also use airports and power lines. Similarly consumers rely on cell phone towers and highways in their daily lives Infrastructure is often provided either directly by government agencies or by firms regulated by the government. Accordingly the quantity and quality of infrastructure available to a firm or consumer often depends on government policy in addition to market forces. In recent years the United States has experienced growing demands on its infrastructure thanks to economic growth and successful deregulation in sectors that are heavy users of infrastructure The policy challenge is how best to respond to these increased demands Infrastructure is a broad term and this brief chapter does not provide a comprehensive review of all of the U.S. infrastructure systems. Instead it discusses some of the economic issues associated with major transportation communication and power transmission systems and some of the policy challenges in each. The key points of this chapter are : Infrastructure typically requires large capital investments to build and maintain capacity. Once built however the cost of allowing an extra person to use the capacity is typically low as long as the number of users is less than the infrastructure s capacity. This cost structure often means that infrastructure can not be provided efficiently by a competitive market. As a result many types of infrastructure are instead provided by Government-regulated companies or in some cases by the Government itself Demands on the U.S. infrastructure grow as the economy expands and Government policies often determine how effectively infrastructure can accommodate that growth. Properly designed user fees can help ensure efficiency by revealing information about what infrastructure consumers value most The price people pay for using infrastructure should reflect the extra cost associated with its use. This includes the cost of maintaining the infrastructure itself as well as delays caused by increased congestion chapter6.indd 2/5/08 : : PM The private sector plays an important role in providing infrastructure However lack of competition in markets for infrastructure raises concerns about market power so that Government oversight is sometimes necessary. Government must continually reassess the need for oversight in the face of changing market conditions The Basic Challenge of Infrastructure Policy As the economy grows demands on our infrastructure increase. Since vehicle traffic on U.S. roads has nearly doubled passenger-miles of air traffic have increased by more than percent and ton-miles of freight on U.S. railroads have increased by more than percent. The Nation s growing demand for energy resources together with a greater emphasis on new sources of power is placing new demands on our energy infrastructure. And the growth of the Internet and information technology means that telecommunications networks are becoming more central to the U.S. economy Infrastructure systems whether pipelines roads fiber optic networks or port facilities require large investments in long-lived capacity. Once this capacity is in place however small increases in usage may cost relatively little to provide. Marginal cost refers to the extra cost associated with a small increase in production of a good. Infrastructure investments produce goods like passenger trips or phone calls that typically have low marginal cost as long as total demands on the infrastructure do not approach the capacity it was designed to support. Once usage approaches capacity however marginal cost can increase substantially as extra use makes the entire system less effective These features create certain policy challenges that are common to many types of infrastructure. To illustrate these challenges imagine a growing city where construction of a new bridge across a river is being considered. The bridge will provide significant benefits relative to the existing options for crossing the river for example taking a ferry or traveling several miles to cross at another point One possibility is that a private party will construct the bridge planning to earn a profit by charging tolls. If the private sector builds a bridge the market for river crossings at any given point will likely be provided by a single monopolist. This is because providing a bridge involves economies of scale : it is cheaper to build a single bridge that serves people per day than two bridges that each serve people per day. Because of economies of scale the market for bridge crossings is called a natural monopoly. Even if there are no artificial barriers to market entry a monopoly is likely to emerge simply because a single firm can produce the good more cheaply than multiple firms could | chapter6.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM A monopolistic bridge owner may choose to charge prices that are too high from society s perspective. A monopolist will choose a toll that generates the highest possible profit even though the cost of allowing an extra person to cross the bridge may be very close to zero. This means lost opportunities : some people will choose not to cross because of the high toll even though the cost of allowing them to cross is very small. The people who choose not to cross may waste time and fuel traveling to a toll-free bridge or may choose not to cross perhaps visiting friends less often or not shopping at stores that would require a bridge crossing. Economists refer to this type of foregone benefit as a deadweight loss and it is a key economic reason for preventing monopoly pricing. To avoid this deadweight loss government often attempts to prevent monopoly pricing of infrastructure either by regulating the price or by providing the infrastructure itself. While government involvement can address monopoly concerns it can create other inefficiencies : regulators may lack the information necessary to make efficient choices and may make decisions based on political considerations rather than on a cost-benefit analysis If the government builds and operates the bridge it must make a number of decisions. First the government must decide how to pay for the bridge One approach is simply to charge a toll for each use of the bridge that is high enough to cover the average cost of providing the bridge. This approach seems sensible : the bridge will be paid for by those people who use it and their willingness to pay for the bridge reveals that it passes a cost-benefit test. However this approach is likely to create some inefficiency because the average cost of providing the bridge will be higher than the extra cost each person imposes when he or she crosses at uncongested times. Thus some people will choose not to cross even though it would cost the government little or nothing to allow them to cross. This can create a deadweight loss similar to the loss that occurs when a monopolist chooses the toll though the deadweight loss will generally be smaller than under monopoly pricing One response to this problem would be to charge a two-part tariff : a fixed charge for a permit to use the bridge in addition to a per-use toll that would be low to reflect the small marginal cost of using the bridge. This approach creates efficient incentives for those consumers who obtain permits because the toll they pay for each crossing reflects only the cost of their use. However some drivers will choose not to obtain a permit and their failure to use the bridge is a deadweight loss Other issues arise if the bridge becomes congested. Suppose that at peak hours so many people attempt to use the bridge that traffic jams develop At such times each person who uses the bridge contributes to the delay that everyone on the bridge suffers. Congestion means that from society s perspective the marginal cost of bridge trips is no longer small : each additional trip makes traffic slower adding to the delay costs of everyone using the bridge Chapter chapter6.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM When the bridge becomes congested users of the bridge may urge the government to invest in expanding its capacity. If people can use the bridge for free frequent users are likely to insist that greater investment is a good idea while those who do not use the bridge will object to spending tax dollars on the project. If the bridge is financed by tolls that are the same at all times of day people who use the bridge at peak times will receive the benefit of extra capacity even though they do not bear the full cost of the expansion. People who use the bridge at uncongested times will pay more in tolls to finance the expansion but receive no benefit. Thus peak-time users may support expansion even if the benefits to society do not outweigh the construction costs Setting aside the question of whether the bridge should be expanded the congestion described above reflects a system that encourages inefficient choices. Each person who uses the bridge decides when to cross without considering the costs this creates for others because of increased congestion Addressing this inefficiency can help ensure that existing capacity is used as efficiently as possible The questions of building the bridge who should provide it how it should be paid for and when new capacity should be constructed are all present to different degrees in debates about the major infrastructure systems in the United States. The next section gives an overview of some of these systems and some of the specific issues they face Current State of the Nation s Infrastructure This section discusses aspects of the U.S. transportation energy and communications infrastructure. Economic growth has meant increased demand for transportation raising questions about how best to address congestion. In energy and communications changes in technology and market structure are transforming the way that infrastructure serves these sectors Roads Roads play a central role in the U.S. economy. Both firms and consumers depend on cars and trucks in their everyday economic lives. Most U.S. freight shipments take place by road ; for example trucks handle over percent of U.S. freight shipments ( by value ) On average drivers travel miles by car each day and spend almost an hour a day behind the wheel. Americans use roads in all parts of their daily lives from commuting to work to shopping and visiting friends The amount of traffic on U.S. roads has been increasing steadily for decades As traffic has increased priorities have shifted from building new connections | chapter6.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM between places to accommodating growing traffic on existing routes ( see Box ) Although Federal State and local governments have built new roads and added lanes to existing roads new construction has not kept up with the increases in traffic. Chart shows that vehicle miles traveled in the United States have almost doubled since whereas total lane-miles of road have expanded by less than percent. Put somewhat differently each mile of road serves more traffic. For example on urban highways the average number of vehicles using a given mile of road each day has increased from in to in We would not necessarily expect new road investment to match increases in miles driven because a mile of road that serves vehicles per day may easily accommodate vehicles per day without any new construction. But at peak hours the number of drivers attempting to use many urban roads approaches or exceeds the roads maximum capacity. In almost two-thirds of peak-hour travel on urban interstates took place on roads carrying at least percent of their theoretical maximum number of vehicles. More than a third of travel on urban interstates took place on roads carrying at least percent of their theoretical maximum Box : The Interstate Highway System The Interstate Highway System began when President Eisenhower signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of which authorized $ billion for the construction of miles of interstate highway designed to a common standard. One of the original motivations for construction was to move materials and troops in times of emergency. President Eisenhower originally hoped to finance the system with tolls but the system was instead financed through a fuel tax because of concern that tolls in less densely populated areas would be insufficient to cover the cost of those roads The Interstate System has come to play a central role in our Nation s economic life and has lowered the cost of transporting goods around the United States. The construction of the Interstate System may have made important contributions to economic growth although there is no consensus among economists regarding highways economic effects and it is therefore difficult to say what parts of the Interstate System have benefits that outweigh their costs. Today the local objective of reducing congestion in urban areas has replaced the National objective of connecting distant markets and providing for National defense. Now that interstates connect the country the priority is to find ways of using these resources as efficiently as possible and in particular to address congestion on the most heavily traveled interstate corridors Chapter chapter6.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM When traffic approaches a road s capacity the road becomes congested resulting in real costs for drivers and businesses. The extra fuel consumed in all urban areas amounts to billion gallons per year about percent of U.S. gasoline consumption. On average commuters in urban areas lose almost hours per year due to traffic congestion and in the largest cities congestion costs the average commuter hours per year. In the largest urban areas over percent of travel takes place under congested conditions. Congestion is worst in the Nation s largest cities but is increasing in urbanized areas of every size. Chart shows that congestion is increasing even in urbanized areas with fewer than residents Traffic congestion is the predictable result of a situation in which a scarce resource road space at rush hour is made freely available to everyone Individual drivers choose to travel at the time they find most convenient When they travel at congested times however they contribute to the wasted time fuel and increased pollution borne by everyone else on the roadway Individual drivers do not take this cost into account so they use the road even though the social costs they create may be greater than the individual benefits they receive. This is the tragedy of the commons : when a resource is freely available to anyone who wants to use it it is overused potentially leaving everyone worse off With highway traffic as with other types of infrastructure the problem is not simply that so many people use a road but that they choose to use it at | chapter6.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM the same time. At hours when many drivers want to travel a certain amount of delay can be optimal given the benefits that many drivers receive from traveling at their most preferred time. But as a road becomes very crowded small increases in the number of cars can cause large decreases in the speed of traffic. When too many people attempt to enter road space at one time traffic flow collapses meaning that a road is able to handle fewer cars in a given amount of time. Spreading out the times at which drivers enter a roadway can permit higher speeds allowing a road to handle more traffic with the same amount of pavement One response to road congestion is to build more roads or widen existing roads. While new construction can be justified in many cases it is not the solution to all congestion. Road construction is expensive ; each additional lane can cost millions of dollars per mile. Furthermore the tragedy of the commons applies to new capacity as well as to existing capacity. If a new lane makes a road less congested at peak hours drivers who had previously avoided travel at peak hours will start to use the road at those times. This increase in rush-hour drivers means that the road will again become congested This phenomenon is often referred to as the fundamental law of highway congestion : increased capacity induces new traffic at peak times so that moderate increases in capacity do not eliminate congestion A solution that does address the tragedy of the commons is to charge a price for using a road that reflects the extra delay each driver causes. Congestion Chapter chapter6.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM pricing refers to a policy of charging tolls that reflect how crowded a road is at particular times. When drivers are required to pay such a toll some drivers will choose to travel at less crowded times take less crowded routes or take alternative means of transportation. Those for whom it is especially important to travel a particular route at a particular time will pay the toll and be able to travel without inefficient levels of delay Congestion pricing has proven effective in many areas in reducing congestion and increasing traffic flows. For example on a busy 10-mile stretch of State Route in Orange County California drivers can choose between free lanes and toll lanes for which prices adjust during the day on a schedule designed to maintain a free flow of traffic. Speeds in the toll lanes exceed miles per hour even at the busiest time of day with the result that at the busiest part of the rush hour each toll lane can produce almost twice as many vehicle trips each hour as the nontoll lanes. Because prices discourage drivers from entering the toll road when it is already crowded traffic does not become so dense that flows collapse and the road is able to serve more drivers during any given period of time More and more urban areas are becoming interested in using congestion pricing as a way to alleviate clogged roadways. As part of its Congestion Initiative the Department of Transportation has developed Urban Partnership Agreements with five cities across the country working with local authorities to mitigate the increasing congestion. In August the Secretary of Transportation announced the selection of Miami Minneapolis/St. Paul New York San Francisco and Seattle as the cities chosen from dozens of applicants to receive a share of $ million in Federal funds to help alleviate highway congestion and the mounting costs it imposes. Each of these cities has developed plans to use some form of congestion pricing to reduce traffic delays. For example New York City is proposing cordon pricing following an approach that has been successfully implemented in London and Stockholm. Between : a.m. and : p.m. on weekdays cars would pay $ per day to drive in the busiest parts of Manhattan while trucks would be charged $ Vehicles driving in the area could be identified by electronic E-Z Pass readers or for vehicles without the readers through a license plate recognition system using digital cameras New York s plan is targeted at a heavily congested urban area ; other cities have followed different approaches targeted at certain roads or stretches of road that are especially congested. On SR-520 in the Seattle area regional planners are proposing to use demand-based toll rates both to alleviate peak-hour congestion and to raise funds to replace a high-traffic bridge over Lake Washington. Under the plan toll rates would be updated in real time to reflect current traffic conditions and in-vehicle transponders and supplemental cameras would collect the toll while drivers travel at highway speed | chapter6.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Bridges On August the I-35W Bridge in Minneapolis collapsed killing people. This was the first collapse of this magnitude since May when a barge collided with a bridge in Oklahoma causing the collapse of a section of I-40 and killing people. The recent tragedy focused national attention on the condition of our highway bridges. Bridge repair and maintenance are important for two reasons : to ensure safety and to maintain or increase the capacity of a bridge to carry traffic There are nearly bridges in the United States. Bridges are inspected using the National Bridge Inspection Standards in most cases every years The Department of Transportation collects this information in the National Bridge Inventory a database of information on bridge conditions. About percent of the bridges in the United States are classified as structurally deficient by the Department of Transportation meaning that the bridge is subject to certain weight or other restrictions due to its condition. This share has been shrinking as States have focused greater resources on bridge maintenance and repair ( see Chart ) These numbers suggest that bridges have become a higher priority for States in recent years Chapter chapter6.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Ongoing inspection and maintenance is especially important for bridges Infrastructure investments should be based on a cost-benefit analysis. In some cases new projects might seem more appealing to decisionmakers than routine maintenance but maintenance is essential. One way to encourage investment in projects with the greatest return is to ensure greater transparency in reporting the costs and benefits of different infrastructure projects For example by publicly identifying the bridges in greatest need of repair the National Bridge Inventory may help generate political support for targeting resources where they are most productive Railways Railroads have played a central role in our Nation s history linking markets over long distances and helping create a national economy. Rail continues to be an important mode of freight transportation particularly for heavy bulk materials such as coal. Chart shows that railroads carry almost one-third of the Nation s freight measured in terms of ton-miles but because rail tends to be used for lower-priced goods this represents a small fraction of the total value of goods shipped. In the Staggers Rail Act deregulated the freight rail industry. At the time observers expected prices to increase but in fact deregulation unleashed significant efficiencies and lower rates After decades without changes in rates or traffic shipping rates have fallen substantially in real terms since while the volume of freight rail traffic has nearly doubled. In the last few years rising fuel prices have made rail an attractive alternative to trucking because railways are about three times more fuel efficient than trucks. Increasing highway congestion may also have contributed to increasing demand for rail. As a result of the increased demand for rail shipping its real price has increased for the first time in many years and railroads are investing increasing amounts in new capacity Railroads serve a variety of customers who face different sets of options for shipping their freight. Some routes are served by only one railroad while other routes are served by competing railroads. Some products ( such as goods in containers ) can be economically shipped by road whereas others ( such as coal ) may be prohibitively expensive to truck over long distances Like roads and other infrastructure rail systems are very capital intensive and railroads must pay the cost of maintaining their rail lines and other capital stock regardless of the amount of freight they carry. This creates difficulties for railroads that serve competitive markets. To remain profitable overall the total revenue from all shipments must cover the railroad s capital costs. But a particular shipment will increase a railroad s profit as long as revenue from that shipment is greater than the marginal cost of that shipment. In markets | chapter6.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM where shippers have an alternative to rail this means that railroads will offer rates to some shippers that do not cover a full share of their capital costs. They make up for this by charging prices that cover more than a shipment s share of capital costs in markets where shippers do not have economical alternatives Understandably many shippers in these markets complain that they pay shipping rates substantially higher than those paid by shippers in more competitive markets. However the railroads ability to charge different rates to different shippers plays a vital role in enabling railroads to maintain the large capital investments needed to operate a railroad. If railroads were forced to charge the same price for all freight many shippers that have alternative shipping options would respond to an increase in rail rates by shifting toward road water or other transportation. This reduction in revenue would make railroad capital investments less profitable and the likely result would be reductions in investment and in rail capacity. In the long run the result could be even higher shipping rates for those who continued to use rail transportation Chapter chapter6.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Container Ports Over billion dollars worth of goods representing over percent of U.S. trade passes through U.S. seaports each year. Container trade that is goods packed in containers that can be moved from ships to trucks or trains without being unpacked continues to grow dramatically more than doubling in the United States since All of those goods pass through a relatively small number of facilities. A complex system of cranes berths skilled labor warehouses and ground transportation facilities is necessary to transfer goods from oceangoing ships to the domestic transportation network Increases in global containerized trade have meant an increase in the size of container ships. In the late 1980s shipping companies introduced the first container ships that were too large to use the Panama Canal and today such post-Panamax ships represent at least percent of container shipping capacity. As ships have gotten bigger port traffic has become more concentrated among those ports with waterways and port facilities capable of handling such large vessels. Today the busiest U.S. ports handle percent of U.S. container traffic up from percent in Chart shows that increased concentration has been most noticeable at the busiest U.S. ports ( Los Angeles Long Beach and New York ) where the share of National container traffic increased from percent in to percent in | chapter6.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Freight shipments into and out of the United States will continue to grow along with the growth in U.S. trade. This increase in trade flows will place tremendous demands not only on port facilities but also on the land-based systems that carry traffic to and from the port. For example the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach together handle container traffic representing over truckloads each day ( not to mention goods shipped in tankers dry bulk and other ships ) All of this traffic must be accommodated on the roads and railways serving the port Increased demands on port facilities are creating opportunities for smaller ports to expand their traffic. For example the Port of Savannah Georgia more than tripled its container traffic between and Savannah s growth reflects significant investments in expanding warehouses docks and rail yards as well as the desire of shippers to avoid congestion at the larger ports in New York and Los Angeles. Increased U.S. sea trade also creates opportunities for ports in Mexico and Canada which can connect by road or rail to U.S. markets. For example a new container port in the town of Prince Rupert British Columbia opened in offering facilities for the largest container ships and rail connections to Chicago and the Midwest Faced with growing demands congested ports have implemented innovative strategies for reducing the attendant strain on local infrastructure. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach developed a program called PierPass designed to move traffic to off-peak periods during the nights and weekends Carriers unloading during peak hours pay a surcharge of $ for a 40-foot container and proceeds from the surcharge fund port operations during the weekend and overnight. According to the program percent of the container volume at the Los Angeles Long Beach complex is now moved during the off-peak shifts removing trucks from the roads during rush hour each week Aviation Since the real price of air transportation has fallen while the number of miles traveled by air has grown by almost percent. An important part of these changes was the deregulation of the airline industry in By permitting airlines to introduce new flights and schedules deregulation introduced competitive forces that have led to entry by discount carriers and reductions in the real price of air travel. In air travel generated approximately $ billion in revenue equivalent to approximately percent of GDP Air travel requires not only planes but also runways terminals and an air traffic control system to maintain a safe distance between planes. The capacity of these systems has not increased as rapidly as the growth of air traffic. Our air traffic control system is largely based on antiquated technology. New investments in infrastructure have been hampered by several factors including Chapter chapter6.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM political opposition from communities near airports and the fact that air traffic control is provided by a government bureaucracy that has no financial incentive to respond efficiently to increased demand for its services Growing traffic has created congestion in both the Nation s airspace and its airports. The result has been longer flight times and increased delays Airlines have accounted for congestion in part by building more time into their schedules although delays have grown despite the longer schedules Chart shows that the average scheduled time for a flight from New York s La Guardia airport to Atlanta s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport has increased from hours and minutes in to hours and minutes in The average delay has also increased from minutes in to over minutes in This has been the trend for the busiest routes in the continental United States : for the city pairs with the highest number of airline passengers scheduled times have increased by an average of minutes and delay has increased by an average of minutes. Delays have also become more severe : for these same routes the number of flights that are delayed by more than minutes has increased from percent to percent. The summer of saw especially severe flight delays with particularly acute problems in New York ( see Box ) | chapter6.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Box : Delays at New York City Airports Some of the worst air traffic congestion in the United States occurs in the New York City area. Problems in New York have a large impact on delays nationwide because a large proportion of U.S. flights travel to from or over New York airspace. Delays in New York became especially acute in the summer of after restrictions were lifted on landings and takeoffs at John F. Kennedy International Airport. With no limitations on how many flights could be scheduled into the airport the number of scheduled flights increased by percent and far more flights were scheduled to arrive during peak periods than the airport could handle. The result was long delays : only percent of flights arrived on time during the summer of with especially severe delays in the peak hours In September the President called on the Secretary of Transportation to seek solutions to mounting air traffic congestion and the frustrations it creates for passengers. The Federal Aviation Administration convened an Aviation Rulemaking Committee to explore ways of relieving congestion including market-based mechanisms such as congestion pricing or auctions for the right to land or take off at congested times. In December the Department of Transportation announced that it would limit the number of flights to and from New York airports beginning in spring while continuing to pursue market-based approaches to reducing congestion in the near term History has shown that such market-based solutions can work. In for example the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey implemented a congestion-pricing fee on small aircraft by raising the minimum landing fee during peak hours. As expected travelers responded to the price incentives : general aviation peak hour activity declined by percent reducing delays at the region s airports The Federal Aviation Administration working with other agencies has begun an effort to expand capacity by upgrading the air traffic control system The Next Generation Air Transportation System ( NextGen ) would use satellites and digital communications to provide both controllers and pilots with a much more accurate picture of where planes are in the airspace. Together with other technologies these upgrades have the potential to reduce the amount of separation necessary for safe flight allowing more planes to use a given amount of space and increasing the system s capacity Airport congestion reflects capacity constraints and indicates a failure to manage and price that capacity in a way that reflects the costs each plane creates for air traffic control and for other users of congested space. Each Chapter chapter6.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM plane that lands or takes off at a busy airport takes up roughly the same amount of space and time regardless of size but the fees paid for using an airport are much higher for larger planes. The airport fees that airlines pay each time they land are based on the weight of a plane and the national air traffic control system is funded largely by taxes on airline tickets. Both approaches mean that a regional jet carrying passengers pays much less than a large jet carrying passengers even though each creates roughly the same burden for air traffic control and the same amount of congestion in the airspace. Similarly fees are the same whether the airport is busy or empty even though scheduling an arrival at a busy time can generate significant costs for other users. This system creates the wrong incentives encouraging airlines to use inefficiently small aircraft and to schedule too many flights at the most popular airports and times of day The market-based mechanisms discussed earlier in this chapter can help encourage airlines to use airport infrastructure more efficiently. Different options are available for using market-based mechanisms to manage airport congestion. One is to change the structure of landing fees so that planes pay more to land at more congested times and airports. Similar to congestion pricing on roadways this would encourage airlines and others to schedule flights at times when the airports and airspace are less crowded. Another approach would be to fix the number of landing and takeoff slots available during the busiest times of day and auction the right to use those slots. Slots would in effect be leased for a fixed period of time with slots turning over and being reauctioned on a regular basis to accommodate new entrants and promote competition. Assigning slots through a market process would have a similar effect to congestion-based fees because the price of slots at the most popular times would be greater than those at less popular times. Under either approach airlines would have an incentive to schedule flights at less busy times and passengers who attach high value to flying at busy times of day would be able to pay a premium to schedule flights at those times with greater confidence that flights will be able to depart on time Market-based mechanisms could also improve efficiency when airport capacity is reduced as a result of bad weather or other temporary problems. For example airlines could pay a premium for the right to land with higher priority when capacity is reduced. Airlines that pay for higher priority could advertise their higher reliability whereas other airlines might offer price discounts to travelers who were willing to accept a higher probability of delay The Electrical Grid Although they transport electricity rather than goods or people power lines share important characteristics with roads and other infrastructure. Building transmission lines requires a large capital investment. Once this capacity is | chapter6.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM built the marginal cost of transmission is low as long as the amount of power being delivered is less than the capacity of the lines The transmission of electric power was once primarily a local affair : a utility generated electricity and distributed it on its own power lines to the surrounding area with rates set by a local regulator. But over time the United States has moved from this local model to one in which the Nation is covered by grids of high-voltage transmission lines and power generated in one place may be used hundreds of miles away. While some power plants continue to serve a particular local population others take advantage of the grid to sell their electricity on a wholesale market By permitting power to be generated in low-cost areas and delivered to high-cost areas the national electrical grid can allow generating capacity to be used much more efficiently. For example on the West Coast long-distance transmission lines allow hydroelectric power from Washington State to be transmitted to California to help meet peak summer demand. Long-distance transmission can make alternative energy sources more viable as the United States attempts to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels ( see Chapter ) For example production of significant amounts of wind power is economically feasible only in certain areas of the country. Similarly it is easier to site power plants in certain areas. Long-distance power lines mean that electricity can be produced in areas where production is most efficient and delivered to areas where it is most needed The legacy of State-regulated local utilities creates obstacles to developing an efficient national electrical grid. One problem is fragmented ownership of power lines. Different parts of the electrical grid are owned and maintained by a large number of investor-owned utilities and other entities so that power may need to pass through lines belonging to multiple parties before reaching its destination. This can create coordination problems. Each utility must decide independently how much to invest in the capacity of its power lines even though these decisions will affect many other parts of the network. It may not make sense for one party to invest in greater capacity unless others make similar investments Such problems are exacerbated by the fact that different regulators govern different parts of the electrical grid. Utility investments often must be approved by State or local regulators applying rules designed for the model of a local utility. Regulators in one State may not have incentives to account for the benefits of new transmission capacity for residents of other States. In fact regulators in an area where production costs are low may object to making it easier for local power generators to sell in areas where production costs are high because more power will flow to the high-cost market potentially raising wholesale prices in the local market in the short run. In the long run however making trade in electricity easier will lead to greater generating capacity in areas where electricity can be generated at lowest cost. The Federal Chapter chapter6.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Government has taken steps to coordinate interstate transmission projects by giving the Department of Energy the authority to designate certain transmission corridors as high priority and to help develop new capacity in those areas Telecommunications Not long ago the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure consisted largely of copper wires used to transmit the human voice. Today information travels any number of ways satellites cellular systems and fiber optic cable to name some examples and industry continues to develop new communication technologies. New choices mean consumers and businesses enjoy the benefits of competition among providers. As information technology becomes faster and cheaper communication infrastructure is allowing workers to telecommute and consumers to shop online Broadband Internet Service Broadband refers to Internet connections that can transmit data at high speeds ( the Federal Communications Commission defines a high-speed connection as one that allows transfer rates greater than kilobits per second in at least one direction but many connections are much faster than this ) As recently as broadband access was very rare but by nearly half the country had a broadband connection at home and the United States had over million high-speed connections. Until almost all broadband users had either a cable modem or a digital subscriber line ( DSL ) connection but recently mobile wireless subscriptions have increased rapidly ( see Chart ) Like other forms of infrastructure broadband capacity requires large capital expenditures and once capacity is installed the marginal cost of delivering data over a line is close to zero. Telecommunications companies have invested large amounts to expand broadband infrastructure installing new highcapacity transmission lines and investing in new technology to send data over existing telephone and cable wires Despite large fixed costs of deployment there are multiple broadband providers competing for subscribers in most U.S. markets. The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) reports that by the end of over percent of U.S. ZIP codes were served by at least four broadband service providers. Nationwide percent of local telephone subscribers had access to DSL and percent of cable subscribers had access to cable Internet service Broadband service provision remains an extremely dynamic area and telecommunications providers are exploring new models to determine what type of broadband provision can produce the greatest benefits for consumers For example last year the fastest-growing category of high-speed Internet | chapter6.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM access was in mobile wireless connections a category that grew from about million connections at the end of to over million connections at the end of Broadband providers are also offering dramatically higher transmission speeds enabling consumers to access new services such as streaming video and voice-over Internet protocol ( VOIP ) The tremendous value the Internet creates for consumers has provided strong incentives for the private sector both to invest in building out the Internet infrastructure and to innovate in finding new ways of serving the market Wireless Communication Wireless technology such as that used in cellular phones has been one of the most dynamic sectors of the economy in recent years with considerable growth in both the number of users and the quality of services. Today the United States has million wireless subscribers up from million at the end of Several wireless service providers compete to offer communication features that will attract new customers such as the opportunity to share pictures download news and other information or view a map of their current location and directions to their destination Wireless communications systems transmit radio signals using specific frequencies of the radio spectrum. If different signals were to use the same frequency the result would be interference that prevents communication Chapter chapter6.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM To prevent interference the Government regulates who can use each part of the spectrum. Private sector users obtain licenses from the FCC that grant exclusive permission to transmit signals in a certain area. Certain frequencies are reserved for use by Government agencies and use of this spectrum is coordinated through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in the Department of Commerce The right to use spectrum is a scarce resource with many competing demands. Early in the history of radio the U.S. Government began allocating the right to use spectrum through an administrative process in which different potential users applied for licenses and the FCC attempted to determine which use would generate the greatest social benefit. This approach requires the Government to evaluate an enormous amount of information about the competing benefits of using resources in different ways. Markets can help solve this problem because the prices people are willing to pay for a scarce resource reflect all the information they possess about how the resource can be best used Recognizing these benefits from market allocation the U.S. Government has moved to a system in which the right to use spectrum for wireless communication is awarded through auctions. In the FCC began a series of auctions for the rights to use spectrum for personal communication services Since then the FCC has held about spectrum auctions generating nearly $ billion in revenue and opening up new opportunities for firms to offer wireless services The spectrum auctions have put the right to use spectrum in the hands of those who believe they can use it to generate the greatest value. By creating clear property rights to use particular frequencies the auctions have given companies the incentives to invest in the resources they have obtained. The result has been a rapid build-out of networks of towers for cellular communication. Chart shows that the number of wireless transmitters in the United States has grown from about in to in an increase of percent per year Through the President s Spectrum Management Initiative the Administration has sought ways to ensure that spectrum is used in the way that generates the greatest value. One way to do this is to create incentives for Government users of spectrum to consider the opportunity cost of the spectrum they use. Currently Government agencies obtain spectrum licenses through an administrative process in contrast to other valuable resources such as electricity and labor for which they must pay. Policies that lead agencies to recognize the cost of using spectrum will encourage them to free up this resource when there are others who could use it more efficiently | chapter6.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Infrastructure Policy Though the U.S. infrastructure systems face a diverse set of issues they have certain features in common such as high capital costs and limitations to capacity that create the potential for congestion. This section discusses some of the key policy questions that are common to many forms of infrastructure First how should infrastructure be paid for ? The price of infrastructure should reflect marginal cost but this may not be sufficient to cover capital costs. Second how should policymakers set priorities for infrastructure investment ? In many cases the government can look to markets for ideas as to how to best identify which projects have the greatest return. Third should infrastructure be provided by the private or public sector ? Policymakers can often choose between government provision and private sector provision with some degree of government regulation. Fourth when should infrastructure be provided at the Federal level and when is it better provided at the State or local level ? Chapter chapter6.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM How Should Infrastructure Be Paid For ? As discussed at the beginning of this chapter efficient use of any good or service requires that the price people pay for using the good or service equals the extra cost they impose when they use it. If the price is lower than this cost people will have an incentive to overuse the good or service. For example if electricity is available for free consumers may leave lights on when they are not using them. If the price is higher than the extra cost of providing the good it will be underused creating a deadweight loss For much infrastructure the marginal cost of extra use may be very low or close to zero when use is well below capacity. This creates a dilemma in financing infrastructure because encouraging efficient use means setting the price equal to marginal cost. If this price is at or near zero revenue will not cover the cost of providing infrastructure requiring either a higher price or some other source of revenue. For some forms of infrastructure firms address this problem with a two-part tariff : a fixed fee for access to the infrastructure in addition to a per-use fee that reflects the marginal cost of providing the infrastructure. For example telecommunications providers typically charge users a monthly subscription fee but allow users to transmit as much data as they like at little or no extra charge reflecting the fact that once a user is connected to the network extra data transmission involves little or no extra costs. This approach creates efficient incentives for those consumers who subscribe while still allowing telecommunications providers to finance the cost of their investment When roads or other infrastructure become congested the efficient response is to charge fees that reflect the cost each additional user imposes on others. Congestion prices can lead to efficient decisions about whether and when to use infrastructure and yield information about where additional capacity would be most valuable Efficient tolls can also generate revenue that can help pay for infrastructure Fees collected through congestion pricing can be used to fund expansion of existing infrastructure and reduce current indirect taxes and fees. Under the right circumstances efficient tolls will be sufficient to completely fund new infrastructure construction meaning that congestion is reduced while at the same time roads are financed almost entirely by the drivers who use them during the busiest periods How Should Government Set Priorities for Infrastructure Projects ? In competitive markets firms decide whether to invest in new capacity based on the value that capacity creates for consumers. For example imagine a coffee shop that has long lines during the morning rush. The shop s owner | chapter6.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM could shorten the wait by adding an extra cashier. This would cost money but would please her customers potentially leading to greater sales. The owner will add a cashier if the extra coffee she can sell will generate enough revenue to justify the extra expense In areas in which infrastructure investment is made by private parties such as broadband or wireless communications companies undertake exactly this type of analysis. Similarly when the government decides whether to undertake new infrastructure investment it should conduct an analysis similar to that of the coffee shop owner comparing the costs of a new project to the benefits it generates for users. Rigorous cost-benefit analysis should be used to determine whether the benefits of a particular project outweigh its cost and whether the benefits of dollars spent are greater than the social benefits from spending money in other areas Private sector firms use the prices consumers are willing to pay to measure the benefits of extra investment. When the government makes investment decisions however there is frequently no market price that reflects how much consumers are willing to pay for greater capacity or for a particular new project. When infrastructure is provided for free one can not infer from heavy use that users attach a high value to using certain infrastructure. Free access also makes it difficult to evaluate users stated preferences. For example residents of a particular area may be strong supporters of expanding a freeway serving their community given that they are able to use that freeway at no additional charge. But this support is not responsive to the real question that a policymaker would want to answer which is whether those residents would support the construction project if they had to bear all of its associated costs in addition to receiving the benefits The problem of determining the value users receive from infrastructure projects is another argument on behalf of user fees that reflect marginal cost When users pay for the infrastructure they use we can be more confident that the infrastructure produces benefits that reflect the cost When Should the Government Regulate or Provide Infrastructure ? As discussed earlier in this chapter infrastructure is often a natural monopoly meaning that one firm can serve the market more cheaply than multiple firms could. This may create a role for the government to prevent the distortions that result from monopoly pricing. However large capital costs by themselves do not necessarily imply natural monopoly ; when a market is large it may support multiple firms even though the costs of participating in the market are high. When several firms compete to provide a service government regulation is not needed to prevent monopoly prices Chapter chapter6.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Technological innovation has the potential to fundamentally alter the makeup of markets and government regulation should adapt to changes in market structure. Markets once dominated by monopolies can become competitive over time due to innovation. Regulations should be eliminated as markets become more competitive A good example of this phenomenon is telecommunications. Although the industry was once dominated by a single firm or by a few large firms today numerous providers compete to provide customers with voice Internet and video over numerous platforms including telephone ( DSL ) cable fiber-optic satellite wireless and even the electric grid. In the face of such innovation and digital convergence the government must reassess legacy regulatory regimes and replace regulation with competition wherever possible to most efficiently maximize consumer welfare When infrastructure provision is a natural monopoly economic theory provides no clear answer to the question of whether infrastructure is better provided directly by the government or by a regulated monopolist. In both cases decisions will be insulated from market discipline. Government regulation of a private firm involves some duplication of effort because the regulator must examine firm decisions to prevent abuses of monopoly power But a government agency may not have incentives to produce efficiently because it does not have the profit motive of the private sector. Private firms may also be able to provide management with stronger incentives to increase efficiency Empirical studies of privatization around the world have shown that in general private firms in various industries produce and invest more efficiently than state-owned enterprises. Although these privatizations have occurred in a wide variety of different countries and industries privately run enterprises on average produce more efficiently and invest more in their industry. Recent U.S. experiences have also demonstrated that in some cases there can be benefits to greater private sector involvement in provision of transportation infrastructure Some urban areas wanting to improve congested roads in the face of tight budgets have turned to private investors to build and operate toll roads. In for example Virginia authorized a private investment partnership to construct the Dulles Greenway a 14-mile stretch of highway in a congested part of the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. The partnership was authorized to collect tolls that would provide no more than a reasonable return on the invested funds. Since construction in the mid-1990s the road has become an integral part of the region s transportation network carrying over vehicles each day in | chapter6.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM In the Federal Aviation Administration contracted with Lockheed Martin to take over operation of the FAA s Automated Flight Service Stations These stations provide general aviation pilots with weather briefings updates on airport closings flight plan assistance and emergency communications The contractor has successfully consolidated operations and reduced costs and the FAA projects that it will save $ billion over the contract s first 5-year period. The FAA continues to monitor the stations to ensure quality and service levels Although private firms have strong incentives to produce efficiently some argue that they will tend to provide a lower quality of service than the government because higher quality may yield lower profits. This concern suggests that when government contracts with a private firm to provide public infrastructure it should pay careful attention to the terms of the contract to ensure that the firm can be held accountable for the quality of the infrastructure What Are the Proper Roles for State and Federal Government ? Both the Federal and State Governments provide and regulate infrastructure. For example most funding for road construction and maintenance is provided by the States although substantial funds are also raised through Federal taxes on fuel and other transportation goods and then distributed to the States. Similarly electricity transmission is regulated both by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and by State utility regulators There are advantages to making decisions about infrastructure policy at the State level. State Governments can tailor infrastructure decisions to local preferences and conditions rather than providing a single one-size-fits-all policy for the entire country. States that implement policies that their citizens dislike will fail to attract new people and businesses Federal provision or regulation can be important when infrastructure in one State provides benefits to residents of other States. For example power lines transmit electricity across State borders but State electricity regulators may think only about how regulation affects their own citizens. Federal regulation may be more appropriate when State infrastructure produces national benefits. Similarly State Governments make decisions about infrastructure investment based on the benefits to their own citizens and will be reluctant to make investments with their own taxpayers money if a large share of the benefits goes to out-of-state residents. The Federal Government should take into account the total benefits to the Nation so when infrastructure projects provide significant cross-state benefits it may be best to set infrastructure policy at the Federal level Chapter chapter6.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Conclusion Infrastructure policy is not simply an engineering problem of how best to build the systems to meet the country s needs. Although Government may play an important role because infrastructure provision is often a natural monopoly economic incentives matter and must be taken into account. There are two central questions of infrastructure policy. First what investments in new capacity generate benefits that exceed their costs ? Second how can we ensure that the capacity we invest in is used in the most efficient way possible ? By subjecting infrastructure policy decisions to these threshold questions and using market-based solutions where action is taken Government at the local State and Federal levels will increase certainty that future investments in infrastructure are socially worthwhile and allocated appropriately | chapter6.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM C H A P T E R Searching for Alternative Energy Solutions T he United States consumes a great deal of energy in support of the world s largest economy. It produces over quadrillion British Thermal Units ( or Btu a measure of energy ) of primary energy per year mainly from coal natural gas petroleum and nuclear power and it consumes quadrillion Btu more than any other country in the world. The difference quadrillion Btu is imported mostly in the form of petroleum For energy security reasons the United States seeks to diversify its energy sources and fuels. One way to do this is to pursue the use and development of domestically-produced alternative energy sources. The United States has also been concerned about the environmental effects of current energy use particularly the emission of air pollutants and carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) For this reason the United States has pursued the use of alternative energy sources that have the potential to produce lower emissions than traditional fossil fuels ( coal natural gas and petroleum ) which are the source of about percent of the energy consumed in the United States. Therefore both energy security and environmental concerns motivate the consideration of policies that diversify our sources of energy. For purposes of this discussion alternative energy will be defined as alternatives to fossil fuels and will include renewable energy sources ( hydroelectric geothermal solar wind and biomass ) as well as nuclear power and emerging technologies Alternative energy sources are not the only way to address energy security and environmental concerns. Improved energy efficiency could reduce our energy demand as well as reduce pollution. Environmental concerns could also be addressed by developing ways to use fossil fuels in a less polluting manner such as through clean coal and carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) technologies. These are both very important solutions that the Administration is pursuing in tandem with alternative energy solutions ; however this chapter will focus on alternatives to fossil fuel This chapter will concentrate on two sectors : electricity generation and transportation. These are not the only two sectors that could benefit from alternative energy. Primary energy consumption ( that is the direct use of energy before it has been subjected to any conversion ) can be divided into five major sectors : electricity generation transportation and energy end use by industry commerce and residences. The potential for the direct use of alternative energy by industry commerce and residences is important ; but chapter7.indd 2/5/08 : : PM because nearly percent of petroleum is used in the transportation sector and the vast majority of coal is used for electricity generation this chapter will largely focus on these two sectors Alternatives for electricity generation include nuclear power hydropower biomass wind geothermal and solar power. Alternatives in the transportation sector include developing domestically-produced transportation fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel and finding new ways to power our cars such as using electricity for plug-in hybrids or using hydrogen to deliver energy Our goal over the next several decades is to change the way in which we produce and consume energy for electricity generation and transportation so as to diversify our energy sources. The key points of this chapter are : The current suite of available alternative energy sources is an important part of achieving our goal but a number of technical regulatory and economic hurdles must be overcome to use them fully There are several promising but currently unproven methods of producing and delivering energy that if successfully developed and deployed will greatly enhance our Nation s energy portfolio Appropriate and limited government action can play a useful role in helping to realize our energy security goals Energy Sources The drive for alternative energy is almost a return to our roots because energy derived from wood biomass is perhaps the oldest source of energy. Two hundred years ago wood supplied nearly all of our energy needs. It is only over the past two centuries that fossil fuels fuels formed from the remains of plants and animals began to dominate as our preferred energy source Coal began to be used as a fuel in the 1700s for a number of reasons including the fact that it burned cleaner and hotter than wood charcoal. Its use spread to the United States during the Industrial Revolution in the early 19th Century increased with the introduction of steamships and steam-powered railroads and finally was used for electricity generation in the 1880s The market for natural gas developed from town gas synthesized from coal and used for street and house lighting during the 1800s and in the 1820s the first well was dug to extract natural gas. In the 1890s electricity began to replace natural gas for lighting purposes but beginning in the 1940s a continental-scale pipeline system evolved to distribute these reserves to urban areas for residential space and water heating and ultimately for power generation | chapter7.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM The first U.S. oil well was drilled in in Western Pennsylvania which spawned the domestic oil industry. After World War II domestic oil production continued to rise but failed to keep pace with accelerating consumption The United States became a net importer of crude oil in The huge post-war expansion of petroleum consumption in Europe and the Far East was met from foreign sources notably Iran and Saudi Arabia while the United States itself became increasingly dependent on petroleum imports. U.S. oil production peaked in and since then declining domestic oil production and rising domestic consumption have increased petroleum imports. While there have been significant gains in energy efficiency economic growth in the United States has led to large increases in aviation trucking and automobile transportation and has resulted in increased oil consumption While fossil fuels have been the primary source of energy for over a century alternative energy has been used throughout our history. The first electric car was constructed as early as the 1830s. Hydropower in the form of waterwheels for milling has been used throughout the world for centuries but dramatically increased in the United States in the 1800s with advancements in turbine technology. The first use of hydroelectric power occurred in at the Wolverine Chair Factory in Grand Rapids Michigan and the first U.S commercial hydroelectric power plant opened in on the Fox River in Wisconsin. In the first large windmill was used to generate electricity in Cleveland Ohio. In Henry Ford s first car was constructed to run on ethanol. The first commercially available solar water heaters were produced in California in the 1890s. The basis for nuclear power originated in when Enrico Fermi and other scientists created the first self-sustaining nuclear reactor at the University of Chicago and the world s first full-scale commercial reactor opened in Cumberland England in Today we continue our search for alternative energy solutions in order to diversify our energy portfolio Fossil Fuels Petroleum accounts for percent of the Nation s total energy consumption ( see Chart ) the largest share of any fuel type and produces almost quadrillion Btu of energy. ( A gallon of gasoline contains about Btu while a kilowatt-hour of electricity is equal to Btu. ) The United States consumes about million barrels of petroleum per day making us the largest oil consuming country in the world. In fact the United States consumes about percent of the million barrels consumed each day worldwide almost three times the amount of oil consumed by China the second largest oil-consuming nation. However China s oil consumption has grown at an average rate of percent per year since compared to an average rate of percent per year for the United States Chapter chapter7.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM | chapter7.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Most of the oil consumed in the United States is used in the transportation sector absorbing percent of U.S. oil consumption in The rest is used by the residential commercial and industrial sectors and for electricity generation ( see Chart ) The largest domestic sources of oil production are offshore wells in the Gulf of Mexico and wells in Texas Alaska and California. Imported oil primarily comes from Canada Mexico Saudi Arabia Venezuela and Nigeria ; and petroleum is the largest imported energy source for the United States. Because of this reliance on oil changes in its price can affect the U.S. economy and in the price of oil hit record levels ( see Box ) Box : Oil Prices In the nominal price for crude oil reached its highest level ever This increase was due to several economic geopolitical and environmental factors such as growing world demand limited supply growth smaller inventories security concerns in oil producing countries and a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar Some fear that high oil prices reflect a peak in oil production and predict an imminent decline in production in the near future. This type of prediction often assumes static or growing consumption with limited additional discovery or production. As the price of oil rises however there is an economic incentive to find new sources or improve extraction techniques. Enhanced oil recovery ( EOR ) is one example of this type of response. EOR is any technique that can increase the amount of oil that can be recovered from an oil field but it is most commonly associated with gas injection particularly using CO2 which forces the oil to the surface. The Department of Energy estimates that state-of-the-art EOR could potentially add an additional billion barrels to the total recoverable oil resources of the United States although not all of that is necessarily economically recoverable Even if production has peaked we are unlikely to abruptly run out of oil. As the price rises over time producers will have an incentive to retain some of the resource to sell at a later date and consumers will have an incentive to transition away from oil consumption. Over time the price rise will make the adoption of alternative energy sources more and more likely Chapter chapter7.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM The next largest fuel types are coal and natural gas comprising percent and percent of consumption respectively. In coal production in the United States reached a record million short tons ( one short ton equals pounds ) while consumption was million short tons. This coal produced quadrillion Btu of energy the vast majority of which was used for electricity generation by the power sector. Coal continues to be a major fuel source for the United States largely due to its domestic abundance The United States has million short tons of recoverable coal reserves at producing mines and an estimated million short tons of total recoverable reserves. Domestic coal production comes primarily from three geographical regions Western Interior and Appalachian and there is a small amount of both imported and exported coal In the United States consumed trillion cubic feet ( Tcf ) of natural gas. By comparison total world natural gas consumption was Tcf with the United States and Russia combined consuming percent of the world total. U.S. natural gas consumption produced quadrillion Btu of energy with percent used by residential commercial and industrial sources and percent used for electricity generation. Domestic gas production comes mainly from the Gulf of Mexico and older-producing areas in Texas Oklahoma and Louisiana. Imports which make up percent of consumption come mainly by pipeline from Canada The Need To Diversify For more than a century fossil fuels have satisfied the bulk of America s demand for energy. However a move to alternative energy sources can hold a number of benefits One of the reasons for shifting away from fossil fuels is improved energy security. This term can have multiple meanings but it is often applied to the desire to reduce the Nation s vulnerability to oil supply disruptions from political or terrorist actions or natural disaster. However because there is a world market for oil and a world price the price of oil rises in the case of a disruption no matter the source of supply be it foreign or domestic. Thus energy security in this context can not be obtained by simply shifting from one supplier to another. It requires diversifying the fuels consumed in our energy portfolio which reduces the amount by which a disruption in any one energy source can affect the economy. In this context alternative energy technologies for both electricity production and for transportation can dampen the impact of sharply rising prices and thus provides an energy security benefit A second major benefit of alternative energy is that some alternative energy sources have a lower environmental impact than traditional fossil fuels. At the point of generation wind nuclear hydropower and solar sources produce no local air pollution such as sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ) and nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) | chapter7.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Also depending on the fuel and technology used alternative energy can reduce CO2 emissions. In the United States emitted approximately billion metric tons of energy-related CO2 almost percent of which were generated by fossil fuel use for transportation and electricity generation Approximately one-third of all energy-related CO2 in the United States came from petroleum use in the transportation sector and percent came from coal and natural gas used to generate electricity ( see Chart ) Appropriately chosen alternative energy sources in the transportation and electricity generation sectors may help reduce these emissions A third potential benefit of alternative energy is that some believe that it may eventually compete with or cost less than fossil fuels. It is worth noting however that reduced energy cost whether achieved through improved energy efficiency or less expensive energy supply will result in increased energy demand a phenomenon known as the rebound effect. For example the Department of Transportation sets mandatory Corporate Average Fuel Economy ( CAFE ) standards for passenger cars and light trucks. When fuel efficiency standards are raised vehicles use less gasoline per mile ; but because Chapter chapter7.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM the increased fuel efficiency reduces the cost of driving people drive more This leads to less gasoline savings than implied by the change in fuel efficiency The economic literature puts the rebound effect between percent and percent which means that a percent improvement in fuel efficiency would actually only produce an to percent improvement in energy consumption Alternative Energy Production While some of the electricity produced in the electric power sector is generated using alternative energy sources the majority ( percent ) is generated from fossil fuels. In the transportation sector almost all of the energy consumed comes from fossil fuels. Developing alternative energy sources in these two sectors could move us down the road to enhanced energy security and lower pollution Alternatives for Generating Electricity In the United States electricity is generated using a wide variety of energy sources both traditional and alternative. One factor affecting which type of electricity plant will be built at any given time is economics : which energy source will produce the greatest economic return over the lifetime of the plant. However it is difficult to compare plants that differ in both cost and generation capacity. One way to assess this economic return is to compare the levelized cost of electricity ( LCOE ) the present value of the total cost of building and operating a generating plant over its financial life converted into equal payments and amortized over the expected annual generation from the plant. Table provides the estimated national average LCOE for various types of electricity generating plants entering service in The final column of Table gives the national average total system LCOE while the four columns prior to the last give the components that make up this total system cost Conventional coal-fired power plants have an average real LCOE of approximately $ per megawatt hour produced which is the lowest cost of all electricity generation methods presented. Natural-gas combined cycle plants have an average LCOE of between $ and $ per megawatt hour produced and are closely competitive with coal-fired power plants. On an average LCOE basis alternative energy based electricity generation is more expensive than both coal and natural gas-based plants which partially explains their lack of penetration in the market The LCOE however is not the only consideration in choosing which type of plant to build. Because the demand for electric power varies by time of day and season and because electricity is difficult to store plants may | chapter7.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Table Estimated Average Levelized Costs ( $ /megawatthour ) for Plants Entering Service in Plant Type Fossil Fuel Based Electricity Generation.............

While natural gas combustion turbines have a lower capacity factor and a higher LCOE than other fossil fuel based plants they are attractive as peak load or intermediate load ( between base load and peak load ) plants. Additionally fuel prices vary regionally due to transportation costs and resources Other factors may also be important in determining what type of plant is built. For example many states have renewable portfolio standards that require minimum additions to capacity from renewable electricity technologies and there may be tax incentives for alternative energy power generation The values in Table do not reflect these factors. Power producers may also consider environmental factors that could affect technology investment decisions. These considerations may depend on a regulatory environment that differs substantially in different regions of the country Investors may be concerned that future policies could increase the cost of coal or make it more difficult to dispatch coal-fired power. Finally LCOE Chapter chapter7.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM estimates are subject to additional uncertainty not discussed here. For example actual fuel prices may differ from those assumed for the LCOE estimates. The best power generation technology may vary throughout the country but the LCOE gives some indication of the relative cost of various types of electricity generating plants Nuclear Power There are currently commercial nuclear power reactors in the United States and they generate approximately percent of the Nation s electricity While the United States has the largest nuclear capacity of any nation no new commercial reactor has been ordered and approved for construction since and all of the plants ordered after have been cancelled The last plant to come online was the Watt s Bar reactor in Tennessee in Despite this the total nuclear capacity per plant in the Nation has increased over time due to uprating a process by which a plant is upgraded and then a more highly enriched fuel and/or a higher percentage of new fuel is used to generate more power. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) has approved power uprate proposals to date and is currently reviewing additional uprate proposals which would add an additional megawatts of electric power. According to NRC they could receive additional applications for power uprates by However there is a limit to our uprate potential and more reactors will be needed if the United States chooses to get more of its electricity from nuclear power plants. To date the NRC has received applications for units and a partial application for a fifth unit and expects to receive applications for as many as units over the next three years. However there is no requirement that a reactor be built for every license granted One advantage to nuclear power is that it has low operating cost so the cost differential between limited output and full capacity is small. These plants operate at close to full capacity and provide a reliable base load which is a constant supply of the electricity to power lines. Another advantage of nuclear power is that it can produce power using a relatively small amount of fuel without producing air pollutants or CO2 emissions A few of the disadvantages to nuclear power include the length of time required to build a new plant high capital costs and the cost of liability insurance. In addition to these economic disadvantages nuclear power faces a number of obstacles including social opposition to its use partially due to fears generated from the partial meltdown of the core of the power plant at Three Mile Island in and the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine in as well as additional safety concerns. There is also concern about the current lack of long term storage for the radioactive waste generated that must be properly contained for centuries. In the President signed a resolution to allow for the storage of nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain in | chapter7.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Nevada. The facility is expected to begin accepting waste in although limits on funding the facility have in the past delayed the opening and may do so again in the future. Additionally the Nuclear Waste Policy Act limits the amount of waste that can be stored at the facility to metric tons of commercial spent nuclear fuel and it is estimated that the commercial nuclear facilities currently operating in the United States will produce this much spent fuel before Unless the capacity at Yucca Mountain is increased by statute or a second site is opened we will face challenges in storing the commercial spent nuclear fuel generated from nuclear plants One possible solution to the storage issue is nuclear recycling. Virtually all of today s nuclear power is generated in an open fuel cycle in which enriched uranium fuel is used once and then disposed of. However only part of this fuel is actually consumed in the process and the residual still has potential energy. Spent nuclear fuel can be recycled to recover some of this remaining energy and this is done in several nations. A second type of nuclear plant using an advanced burner reactor can be designed to consume the residual producing a closed fuel cycle process. It is important however that any such recycling program be implemented in such a way so as not to produce weapons-grade nuclear material. This is the central goal of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership ( GNEP ) announced by the President in the State of the Union Address Hydropower Hydropower which is used almost exclusively to generate commercial electricity is the largest renewable energy source used by the electric power sector In the United States consumed quadrillion Btu of conventional hydroelectric power about percent of all renewable energy consumption The State of Washington generates the most hydropower among all states followed by California Oregon and New York. Hydropower works by powering turbines with either the force of the current or the fall of water from a reservoir or dam The advantage of hydropower is that it is a well-understood renewable power source that can supply both peak load demand by reserving available water for high value periods as well as base load demand. Hydroelectric plants do not produce air emissions and there are some positive externalities associated with them because the reservoirs and dams can provide irrigation benefits recreational opportunities and flood control. However hydropower also produces negative ecological effects. Hydropower s largest disadvantages are its negative impact on the surrounding environment low dissolved oxygen in the water impacts on the fish and the riverbank habitat and alteration of fish migration corridors ( e.g. salmon runs ) Even if the environmental concerns are removed however there is limited ability to expand hydropower beyond what is currently available. The total U.S. hydropower capacity including Chapter chapter7.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM pumped storage facilities is about gigawatts and the Department of Energy estimates that there are only gigawatts of undeveloped capacity remaining in the entire states Biomass Biomass is organic material from plants and animals such as wood crops manure and some garbage and is second only to hydroelectric power in providing renewable electricity to the United States. Biomass excluding biofuels makes up about percent of the Nation s total energy consumption and comprises almost percent of the total renewable energy consumption in the country. Sixty-four percent of this biomass is used directly by the industrial sector to generate power. Only a small portion is used by the power sector to generate electricity The main advantage to biomass is that it is a renewable source of energy that can be used either as a dedicated fuel to generate electricity or can be co-fired with other fossil fuels. Compared with coal biomass produces fewer CO2 SO2 and NOx emissions. If biomass is grown specifically for electricity generation in a closed loop system then the only CO2 emissions come from the harvesting transportation and processing operations The main disadvantage to electricity generation using biomass is that it currently has an average LCOE above generation using fossil fuels. This is due to a number of factors including the cost of obtaining the raw material. Also biomass energy consumption is technically not a zero-emission process Geothermal Power Geothermal energy is contained in underground reservoirs of steam hot water and hot dry rocks. Large geothermal power plants use this energy to generate electricity by drilling below the earth s surface in order to release or produce steam which is used to power turbine generators. After the steam condenses the water can be injected back into the ground to be used again Geothermal energy currently makes up about percent of the total renewable production of the country but it only supplies about percent of the Nation s electricity. It is considered an attractive resource because it requires a relatively small plant footprint requires no storage has no fuel costs and can provide continuous base load power. A study by the Government Accountability Office reports that there are at least undeveloped wells and hot springs with potential for future electricity production Geothermal power however is limited in its ability to provide large amounts of electricity to the country. To be viable geothermal power requires access to permeable rock systems filled with steam or water at temperatures from to degrees. Sites that meet these conditions are much more prevalent on the West Coast than in other parts of the country. Also geothermal sites can produce some local pollutants and small amounts of CO2 | chapter7.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Wind Power Wind power supplies about percent of our renewable energy and less than percent of the Nation s electricity a small percentage compared to large wind users such as Denmark Spain Portugal and Germany. However the use of wind power in the United States is on the rise and appears to be poised for dramatic increases in the future. In wind capacity increased by percent and the United States has led the world in capacity additions in recent years. An estimated gigawatts of wind capacity were added in This growth is due to the fact that in some areas wind is now cost competitive with other sources of energy production largely because of a government tax credit of cents for each kilowatt hour produced ( not reflected in Table ) Wind power is desirable because it is a domestic source of power with no fuel costs or emissions. It has become increasingly popular for two reasons First the current generation of windmills produces more power from a given wind resource than past technologies. The amount of electricity generated from a windmill is determined by a number of factors including the turbine size and the capacity factor. The size of the turbine dictates the potential output of the windmill and the average turbine size has approximately doubled since to about megawatts. The windmill s capacity factor is its actual energy output divided by its potential output. The average capacity factor has shown substantial improvement and is now roughly percent. Second windmills are increasingly popular because they can be placed on farms providing a source of lease income without having a large impact on the surrounding farming activity The ability of wind power to grow as an alternative energy source is affected by a number of factors. First the capacity factor is very sensitive to the average wind speed and it can drop dramatically for sites with less optimal wind profiles meaning less electricity from each windmill. Second to maximize the market potential wind-generated electricity must be integrated with the overall power grid the system of power lines and transformers that distribute electricity. When wind farms are located in rural areas some electricity is lost during the transmission to homes and businesses. In addition since wind energy is generated only when the wind blows and the electricity can not be economically stored at this time wind is an intermittent energy source Finally there is some public opposition to wind power. Because of the height of the turbine wind plants produce a large visual footprint and there is a potential effect on migratory bird and bat populations Solar Power Solar power has captured the imagination of alternative energy advocates and lends itself to creative demonstration projects like the installation of Chapter chapter7.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM solar panels on the roof of the West Wing of the White House. Solar power is attractive because its output closely aligns with peak electricity demand The fact is though beyond some niche markets solar power is not yet an economically competitive method of supplying large amounts of electricity Solar power currently comprises percent of the total renewable energy production and it produces a negligible amount of the Nation s electricity This is largely because solar power has a levelized cost of electricity above other energy sources Solar power generation generally comes in two forms : photovoltaic and thermal. Photovoltaic generation involves the direct conversion of light energy into electricity through the use of semiconducting material like silicon This technology already has some commercial success for low-power devices like calculators and emergency phones but is a relatively expensive method of producing large amounts of electricity. At present photovoltaic generation is generally used when grid connection is difficult or impossible such as for satellites. However progress has been made in reducing the cost and improving the efficiency of silicon-based photovoltaic cells as well as newer thin-film technologies. Photovoltaics can be used for distributed electricity generation at homes and businesses and may eventually serve as an alternative to bulk power provided by the electricity sector Solar thermal devices use direct heat from the sun concentrating it in some manner to produce heat. Solar power plants focus heat in troughs dishes or large power towers to generate electricity in what is called concentrating solar power ( CSP ) technology. If combined with thermal storage CSP could reduce the problem of an intermittent power supply. However currently CSP plants are expensive. They also require a large amount of space and are considered aesthetically unappealing by some and thus could be sited away from population centers. This means that there would be transmission losses in moving the electricity to population centers Summary of Alternatives for Generating Electricity There are many alternative sources of energy for generating electricity Some of them are more promising than others due to costs and other technological barriers. Nuclear power s LCOE is closest to coal and natural gas production and is currently best suited to produce large amounts of electricity without using fossil fuels but it requires large and expensive plants and is often socially unpopular. Hydropower currently provides the majority of the Nation s renewable electricity production but it is very limited in its ability to expand. Biomass geothermal and wind power are close to economically competitive with nuclear and fossil fuel production and have the potential for expanded use provided that the constraints described above can be overcome Finally while solar power is currently an expensive way to produce large | chapter7.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM amounts of electricity it could be an important source of alternative energy if costs can be reduced Alternatives for Transportation Twenty-eight percent of the energy consumed by the United States is used for transportation : cars trucks planes trains and ships. Unlike the energy used to generate electricity ( of which percent is generated using non-fossil fuels ) transportation relies almost entirely on petroleum-derived fuels. As with electricity generation a great emphasis has been placed on finding alternative transportation fuel sources for both energy security and environmental reasons One solution is to find an alternative fuel to use in our cars and trucks At present corn-based ethanol is the largest alternative fuel source but other fuels like biodiesel are also available. Our current vehicle fleet can burn a gasoline mixture containing up to percent ethanol without any modification ; flexible fuel vehicles are already being sold that can operate on percent ethanol ; and other alternative fuel vehicles such as natural gas-powered vehicles have long been used in niche markets. In addition investments in second generation biofuels like cellulosic technologies to convert non-food crop residues grasses and forest biomass are on the rise Another alternative energy solution for transportation is to design a different type of car. Hybrid vehicles are part of the current car stock but other advanced technologies are under development including hydrogenpowered vehicles and plug-in hybrids that would allow consumers to charge on-board batteries and achieve a limited range using electricity Corn-Based Ethanol Ethanol is a fuel made from grains and biomass that can be used as a gasoline supplement for automobiles. By far the most common raw material or feedstock used to produce ethanol in the United States is corn. Since major manufacturers of fuel tanks have provided the same warranties for use of both unblended gasoline and ethanol blends up to E10 ( percent ethanol and percent gasoline ) Flex-fuel vehicles ( FFVs ) can use blends containing more than percent ethanol such as E85 and auto manufacturers can produce FFVs at only a small additional cost. In of a total million light-duty cars and trucks on the road an estimated million were FFVs and this portion will likely grow. It is estimated that by approximately percent of the total U.S. car and truck sales will be FFVs. However of approximately fueling stations in the United States only offer E85 so flex-fuel vehicles have a harder time locating stations offering this fuel Ethanol has a number of advantages over oil. First it is domestically produced so its use decreases the impact from a disruption in the oil market Chapter chapter7.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Second the production of ethanol releases less carbon monoxide emissions ( but can increase other pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and non-exhaust volatile organic hydrocarbon ) than gasoline use. Finally depending on how it is produced ethanol may reduce CO2 emissions Since January annual ethanol production has increased more than percent from billion gallons to an estimated billion gallons in Including new and expanding plants one industry group estimates that the United States may soon have the capacity to produce more than billion gallons of ethanol annually. Four major factors have driven the dramatic growth in this market. First high oil prices have increased the demand for an alternative fuel. While ethanol has one-third less energy content than gasoline oil prices are high enough for ethanol to compete with gas on an energy-equivalent basis. However as oil and ethanol prices move so will the significance of this factor. Second the elimination of MTBE a gasoline additive used to produce cleaner fuel in cities with smog problems that was found to contaminate groundwater has increased the demand for ethanol as a substitute oxygenating agent. Third there are financial incentives for ethanol production. There is a 51-cent per gallon Federal tax credit for blending ethanol into gasoline ( and an associated 54-cent per gallon tariff on imported ethanol ) and additional subsidization in some states. Finally the Energy Policy Act of mandated the use of billion gallons of renewable fuel by much of which was expected to be met with ethanol The recently passed Energy Independence and Security Act of increases this mandate to billion gallons of renewable fuel by which will likely increase the demand for ethanol There are a number of concerns about ethanol. First some worry that production will outstrip the capacity to blend ethanol into the gasoline supply ( See Box ) Second the current oil pipeline infrastructure is not capable of transporting ethanol so it must be shipped by truck train and barge. To remain cost competitive ethanol plants are generally located within miles of where the corn is grown. Ninety percent of the productive capacity is in eight Midwestern States while percent of the U.S. population ( and thus the ethanol demand ) lives along the coastline. Rail transport capacity from the Midwest to the coasts is limited and dedicated ethanol barges ( to move ethanol from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast ) will take time and money to construct. Third there are environmental concerns about ethanol production depleting groundwater aquifers and water pollution from fertilizers used to grow crops for biofuels. Finally there are fiscal concerns particularly the cost of the 51-cent per gallon blender s credit The growing demand for corn-based ethanol as fuel is affecting the overall corn market. Most of the adjustment will take place over the next couple of | chapter7.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM years as corn-based ethanol production responds to market signals. Over time other markets will adjust to higher corn demand and ethanol substitutes will come online. The Department of Agriculture estimates that acres of planted corn increased to million in marketing year 2007/08 and corn production increased to billion bushels an increase of almost percent from marketing year 2006/07. Corn prices are also projected to rise to as much as $ per bushel by 2009/2010 before stabilizing and the U.S share of global corn trade is projected to fall to less than percent Increased production of ethanol will also affect other crops particularly soybeans because it competes with corn for cropland. Land devoted to soybeans is expected to decrease from million acres now to million acres by 2009/2010 and the price of soybeans is expected to rise from $ per bushel in to $ by 2009/2010 before stabilizing. Livestock production will also face higher costs as grain prices rise and the price of its final product ( meat eggs and milk ) will follow. Corn farmers will obtain higher Box : The Blend Wall In the United States nearly all of the ethanol produced is blended into E10 fuel. In nearly billion gallons of ethanol were blended into billion gallons of gasoline. By ethanol production is estimated to have grown to billion gallons and the total capacity could eventually reach billion gallons per year. Some worry that production will ultimately outstrip the capacity to blend ethanol into E10. ( By definition ethanol can not exceed percent of the gasoline pool if it is blended exclusively into E10. ) This limit to the use of ethanol ( basically where ethanol supply exceeds demand ) is referred to as a blend wall. There are a number of reasons why the blend wall is unlikely to pose a significant problem. The United States consumes around billion gallons of gasoline per year meaning that almost billion gallons of ethanol can be used for E10 alone. In addition if all existing FFVs used E85 they would consume an additional billion gallons of ethanol Therefore the total potential demand for ethanol blending is currently around billion gallons and this amount will grow as more FFVs are produced. Even extrapolating the rapid growth in ethanol production potential demand is well above the production capacity. As the supply of ethanol grows ( reducing the price of ethanol ) or as the price of oil rises ethanol looks increasingly attractive compared to oil and more trucks and rail cars will be devoted to distribution and more E85 pumps will be installed in order to capture the profits of an economically valuable commodity Chapter chapter7.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM prices for their products but livestock producers will face higher production costs ; and government counter-cyclical payments and market loans will likely decrease due to higher commodity prices. On net however it is likely farm incomes will rise as consumer prices rise Cellulosic Ethanol Cellulosic ethanol is similar to corn-based ethanol but it can be produced from a variety of biomass feedstocks such as agricultural plant wastes industrial plant wastes ( such as sawdust and wood pulp ) and crops grown specifically for fuel production ( such as switchgrass ) Because cellulosic ethanol can come from a variety of raw materials it can be produced in nearly every region of the country and has the potential to supply more fuel per acre than corn. Cellulosic ethanol production also produces less greenhouse gas ( CO2 methane and nitrous oxide ) emissions than either gasoline or cornbased ethanol While clearly desirable from both an energy security and an environmental perspective cellulosic ethanol is not yet commercially available because the conversion technology is only in its introductory stages and is expensive There are currently no commercial cellulosic ethanol refineries in operation in the United States but the Department of Energy has announced that it will invest $ million over the next four years in a cost-sharing program with private companies to fund six biorefinery projects located in California Georgia Florida Kansas Idaho and Iowa. By these refineries are expected to produce million gallons of cellulosic ethanol each year at less than $ a gallon Biodiesel Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that can be made by chemically combining natural oils and fats with an alcohol. It can be used by vehicles that use diesel fuel and it is typically blended with petroleum diesel at levels up to percent. Most U.S. biodiesel is made from either soybeans or yellow grease from restaurant cooking oil. Like ethanol biodiesel is a domestically produced fuel and depending on how it is produced its use generates about two-thirds less greenhouse gas emissions than petroleum-based diesel. At present however it is economically viable only because of a $ per gallon tax credit for blending biodiesel from virgin oil ( oil in its first-use ) and a $ per gallon credit for blending with recycled oil Alternative Vehicles An alternative to developing new fuels is to develop a different type of car that uses less gasoline. Two such vehicles currently exist. Conventional hybrid vehicles combine the internal combustion engine of a standard vehicle with the battery and electric motor of an electric vehicle. This gives them | chapter7.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM the power range and convenient fueling of conventional vehicles but lower emissions and better gas mileage. Hybrid passenger cars first became available in the United States in and have gained an increasing share of the U.S car market growing to percent of the U.S. car sales in Part of this is due to a tax credit introduced in for purchasing a hybrid vehicle. This credit of up to $ varies by model and is based on both the lifetime fuel savings and the fuel efficiency of the car measured against a baseline However in order to limit cost to the taxpayer while providing incentive to multiple automakers this tax credit is phased out for each car manufacturer once it has sold over eligible vehicles. A number of manufacturers have already reached this limit A second type of alternative vehicle is one powered by natural gas. Though major auto makers sell natural gas-powered cars in Europe Asia and South America they have not sold well in the United States. There are about natural gas vehicles in the United States ( compared to million worldwide ) most of which belong to corporate or government fleets. The low demand for these vehicles is due in part to a shorter driving range smaller trunks due to larger fuel tanks and a lack of retail stations selling natural gas However increased use of natural gas-powered vehicles could both provide both greater fuel diversity and lower CO2 emissions Plug-in Hybrids Plug-in hybrid cars are a different type of vehicle that has the potential to both improve energy security and decrease pollution. Unlike conventional hybrids which only recharge the electric battery through braking recovery a plug-in hybrid is also charged with electricity delivered to the home or business. As a consequence the vehicle can displace gasoline consumption with electricity that it draws from the grid. Some models under development would run on electricity for about miles. Since percent of personal automobiles travel miles or less daily plug-in hybrids may consume substantially less gasoline than a conventional hybrid. A recent study suggests that if plug-in hybrids were to be widely adopted and powered with low-carbon generated electricity they could mitigate a large portion of the Nation s CO2 emissions from transportation The major hurdle to the commercialization of the plug-in hybrid vehicle is the battery. Technology barriers include the battery cost size and weight power density durability reliability and safety. With continued improvements however plug-in hybrids could eventually become commercially feasible Hydrogen-Based Fuel Cell Vehicles Hydrogen can be used as a fuel with its chemical energy converted to electricity in a fuel cell. Pressurized hydrogen gas is forced through a catalyst and is split into positively charged hydrogen ions and electrons. The hydrogen Chapter chapter7.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM ions are combined with oxygen to form water and the electrons are used to generate electricity There are many possible uses of fuel cells including primary electricity generation from stationary fuel cells as well as hydrogen-based fuel cell vehicles. In a fuel cell vehicle a series of fuel cells generate electricity to power the car s electric motor and there is no exhaust other than water vapor. Since hydrogen can be produced domestically fuel cells could provide domestically-fueled vehicles that produce no CO2 or other harmful emissions from the tailpipe While hydrogen has great potential as an alternative fuel it does face some limitations. Currently it is more expensive than other energy sources Production storage and delivery are the largest cost categories associated with hydrogen-based energy. Hydrogen can be produced in small quantities where it is needed such as at a vehicle refueling station but the production cost can be high. In contrast larger centralized facilities can produce hydrogen at a lower cost but the delivery costs are high. Additionally the full infrastructure has not been built to accommodate hydrogen fuel and there are safety concerns with hydrogen pipelines and dispensing systems Summary of Alternatives for Transportation While the United States currently blends corn-based ethanol the transportation sector still depends on petroleum as its primary energy source. Changes to either the fuel we use or the vehicles themselves will be necessary if we are to substantially reduce this dependency. On the fuel side we can reduce our reliance on oil by developing alternative fuel like cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel. On the vehicle side we can develop vehicles that simply do not require gasoline such as plug-in hybrids or hydrogen-fueled vehicles. Done carefully these measures will not only enhance energy security but could also reduce CO2 emissions The Road Forward What we do over the next few years will dictate how quickly we can move away from fossil fuel consumption. The Energy Information Administration projects that absent any additional action primary energy consumption in the United States will increase percent to quadrillion Btu by an average annual increase of percent per year. Total consumption of coal is projected to grow from short tons in to short tons in Natural gas is expected to increase from trillion cubic feet in to trillion cubic feet in Total consumption of liquid fuels and | chapter7.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM other petroleum products is projected to grow from million barrels per day in to million barrels per day in Total electricity sales are projected to grow from billion kilowatt hours in to billion kilowatt hours in an average annual increase of percent Some alternative energy will enter the market as a result of market prices and as the market fluctuates there will be additional economic incentives to diversify our energy portfolio. If research and development leads to lower renewable energy prices then sources such as wind power and geothermal energy may eventually become fully cost competitive. Fuel efficiency is expected to increase not only as a result of an increase in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards but also due to price-driven consumer demand and the introduction of more advanced vehicles into the market Combined total consumption of marketed renewable fuels ( including ethanol for gasoline blending ) is projected to grow from quadrillion Btu in to quadrillion Btu in with ethanol consumption growing especially rapidly. However for alternative energy to dramatically penetrate the market technological and other hurdles must be overcome Policy Tools There are a number of policy tools available to any administration interested in promoting alternative energy and enhancing energy security. The traditional approach is to use research and development grants to subsidize the development of new technologies that are then adopted by the private sector. An alternative is to establish a mandate through legislation or regulation and require the private sector to meet it. While both approaches may be useful for advancing the adoption of alternative energy some worry that these approaches dictate which technology must be adopted. Also while mandates do not involve direct government expenditure they are not free. Consumers may have to pay higher prices for some alternative energy in order for the United States to receive the energy security and environmental benefits Another approach is to try to overcome the cost gap between conventional and more expensive alternative sources. This can be done through either tax credits or subsidies equal to the cost differential between the two technologies. In either case there is a public cost either directly through the subsidy or indirectly through the revenue loss on allowed credits. Loan guarantees are another possible tool that can encourage investment by shifting risk to the government but at the price of some moral hazard : if the government assumes too much of the financial risk investors may take on highly speculative projects that have little hope of success shifting the cost onto the Federal taxpayers Chapter chapter7.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Market-based mechanisms such as cap-and-trade and Pigovian taxes are another possible way to encourage the switch to alternative energy provided that these programs are workable and can meet the desired objective. Cap-andtrade programs dictate the total permissible emissions or total input desired ( the cap ) and allow companies to trade the right to make those emissions or produce those quantities ( the trade ) Trading assures that the desired outcome will be achieved at the lowest cost. For example the Renewable Fuels Standard ( RFS ) set in required that billion gallons of gasoline be replaced with renewable fuel by Obligated parties were to demonstrate compliance with the program by acquiring credits ( called renewable identification numbers ( RINs ) ) representing the amount of renewable fuel blended into conventional gasoline or used in its neat ( unblended ) form Under the trading program however obligated parties could purchase these credits from other obligated parties rather than acquire them themselves An alternative approach is to set a fixed fee ( sometimes called a Pigovian tax ) for each unit of the traded good. This is theoretically equivalent to a capand-trade program when the costs and benefits of the program are known. A hybrid approach is a cap-and-trade program with a safety valve in which the trading of credits occurs normally but obligated parties can choose to pay a fee ( the safety valve ) to demonstrate compliance rather than trading. In the President proposed that the RFS be increased to billion by but proposed an automatic safety valve to protect against unforeseen increases in the prices of alternative fuels or their feedstock One final policy tool that has shown occasional promise is the use of inducement prizes. When a specific goal is known the government may choose to award a prize for successfully reaching this goal as a way to spur technological innovation. For example the government could offer a prize for overcoming the technical barriers associated with the commercialization of hydrogen and fuel cells. Prizes are desirable because they focus on rewarding the actual achievement of the goal using whatever technology gets to the solution first whereas subsidies grants and contracts might only be dispersed to existing technology Current Efforts Diversifying our energy sources and fuels will not come quickly or cheaply and may require incentives for some of the alternative energy options discussed in this chapter. Over the past several years there have been a number of successful programs promoting alternative energy. In the President announced his Advanced Energy Initiative which called for a percent increase in funding for clean-energy research and a significant reduction in our oil imports over time | chapter7.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM To help meet the growing demand for base load electricity generation there are a number of programs aimed at expanding nuclear energy. The Nuclear Power program is a joint government and industry effort to develop advanced nuclear plant technology and reduce the technical regulatory and institutional barriers to the deployment of new nuclear power plants The United States is also part of two broad international efforts related to the development of nuclear power. The Generation IV International Forum is a cooperative effort to develop competitively priced nuclear energy systems that address nuclear safety waste proliferation and public perception concerns The goal is to have these systems available for international deployment by The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership is a group of nineteen countries that seek to expand the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes through a proliferation-resistant closed nuclear fuel cycle. Under this program nations with secure advanced nuclear capabilities would provide fresh fuel and reprocessing services to other nations who agree to employ nuclear energy for power generation purposes only Other efforts are aimed at improving electricity generation from renewable sources. The Department of Energy s Wind Energy Program is focused on the development of technology to make wind power cost-competitive in various areas of the country and to help reduce the barriers to electric grid interconnections. The goal of the Solar America Initiative is to make solar energy cost-competitive with conventional forms of electricity by Finally the recently passed Energy Independence and Security Act of takes a significant step in the direction of implementing the President s Twenty in Ten plan which was aimed at reducing domestic gasoline consumption by percent in years. Under this Act mandatory fuel standards require the production of billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels by Also the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards will be raised to miles per gallon by a percent increase from the present level Because fuel economy standards reduce oil consumption directly ( including the rebound effect ) and renewable fuels are produced domestically and may generate less CO2 than oil both of these measures produce energy security and environmental benefits Conclusion Both energy security and environmental concerns motivate the consideration of policies that move toward alternative energy sources. Currently percent of our energy consumption comes from fossil fuels and energy consumption is projected to increase percent by This means that the incentive to find alternative energy solutions is growing Chapter chapter7.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Fortunately some solutions exist. With regard to electricity generation nuclear power is close to cost competitive and could contribute a larger share to our Nation s energy portfolio. Even though there are some constraints on their use we should utilize our biomass geothermal and wind energy potential where it is economically viable. On the horizon technological advances and cost reductions might bring in solar power. With regard to transportation corn-based ethanol and other alternatives already reduce our gasoline consumption. The introduction of cellulosic ethanol in the next few years could reduce it further. In the longer term introducing new vehicles like plug-in hybrids and hydrogen-based fuel cell cars could dramatically reduce our oil consumption. While none of these solutions can resolve fully our energy security and environmental concerns together they provide a potential portfolio of solutions to our search for alternative energy | chapter7.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM C H A P T E R Improving Economic Statistics S tatistical systems have substantial value for both public policymakers and private decisionmakers. Administration and Congressional policymakers rely on statistics for budget decisions and related fiscal policy choices and the Federal Reserve System relies on statistics for formulating sound monetary policy. Private firms combine internal company data with publicly provided statistics to make sales projections and investment decisions. In addition contracts often use price or wage indexes to adjust payments for inflation Statistical systems like physical infrastructure become obsolete or depreciate with time. In a dynamic market-based economy like that of the United States new industries emerge old industries contract and firms find new ways of organizing and conducting their activities. The challenge for those who manage statistical systems is to keep pace with changes in the economy by continually evaluating the relevance and reliability of the statistics that are produced. In addition it is important to maintain the continuity of statistical time series to facilitate meaningful historical comparisons. Up-todate relevant statistics are critical to the public policy process : they help frame policy debates by providing a sense of the size and scope of an issue as well as the likely benefits and costs associated with a given policy action Advisory committees and researchers drawn from other parts of the government and academia help statistical agencies maintain the high quality of the data they collect and publish. They provide advice and engage in academic-style research that ensures that collected data are useful and relevant to issues people care about. Their work also enhances future data products by suggesting ways to improve the statistical system The statistical community in government business and academia recognizes that statistical agencies can improve the quality usefulness and efficiency of their statistical operations through cross-agency sharing of selected business data. Such interagency data sharing facilitates the synchronization of data across agencies which in turn improves the comparability of different datasets and makes the statistical products of all agencies more valuable. For example a measure of industry input ( such as labor hours ) often comes from one agency while a measure of industry output comes from another agency. If each agency classifies a given firm as belonging to a different industry then the productivity ( output per input ) of both industries may be mismeasured. By sharing classification data agencies can reconcile these differences to ensure that the firm is classified in a consistent manner. In addition to improving the accuracy of government statistics data chapter8.indd 2/5/08 : : PM synchronization may reduce the reporting burden on survey respondents thereby improving the efficiency of the Federal statistical system The key points in this chapter are : Robust statistical systems produce products that are important to understanding the changing state of the economy and to formulating sound policy. But statistical systems like physical infrastructures become obsolete or depreciate with time if they are not maintained Statistical measures must keep up with the changing nature of the economy to be relevant and useful. For example it is important that these measures reflect new and growing industries ( such as high-technology industries or services ) and intangible capital ( such as research and development ) Disruptions in a statistical series render it much less useful to policymakers and other data users. Thus continuity in statistical series is an important goal More effective statistical use can be made of existing data. In particular amending relevant legislation to enable full implementation of the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act ( CIPSEA ) could greatly improve the quality of Federal statistics An Overview of the U.S. Statistical System The U.S. statistical system comprises many organizations inside and outside the U.S. government that produce statistics. Of particular interest in this chapter are Federal statistical agencies ( whose principal function is to collect compile analyze and disseminate statistics ) and associated organizations such as the Federal Reserve Board that produce economic data to inform policy decisions. As of these organizations produced statistical releases designated as principal Federal economic indicators. These indicators include everything from agricultural prices to new home sales the unemployment rate and gross domestic product ( GDP ) Among the Federal statistical agencies the largest is the Department of Commerce s Census Bureau which accounted for percent of spending by principal statistical agencies in fiscal year as shown in Chart Spending on statistics by the Federal Reserve and many regulatory and program agencies as well as by nongovernmental organizations is excluded from this calculation. The Census Bureau s spending expands even more during years leading up to the Decennial Census. Although the Decennial Census receives a great deal of attention the Census Bureau conducts numerous other surveys much more frequently | chapter8.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM The second largest Federal statistical agency at percent of spending is the Department of Labor s Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) which produces on a monthly and quarterly basis the vast majority of U.S. data on employment and prices that are used to provide timely assessments of the current state of the economy. A combined percent of spending is accounted for by the agencies responsible for preparing statistics on education agriculture and health The Department of Commerce s Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) is a relatively small statistical agency with just percent of spending. Its data products rely substantially on input data collected by other agencies and include the National Income and Product Accounts which are among the most comprehensive measures of the size and current performance of the U.S. economy. Construction of the national accounts ( which includes GDP ) makes the BEA a consumer of vast amounts of data from the Census Bureau ( such as import and export data ) and the BLS ( such as wage and salary data ) as well as many other public and private sources Statistical data may be collected on a regular basis ( monthly quarterly or annually ) or on a relatively infrequent basis ( every or years for example ) Chart shows the pattern of real spending by several statistical agencies Chapter chapter8.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM on economic statistics that are produced at least once per year. Examples include the monthly employment report from the BLS ; monthly data on durable goods orders and new home sales quarterly data on services and official annual estimates of income and poverty from the Census Bureau ; and quarterly GDP from the BEA. Chart shows the pattern of real spending for several Census Bureau programs that are produced on an infrequent basis ( the Decennial Census or the 5-year Economic Census and Census of Governments ) In both charts expenditures on these programs were adjusted for inflation with the Office of Management and Budget s deflator for all other Federal outlays ( primarily salaries and expenses for nondefense agencies ) As shown in Chart spending on economic statistics has largely kept up with inflation. Real spending by the BLS has decreased slightly since after a period of steady growth that began in The three statistical agencies in Chart account for about percent of the total spending on economic statistics ( excluding the Decennial Census and periodic spending by the Census Bureau ) Total spending on economic statistics by other agencies has remained level | chapter8.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM As shown in Chart spending on programs with a or 10-year production cycle exhibits a clear pattern : spending climbs in preparation for the survey during the years immediately preceding the survey peaks during the year of the survey and then falls quickly upon completion. For example real spending ( in dollars ) on the Decennial Census which measures the size of the U.S. population rose from about $ million in to over $ billion in before quickly falling back. The slight upward trend in decennial funding in the last several years was partly for the development of the American Community Survey discussed later in this chapter. The 5-year budget cycle of the Economic Census which measures output and related statistics in the business sector is also apparent though the year-to-year changes in spending are considerably smaller. The Census of Governments which collects data on government organizations finances and employment also picks up every years but the annual level of spending on this program is relatively small ( less than $ million ) so the variations are less noticeable Chapter chapter8.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM Unlike the and 10-year censuses which are fairly well understood funding requests for other statistical initiatives such as new products or needed updates to existing programs are easily misunderstood. For example a major redesign of an existing survey s methodology ideally involves running two surveys concurrently ( one with the old methodology and one with the new methodology ) for a brief period of time so that the effect of the change in methodology can be isolated. Understanding this effect is essential if results from the redesigned survey are to be meaningfully compared to those of the survey being replaced The Importance of Statistical Systems Providing accurate information to households firms and policymakers is an important role of government statistical agencies. Most decisionmakers in private industry in Federal State and local governments and in private households rely in some way on data collected by Federal agencies. Federal economic statistics are designed to be consistent unbiased and reliable over time. These statistics can prove particularly useful if their availability and analysis allow a costly problem to be prevented or remedied more quickly and efficiently Private decisionmakers benefit from high-quality statistical systems because they improve the value of the information upon which firms and individuals base their decisions. For example in formulating investment decisions industries may use data on final demand or on the output of other industries that buy their output. A firm may examine a variety of labor market data such as wage rates and educational attainment in the region when deciding where to open new branches of the company. Airport authorities may study regional economic prospects when considering expansion decisions. Worker organizations and employers may track inflation trends and factor these price changes into their expectations for nominal wage gains. Popular press accounts based on occupational earnings may help students choose colleges fields of study or other training that will have long-term implications for their career paths State and local governments rely on a wide variety of statistical data to benchmark their performance to plan for the future and to readjust their allocation of resources. For example a State that finds its high school dropout rate rising relative to other States may opt to devote more resources to education. Likewise a city that finds its crime rate rising relative to other localities may choose to devote more resources to law enforcement. States and cities may study data on local population growth to assess the need for new transportation systems schools and other types of physical infrastructure | chapter8.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Monetary and fiscal policymakers also rely on high-quality publicly available data for understanding the changing state of the economy for formulating sound policy on a wide range of macro- and microeconomic issues and for economic forecasting. For example monetary policy depends on accurate measures of resource utilization current employment and unemployment trends productivity trends inflation trends ( including unit labor costs ) and housing market developments. If inflation estimates are overstated monetary policy might be unnecessarily restrictive. Similarly if productivity is overstated policymakers may think that the economy s productive capacity is expanding quickly enough to accommodate rising output without being inflationary and the resulting monetary policy may not be restrictive enough to limit the risk of inflation. Fiscal policy depends on accurate measures of GDP growth potential GDP growth labor markets and demographic change to forecast future government outlays and revenues. If productivity is growing more slowly than believed then revenue projections may be too high and as a result policymakers may adopt spending plans that are inconsistent with overall budget goals. Thus a clear understanding of the true trends in these variables is critical to making sound budget projections Keeping Up with a Changing Economy There are many ongoing efforts to update the statistical infrastructure to better reflect the changing economy and to more accurately reflect the economy as it stands now. These efforts include maintaining the relevance of statistical classification systems better measuring the changing population improving the measurement of the service-sector output and measuring the contribution of investment in intangible assets ( such as research and development ) to economic growth Statistical systems rely heavily on the classification of activities and over time classification structures are changed to better reflect the economy Sometimes the changes are incremental such as when an industry is split into two more detailed industries. Other changes are more substantial such as the transition from the Standard Industrial Classification ( SIC ) system to the North American Industry Classification System ( NAICS ) Despite the benefits of NAICS such as better coverage of advanced technology industries as well as better international comparability the transition was nonetheless disruptive to statistical agencies and data users. In particular the transition to NAICS broke the historical continuity of many data series. Further the official use of NAICS began in but not all data series incorporated NAICS classification in the same year. Statistical agencies have extended Chapter chapter8.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM many of their statistics backward in time on a NAICS basis but doing so is difficult and time-consuming. There is sometimes inadequate information to cleanly separate SIC-reported industry data into the redefined industries and the greater industry detail under NAICS. Many statistics produced by the BEA and BLS for example have been extended back to or respectively and a few series go back further. The Federal Reserve Board extended its industrial production and capacity utilization statistics back to based on the results of an extensive microdata reclassification research project that was conducted with the Census Bureau s Center for Economic Studies. Despite the improvements that came with NAICS it can be argued that the classification system has yet to fully capture the character of modern economies. For example the shift over time from manufacturing to services is still not fully reflected in the level of detail collected or even in the number of defined industries : The NAICS recognized nearly percent more private service industries than manufacturing industries ( versus ) even though the gross output of private services was about times larger than that of manufacturing in The Census Bureau recently introduced the American Community Survey ( ACS ) to provide more current data on our Nation s population and its characteristics. With a sample size of approximately million addresses the ACS collects important demographic housing social and economic information for use in the administration of Federal programs and the distribution of Federal spending. The ACS is the Nation s largest household survey and will eliminate the need for the Decennial Census long form in future censuses by providing data for the same detailed geographic locations as the long form. Unlike the long form however it will provide single-year estimates for geographic areas with populations of or more annually rather than estimates every years. Smaller geographic areas will be sampled over and 5-year intervals allowing the Census Bureau to produce estimates down to the census tract or block group. For policymakers who need to make decisions affecting the lives of large numbers of people having up-to-date estimates of population characteristics is critical to understanding a program s likely beneficiaries and its likely costs Another recent improvement to the Federal statistical system has been more accurate and timely measurement of service-sector output. In the Census Bureau introduced the new Quarterly Services Survey ( QSS ) the first new principal Federal economic indicator in nearly years. Prior to the introduction of this survey the private service sectors which together account for about percent of GDP were measured at most once per year if covered by the Service Annual Survey. Even at the annual frequency the available surveys account for just percent of GDP. The only comprehensive measures of service-sector output come every years during the Economic Census. Therefore the QSS is important because it measures | chapter8.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM service-sector output much more frequently which keeps the measures of service-sector activity in the National Income and Product Accounts more current. Even so the QSS covers a limited portion of the service sector which means there is room for improvement by broadening the coverage of the survey Efforts aimed at understanding the contribution to economic growth of investment in intangible assets such as spending on research and development ( R&D ) is another example of the work being done to make statistics better reflect the state of the economy. The BEA with the support of the National Science Foundation created a R&D satellite account of the U.S national accounts which treats R&D as an investment rather than an expense. Accounting for R&D in this fashion would have boosted the average annual change in real GDP from to by nearly one-quarter percentage point to percent. The BLS has created statistical measures of business employment dynamics that help explain the contributions to net changes in employment that come from job losses versus job gains. As the length of the time series increases these employment measures will be useful for understanding changes in employment over the business cycle. For example a policy response to a decrease in net employment that results from an increase in gross job losses ( i.e. greater layoffs or voluntary separations ) may be different from one that results from a decrease in gross job gains ( i.e. weaker hiring ) The former might reflect transitory industry shifts while the latter might suggest a generally weaker macroeconomic situation Other efforts to better reflect the changing economy include work at the Federal Reserve Board the BLS and the BEA to improve price measures to better represent the rapid pace of technological change in high-technology products like computers. When adjusted for improvements in quality prices are estimated to fall much faster which raises measures of real output Attempts to keep up with the changing economy are complicated by efforts to maintain consistent time series. Long time series are valuable for making historical comparisons and inferring long-run relationships among economic variables. When a time series is short it is hard to know if there is anything exceptional about a current event. The strength of any conclusions that are drawn is a direct function of variation in data. Short time series have too little cyclical variation. Similarly panel data which follows a group of persons households or firms over time are valuable for inferring changes over time from cross-sectional changes due say to different population composition There are a variety of ways in which economic measures can fail to keep up with the changing nature of the economy. Examples include : Firms increased substitution of purchased services for secondary activities previously done within the firm ( such as payroll processing ) means that some statistics such as employment will document this change as a shift to services. In this example the data accurately capture the Chapter chapter8.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM current use of services but the data do not reflect the change in the use of services correctly as the earlier data classified all activity within the firm ( including payroll processing ) by the predominant activity of the firm ( i.e. construction manufacturing etc. ) Established industries tend to receive a disproportionate share of attention compared to new growing industries. Industry and product classification codes are more likely to be kept than eliminated while new industries and products are often poorly measured and tracked at least initially The growth of professional employer organizations companies that provide employees to firms on a contractual basis has led to datareporting problems and consequently to inaccurate employment and wage data for industries and localities. Professional employer organizations that report employment centrally rather than separately for each client can obscure both the industry and location of the workers and our understanding of employment change and dynamics negatively affecting data from BLS the Census Bureau the BEA and all derived products The prices for some items may fail to fully reflect changes in the quality of the items. Improvements in quality if properly accounted for tend to boost measured real output. The split between consumer and business spending on some products may be updated infrequently which can lead to misstatements about which components of GDP are growing more rapidly. Both factors tend to result in less reliable estimates of real spending by consumers and businesses Housing and geographic samples for the consumer price index ( CPI ) become outdated as the population distribution shifts ( see Box ) Improving the Value of Existing Statistical Data Federal Government statistical agencies are focusing on three ways to improve the value of existing statistical data : Improve the detail in publicly available data products facilitate well-defined and secure research on the underlying microdata and synchronize data produced across agencies Government agencies strive to improve the usefulness of their data products by providing greater detail while protecting the confidentiality of respondents. The Census Bureau for example employs several techniques to avoid disclosing individually identifiable data. Synthetic data modeled on original data retain the needed statistical properties of the original data but protect the confidentiality of respondents by modifying all or selected variables. The Census Bureau creates synthetic data to obscure the underlying demographic data used in its On the Map feature. This feature creates maps showing | chapter8.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Box : How to Reverse a Decline in Statistical Infrastructure : Improving the Sample for the Consumer Price Index The housing and geographic area samples for the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) currently based on Decennial Census data are overdue for an update. Each year these samples become more out of date in that the samples do not reflect almost years of population growth demographic changes and new housing construction. Because of its widespread use to estimate price changes the accuracy of the CPI influences a range of economic variables in both the public and private sectors. For example within Federal programs the CPI is used to adjust Social Security payments civilian and military retirement payments and individual income tax brackets for inflation. A study by the Congressional Budget Office found that a percentage point reduction in the growth rate of CPI estimates beginning in January would have reduced the Federal budget deficit or surplus by $ billion by the end of and $ billion by The Administration has proposed to update the Decennial Census based housing sample used by the BLS with data from the Census Bureau s new continuously conducted American Community Survey ( ACS ) and/or private sector sources. With continuous updating the sample would never be more than years old. This change would increase the accuracy of the CPI by creating a more representative housing sample reduce respondent attrition and reduce potential bias by more accurately reflecting new construction. Moreover using the ACS to update the geographic sample on which the CPI is based would result in estimates that more accurately reflect the geographic distribution of the population and its characteristics commuting patterns and workforce data where people live and work by age earnings and industry for geographic areas selected by the user. Another method used is noise addition the controlled introduction of variation from reported levels to detailed data that otherwise could not be published with small compensating adjustments to other data in the same series. The Census Bureau uses this method to ensure that an individual company s data can not be readily inferred from published Survey of Business Owners data or other estimates Government statistical agencies benefit when researchers can subject the data and the methodology behind the statistics to academic scrutiny in a secure research environment that maintains security of the data restricts access to the level of data essential for an authorized project and protects the Chapter chapter8.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM confidentiality of respondents. The analysis of underlying data by academics is an inexpensive way for statistical agencies to improve their data products For example academic researchers typically investigate relationships among variables in a single survey or in several surveys that are not examined during routine data-processing procedures. Their nonstandardized data reviews can uncover anomalies that should be resolved before the data are released or provide the basis for future improvements in standardized data-processing routines. In addition this third-party scrutiny adds to the credibility of the data products. For example the Census Bureau s Research Data Centers ( RDCs ) provide secure restricted access to Census Bureau data for authorized researchers. Likewise the BLS researcher access program provides secure restricted access to BLS data. In both cases researchers must undergo a strict approval process and face significant penalties for violating the laws protecting the confidentiality of responses to government surveys Previous research at the RDCs has led to new data products and changed thinking about many important economic issues. For example an important strand of academic work separated net employment flows the published employment changes with which people are familiar into gross job creation and gross job destruction. The quarterly BLS Business Employment Dynamics data release which reports the number and rates of gross jobs gained at opening and expanding establishments as well as the number and rates of gross jobs lost at closing and contracting establishments is an example of a new data product that grew out of this work. Importantly the Business Employment Dynamics data release is tabulated from already collected company data records thus creating no additional respondent burden. It is an important example of drawing upon academic research to improve the use of existing data in order to create new data products A third way that the Government can improve the value of existing data and the method that offers the most substantial opportunities is to allow the BEA BLS and Census Bureau to link their business data while maintaining confidentiality. This linking would result in more accurate and reliable economic indicators lower budget costs for the agencies and lower response burdens for survey respondents. For example at present both the Census Bureau and the BLS ask firms to break out employment and payroll data by establishment in the Company Organization Survey and Multiple Worksite Report respectively. If these agencies could share their business data these two surveys which are mailed to multiunit companies could be combined reducing the response burden of these firms and reducing survey costs for the statistical agencies The Administration recognizes that the sharing of key business data among Federal statistical agencies has tremendous potential for exploiting synergies among the agencies and for improving the quality of Federal statistics. In with Administration support the Congress passed the Confidential | chapter8.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act ( CIPSEA ) described in Box whose stated purposes were : ) To protect the confidentiality of information collected by Federal agencies for statistical purposes and ) to improve the efficiency of the Federal statistical system by authorizing limited sharing of business data among the Census Bureau the BEA and the BLS for exclusively statistical purposes. In the Office of Management and Budget issued implementation guidance for CIPSEA. The first part data protection has been effectively implemented across agencies but the second part improving statistical efficiency can not be fully enabled without additional legislation. Because business tax data ( such as company name and address ) are used to construct the Census Bureau s business list many Census Bureau data products are considered to be comingled with tax information. Therefore full implementation of CIPSEA would require changes to the portion of the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) code that authorizes the statistical use of business tax data Box : The Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act ( CIPSEA ) The two parts of CIPSEA are confidential information protection and statistical efficiency Confidential information protection : Subtitle A establishes standardized safeguards to protect the confidentiality of data collected by Federal agencies for exclusively statistical purposes. These safeguards include the assurance that information will not be used against a respondent in any government action and that inappropriate disclosure of confidential data will be considered a felony and carry significant criminal penalties In other words data collected for statistical purposes can not be used for tax immigration or other enforcement purposes Statistical efficiency : Subtitle B authorizes the sharing of business data among the Census Bureau the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes in order to : Reduce the paperwork burdens imposed on businesses that provide requested information to the Federal Government ; Improve the comparability and accuracy of Federal economic statistics by allowing these agencies to reconcile differences in business lists ; to develop consistent classifications of businesses into industries ; and to improve coverage ; and Increase understanding of the U.S. economy ( including key industries and regions ) develop more accurate measures of the impact of technology on productivity growth and enhance the reliability of the Nation s most important economic indicators such as the National Income and Product Accounts Chapter chapter8.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM A major goal of fully implementing CIPSEA is to better reconcile the BLS Business Establishment List based on State unemployment insurance records and the Census Bureau s Business Register based in part on IRS records. One study found that over percent of single-establishment firms had different 6-digit NAICS industry codes in the two lists and another study revealed large discrepancies in measures of industry-level employment across surveys The failure to coordinate data across agencies can lead to noticeable inaccuracies especially when one needs to calculate a measure that combines data from two agencies. For example the implications of discrepancies in establishment classifications are particularly acute when measuring labor productivity which is an important statistic for economic policymakers including those who project the Federal budget. Labor productivity is the ratio of output measured by the Census Bureau and hours worked as measured by the BLS. Accurate productivity estimates depend upon these labor and hours worked measures being given consistent industry classifications which is unlikely if the underlying business lists are inconsistent Differences in industry classification would also result in discrepancies in the rate of real GDP growth reported by key sectors. For example in the Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing Subsector ( NAICS ) the growth in real value added in would have been percent if payroll data from the Census Bureau s Economic Census had been used Instead the growth in real value added was published as percent a statistic based on payroll data from the BLS. Without carefully analyzing the confidential business lists used for the Economic Census and the BLS payroll data it is difficult to know which payroll measure should be used Some efforts to share data have proven useful in reducing inconsistencies and reducing burden. The BLS has shared industry identifiers with the Census Bureau since and geographic identifiers since particularly for new and small businesses. These industry codes covered over million businesses in alone and now account for about percent of the Census Bureau s business codes. Expanding data sharing would extend this work and further improve consistency and accuracy of key data series A report noted that data sharing might highlight opportunities for understanding data reporting that would better focus resources on activities that would improve the measurement of national economic activity ( such as the reporting of stock options ) The National Income and Product Accounts provide two measures of national activity one based on total output ( GDP ) and one based on total income ( gross domestic income or GDI ) In theory these measures should be equal. In practice they differ by a measurement error called the statistical discrepancy. The statistical discrepancy can be persistent : From real GDI grew percentage point faster than real GDP on average per year. If the growth rate of the GDI were projected | chapter8.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM forward instead of the growth rate of GDP the budget implications could be substantial. An analysis of fiscal year by the Office of Management and Budget found that if the GDP were persistently understated by percent the projected cumulative budget deficit would be overstated by $ billion over a 5-year period Better measures of business formation are needed to understand the changing composition of the business sector and the factors that contribute to business and job creation. Data synchronization would help agencies track business formation more accurately and on a more timely basis by reconciling the business lists from the Census Bureau and the BLS. For example the Census Bureau s Business Register relies heavily on the Economic Censuses ( conducted every years ) for information on business structure. In the intervening years however the Census Bureau makes use of its annual Company Organization Survey which covers all employers with more than employees but only a sampling of smaller companies. The Census Bureau s Business Register generally does a good job identifying ownership links among establishments ( e.g. when a single firm owns establishments in two different States ) However the information on ownership is weaker for smaller firms because only a subset of these businesses is surveyed during the years between the 5-year censuses. Firm restructuring often contributes to the difficulty of tracking parent subsidiary relationships. The BLS Business Employment Dynamics accurately measures the universe of business openings and closings on a quarterly frequency but may not always successfully track parent subsidiary relationships. Combining the strengths of the Census and BLS business lists would improve the ability to discern whether a new establishment is an entirely new firm or a new branch of an existing firm and therefore improve understanding of business dynamics Data synchronization could also help reconcile differences between similar statistics produced by separate agencies. For example the BLS publishes wages and salary data based on its Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages business list and the Census Bureau publishes payroll data in its County Business Patterns series. A comparison of private wages and salaries revealed that these two measures differed by significant amounts For example the BLS measure of wages and salaries in New Mexico was percent higher than the Census Bureau measure while in Alaska the BLS measure was percent lower. At the national level BLS data were percent ( or $ billion ) lower than County Business Patterns data but they were percent ( or $ billion ) lower for New York. Understanding the sources of these differences ( such as differences in reporting and coverage ) may yield improved regional measures that would have several implications : Distribution of Federal funds to the States : BEA per capita personal income data based largely on BLS data are used in the formula that calculates how to distribute the Federal share of Medicaid funding to Chapter chapter8.indd | 2/5/08 : : PM States. Wages and salaries and wage-related components account for two-thirds of personal income. In State private wage levels based on BLS data were $ billion higher in Texas and $ billion lower in Washington than levels based on the Census Bureau s County Business Patterns State tax and budget planning : The dollar difference between BLS and Census measures of wage and salary growth from to would result in significantly different projections of State and local government income taxes received : a $ million discrepancy in New Jersey and a $ million discrepancy in Massachusetts. The $ billion wage growth difference in New York would yield a $ million discrepancy in projected State and local tax revenue Conclusion The quality of public policy debates depends in large part on the availability of relevant and reliable statistical data. Consistent data series ensure that newly gathered data can be meaningfully compared to previously collected data. At the same time it is also important that the statistical system maintain the flexibility to create new data products that keep up with the changing nature of the dynamic global economy. The infrastructure required to develop and produce these data like any infrastructure requires continuous investment to maintain and improve the system but not all data improvements are costly. For example existing economic data on businesses could be improved through the full implementation of the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act without increasing the reporting burden for respondents without compromising the confidentiality of the data collected by the Federal statistical agencies and without significantly raising costs of the data collection and tabulation. Maintaining solid statistical systems ensures that public policymakers and private decisionmakers will have access to the information needed to understand our dynamic economy | chapter8.indd Economic Report of the President 2/5/08 : : PM Appendix A REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS DURING LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL Council of Economic Advisers Washington D.C.
