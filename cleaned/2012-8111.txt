That s the promise of America The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do very well while a growing number of Americans barely get by or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules Long before the recession that began in December job growth was insufficient for our growing population. Manufacturing jobs were leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more efficient but also made some jobs obsolete. The few at the top saw their incomes rise like never before but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing paychecks that were not and personal debt that kept piling up In the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who could not afford them or did not understand them Banks had made huge bets and doled out big bonuses with other people s money. Regulators had looked the other way or did not have the authority to stop the bad behavior. It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work saddled us with more debt and left innocent hardworking Americans holding the bag In the year before I took office we lost nearly million private sector jobs. And we lost almost another million before our policies were in full effect Those are the facts. But so are these : In the last months businesses have created million jobs. Last year they created the most jobs since American manufacturers are hiring again creating jobs for the Economic Report of the President | first time since the late 1990s. And we have put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable so a crisis like this never happens again Some however still advocate going back to the same economic policies that stacked the deck against middle-class Americans for way too many years. And their philosophy is simple : We are better off when everybody is left to fend for themselves and play by their own rules That philosophy is wrong. The more Americans who succeed the more America succeeds. These are not Democratic values or Republican values. They are American values. And we have to reclaim them This is a make-or-break moment for the middle class and for all those who are working to get into the middle class. It is a moment when we can go back to the ways of the past to growing deficits stagnant incomes and job growth declining opportunity and rising inequality or we can make a break from the past. We can build an economy by restoring our greatest strengths : American manufacturing American energy skills for American workers and a renewal of American values an economy built to last When it comes to the deficit we have already agreed to more than $ trillion in cuts and savings. But we need to do more and that means making choices. Right now we are poised to spend nearly $ trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest percent of Americans. Right now because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households. I believe that tax reform should follow the Buffett Rule. If you make more than $ million a year you should not pay less than percent in taxes. In fact if you are earning a million dollars a year you should not get special tax subsidies or deductions. On the other hand if you make under $ a year like percent of American families do your taxes should not go up Americans know that this generation s success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other and to the future of their country. Now it is our turn. Now it falls to us to live up to that same sense of shared responsibility This year s Economic Report of the President prepared by the Council of Economic Advisers describes the emergency rescue measures taken to end the recession and support the ongoing recovery and lays out a blueprint for an economy built to last. It explains how we are restoring our strengths as a Nation our innovative economy our strong manufacturing base and our workers by investing in the technologies of the future in companies that create jobs here in America and in education | Economic Report of the President and training programs that will prepare our workers for the jobs of tomorrow. We must ensure that these investments benefit everyone and increase opportunity for all Americans or we risk threatening one of the features that defines us as a Nation that America is a country in which anyone can do well regardless of how they start out No one built this country on their own. This Nation is great because we built it together. If we remember that truth today join together in common purpose and maintain our common resolve then I am as confident as ever that our economic future is hopeful and strong the white house february Economic Report of the President | the annual report of the council of economic advisers letter of transmittal Council of Economic Advisers Washington D.C.

Contents | C H A P T E R TO RECOVER REBALANCE AND REBUILD T he problems that caused the deep recession that began at the end of and lasted until mid-2009 were a long time in the making and will not be solved overnight. But in the Nation continued to recover from the Great Recession and to make progress toward building a stronger foundation for more balanced and sustainable economic growth in the future The economy has expanded for straight quarters. As a result of this growth by the third quarter of the real gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the United States had surpassed its peak level at the start of the recession. Sustaining and strengthening the ongoing recovery remains a top priority for the Obama Administration while seeking to address the fundamental imbalances and other problems that had built up for decades and erupted with the financial and economic crisis in The pace of the recovery has not been faster because of the severity of the financial and economic crisis and the unique nature of the problems that led to the crisis in the first place. These problems included excess borrowing in the run-up to the financial crisis that subsequently caused massive deleveraging by households a massive loss of wealth during the financial crisis that continues to constrain consumption and excess residential home building during the housing boom that continues to cause weakness in residential construction and the housing sector Fundamentally many of the problems that have plagued the economy in the past decade can be traced to weak income growth for middle-class workers. This can be seen in Figure which displays the median household s income each year after adjusting for inflation. Income growth was stagnant for middle-income earners in the period and as is common declined in the recessions at the end and beginning of the decade Had income grown at the same average annual rate in the first decade of the 2000s as it did in the 1990s middle-income households would have greatly improved their financial situation Figure Median Household Income Dollars ( ) Projection if median household income had grown during the 2000s at the same rate as it did during the 1990s Actual Note : Shading denotes recession Source : CEA calculations and Census Bureau A related phenomenon is that the size of the middle class has shrunk This disturbing trend has taken place over several decades. While those at the top of the income distribution have seen strong income growth many in the middle and at the bottom have struggled. Many economists have argued that when confronted with easy credit and nontransparent terms many families borrowed at an unsustainable rate to make up for the weak income growth they experienced in the 2000s. Strengthening and expanding the middle class and adequately reforming the financial sector are therefore at the root of the Obama Administration s strategy to reestablish an economy that is built to last In addition to lingering effects of the financial crisis and the longstanding problem of weak income growth for the middle class the recovery in faced additional shocks from natural disasters in Asia unrest in the Middle East that caused oil prices to spike self-inflicted wounds to confidence from the contentious debt ceiling debate over the summer and stress in European debt markets. Despite these encumbrances and with the support in part of measures the President signed into law in December including the payroll tax cut the extension of unemployment insurance and percent business expensing private-sector employment has increased for straight months and the unemployment rate fell from a high of percent in October to percent in January Over the course of | Chapter the unemployment rate fell by percentage points the largest drop in any year since Most of that decline occurred in the last three months of The sharp drop in unemployment toward the end of took economic forecasters by surprise because unemployment was projected to remain in the high-8-percent range by many forecasters including the Council of Economic Advisers ( CEA ) As part of the Budget process the CEA together with the Office of Management and Budget and Treasury officials made its forecast of economic outcomes in mid-November Since that forecast was locked down the reported unemployment rate has now fallen by percentage points and the advance estimate of GDP growth for the fourth quarter of exceeded what most forecasters had expected in November. In view of the new information the consensus of Blue Chip forecasters lowered its forecast of the unemployment rate for the end of by about percentage point to percent. The more optimistic private forecasters expect the rate to be below percent at the end of the year. In Chapter the Report illustrates the latest forecasting range for the unemployment rate. One of the reasons for the range of forecasting uncertainty is that it is unclear how many of the President s job creation initiatives Congress will enact in the coming year. Respected private forecasters have estimated that a continuation of the percentage point payroll tax cut and extended unemployment insurance benefits through the remainder of could significantly boost economic growth and job creation The Administration s economic strategy continues to be to : ) pursue avenues to raise demand for U.S. goods and services in the short run to support the ongoing recovery and put more people back to work ; ) develop credible policies to return to a fiscally sustainable path in the intermediate and long term ; and ) invest in education innovation research domestic energy and infrastructure in order to build a stronger foundation for future economic growth and an expanding middle class. Put simply the Nation needs to recover rebalance and rebuild. As described in this Report in many instances when Congress has not acted the President has taken steps to implement this agenda Recovering from the Great Recession When President Obama took office on January the U.S economy was contracting at an alarming rate and employment was falling by more than jobs a month. The plunge in economic activity was even deeper than the Bureau of Economic Analysis initially reported : revised estimates showed that the economy contracted at an percent annualized To Recover Rebalance and Rebuild | Data Watch : Innovation in Measurement Economic statistics are central to understanding how the economy is working whether consumer spending is growing or shrinking the extent to which businesses are investing in equipment and software the number of people currently employed and the wages they are earning among many other examples. This year s Economic Report of the President highlights the role that accurate and timely economic measurement plays in supporting sound economic decisions by policymakers businesses and families. In a series of Data Watch boxes the Report offers examples of recently developed data series that shed light on economic performance significant gaps in available economic data and opportunities for improvements in the Nation s economic measures The growing integration of technology in our daily lives has created an abundance of new possibilities for producing better and more timely data based on nontraditional sources of information. As Census Bureau Director Robert Groves has written ( t ) he volume of data generated outside the government statistical systems is increasing much faster than the volume of data collected by the statistical systems ; almost all of these data are digitized in electronic files ( Groves ) Nontraditional sources of information include both digital administrative data ( e.g. tax records and records related to participation in government transfer programs ) and records generated in the private sector ( e.g. data from Internet searches scanner data and social media data ) There is a long history of using administrative records to produce economic statistics under strict standards of confidentiality. The Obama Administration has endeavored to create new databases that track student performance across different stages of education as well as the performance of postsecondary educational institutions. Once these databases have been developed analyses of the outcomes achieved by students with different educational experiences will help to guide improvements in instructional quality and college choice Innovative statistics based on electronic records compiled as a byproduct of commercial activity also can be informative. Adding series based on Google Trends to economic forecasting models for example can improve those models predictive power. The number of search queries for a particular make of automobiles in the last two weeks of a month for instance turns out to be a good predictor of sales of that car and the number of searches for real estate agencies is one of the best predictors of current home sales ( Choi and Varian ) Unlike government survey data data based on electronic records generated for commercial or administrative purposes may not be nationally representative and expanding access to these records even | Chapter for purely statistical purposes can pose privacy concerns that must be addressed. But their use also has the potential to improve and enrich existing official statistics. The Bureau of Economic Analysis for example plans to use credit card data to improve its statistics on international travel services. The Census Bureau is exploring the use of administrative data on receipt of government benefits to improve estimates of income in its household surveys. Other uses of both commercial and administrative data to improve official statistics can easily be imagined Government statistical agencies can play a vital role in this burgeoning field by providing survey data to improve the representativeness of nonsurvey data and the Federal statistical agencies can improve their measures by integrating private-sector information. Progress in this area will ultimately lead to better informed decisions by policymakers businesses and families rate in the last quarter of from the initial advanced estimate of percent the largest quarterly downward revision in history. The Administration immediately took bold steps to turn around an economy in free fall. It worked to stem the job losses and put people back to work through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of ( the Recovery Act ) and it shored up the banking system and stabilized the financial sector through a series of measures including stress tests for banks and rigorous requirements for banks to raise private capital and repay the government for funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program and it rescued the American auto industry Soon after the Recovery Act was passed the contraction of GDP slowed markedly to percent in the second quarter of from percent in the preceding quarter. Economic growth turned positive in the third quarter of and the economy has grown at an annualized growth rate of percent over the past quarters The economy is continuing to recover from the most severe downturn since the Great Depression. Despite numerous adverse headwinds both domestic and international that threatened the recovery the U.S. economy displayed notable resilience in Private nonfarm employment growth shown in Figure averaged jobs per month in and jobs per month over the past three months ( ending in January ) Private employers added more than million jobs in the most in any year since At $ trillion dollars real GDP now exceeds its pre-recession peak. Clearly this improvement since the end of the recession represents real progress. Nevertheless given the depth and severity of the Great Recession To Recover Rebalance and Rebuild | Data Watch : Revisions to Estimates of the Gross Domestic Product The gross domestic product ( GDP ) is a summary measure of the Nation s economic activity constructed as the sum of personal consumption gross private investment net exports and government expenditures. The first estimate of GDP appears within a month after the end of the quarter to which it applies and is based in part on source data that are preliminary and incomplete. More complete data are available for the second estimate published the following month and the third estimate released the month after that ; each of these revisions incorporates new or revised information from private and public sources including monthly and quarterly Census Bureau surveys Annual revisions to the National Income and Product Accounts allow the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) to catch up in an organized way with further revisions to the source data used to compute GDP and to incorporate additional data available only at yearly frequencies About every five years a benchmark revision incorporates data from the Economic Censuses ( Landefeld Seskin and Fraumeni ) Between and revisions in the annualized growth rate of real quarterly GDP between the first and latest available estimate averaged percentage points in absolute value ( Fixler GreenawayMcGrevy and Grimm ) A dramatic example is provided by the revisions to the GDP growth rate for the fourth quarter of which was originally reported as percent and later revised down to percent in the annual revision released in July This was the largest downward revision to the quarterly data ever reported. Taken as a whole the revised data for and indicated that the recent recession was considerably more severe than originally reported While revisions to initial GDP estimates for the United States can be substantial they are smaller than the average for other large developed economies ( see for example Faust Rogers and Wright ) And despite sometimes sizable revisions early estimates of quarterly GDP growth generally do a good job of capturing increases or decreases in growth rates as well as the timing of cyclical peaks and troughs ( Fixler and Grimm ) Further research has found that there is only limited potential to improve the initial GDP estimates given the contemporaneous information available to the BEA ( Dynan and Elmendorf ; McKenzie Tosetto and Fixler ) Still more accurate early estimates of GDP would be helpful to policymakers and businesses. Improving the quality and timeliness of the source data available to the BEA is the best way to accomplish this objective | Chapter stronger economic growth and faster job gains are needed to make full use of the Nation s human and physical resources On the whole the pace of real GDP growth so far during this recovery has been almost as fast as was the case at a similar stage of the recoveries following the and recessions which is noteworthy progress given that the earlier recoveries received a strong boost from residential home building and State and local government spending. Because of the excess home and office construction during the housing bubble construction of structures has been notably weak so far in this recovery. In addition once Recovery Act funds began to phase out State and local governments cut spending and laid off workers at a faster pace. Both of these developments are unprecedented headwinds that were not present during other postwar recoveries As has been the pattern in recent recoveries job growth has lagged a resumption of economic growth. Job growth started in February months after the official conclusion of the recession versus months after the end of the recession and months after the end of the recession. From February through January ( months through after the official end of the recession ) private-sector employers added a net total of million jobs. Over the comparable period of the recovery from the recession businesses added million jobs ( from November to October ) and over the comparable period of the Figure Change in Nonfarm Payrolls Thousands seasonally adjusted Jan-12 Total ( excluding Census hiring ) Private Jan-07 Jan-08 Jan-09 Jan-10 Jan-11 Jan-12 Note : Shading denotes recession Source : Bureau of Labor Statistics To Recover Rebalance and Rebuild | Figure Unemployment Rate Increases in Recessions Associated with Financial Crises Percentage point increase from business-cycle peak Malaysia ( : Q4 ) Thailand ( : Q3 ) Japan ( : Q1 ) Philippines ( : Q1 ) Norway ( : Q1 ) U.S. ( : Q4 ) Colombia ( : Q2 ) Argentina ( : Q2 ) Hong Kong ( : Q3 ) South Korea ( : Q3 ) Indonesia ( : Q4 ) Average Sweden ( : Q1 ) Spain ( : Q2 ) Finland ( : Q1 ) U.S. ( : Q3 ) Note : Financial crises are from recessions identified by Reinhart and Rogoff ( ) as associated with major systemic financial crises. Each data point represents the increase from the business-cycle peak to the subsequent peak in the unemployment rate U.S. business-cycle peaks are defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research and the business-cycle peaks of other countries refer to the peaks of real GDP. Unemployment rates for Argentina Colombia Indonesia Malaysia and Thailand are based on annual data. " Average " excludes the U.S. recession Source : Reinhart and Rogoff ( ) ; National Bureau of Economic Research ; International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook and International Financial Statistics ; Moore ( ) ; national sources ; CEA calculations recovery from the recession businesses added million jobs ( July to June ) The catastrophic financial crisis that exacerbated the economic downturn during the second half of is an important reason why the pace of the recovery has not been stronger. As discussed in Chapter previous research finds that recessions associated with financial crises not only tend to be deeper than other types of economic downturns but also longer lasting. Yet as bad as the Great Recession was the United States appears to have fared relatively better than other countries that have experienced severe financial crises in large part because of the emergency actions that were taken to strengthen the economy and stabilize the financial system. In a group of countries identified by the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff as having experienced severe financial crises these crises were followed by a real GDP decline of more than percent on average. In contrast U.S. output decreased by substantially less. In addition from each country s business cycle peak to their subsequent peak unemployment rate the unemployment rate across these countries increased by an average of percentage points as a result of their financial crises ( Figure ) Figure shows the average increase in the unemployment rate across financial crisis recessions regardless of how many quarters it took the unemployment rate to reach its peak. Figure in contrast shows the average rise in the unemployment rate in each quarter elapsed from the beginning of each recession | Chapter Although still a large increase relative to previous postwar recessions the U.S. unemployment rate rose by percentage points from the last quarter of to the fourth quarter of about points less than the average country s experience The financial crisis was precipitated largely by lax credit standards inadequate oversight excessive debt and a boom-and-bust cycle in housing prices which led to unsustainable expansions in residential construction and consumer spending. Chapter highlights the challenges that remain in the housing market deriving primarily from institutional frictions and explains the Administration s initiatives for addressing many of the interlinked housing market problems Rebalancing at Home and Abroad Once economic recovery began in mid-2009 the Obama Administration took steps to restore balance to the U.S. economy to help prevent the sorts of excesses that led to the financial crisis that erupted in In June the President presented his proposals for Wall Street reform. Those proposals began a process that culminated at the end of July with President Obama signing the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of Progress is being made on rebalancing the sources of economic growth as well. Business investment has begun to rebound. The mix of business investment has shifted from residential and structures toward equipment and software the types of investments that expand capacity help workers become more productive and build a foundation for sustainable growth. Exports as a share of GDP have also grown by percent since the end of the recession. The growth in exports puts the United States on track to meet the President s goal of doubling exports by the end of More rebalancing is needed and the adjustment process may continue to cause headwinds for the recovery. As Chapter details government balance sheets need to shift by both cutting unnecessary spending and raising revenue to continue needed investments in the future. In September President Obama submitted a balanced plan to the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction that would have reduced the deficit by $ trillion over years with a mix of spending cuts and additional revenue and the President remains committed to pursuing a balanced approach to put America on a sustainable fiscal path Finally rebalancing in the economy is required so that the gains of economic growth provide more opportunity for the middle class and those struggling to get into the middle class. One step in this direction is provided To Recover Rebalance and Rebuild | by the landmark Affordable Care Act which will provide premium assistance tax credits for those without access to affordable health insurance to obtain coverage. The new law will also begin to lower the rate of health care cost growth. Additionally improvements in K education and greater access to postsecondary education will provide more opportunity for middle-class families and those struggling to get into the middle class Restoring Fiscal Responsibility In the late 1990s the Federal Government was generating budget surpluses both annually and throughout the 10-year budget window as well as actually paying down the national debt. Since Federal debt has been growing unsustainably primarily as a result of the and tax cuts that were skewed toward the wealthiest increased military operations the unfunded Medicare prescription drug benefit and slow job and economic growth. Although safety net stabilizers and job creation measures in the short term are important to keep the recovery gaining momentum the longterm Federal debt must be reduced Chapter details how Federal debt shifted sharply from a downward to an upward path to reach today s unsustainable heights and what the options are for reducing the long-term debt. Recognizing the economic risks associated with increased budget deficits the Administration and Congress agreed on a $ trillion deficit reduction package in the Budget Control Act of with an additional $ trillion to $ trillion in further reductions scheduled to follow. In his Fiscal Year Budget the President has proposed a balanced approach that recognizes the need to prioritize spending initiatives while aligning revenues with current spending Rebuilding a Stronger Economy President Obama has emphasized that the United States can outeducate out-innovate and out-build the rest of the world. Accomplishing this goal will require a Federal Government that lives within its means and makes targeted cuts to government spending while maintaining essential safety net services. But it will also require continuing to invest in the Nation s future training and educating workers ; increasing the commitment to research and technology ; and building new roads and bridges highspeed rail and high-speed Internet. In cities and towns throughout America the benefits of these investments are clear Investments in education innovation clean energy and infrastructure are an essential down payment on the future. These investments today will be the foundation of long-term output and employment growth in the | Chapter future robust wage growth for all Americans and improvements in the quality of life. As emphasized the Nation can afford these investments only by getting its fiscal house in order. The Federal Government has to live within its means to make room for things it absolutely needs without jeopardizing essential safety net programs or the ability to make investments for the future. That is why President Obama urged Congress to find common ground so that government policies can with the private sector accelerate not impede economic growth and sharpen America s competitive edge in the world Measured GDP growth is not the only contributor to the quality of life that Americans seek to enjoy. Government investments as well as regulatory policies can improve well-being by correcting market failures and protecting safety health and environmental quality. In fashioning long-term policies the Nation should not overlook those factors that contribute to well-being even if they are not fully captured in economic statistics Jobs and Income : Today and Tomorrow Problems that were building in the labor market for well over a decade were amplified by the Great Recession. Chapter explains where the labor market is today and distinguishes between the effects of the recession and longer-term trends in employment and income that predated the recession The goals of current policies are twofold : to increase job growth in the near term and to prepare Americans of all ages for the jobs of the future. The chapter discusses the President s job creation proposals and the key role they can play in supporting job growth in the near term One notable long-term trend that can be stopped is the sharp decline in manufacturing jobs. From to the economy lost nearly million manufacturing jobs as these positions migrated overseas. Another million manufacturing jobs were lost during the recession. Thanks in part to the President s efforts to rescue the American auto industry manufacturing companies have been adding jobs for the first time since the late 1990s On net manufacturing jobs have been added in the past two years The auto industry was central to the rebound in manufacturing : although the auto industry accounts for only percent of industrial production it is responsible for percent of the increase in industrial production since the end of the recession As discussed in Chapter and Chapter a number of companies have indicated that they are bringing jobs back to the United States because of the Nation s high productivity and growing cost advantages. The President has laid out a bold agenda to support this trend and to encourage more manufacturing production at home To Recover Rebalance and Rebuild | Investments in education will build on America s highly productive workforce and are essential to prepare today s children for the jobs of tomorrow. Increasing educational attainment for low-income children would substantially improve their chances of moving up the rungs of the ladder of opportunity. As shown in Figure the average earnings of college-educated workers has risen to a level twice as high as that of workers with only a high school diploma. And the unemployment rate of college graduates is about half of the national average. Yet while the benefits of education have grown the growth in the relative share of college-educated American workers has slowed since ( Goldin and Katz ) In the last few years however there has been an increase in school enrollment and the President has set a goal for the United States to have the highest share of to 34-year-olds with a college degree of any country by Chapter lays out the strides the Obama Administration has made in bettering the education system at every level making higher education more affordable and improving job training programs Making sure American workers have the right set of skills is also critical for a revival of manufacturing jobs and jobs in other high-paying sectors The United States has a comparative advantage in high-technology innovative sectors but jobs in such sectors require a highly skilled workforce. As technology changes advanced manufacturing products can become an even more important segment of the U.S. economy. Cars for example are now a highly advanced product : fully percent of the value of many automobiles is derived from computer software electronic components and intellectual property according to industry estimates. Thus the President s education and job training strategy is a necessary complement to proposals to strengthen the manufacturing sector Preserving and Modernizing the Safety Net The recession highlighted the need for a strong safety net as millions of Americans through no fault of their own lost their jobs and saw their savings decline. In addition to cushioning the shock of income loss safety net programs are important for long-term growth because they help maintain consumer demand in a downturn and make it easier for entrepreneurs to take risks knowing that if they fail they will have access to a minimum level of support As the economy has undergone major changes the safety net has not always adapted with it. Chapter describes this changing landscape and the steps the Administration has taken to modernize the safety net for a more dynamic economy and more mobile workforce. The President has already reformed health care to give millions more Americans access to care and to | Chapter Figure Earnings Ratio : College Degree or More to High School Degree Ratio Source : CEA calculations using March Current Population Survey data for workers aged who worked at least hours a week and for at least weeks in the calendar year Before education groups are defined based on the highest grade of school or year of college completed.

He has also called for the largest changes to the unemployment insurance program in years and proposes to improve retirement preparedness by broadening the reach of individual retirement accounts simplifying financial decisions for retirement savers and retirees and promoting financial literacy Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment Rebuilding the American economy entails investments in the foundations of economic growth education infrastructure and research and development. Government investments in innovation and infrastructure and smart government regulations improve the quality of life and help the economy to operate more efficiently The President has reduced burdensome regulations where possible but smart regulations have also enabled Americans to live longer healthier and more productive lives. As discussed in Chapter the Obama Administration has made significant reforms to the regulatory system to To Recover Rebalance and Rebuild | better measure relevant costs and benefits and to establish a review process that will result in continual improvement of the regulatory architecture A focus on quality of life also emphasizes public investments in innovation and infrastructure. Technological breakthroughs improve the quality of life in ways that are not fully captured by measures of economic activity Cellular telephones for example generate large increases in convenience that benefit consumers without being fully captured in measures of GDP Similarly investments in infrastructure improve productivity but also have other even larger benefits. A strong infrastructure system for example facilitates shorter commuting times increasing leisure time and improving well-being Ensuring that America has abundant clean energy to power the economy of the future is also a prerequisite for raising the quality of life and enhancing the Nation s security. Early in President Obama noted that The United States of America can not afford to bet our long-term prosperity and security on a resource that will eventually run out. The Administration laid out a Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future a comprehensive strategy that focuses on three key areas : developing and securing America s energy supplies including oil and natural gas ; providing consumers with choices to reduce costs and save energy ; and innovating our way to a clean energy future. This past year has seen remarkable progress toward reaching many of these energy goals. In domestic oil production was the highest it has been in the past eight years and natural gas production reached an all-time high. At the same time the Administration has advanced common-sense new standards to ensure the safe and responsible development of these resources Conclusion The U.S. economy has been expanding for two and a half years but the pace of economic growth and job growth has not been fast enough given the deep hole that was created by the sharp recession that started at the end of The economic challenges that the United States faces are the direct result of problems that took years to build up and that came to a boil in the financial and economic crisis of While actions taken to prevent a deeper recession and to strengthen the recovery have made a difference the Nation is still recovering from that profound crisis and the problems that led to it. Because household income for vast swaths of the middle class had stagnated many families borrowed to support their consumption and to buy houses that later fell in value. Families are now paying down debt which is restraining consumption and economic growth. Meanwhile because of the | Chapter collapse of the housing boom builders have been reluctant to build new homes and construction workers had a percent unemployment rate in And the government budget moved from surplus and debt reduction at the end of the 1990s to deficit and increasing debt in the early 2000s as the priorities in Washington at that time shifted to increased spending to prosecute two wars while cutting taxes in a skewed and inefficient way These are the Nation s principal economic challenges not uncertainty about economic policies taxes or regulations. To economists the solution to these problems is clear : the Nation needs to raise demand for its goods and services in the short run to strengthen and sustain the economic recovery and put more people back to work while pursuing credible policies to return to a fiscally sustainable path in the intermediate and long term and investing more in education innovation clean domestic energy research and development and infrastructure to raise long-run growth and expand the middle class To Recover Rebalance and Rebuild | C H A P T E R THE YEAR IN REVIEW AND THE YEARS AHEAD T he U.S. economy continued to recover in from the deep recession that began at the end of The real value of goods and services produced in the economy as measured by gross domestic product adjusted for changes in prices ( real GDP ) has now grown in each of the past quarters In the third quarter of real output surpassed the level last reached at the business-cycle peak in the fourth quarter of Employment continued to expand in and the private sector created more than million new jobs in and about in line with the recovery from the recession and faster than the recovery from the recession However the level of unemployment remains too high and the pace of the recovery in output and employment would in all likelihood be faster if it were not for the lingering effects of the financial crisis. The destruction of household wealth during the financial crisis and the deep recession that followed appears to have restrained the growth of consumption during the recovery particularly in services. Investment in new residential construction also remains much weaker than in typical recoveries a reflection of soft demand since the recession as well as the vast amount of overbuilding of houses during the years leading up to the crisis. Growth in other components of demand such as business investment and exports has followed trajectories more typical of business-cycle recoveries and in some cases has been even stronger than average To put the current U.S. recovery in historical and international context this chapter presents an overview of the influential work by Charles Kindleberger ( ) and Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff ( ) who argue that recessions associated with financial crises are typically deeper than normal downturns and that the recoveries that follow tend to take longer. As severe as the recession was the drop in U.S. real GDP after the financial crisis of was smaller than the average decline in recessions associated with other severe systemic financial crises in various countries over the past years. Similarly the rise in U.S. unemployment was less extreme than the average experience following these financial crises and it peaked earlier. As of January the unemployment rate has fallen by percentage points since peaking in October This chapter also reviews the developments of for individual sectors of the U.S. economy. In the household sector credit conditions continued to improve and purchases of durable goods such as motor vehicles rose at a robust pace. Households continued to work down debt in As noted growth in consumption remained somewhat restrained however as households continued to pay down debt and growth in nominal income slowed. In the business sector investment in equipment and software posted solid gains in and global demand for U.S. goods and services was strong. The growth in U.S. exports supported job creation in as well as the continued expansion of manufacturing output. Conditions in residential real estate markets continued to stabilize in with a modest uptick toward the end of the year but demand for new housing remained weak. Spending by State and local governments was also severely restrained in by tight budgets. Much of the weakness in these areas can be tied directly to the financial crisis and the problems that precipitated the crisis An Economy in Recovery : Key Events of Real GDP rose percent over the four quarters of after having risen percent in Output expanded at an annual rate of only percent in the first half of the year when a series of shocks among them a sharp rise in the price of oil due to turmoil in the Middle East appeared to reduce consumer and business sentiment and dampen economic activity. As the effects of the transitory shocks waned in the second half of the year real GDP growth picked up to an average annual rate of percent ( Figure ) Nonfarm private payroll employment expanded by million jobs during the twelve months of having added million jobs in the last months of The recovery in payroll employment like that in real output was uneven over the months of Payrolls expanded moderately near the beginning of the year but job creation slowed in the spring and summer before picking up again in the fall. The unemployment rate fell over the course of the year from percent in December to percent in December and then to percent in January A Series of Global Shocks and Revised GDP Data. A succession of global shocks turned into a turbulent year for the U.S. economy. The collapse of Libyan crude oil production during that nation s revolution caused world oil markets to tighten near the beginning of the year. The price | Chapter Figure Real GDP Growth by Quarter Percent change ( annual rate ) : Q4 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 Note : Shaded area represents recession Source : Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts refiners paid for crude oil rose from an average of $ a barrel in the second half of to $ a barrel in the first half of The $ per-barrel increase led to higher gasoline prices eroded the real purchasing power of disposable personal income by more than $ billion at an annual rate and dampened consumer confidence. Consumers appear to have reacted with a combination of reduced spending on other goods and services and a lower saving rate than might otherwise have been the case. The percentage point cut in the payroll tax for workers that President Obama proposed and the Congress passed near the end of helped offset the impact of higher oil prices Another supply shock hit the world economy in March when an earthquake struck northeastern Japan and set off a tsunami a disaster that resulted in a devastating human toll and required a massive rebuilding effort. Economic activity across the globe slowed because damage to Japan s electrical grid disrupted industrial output throughout the country. As a result global supply chains in some industries faced shortages of key parts In the United States vehicle assembly plants were forced to cut production when supplies of critical parts produced in Japan became scarce. U.S. motor vehicle production fell percent at an annual rate in the second quarter before rebounding in the third and fourth quarters In the summer concerns mounted over sovereign debts and financial institutions in Europe and the likelihood of a global slowdown in economic The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | growth. In addition the contentious debate in Congress over raising the statutory debt ceiling kept financial markets on edge and appeared to weigh on equity markets over the summer and fall In addition revised estimates of U.S. real GDP released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) in July revealed that the recession was more severe than had been originally reported. Real GDP fell at an average annual rate of percent in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of the sharpest two-quarter contraction since quarterly GDP data began being collected in The change to the estimate for the fourth quarter of was particularly stark. The BEA originally estimated that output contracted at an annual rate of percent that quarter but its July revised estimate showed an percent rate of contraction. The downward change of percentage points was the largest downward adjustment to the quarterly data ever reported. The BEA also revised down the average annual rate of growth during the recovery ( from the second quarter of through the first quarter of ) by percentage point to percent Policy Developments in late and Supportive policies enacted near the end of the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act ( TRUIRJCA ) cushioned the adverse shocks experienced in Provisions in the legislation included a percentage point reduction in workers payroll taxes and a continuation of the extended and emergency unemployment benefit programs through the end of In the absence of this legislation real GDP growth over the four quarters of would have been lower by to percentage points according to the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO 2011b ) Because the legislative package was constructed to be temporary ( including mostly one- and two-year provisions ) it had little effect on the long-term deficit The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( Recovery Act ) enacted in early when real GDP was contracting at an annual rate of more than percent and employment was falling by more than jobs a month also continued to support the level of real GDP in although its effect which had been designed to be strongest during and was gradually declining. In Recovery Act related outlays obligations and tax cuts totaled $ billion down from $ billion a year earlier as measured in the National Income and Product Accounts. The Council of Economic Advisers ( CEA ) estimates that the Recovery Act increased GDP as of the second quarter of relative to what it otherwise would have been by to percent and raised employment by between million and million jobs. The CBO and outside analysts have also presented estimates in this range | Chapter In the Administration proposed additional steps to strengthen and sustain the economic recovery in the wake of world events that posed increasing risks to growth. Before a joint session of Congress on September the President proposed the American Jobs Act to strengthen the current recovery and spur the creation of new jobs. The American Jobs Act incorporated a number of proposals that some independent economists estimated could have boosted payrolls by million to million jobs by the end of ( for example Macroeconomic Advisers ) Equally important the American Jobs Act would not have added to the long-term Federal Budget deficit. The CBO ( 2011a ) estimated that revenue raisers recommended by the President in September would have more than offset the cost of the proposed tax cuts and investments. Specifically the bill proposed limiting deductions and exclusions for upper-income taxpayers taxing carried interest earned on private equity and hedge fund investments at the same rate as ordinary income and eliminating certain tax provisions for oil and gas production companies The full American Jobs Act did not pass Congress in the form that the President proposed. Nevertheless the President kept pressing for measures to support economic growth and job creation and will keep doing so until every American looking for work can get a job. In November the President won enactment of one element of the American Jobs Act : a new tax credit for America s veterans that provides up to $ to businesses that hire veterans who have been unemployed for more than weeks and $ for businesses that hire a veteran with a service-related disability And in the waning days of the President signed into law a 2-month extension of the percentage point reduction in workers payroll taxes and of the emergency and extended unemployment insurance programs. Those initiatives were mostly paid for by an increase in guarantee fees charged to lenders by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The President has called on Congress to extend these policies for the entire calendar year. The extension of the payroll tax cut for the rest of would help approximately million full-time and part-time workers and provide a typical worker with an additional $ in each bi-weekly paycheck. The full-year extension of unemployment insurance programs would prevent million unemployed workers from exhausting benefits this year and help support the equivalent of about cumulative job-years of employment by the end of as these benefits are spent Policy actions by the Federal Reserve also supported the recovery in Monetary policy remained accommodative throughout the year with the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) maintaining a target range for the federal funds rate of to percent. During the first half The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | of the year the FOMC continued to advise that economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period. In June the Federal Reserve completed the program first announced in November under which it purchased $ billion of longer-term Treasury securities and the FOMC maintained its policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of debt and mortgagebacked securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac The FOMC took steps in the second half of and in the early part of to further ease conditions in financial markets and to provide additional support to the recovery. In the statement released following its August meeting the FOMC said that it expected economic conditions to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013. In January the committee extended this period until at least late-2014. The committee voted at its September meeting to extend the average maturity of the Federal Reserve s holdings of Treasury securities in order to lower longer-term interest rates. In response to the escalation of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe the FOMC approved an extension of the temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements with a number of foreign central banks in June and again in November.1 An Economy in Recovery : The Lingering Effects of Financial Crises The financial crisis and the drop in economic activity during the recession were unprecedented. In the two and a half years that have elapsed since the official end of the recession real U.S. GDP has risen percent enough to recoup the percent loss of real output recorded during the recession. The pace of GDP growth during the recovery has been almost the same as the rates of growth observed during the recoveries that followed the and recessions ( Figure ) although private employment has grown at a faster pace than in the recession A major reason that the rate of real GDP growth has not been faster during the current recovery involves the lingering effects of the financial crisis. As argued by Kindleberger ( ) and Reinhart and Rogoff ( ) recessions linked with financial crises tend to be deeper than other recessions and the subsequent recoveries take longer. Hall ( ) and Woodford ( ) argue that recessions around financial crises are worse in part The Federal Reserve receives collateral in the form of foreign currency during the life of the transaction. The exchange rate used for the transaction is based on the market exchange rate at the time of the transaction. The swap is unwound at the same exchange rate so the Fed is not exposed to any currency risk resulting from the transaction | Chapter Figure Real GDP During Recoveries Indexed to at NBER-defined trough Current ( : Q2 trough ) Trough Quarters from trough Source : Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts ; National Bureau of Economic Research ; CEA calculations because the critical intermediation role played by the financial sector is disrupted. Financial crises also tend to spread across countries temporarily reducing the volume of world trade and restraining growth of output during the recovery as noted by Reinhart and Rogoff ( ) and IMF ( ) Housing slumps are also typically associated with slower growth during recoveries ( Howard Martin and Wilson ) Some sectors of the U.S. economy are recovering at a moderate pace while growth in other sectors continues to be restrained by the lingering effects of the financial crisis. In the current recovery real U.S. exports have risen at a robust pace and have exceeded their average rate of growth in the preceding eight recoveries. Business fixed investment has been about as strong in the current recovery as in the average U.S. recovery. Real residential investment in contrast had barely returned to its level at the business-cycle trough by the very end of whereas this type of investment in a typical U.S. recovery would have increased roughly percent over a comparable period. In addition real expenditures by State and local governments have continued to decline on balance during the current recovery instead of rising as they had in every other postwar recovery Personal consumption expenditures have risen more slowly in the current recovery than in the average U.S. recovery. The slower recovery in consumer spending may partly reflect the sharp losses in household net worth caused by the financial crisis and the high levels of consumer The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | debt including mortgage debt taken on during the period leading up to the financial crisis. After the collapse in house prices destroyed large amounts of household net worth households have reduced their consumption as they work down debt taken on before the crisis To put the U.S. recession in international and historical contexts Figure compares the depth and duration of the recession in the United States with recessions including the downturn in the United States a group of recessions categorized by Reinhart and Rogoff ( ) as occurring near major systemic banking crises.2 The horizontal bars on the left of the figure refer to the decline in real output measured in each of the recessions and the bars on the right report the length of each recession measured as the number of quarters between the peak and trough of real output While the drop in real U.S. GDP reached as high as percent at an annual rate in the last quarter of the figure shows that the cumulative decline in GDP was percent during the recession. This was the biggest drop in U.S. output during any business-cycle contraction since the Great Depression although it was less drastic than the declines in output experienced in most other financial crises and well below the average decline of percent. The duration of the recent U.S. downturn which measured six quarters was about percent shorter than the average. The breadth and speed of the emergency economic recovery measures that were put in place to address the financial and economic crisis including the Recovery Act and Financial Stability Plan as well as extraordinary actions by the Federal Reserve Board are the main reasons why the economy avoided a steeper and more prolonged decline with growth returning by the middle of Figure compares the rise in the unemployment rate in the United States between the fourth quarter of and January with the average rise in unemployment following the business-cycle peaks for the financial crises shown in Figure Between the fourth quarter of and the fourth quarter of the U.S. unemployment rate rose more sharply than the average cumulative rise over the first quarters after these business-cycle peaks but then it peaked and declined over the next two years an outcome less severe than the average rise in unemployment around other financial crises. If the United States had followed the path of the average country during a financial crisis recession the unemployment rate would have been percent in January instead of percent The crises shown in Figure are the major systemic banking crises included in Reinhart and Rogoff ( ) Table The analysis here differs from Reinhart and Rogoff ( ) in that we use seasonally adjusted quarterly real GDP rather than annual real GDP per capita | Chapter Figure Real GDP in Recessions Associated with Financial Crises Duration of downturn ( quarters ) Percent decline peak-to-trough Spain ( : Q2 ) Philippines ( : Q1 ) Japan ( : Q1 ) Norway ( : Q1 ) United States ( : Q4 ) Colombia ( : Q2 ) South Korea ( : Q3 ) Hong Kong ( : Q3 ) Average Malaysia ( : Q4 ) Finland ( : Q1 ) Thailand ( : Q3 ) Indonesia ( : Q4 ) Argentina ( : Q2 ) United States ( : Q3 ) Sweden ( : Q1 ) Percent decline Duration in quarters Note : Financial crisis dates are from Reinhart and Rogoff ( ) U.S. business cycles are defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research and the business cycles of other countries refer to the peaks and troughs of real GDP.

Gains over the year were uneven however in the face of upheavals at the beginning of the year. Partly reflecting these shocks real consumer spending rose at an annual rate of only percent in the first half of having increased more than percent at an annual rate in the second half of The slowdown in spending growth would have been more severe in the absence of the workers payroll tax cut which offset oil price shocks early in the year and supported household consumption The disturbances that slowed consumption growth in the early part of the year proved transitory and their effects dissipated in the second half of the year ; oil prices stabilized over the summer and by the fourth quarter production ( and availability ) of motor vehicles had returned to levels that prevailed before the earthquake in Japan disrupted supply chains. The second half of brought new challenges however. Concerns about the weakening pace of growth in several industrialized economies most notably in Europe escalated during the summer and the contentious debates held in Congress over raising the statutory debt ceiling unsettled equity markets. The stock market and consumer confidence both fell in the third quarter before rebounding in the fourth quarter and early Despite these headwinds the growth rate of real consumer spending picked up in the third and fourth quarters to an average annual rate of percent Several key developments in shaped the contours of consumer spending Household Income in Nominal personal income grew percent during the four quarters of a somewhat slower pace of growth | Chapter than in Growth in nominal personal income was held down in by a slowdown in job growth near the middle of the year. Real disposable personal income which is personal income less personal taxes and adjusted for price changes edged down percent over the four quarters of after having risen percent in the year-earlier period. The purchasing power of wages and salaries was curtailed somewhat in by a run-up in food and energy prices in the first half of the year which appeared to have passed through to the prices of some other goods and services as well. As noted tax policies passed near the end of helped cushion some of the effects of these price increases on consumers while providing an additional boost to income. The Administration seeks to extend the workers payroll tax cut in and to provide additional immediate support for aggregate demand through the continuation of extended unemployment insurance benefits and other measures initially proposed in the American Jobs Act Household Wealth and Saving in The wealth-to-income ratio depicted in Figure declined in the third quarter of after rising on balance since the beginning of The consumption rate ( shown in the figure as the share of disposable income consumed ) tends to fluctuate with the wealth-to-income ratio. As a rule of thumb a one dollar drop in wealth tends to reduce annual consumer spending by about two to five cents although the source of the wealth change ( housing or equities for example ) Figure Consumption and Wealth Relative to Disposable Personal Income ( DPI ) Consumption/DPI ratio Total-wealth-to-DPI ratio ( right axis ) Years of disposable income : Q3 Consumption-to-DPI ratio ( left axis ) : Q4 Stock market wealth-to-DPI ratio ( right axis ) Net housing wealth-to-DPI ratio ( right axis ) : Q3 : Q3 Source : Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts ; Federal Reserve Board Z.1 ; CEA calculations The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | also may matter. The decline in the wealth-to-income ratio from the second quarter of to its low point in the first quarter of amounted to years of income. ( In other words household wealth declined by the amount of income earned in years ) The drop in the wealth-to-income ratio over this period was the deepest sustained decline since when these data began to be compiled. Of the total decline years were lost from the decline in stock market wealth and about year from net housing wealth All told a drop in wealth of this magnitude could be expected to reduce personal consumption expenditures by about percent Equity prices fell during the summer of before regaining most of the losses toward the end of the year. Driven in part by the rise in uncertainty during the debt ceiling debate as well as external events in Japan and Europe consumer sentiment also dropped to low levels in the summer before partially rebounding toward year s end Households continued to work down their debt through the third quarter of ( the latest data available as this report goes to press ) The personal saving rate expressed in the National Income and Product Accounts as a share of disposable personal income fluctuated around percent for the first half of about the same rate as in but below the average rate of about percent observed in the first half of The personal saving rate fell in the second half of to percent a decline from the first half of that may have partially reflected the pick up in purchases of consumer durables especially new vehicles. Purchases of new motor vehicles are counted as a consumption outlay in the National Income and Product Accounts even though households view these purchases as investment and so a rise in vehicle purchases reduces the personal saving rate Looking ahead the personal saving rate appears roughly consistent at current levels with household wealth. As a consequence while some further drops in the saving rate are possible the growth rate of real consumer spending in the years ahead would be expected to largely mirror the growth rate of income barring a dramatic change in asset prices. Even so further increases in household purchases of durable goods perhaps reflecting pentup demand for motor vehicle purchases that were deferred during the recession may reduce the saving rate temporarily Some of the recent patterns in aggregate spending and saving behavior including the sluggish growth in consumer spending may reflect the sharp rise over the past years in the inequality in the income distribution in the United States. As the Congressional Budget Office recently noted the top percent of families had a percent increase in their real after-tax income from to while the middle percent had an increase of less than percent. As a result of these trends the very top income earners | Chapter have pulled much further ahead of everyone else. ( See Chapter for a discussion of shifts in the income distribution. ) The effects of this dramatic shift in the income distribution on aggregate demand are hard to document although some of the spending patterns in the Consumer Expenditure Survey reveal evidence of the increasing inequality of income. For example the share of income spent on luxury goods and services such as entertainment relative to necessities such as food is higher for high-income households than for low-income households and this gap has widened over time ( Aguiar and Bils ) Several authors have argued that increases in inequality have likely adversely affected the economy.3 For example the rise in income inequality may have reduced aggregate demand because the highest income earners typically spend a lower share of their income at least over intermediate horizons than do other income groups. The following calculation illustrates the potential magnitude of this effect. As shown in recent research by Piketty and Saez ( ) the share of all income going to the top percent has risen sharply over the past three decades rising by percentage points from percent to percent between and This is the equivalent of about $ trillion of annual income in Research on the saving rate ( or marginal propensity to consume ) of families at the very top of the income distribution is scarce but one study ( Dynan Skinner and Zeldes ) implies that the top percent of households save about half of their total current income while the population at large has a saving rate of about percent of their total income.4 This finding implies that if another $ trillion had been earned by the bottom percent instead of the top percent of income earners annual consumption could have been about $ billion or about percent higher There are many caveats to this calculation because the marginal propensity to consume is not well established for the extreme upper end of the income distribution. In addition aggregate consumption may not have been reduced by a full percent because the dramatic shift in the income distribution likely led many households to accrue more debt. In his book Fault Lines Raghuram Rajan ( Rajan ) argues that slow income growth for the middle class led in part to the rising levels of debt and the overleveraging that played a central role in the financial crisis.5 See Rajan ( ) and Reich ( ) Kaldor ( ) provides some early research in this area The saving rate cited here refers to the change in real net worth as a share of real pre-tax income a measure that differs from the personal saving rate reported in the National Income and Product Accounts Note that the increase in leverage by the middle class may explain why the aggregate saving rate did not rise despite the shift in income to high savers The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | Increases in the inequality of income have been developing for some time but their effects on aggregate demand may have become more pronounced in the wake of the financial crisis. Increasing levels of debt during may have masked the influence of the rising inequality of incomes on aggregate consumer spending because increased access to credit card debt other consumer loans and mortgage loans allowed the growth of purchases to outpace the growth of income for most income groups. With the onset of the recession and financial crisis however the scope for this level of borrowing came to an abrupt end. Access to credit particularly for mortgages was severely restricted and the average consumer was left with elevated levels of debt taken on before the crisis. Since the crisis the process of deleveraging appears to have reduced consumption below what it would have been otherwise. By targeting support to a broad group of American workers including those with a higher propensity to spend additional income the measures the President put forward in the American Jobs Act like the payroll tax cut and extension of unemployment benefits are likely to have a greater impact on consumption and aggregate demand than alternative measures Other Influences on Consumption in For the second consecutive year lending standards eased as reported in the Federal Reserve s senior loan officer survey and consumer credit expanded modestly over the first three quarters of The level of overall household debt fell in reflecting a decline in mortgage debt. The decline in real household debt outstanding in the current recovery has been unprecedented which suggests that the process of deleveraging has played a sizable role in household consumption decisions in recent years Reflecting in part the improvement in credit availability since household consumption of durable goods including items such as new and used automobiles as well as household electronics furniture and other appliances has risen at a solid pace in the current recovery and somewhat more strongly than the rates of growth observed during the recoveries that followed the and recessions. Household consumption of nondurable goods and services in contrast has risen at a slower pace in the current recovery than in most previous U.S. recoveries. Real consumer spending on services has increased only percent so far in the current recovery whereas this type of spending grew by an average of percent over the first ten quarters of the previous eight recoveries. Consumer spending on services has been particularly weak in categories such as housing services financial services and insurance likely reflecting the continuing effects of | Chapter the financial crisis and on categories that are more discretionary such as recreation and gambling.6 Restrained demand for services may have implications for the labor market because the production of services accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. GDP and a larger share of U.S. employment. ( For a discussion of the measurement of services see Data Watch ) Although it is difficult to tie final consumption of a particular type of good or service to employment in that industry ( the purchase of a new motor vehicle creates jobs in a number of service industries for example ) jobs in service-producing sectors accounted for about percent of total nonfarm payroll employment in Developments in Housing Markets After posting steep declines during the recession activity in the housing sector remained at subdued levels in the first half of before edging up in the second half of the year. New housing starts were about units in an increase of percent from the level in New housing starts remain well below the long-run trend in U.S. housing demand According to researchers at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University projected rates of household formation and immigration for the period through are consistent with housing starts in the range of million to million units a year ( Masnick McCue and Belsky ) Activity in the housing sector is likely to remain below these levels for some time however as new construction continues to be restrained by a sizable overhang of vacant properties for sale House prices discussed in more detail in Chapter fell percent on net during the twelve months of according to the CoreLogic home price index. Distressed sales which include short sales and sales of properties owned by lenders ( real-estate owned or REO ) remained a headwind in : CoreLogic estimates that million properties were seriously delinquent in foreclosure or owned by lenders in October equal to about five months of supply at the current pace of sales. The modest rates of growth in personal income and the tighter mortgage underwriting standards observed in recent years also kept sales and starts below their long-run trend levels Consumption of services is more difficult to measure than is consumption of goods and estimates for may be revised considerably when the Services Annual Survey is incorporated into the National Income and Product Accounts. Nonetheless the pattern of weaker-than-normal growth in services consumption in the current recovery has been quite pronounced through a period for which estimates reflect the latest annual survey Industries counted in this figure include professional and business services education and health services leisure and hospitality other services and government services The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | Data Watch : The Data Implications of the Transition to a Services-Based Economy In services represented less than percent of U.S. gross domestic product ( GDP ) Today service industries account for almost percent of total U.S. domestic output. For many years however the measurement of service activity lagged the sector s growing importance A fundamental challenge in measuring the value of services is the disparate range of activities encompassed within the service sector The Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) defines services as products that can not be stored and are consumed at the place and time of their purchase. This includes for instance medical consultations admission to movie theaters Internet subscriptions haircuts and apartment rents but also some less apparent things such as meals at restaurants check clearing by banks and the rental value of homeownership. ( Although the purchase of a newly constructed home is categorized under residential investment the BEA estimates the amount homeowners would have had to pay to rent similar houses and classifies this imputed rent under housing services. ) A major breakthrough in the measurement of service output came with the introduction of the North American Industry Classification System ( NAICS ) beginning in to replace the Standard Industrial Classification ( SIC ) system. Originally developed during the 1930s and reflecting the economy of its time the SIC provided far more detail for goods-producing industries such as manufacturing and mining than for service-producing industries. The NAICS added more than new services industries. Just as important a process was put in place to add new industries to NAICS as they develop. A parallel effort carried out over the past decade the development of the North American Product Classification System similarly will provide a consistent basis for categorizing the rich array of outputs produced in the growing service sector The quality of the source data on the volume of service transactions also has improved over time. Since the 1980s the BEA has collected data on international trade in services. In the Census Bureau introduced the Quarterly Services Survey ( QSS ) to provide more timely data on domestic consumption of services. The QSS normally published about months after the end of each quarter allows the BEA to incorporate actual survey data on many services into its quarterly estimates of GDP rather than relying on judgmental trends. Furthermore the Census Bureau has expanded the scope of its annual surveys of the service sector. In fact the Services Annual Survey and the Quarterly Services Survey both now capture percent of U.S. GDP equaling the | Chapter coverage of services in the Economic Census and marking substantial improvement relative to even just a few years ago Measurement of real activity in the service sector requires appropriate price deflators for service outputs. In the Producer Price Index ( PPI ) covered less than percent of U.S. service output. Today thanks to a concerted effort by the Bureau of Labor Statistics PPI deflators are available for more than three-quarters of domestically provided services. This has translated directly into more accurate estimates of real GDP Nevertheless as the U.S. economy continues to evolve the work of accurately measuring service activity grows accordingly. Despite recent innovations in the collection of primary source data there are still conceptual issues pertaining to the appraisal and definition of services that remain unresolved. As an example improvements in health care have contributed to longer life spans and better quality of life but there is not a consensus about how to value and incorporate these benefits in a national income accounting framework. Similarly industries such as finance largely produce intangible outputs that are difficult even to identify much less quantify. Furthermore although estimates of international trade in services are now more detailed than was the case before the 1980s the statistics still could and should be improved. Data on the prices of traded services are extremely limited and even the most disaggregated data collected by the BEA on services extend to only categories in contrast to thousands of categories for manufactured goods. Continued research and investment in the development of data on services are needed to ensure timely and accurate measurement of the U.S. economy Although home prices in some parts of the country have stabilized CoreLogic estimates that more than percent of homeowners with mortgages remained underwater at the end of the third quarter of ( that is the value of the mortgage exceeds the house price ) The share of mortgages in the foreclosure process remained elevated by historical standards in and changed little from the level in as reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association For a description of the Administration s housing policy proposals see Chapter Business Fixed Investment Business fixed investment grew at a solid percent annual rate during the four quarters of after rising percent at an annual rate The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | in the four quarters of Among the two main components of business fixed investment spending on equipment and software investment grew percent over the four quarters of and investment in nonresidential structures increased percent Within equipment and software purchases of transportation equipment rose at a brisk percent annual rate over the four quarters of after having surged at a percent annual rate in Business outlays on information technology rose at a percent annual rate over the four quarters of a third consecutive year of solid growth. Investment in industrial equipment also grew notably posting a four-quarter increase of percent. ( For more information on how investment is defined see Data Watch ) Investment growth among the categories of nonresidential structures was mixed in On one hand investment in mining and drilling structures was strong reflecting elevated oil prices as well as some advances in technology that have enabled drilling at new sites. ( See Chapter ) Investment in commercial and health care structures on the other hand edged down over the four quarters of The strength of business fixed investment since mid-2009 reflects several developments. Investment fell sharply during the recession and as the prospects for sales have begun to improve businesses have invested in recent years to replace aging equipment. In addition the Administration s percent business expensing policy boosted business investment by allowing firms to take an immediate deduction on investments made in new equipment in The President has proposed extending this provision into Business investment may be positioned to grow rapidly if demand accelerates because corporations have plenty of internal funds ( Figure ) Corporate profits continued to rise in and were above their pre-recession level while corporate dividends have returned roughly to pre-recession levels. Largely as a result corporate cash flow a measure that includes undistributed profits and depreciation and represents the internal funds available for investment has also risen substantially during the recovery. A large share of these investable funds has been channeled to financial investments rather than to new physical capital as can be seen by the rising level of liquid assets held by nonfinancial corporations Manufacturing Output The real output of U.S. factories rose percent over the twelve months of after having risen percent in according to the manufacturing component of the industrial production index published | Chapter Figure Business Fixed Investment and Cash Flow Percent of potential GDP : Q3 Nonresidential fixed investment Cash flow : Q4 Liquid assets held by nonfinancial corporations : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 Note : Potential GDP is a CBO estimate. Cash flow from the National Income and Product Accounts and nonfinancial liquid assets are plotted using three-quarter moving averages Source : Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts ; Federal Reserve Board ( Flow of Funds L.102 ) ; Congressional Budget Office by the Federal Reserve Board. The manufacturing sector has been growing faster than the rest of the economy during the recovery with real output rising at an average annual rate of percent since its low in June of its fastest pace of growth in a decade The rise in manufacturing output during the recovery has provided a considerable boost to the U.S. economy. Following two decades of shrinking employment a trend that reflected both increases in automation and the lower labor costs in emerging-market economies manufacturers in the United States have added more than jobs since employment in the sector reached its low in January These numbers reflect an emerging trend of some companies bringing jobs back to the United States as discussed in the special report Investing in America : Building an Economy that Lasts ( White House ) This nascent trend likely reflects in part the improvement in unit labor costs in the United States relative to many of our trading partners in recent years. ( See Chapter for more discussion of the rising competitiveness of U.S. industry. ) The robust gains in manufacturing output during the recovery appear to reflect rising investment demand for domestically-produced capital goods from both domestic and foreign customers. The rebound of the U.S. motor vehicle industry has played a particularly large role with the production of motor vehicles and parts directly accounting for about percent of the increase in manufacturing output since mid-2009. As U.S. demand for new The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | Data Watch : Investment in Intangibles Investment can be defined as devoting resources to produce a durable asset that will yield a future flow of services. Until recently measures of investment in the National Income and Product Accounts ( NIPAs ) were restricted to investments in physical capital such as buildings machinery and equipment ; new residential construction ; and net additions to inventories. In today s knowledge economy however intangible assets such as computer software and scientific innovations make increasingly important contributions to economic growth The Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) has begun to incorporate investments in intangible capital into the NIPAs. The first step in this direction taken in was to treat spending on computer software as an investment outlay which enters GDP directly rather than as a business expense which is considered an intermediate input rather than a part of final demand ; the treatment of government spending on computer software was changed at the same time. Because business and government spending on computer software had been growing rapidly compared to other types of spending these changes raised the measured growth rate of GDP slightly. In BEA plans to begin treating spending on scientific research and development as an investment rather than an expense ; had this treatment been in effect historically it too would have raised the average measured rate of growth of GDP in recent decades Some researchers have argued that investment in intangibles should be defined even more broadly ( Corrado Hulten and Sichel ; Corrado and Hulten ) In addition to research and development that builds on a scientific base of knowledge for example there is an argument for treating as investment the money firms spend on other sorts of new product development such as the development of new motion pictures or new financial services products. Businesses also spend money on strategic planning the implementation of new business processes and employee training all of which may add significantly to future productivity and thus arguably should be treated as investment as well. Taking an even broader perspective time and money devoted to formal education add to the human capital of the American workforce and thus to its future productivity. While accounting accurately for the value of these investments poses some difficult measurement challenges ( Abraham ) their importance to future economic growth should not be overlooked. According to some research ( Krueger ) returns on human capital generate the lion s share of national income | Chapter vehicles has recovered the Detroit auto companies along with the foreigndomiciled auto companies have been expanding U.S. production to serve both U.S. and foreign markets. Over the past two years the entire U.S. auto industry including dealerships and suppliers of auto parts has added nearly jobs. General Motors was the world s top-selling automaker in Ford is investing in new American plants and sales at Chrysler grew faster in than in recent years In addition to rescuing the American auto industry the Administration has more broadly supported American manufacturing through its efforts to reduce barriers for American businesses to sell products all over the world To build on the progress already made the President laid out in his State of the Union address a Blueprint for an America Built to Last which included proposals to encourage companies to create manufacturing jobs in the United States while removing tax deductions for shipping jobs overseas Business Inventories Businesses continued to build inventories during and inventories in the manufacturing and trade sectors remained lean relative to sales Inventory investment measured as the change in inventories from one quarter to the next is typically an important contributor to the changes in real GDP during recessions and the early stages of recoveries Over the course of real inventory investment stepped up in the first quarter and then slowed in the second and third quarters but closed out the year on a high note. The slower pace of inventory investment in the second quarter reflected in part the reduced rate of motor vehicle production caused by disruptions to the flow of auto parts following the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Altogether real inventory investment added roughly percentage point to real GDP growth between the fourth quarter of and the fourth quarter of Government Outlays Consumption and Investment The Federal budget deficit during Fiscal Year which ended on September was $ trillion roughly unchanged from the year before As a share of GDP the deficit fell to percent in FY from percent in FY Federal receipts rose percent during FY largely driven by a percent increase in individual income tax receipts. Corporate tax receipts fell percent in FY partly reflecting the introduction of percent depreciation for business equipment investment in calendar year ( up from percent in calendar year ) which pulls forward deductions that businesses would otherwise receive over several years. Corporate tax receipts in FY were only about half what they were in FY The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | even as domestic corporate profits ( excluding Federal Reserve Banks ) were roughly unchanged.8 In contrast individual income tax receipts in FY were more than percent of their FY level Federal outlays rose percent in FY from FY but remained steady as a share of GDP at percent. According to the CBO approximately half of the year-over-year increase in Federal outlays reflects re-evaluations of the cumulative cost of the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) The President s FY Budget estimates that the cumulative cost of TARP will be $ billion well below the Administration s estimate of $ billion Nominal spending on defense grew more slowly in FY than in recent years. Combined total spending on Social Security Medicare and Medicaid rose in FY though at a slower pace than the average over the past three years. According to the Department of Labor extended unemployment benefits and emergency unemployment benefits are on track to be about $ billion in following total benefits of $ billion in The past three years of unemployment benefits stabilized consumer spending at a level higher than would have occurred absent this income support. In addition the percentage point reduction in payroll taxes through the end of lowered tax liabilities by about $ billion During the four quarters of calendar year real Federal expenditures on consumption and gross investment as measured in the National Income and Product Accounts declined percent ; federal defense spending fell percent over the four quarters of and federal nondefense spending declined percent As projected in the Administration s FY Budget which includes demand-supporting initiatives for FY that have not yet been approved by the Congress the deficit as a share of GDP will fall from percent in FY to percent in FY and to percent in FY The fullemployment deficit as a share of GDP ( the budget deficit that would exist if the economy were at full employment ) would be roughly unchanged in FY and fall by about percentage points in FY and by another percentage points in FY This fiscal consolidation will restrain the The divergence of corporate profits and corporate tax receipts between and reflects changes in tax policy and differences in how profits in the National Income and Product Accounts ( NIPA ) and corporate taxable income are calculated. Business credits for corporations have increased between and The components of NIPA profits that are not counted in taxable income include capital gains bad debt and Federal Reserve profits The CBO ( 2011c ) estimates the net present value of the cumulative cost of TARP each year and if costs are revised down records the changes in these valuations in the Budget as a negative outlay. The CBO adjusted down the total cost of the program in FY and FY but the downward adjustment in FY was smaller than in FY | Chapter growth of demand in those years but an increase in private-sector demand in those years is projected to fill in the gap Looking further ahead the deficit reduction from the cuts mandated by the Budget Control Act of and the expiration of the tax cuts on upper-income Americans enacted between and combined with the winding down of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq will bring deficits down to approximately percent of GDP near the end of the 10-year budget window. Policy changes recommended in the FY Budget put the debt on a stable or declining path as a share of the economy and would if enacted place the budget in a fiscally sustainable position in the ten-year budget window State and Local Governments State and local governments remained under severe fiscal pressure in and as noted declines in this sector s revenues have forced sharper declines in real State and local consumption and gross investment than in earlier U.S. recoveries. Although nominal State and local government tax receipts continued to increase in Federal funds from the Recovery Act which helped support State and local governments during and declined and employment continued to contract State and local tax revenues rose about percent or $ billion during the four quarters through the third quarter of roughly the same pace as during the year-earlier period. About half of the rise came from personal income taxes. State and local taxes on production and imports a category that includes sales and property taxes increased about $ billion over this period while corporate taxes were down $ billion. Federal grantsin-aid to the states plunged $ billion during the four quarters of after rising notably during and ; both the earlier increase and the decline were attributable to the Recovery Act which was designed to offer temporary support to State and local governments. Current State and local government expenditures which include transfers to individuals as well as government consumption fell percent over the four quarters of following a percent increase in the year-earlier period. Reflecting in part the decline in Federal grants-in-aid between the third quarters of and the operating position of State and local governments deteriorated to an aggregate deficit of $ billion by the third quarter of the fourth consecutive year of operating deficits for the State and local sector Employment in State and local government declined by in and employment in the sector fell from its peak in August The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | to December About percent of the jobs lost over this period were in education Real investment by State and local governments in structures such as schools roads and bridges fell percent during the four quarters of a decline notably steeper than those of the preceding three years. Some of the decline is attributable to the expiration of the Build America Bonds program at the end of Part of the Recovery Act the program subsidized municipal bonds issued for infrastructure development and helped finance $ billion worth of capital projects including schools bridges and hospitals ( Department of Treasury ) State and local governments have made tough budget decisions during the past four years. They will likely continue doing so in as Federal transfers diminish and past declines in house prices erode the property tax base. The Administration took important steps in and to help State and local governments maintain critical services in public safety and education. In addition to the grants-in-aid components of the Recovery Act the Administration eased the burden on State and local governments in August by establishing a new teacher job fund and by extending the enhanced Federal matching formula for certain social services and medical insurance expenditures covered by the States. In the President proposed additional funds as part of the American Jobs Act to prevent layoffs of teachers police and firefighters. To support infrastructure investment the Administration also included funds in the American Jobs Act to modernize more than schools Real Exports and Imports Real exports grew percent during the four quarters of after jumping percent in As noted the rebound in exports since the trough of the recession has been strong and reflects rising demand for U.S goods and services abroad. Total exports rose at an average rate of almost percent per year between and the twelve-month period that ended in November an increase that creates jobs for U.S. workers and puts U.S exports on track to meet the President s goal of doubling nominal exports between and the end of Meeting this goal depends in part on healthy growth of the world economy ; world growth however may falter in the near term for reasons related to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe Maintaining robust exports is a key to building an American economy that can prosper in the global economy in the years to come ( see Chapter ) Real imports also grew in expanding percent over the four quarters of the year. The rise in real imports over the past year likely reflects | Chapter the increase in consumer spending on goods the rise in real business fixed investment and the continued recovery in industrial production in All told real net exports exports less imports made a small positive contribution to the rise in real GDP over the four quarters of after subtracting from real GDP growth in the year-earlier period Labor Market Trends The job market continued to heal in adding a total of million jobs. The private-sector added million jobs during the twelve months of while State and local government employment fell by The growth in private-sector jobs was the strongest since Private sector payroll employment has grown in each month since February and layoffs as measured by the four-week average of initial claims for unemployment insurance have come down considerably over this period ( Figure ) The four-week average of initial claims continued to recede through the end of January Private-sector job growth during the current recovery has been similar to that in the recovery and faster than that in the recovery as illustrated in Figure As is typical the recovery in jobs since has lagged the recovery in output. Growth in private nonfarm jobs in the current recovery began nine months after the business-cycle trough. By comparison Figure Weekly Initial Unemployment Insurance Claims Thousands seasonally adjusted Week ended 1/28/2012 Note : Four-week moving average. Shading denotes recession Source : Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | payrolls first began expanding consistently twelve months into the recovery and sustained private-sector job growth in the recovery did not begin until months after the official end date of the recession. Thus although the recession lasted longer and featured job losses much deeper than those in the recessions of and recovery in the labor market began somewhat sooner Nonetheless the steep rate of job loss during the recession has left the rate of unemployment high. During the recovery the unemployment rate receded from its peak of percent in October to percent by January The unemployment rate dropped by percentage point between October and January ( Figure ) Other measures of labor market slack such as the U-6 unemployment rate published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics have also declined over the past year. The U-6 measure includes in the pool of unemployed workers those who are underemployed or are marginally attached to the labor force that is would like a job but are not currently searching for work. The U-6 unemployment rate in January was a percentage point below its year-earlier level In addition to tracking the number of jobs added in other margins of labor market adjustment such as the workweek also contain important information about the pace of the recovery.

By the second quarter of it had shortened hour. By the fourth quarter of the workweek increased to hours recovering most of the hours lost during the recession. A hour lengthening of the workweek is roughly equivalent in terms of labor input to an increase in employment of more than jobs Wages Labor Productivity and Prices Hourly compensation rose at about the same pace in as in The employment cost index for private-sector workers including wages and benefits rose percent over the twelve months of roughly the same as the year-earlier increase. Nominal hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector a measure based primarily on compensation in the National Income and Product Accounts rose percent during the four quarters of up slightly from the pace during but well below the average increase of about percent in and Labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector ( that is real output per hour worked ) rose about percent during the four quarters of a slower pace of growth than during the preceding two years. Averaged over the nearly four years since the business-cycle peak labor productivity grew at a percent annual rate The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | Consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index ( CPI ) rose almost percent during the twelve months of percentage points more than they did in ( Figure ) The cost of food crude oil and many other commodities rose sharply in the first half of and some of these increases were passed through to consumer prices for food and energy products. Excluding food and energy products the core CPI rose a more moderate percent during the months of after rising at an unusually slow pace of percent in Over the second half of overall consumer price inflation fell considerably as the price pressures from the earlier increases in energy and commodity prices waned. After rising at an annual rate of percent in the first six months of the year consumer price inflation fell to percent between June and December Most of the inflation in nonfarm business prices during the past four years has been due to a rise in the price markup over unit labor costs rather than to rising unit labor costs. Hourly compensation has risen at a roughly percent annual rate during the four years since the business-cycle peak but this growth has been offset by growth of labor productivity also by an annual rate of about percent during the same period leaving unit labor costs essentially unchanged. Over the long run prices of nonfarm business output rise in a roughly parallel fashion to unit labor costs so the markup of prices relative to unit labor costs has been flat although it has certainly fluctuated in the short run. As can be seen in Figure this long-term property of the U.S. economy appears to have broken down over the past decade. The markup has now risen to its highest level in post World War II history with much of that increase taking place over the past four years Because the markup of prices over unit labor costs is the inverse of the labor share of output saying that an increase in the price markup is the highest in postwar history is equivalent to saying that the labor share of output has fallen to its lowest level The Administration expects consumer prices to rise slightly below percent a year for the next few years edging up to a percent annual rate in the long run. The long-run projection is in line with the levels of inflation deemed by the Federal Reserve as consistent with stable prices and full employment and only slightly below survey measures of long-run inflation expectations and the 5-year forward inflation rate implied by the yields on inflation-protected Treasury securities.10 Moreover because slack in the labor market remains the economy has considerable room to expand without increasing price pressures The Survey of Professional Forecasters projects the CPI will grow at an average annual rate of percent from through | Chapter Figure Consumer Price Inflation 12-month percent change Headline Dec-11 Core Source : Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index Figure Price Markup over Unit Labor Costs Nonfarm Business Ratio of prices to unit labor costs : Q4 Markup over unit labor costs Average markup : Q1-2011 : Q4 : : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 Note : Shading denotes recession Source : Bureau of Economic Analysis National Income and Product Accounts ; Bureau of Labor Statistics Productivity and Costs ; CEA calculations The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | Financial Markets The past year was a volatile one for financial markets. Concerns that had arisen late in over sovereign debt in Greece and Portugal continued into and spread to several larger countries in the European Union with effects that were felt worldwide Following a percent gain in U.S. equity prices as measured by the Standard and Poor s Composite Index were essentially flat in External factors weighed heavily on investor sentiment at times over the course of the year. After rising more than percent from the end of through April equity values plunged during the summer reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the European sovereign debt problems and the protracted negotiations over raising the statutory U.S. Federal debt ceiling. Measures of market volatility such as the Market Volatility Index ( VIX ) rose sharply in mid-2011 before retreating near the end of the year The VIX reached levels in that were about equal to those in mid-2009 but remained well below record levels in late The day-to-day changes in the S&P index exceeded percentage point on days in days more than in In and swings in the S&P index exceeded a percentage point only times per year on average Yields on 10-year Treasury notes were percent in December down from percent in December ( Figure ) Ten-year yields rose to a monthly high of percent in February of as investors Percent Figure 10-Year Treasury Yields Nominal Feb.2 Real % % Source : Federal Reserve Board H.15 | Chapter elevated their outlook for the U.S. economy. Renewed concerns about sovereign debt issues in Europe however triggered a flight to safety that pushed down long-term rates on balance during the remainder of The Federal Reserve System s program to lengthen the maturity of the portfolio of their U.S. government debt also held down long-term rates. Over the final five months of the year 10-year Treasury yields fluctuated around percent and real long-term interest rates at the same maturity as indicated by the market for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities fluctuated around zero When the Administration s economic forecast was finalized in midNovember interest rates both short- and long-term were recognized as being in the low end of their historical range. Yet in light of the Federal Reserve s August announcement that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013 the Administration did not foresee any material changes in short-term interest rates over the near term. Thus the Administration s projected path for 91-day Treasury bills calibrated from rates in the market for federal funds futures anticipated that these rates would remain extremely low until the second half of The FOMC forecasted in January that these rates would remain low at least through late Small Businesses and the Recovery Small firms with fewer than employees account for about half of private-sector nonfarm employment. Between and more than half of firms in the private sector had to employees and nearly percent had fewer than employees. Figure illustrates that small firms experienced proportionately larger job losses than large firms during the recession and until early Similarly the number of bank loans to small firms fell dramatically during the recession and although it has stabilized since still has not returned to pre-recession levels ( see Figure ) In consecutive quarters between : Q1 and : Q1 respondents to the Federal Reserve s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported that credit tightened or remained tight for small firms ( those with less than $ million in annual sales ) and that since credit standards for large firms eased at a faster rate than for small firms Small firms depend more on banks for financing than do larger firms in part because larger firms have access to other forms of finance including public debt and equity markets typically unavailable to small firms. Petersen and Rajan ( ) have documented the critical relationship between banks and small firms and showed that over half of financing for small firms came The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | Figure Private Sector Job Recovery by Firm Size Indexed to at : Q4 : Q2 Large firms Small firms : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 Note : Small firms have fewer than employees. Shaded area denotes recession Source : Bureau of Labor Statistics Business Employment Dynamics from bank finance. Economists have modeled a link between the supply of credit and macroeconomic activity ( Bernanke ; Holmstrom and Tirole ; and Peek and Rosengren ) Credit conditions have been shown to affect a variety of specific macroeconomic outcomes including investment spending inventories and economic growth and development ( Fazzari Hubbard and Petersen ; King and Levine ; Kashyap Lamont and Stein ; Levine and Zervos ; Rajan and Zingales ; and Guiso Sapienza and Zingales ) Gertler and Gilchrist ( ) find that smaller manufacturing firms respond more to money supply conditions than larger firms and Kroszner Laeven and Klingebiel ( ) use cross-country evidence to show that banking crises negatively affect bank-dependent firms more than they affect firms less dependent on bank finance The credit-contraction hypothesis has been used to explain the steeper loss of employment in small firms. Until recently however the literature from the recent financial crisis has largely been unable to disentangle the contributions of credit-supply and aggregate-demand conditions. DuyganBump Levkov and Montoriol-Garriga ( ) use data from the Current Population Survey Compustat and the National Survey of Small Business Small firms in their paper are the smallest percent of the sample measured by the book value of assets. Their sample which is drawn from the Federal Reserve s National Survey of Small Business Finances conducted in and contains firms with fewer than employees | Chapter Figure Small Business Commercial and Industrial Loans Billions of dollars Value of loans ( left axis ) Number of loans ( right axis ) Millions of loans : Q3 Note : Loans with original amounts of less than $ million Source : Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Statistics on Banking Finances to separate the contributions of these two factors. They find that as in previous recessions involving banking crises following the crisis of the likelihood of becoming unemployed was greater in sectors that were more dependent on external finance. Further among firms highly dependent on banks for financing the likelihood that an employee will become unemployed is greater in small firms ( defined as those with or fewer employees ) The authors do not observe such a divergence in unemployment incidence in firms with low dependence on external finance Prior to the financial crisis the share of lending to small businesses by the largest banks those with assets of over $ billion had risen substantially ( Corner and Bhaskar ) Since however financing has been constrained and it remains so for small firms seeking funding Simultaneously the data show that other financial institutions smaller banks credit unions and other alternative lenders and governmentsponsored programs have filled part of this gap. Between January and December Biz2Credit a private firm that matches over million small businesses seeking loans to nearly lenders and loan intermediaries reports that loan-approval rates by large banks fell percentage points while increasing percentage points at small banks percentage points This evidence does not address whether the credit-supply conditions are due to factors related to lower credit quality The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | Box : SBA s Role in Financing Small Firms During the Recovery The Small Business Administration ( SBA ) was created by Congress in to aid and provide technical support for small businesses.1 Many SBA programs seek to minimize the riskiness of small-business loans for lenders by guaranteeing a portion of these loans against default. SBA collaborates with federal agencies and the White House to ensure that at least percent of Federal Government contract opportunities worth nearly $ billion are available to small businesses Traditional SBA programs the ( a ) and loans target small firms. These programs have been found to have a positive impact on local economic performance ( Craig Jackson and Thomson ) In response to ongoing tight credit conditions facing small firms during the recovery the Small Business Jobs Act of increased the loan limits for SBA loan guarantees. The limits for equipment and real estate loans were increased permanently and the limits for working capital loans through the SBA Express program were increased temporarily. Between FY2010 and FY2011 the number of SBA loans approved increased percent while the value of SBA loans approved increased percent ( see box figure ) SBA increased overall lending supported to $ billion in FY the highest ever lending year in its 60-year history.2 Recent economic research shows that new and young firms contribute disproportionately to job growth in the U.S. ( see Chapter ) The Obama Administration has created the Startup America initiative to support the role that startups play in economic growth and job creation The initiative aims to accelerate high-growth entrepreneurship through policies that unlock access to capital for high-growth companies create mentoring programs accelerate lab-to-market innovation and make government work better for entrepreneurs As a part of the Startup America initiative SBA is improving access to capital for high-growth small businesses.

To improve access to working capital for thousands of small firms in September President Obama issued an executive order to institute the QuickPay program which requires an agency to pay its contractors within days and at a maximum within days. As with the QuickPay program SBA plays a coordinating role for the Small Business Innovation Research ( SBIR ) program which focuses on small high-technology firms and includes granting agencies. Evidence suggests that SBA and SBIR involvement make a difference to young firms. Between and awardees of the SBIR program subsequently had substantially higher employment and sales growth compared to a matched sample of similar firms ( Lerner ) In December Congress passed a long-term reauthorization of the SBIR program that will increase its funding The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | at credit unions and percentage points at other alternative lenders such as CDFIs microlenders and accounts-receivable financiers.13 In the Obama Administration increased the amount of capital invested in financial institutions and other entities to support small-business lending. This lending evolved along two lines : investing capital directly into financial institutions that provide small business loans and adding funding to new and existing programs that provide credit support to small business loans. In terms of direct investment that strengthened small-business lending the Administration invested more than $ billion in over financial institutions most of which were small banks but also including credit unions Community Development Financial Institutions ( CDFIs ) and business loan funds. The programs that provide small-business credit support include the new State Small Business Credit Initiative ( SSBCI ) which is expected to channel $ billion in new small-business lending as well as existing programs such as loan-guarantee programs housed at the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) the Department of Agriculture and the Export-Import Bank. Other Administration initiatives also helped small firms gain access to capital at a critical period. For example the Financial Stability program was modified in to protect auto parts suppliers percent of which employ less than workers to ensure that they would be paid for any parts they shipped regardless of the fate of the recipient car company. Given the integral role auto-parts manufacturers play in the manufacturing supply chain systemic failure in this sector would have had a substantial effect on the auto industry the manufacturing supply chain output and employment.14 By the end of FY2011 marked increases in these capital-access programs were partly due to the introduction of two new programs administered by Treasury the Small Business Lending Fund ( SBLF ) and the SSBCI and increases in the scope of the aforementioned loan-guarantee programs. As of the beginning of January institutions participating in the SBLF have increased lending to small businesses by roughly $ billion over their baseline and in Fiscal Year SBA supported over $ billion in loans. ( Box further describes the Administration s efforts to address credit constraints among small businesses through the SBA s loan-guarantee programs administered through bank finance and Startup America. ) The most recent data on the expectations of small businesses concerning financing and future job growth suggest that these efforts along with Small firms in the Biz2Credit sample are firms with fewer than employees and under $ million in annual revenue.

With the economy now operating below its capacity and many resources still underutilized we forecast that the recovery will continue to gain strength Growth in GDP over the Long Term The growth rate of the economy over the long run is determined by the growth of its supply-side components although growth rates over shorter periods can vary considerably. The growth rate that characterizes the long-run trend in real U.S. GDP or potential GDP plays an important role in guiding the Administration s long-run forecast because actual GDP tends to gravitate toward its potential in the long run.

The labor force participation rate may also receive a boost during the forecast period from the recent increase in the share of young adults enrolled in school. The share of young adults aged to enrolled in school rose well above its trend between January and December sufficient to account for the entire decline in the labor force participation rate for this age group over this period ( Figure ) As these young adults complete their education they are expected to re-enter the labor force Taking into account all of these effects the labor force participation rate is projected to recede about percent a year between now and The employed share of the labor force which is equal to minus the unemployment rate is expected to increase percent per year over the next years ( line column ) but to be nearly unchanged on balance between and ( line column ) Because of the recession the employed share of the labor force has contributed negatively to GDP growth To be precise changes in the employment ratio reduce growth in real GDP by percentage point per year between : Q4 and : Q4 because the unemployment rate in : Q4 ( percent ) was below the level consistent with stable inflation which is expected to remain stable at around percent from through the end of the projection period The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | Figure Labor Force Participation and Educational Enrollment Ages Percent seasonally adjusted : Q4 Labor force participation and enrollment rate Labor force participation rate : Q1 Educational enrollment rate : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 Note : Enrollment rate is defined as the number of those enrolled in school but not in the labor force as a share of the population.

Smoothing through the effects of the recent business cycle real GDP is expected to rise percent a year on average over the 15-year period from to just short of the growth rate of potential real GDP of percent because the economy in is estimated to have been above its trend Real potential GDP is projected to rise percent a year in ( line column ) more slowly than the long-term historical growth rate of percent a year ( line column ) The projected slowdown in real potential GDP growth reflects the lower projected growth rate of the working-age population and the aging of the baby-boom cohort into retirement. The effects of the financial crisis and the recession in contrast are expected to have little effect on the level of potential real GDP by the end of the projection because the recession is not expected to permanently reduce any of the demographically-determined elements of long-term growth An important question addressed in the budget outlook however is how quickly real GDP will return to its potential level. In the Administration s Budget forecast the U.S. economy catches up to potential real GDP in the second half of the forecast period. The historical record supports this forecast. The full recovery of real GDP during the decade following the Great Depression suggests that the U.S. economy can recover from a severe shock to return to this underlying trend level Conclusion The U.S. economy continued to recover in from the severe effects of the financial crisis and the deep recession that followed. The rise in real GDP since the beginning of the recovery has been roughly similar to the trend in both following the and recessions while private payroll growth came sooner and more swiftly than in the beginning of the recovery from the recession. The housing market began to show signs of life in and is likely to have a positive effect on the economy though from a low base As begins the recovery appears most likely to proceed at a moderate pace over the coming year with the gains in output and employment increasing in subsequent years as credit conditions continue to ease The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | and confidence improves. Ensuring this outcome requires policies that both restore balance to the economy by increasing aggregate demand and guard against the types of excesses that led to the crisis in the first place. With millions of Americans still unemployed much work remains to restore the U.S. economy to full health. Only a prolonged and robust expansion can eliminate the large jobs deficit that opened up during the recession and the economy as a whole has considerable room to grow. The fact that private job growth has closely tracked the pattern of the early 1990s expansion is encouraging and highlights the importance of sustaining the recovery | Chapter C H A P T E R RESTORING FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY W hen President Obama took office three years ago the Administration was given an annual deficit of $ trillion and a projected 10-year fiscal shortfall of more than $ trillion.1 The Administration has taken many steps to restore fiscal responsibility because large and sustained fiscal imbalances pose one of the Nation s greatest economic challenges. Policymakers are charged with the dual imperative of safeguarding the ongoing economic recovery while simultaneously ensuring that future generations are not burdened with excessive debt and that future government borrowing does not unduly crowd out private investment. In the near term sharp deficit reduction serves as a drag on aggregate demand and threatens to disrupt ongoing economic growth. In the long term persistent budget deficits can reduce national saving raise interest rates and discourage private domestic investment even in an economy as dynamic and robust as our own. These seemingly conflicting concerns make deficit reduction a crucial but delicate endeavor Recognizing the economic risks associated with sustained large budget deficits the Obama Administration has made deficit reduction a priority In February the President signed the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act a law that restored the commonsense principle of paying for permanent mandatory spending or tax changes a rule that had lapsed or been waived during the previous decade. In March the President signed the Affordable Care Act which both expands health coverage and directly addresses one of the key drivers of the long-term deficits rising health care costs. Last summer the President and Congress enacted a $ trillion deficit-reduction package in the Budget Control Act of with a minimum $ trillion In this chapter only unless otherwise noted budget deficits and spending programs are reported in fiscal years and tax receipts are reported in calendar years in further reductions scheduled to follow. As a way forward the President has laid out a balanced plan that would in combination with the Budget Control Act and other deficit reduction measures taken since the beginning of cut the 10-year deficit by more than $ trillion bring the budget into primary balance so that revenues cover all noninterest expenditures and reduce debt as a share of the economy. These steps represent a radical departure from the budget policies of the previous administration which included a series of sweeping tax cuts skewed toward the wealthiest establishment of the Medicare prescription drug benefit program and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan all enacted without being offset by cuts or additional revenue raised elsewhere in the budget This chapter highlights the sources of budget deficits and public debt describes projected budget outlooks and outlines the Administration s deficit-reduction plan a balanced approach that recognizes the need to prioritize spending initiatives while aligning revenues with current spending by asking the highest-income Americans to contribute to deficit reduction as well as closing loopholes for corporations and special interests. The President s plan acknowledges that balancing the budget on the spending side of the ledger alone would hurt programs that help the middle class and those trying to get into it and put at risk other national priorities such as investment in infrastructure and education The prospective fiscal imbalances have been decades in the making Restoring balance will necessitate bold and difficult reforms in government programs. Although the Affordable Care Act and the Budget Control Act were the most aggressive Federal deficit-reduction legislation in years much work remains to be done. Because budget projections show continued fiscal imbalances it is critical for Congress to work with the Administration to return the Nation to a sound fiscal outlook Determinants of Current Deficits Under current law and established budget policy which are reflected in the adjusted baseline of the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) the annual budget would improve rapidly as the economy recovers falling from $ trillion in ( percent of GDP ) to $ billion in ( percent of GDP ) Despite these projected improvements the deficits moving forward are expected to remain at unsustainable levels absent additional policy actions. The fiscal shortfall is not primarily driven by countercyclical policies enacted in response to the Great Recession. Instead recent deficits are principally the result of spending policies enacted during the previous | Chapter administration sweeping tax cuts initiated in and and economic conditions. While temporary policies designed to increase aggregate demand improve business investment and jump-start employment contributed to annual deficits immediately following the financial crisis they are less costly than the previous decade s spending and tax policies ; most importantly they are temporary emergency measures projected to have a minimal effect on annual budget deficits going forward As noted spending policies enacted in the early part of the previous decade are one of the primary causes of recent deficits. Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan substantially more costly than initially announced by the previous administration added $ trillion in military spending between September and December The Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit enacted in has raised Medicare spending by over $ billion through calendar year Increased interest costs associated with these programs have driven deficits even higher Tax cuts initiated in the previous decade including those for the wealthiest individuals have helped drive down tax revenues to historical lows. In particular sweeping cuts in income and estate taxes initially enacted in and have reduced revenue and increased interest costs by nearly $ trillion between and ( Ruffing and Horney ) In Federal tax receipts amounted to just percent of GDP far below the postwar average of percent. Part of this revenue shortfall is attributable to temporary tax cuts designed to aid the economy and create jobs and part to the slow rebound of wages investment income and corporate profits the income base from which tax receipts are primarily derived. But several ongoing tax policy trends that long predated the financial crisis have also put downward pressure on tax revenue By comparison policies enacted to revitalize the economy and stabilize the financial system have contributed only moderately to deficits over the past several years with a substantially waning impact after The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( the Recovery Act ) of cost $ billion overall while the most recent Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) cost estimate is just $ billion. Other countercyclical measures including the percentage point payroll tax reduction for workers have also carried relatively small costs which have often been offset by other budget measures. For example the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of which temporarily extended the payroll tax cut unemployment These policies contributed to a historic gap between projected and realized budget outcomes In following several years of budget surpluses the Congressional Budget Office projected a cumulative surplus of $ trillion between and ( CBO ) No surplus was realized after and a cumulative deficit of $ trillion accumulated between and Restoring Fiscal Responsibility | benefits and certain about-to-expire Medicare provisions regarding physician payments included offsets that made the bill deficit neutral Figure compares the incremental cost of various post-2001 determinants of the deficit including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan economic downturns and tax cuts financial stabilization measures and economic stimulus initiatives. What the figure does not show is the path the deficit would have taken had the Great Recession persisted. The projections in the figure based on Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) data incorporate both the direct economic growth owing to countercyclical measures undertaken by the Obama Administration and the subsequent projected economic recovery. If economic growth had turned negative instead of growing throughout or if the financial system had remained in turmoil the tax base would have eroded further and the fiscal crisis would have been more severe The connection between unused countercyclical fiscal policy and stunted economic growth has been shown time and again. From the Great Depression to Japan s Lost Decade to international attempts to enact austerity measures during economic recessions research has shown that in the absence of countercyclical measures recessions become even more severe ( Auerbach and Gale ) As painful as the past three years have been Figure Selected Components of Deficit Projections : Billions of dollars War costs Bush-era tax cuts Recovery measures TARP Fannie and Freddie Economic downturn Deficit without these factors Note : Based on CBO budget projections. CBO employs different economic assumptions and methodology than OMB. As a result the projections presented in this figure may differ from those presented by OMB Source : Ruffing and Horney ( ) | Chapter for the U.S. economy countercyclical measures brought the downturn to a quicker end and have reinforced the recovery While demographic trends and rising health care costs pose serious challenges on the spending side of the ledger the failure of tax revenue to match Federal spending remains a primary concern Falling Effective Tax Rates on Upper-Income Taxpayers Effective tax rates also known as average tax rates are simply the amount of taxes paid as a share of total income. In contrast marginal rates are defined as the taxes paid on an additional dollar of earnings. Tax preferences such as preferential rates for investment income or deductions for particular activities can drive effective tax rates far below marginal tax rates As a result effective tax rates have varied over time with periodic tax reforms and a shift in the composition of income among high earners toward business and capital income. Several of the President s tax policy initiatives including the American Opportunity Tax Credit the expansion of refundable tax credits for families with children and the cut in the payroll tax have provided tax relief for middle-income Americans In order to isolate the effects of changing tax policy on effective tax rates a useful exercise is to track effective tax rates holding income characteristics constant. Under this methodology as indicated in Figure effective tax rates on middle-income Americans rose slightly in the 1960s and 1970s and then remained mostly flat between and the start of the Obama Presidency. Effective tax rates for the top percent have varied moderately over the past five decades peaking in about before falling back to lower levels between the late 1980s and the present. In stark contrast the wealthiest taxpayers have seen their effective tax rate plummet over the past five decades because of changes in Federal tax policies. The wealthiest 1-in-1,000 taxpayers pay barely a quarter of their income in Federal taxes today half of what they would have contributed in Although trends in effective tax rates are attributable to a variety of factors the tax cuts initiated under the previous administration had a notable impact. When the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of cut statutory income tax rates high-income taxpayers benefited disproportionately in large part because of the cut in the top rate from percent to percent. Two years later in preferential rates on longterm capital gains and dividends were cut to historical lows of percent again resulting in large benefits for the upper-income taxpayers who realize the bulk of investment income Treasury data show clearly that high-income families benefited the most from the and tax law changes. For example as Figure Restoring Fiscal Responsibility | Average tax rate Figure Average Tax Rates for Selected Income Groups Under a Fixed Income Distribution Top % Top % Middle % Note : Average Federal ( income plus Federal Insurance Contributions Act ) tax rates for a sample of taxpayers after adjusting for growth in the National Average Wage Index Source : Internal Revenue System Statistics of Income Public Use File National Bureau of Economic Research TAXSIM and CEA calculations illustrates between and income tax rates fell more for the top percent and top percent of the income distribution than for the middleincome quintile. Average individual income tax rates fell by percentage points for families in the top percent but only by percent for middleincome families To help reduce the deficit consistent with the notion of shared responsibility the President s Fiscal Year Budget proposes to let the tax breaks expire for income above $ a year reversing a decade-long trend of unequal tax benefits for the wealthy while making the tax cuts for those families making $ or less permanent Heterogeneity in Effective Tax Rates among High-Income Taxpayers The gradual drop in effective tax rates on high-income taxpayers is only part of the story. Effective tax rates on these taxpayers also vary widely because of the tax code s differing treatment of various sources of income allowances for changing the timing of taxes paid and various deductions and credits. For example a high-income taxpayer who is compensated primarily with cash wages might remit in excess of percent of income in payroll and income taxes while a high-income taxpayer who receives a large share of compensation in the form of interest in an investment fund ( known as carried interest ) would have a far lower tax rate | Chapter Figure Average Individual Income Tax Rates by Income Quintile and Average tax rate Average tax rate Average tax rate 1st 2nd Middle 4th Highest Top quintile quintile quintile quintile quintile percent Note : Quintiles are based on adjusted gross income Source : Department of Treasury Top percent Top percent Top percent In among taxpayers in the highest income quintile effective tax rates ( including income payroll and corporate taxes ) are expected to vary between percent for those at the 10th percentile ( in terms of effective tax rates ) to percent for those at the 90th percentile. That is percent of all high-income taxpayers are expected to pay less than percent of their income in Federal taxes and another percent are expected to pay more than percent ( the remaining percent will pay somewhere in between the two rates ) For the top percent of taxpayers the variation in rates is even starker. Among those in the top percent one in ten taxpayers is expected to pay less than percent of their income in taxes while another one in ten is expected to pay percent or more ( see Table ) The variation is perhaps most evident at the very top of the income distribution. In the most recent year for which data are available of the highest-earning taxpayers ( percent ) paid less than percent of their income in Federal income taxes while ( percent ) paid in excess of percent Addressing the Role Of Exclusions and Deductions in Effective Tax Burdens As noted effective tax rates vary widely because of myriad deductions exemptions and preferences in the tax code. Moreover particular streams of income are excluded from taxation entirely. But as noted the expanding Restoring Fiscal Responsibility | Table Distribution of Average Federal Tax Rates Family cash income group Average rate at each breakpoint in the rate distribution 10th 25th Median 75th 90th Lowest quintile Second quintile Middle quintile Fourth quintile Highest quintile Total Top percent Note : Calculations assume tax law with an AMT patch and income levels and includes individual income tax corporate income tax and payroll tax. For the lowest income quintile the calculation of average rates and the distribution of average rates do not include families with negative income. These families are included in the total Source : Department of Treasury array of such tools within the tax code has enabled some high-income taxpayers to reduce their tax liability dramatically. Decades ago the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) was enacted in an attempt to combat the low rates paid by some high-income taxpayers but its poor design has caused it to fall primarily on upper-middle-income families from high-tax states as well as on those with many children ( Burman ) In addition because the value of a deduction or exclusion is a function of a taxpayer s marginal tax rate deductions and exclusions from taxable income are typically worth much more to high-income households as much as two to three times more than to low- and middle-income ones As a way to combat this upside-down system of tax incentives the President has proposed several principles for tax reform. The President s proposed Buffett rule would ensure that Americans making more than $ million a year would pay no less a share of their income than middle-income families pay in particular no less than percent of their income in taxes. In addition the President has proposed tax reform that would ensure fair incentives for the middle class helping to equalize the value of tax expenditures across the income distribution. ( For information on how to evaluate effective tax rates based on their progressivity see Economics Application Box ) The Fiscal Outlook Without the pro-growth policies of the past three years future budget shortfalls would be even more severe. Moreover the policies presented in the Administration s Fiscal Year Budget significantly improve | Chapter projected medium-term deficits relative to an adjusted policy baseline and projected long-term public debt continues to rapidly decline over the course of the Obama Administration Medium-Term Budget Projections Under the OMB adjusted baseline medium-term deficits gradually decline as a share of GDP projected deficits fall from percent of GDP in to percent of GDP in as Figure indicates. This adjusted baseline represents a medium-term scenario in which current policies continue throughout the decade. The scenario includes the continued indexation of AMT parameters extension of the and tax cuts and extension of the estate tax parameters at their current levels as well as a continuation of current levels of spending for Overseas Contingency Operations and physician pay rates under Medicare This improved fiscal outlook is due in large part to a recovering economy and the fiscal steps the Administration has already taken including the Affordable Care Act and the Budget Control Act. Nonetheless this adjusted baseline remains problematic and represents a fundamental imbalance between government spending and revenues. The President s plan to rebalance revenue streams and spending priorities is detailed later in the chapter Figure Projected Medium-Term Budget Deficits Percent of GDP Adjusted baseline Note : See text for policies incorporated in OMB 's adjusted baseline Source : Office of Management and Budget ( 2012a ) Restoring Fiscal Responsibility | Economics Application Box : Measuring Progressivity in the Tax Code Tax changes are typically evaluated based on several key criteria including efficiency simplicity ease of compliance and administration impact on economic activity and progressivity. Progressivity is the measure of how a particular policy affects households with differing levels of income or resources. Fairness is the essence of progressivity ; many taxes particularly income taxes are designed to ensure a lighter tax burden for households with less income and lower ability to pay Economists typically define a progressive tax as one that has average tax rates that increase with income ; under a progressive tax code higher-income taxpayers devote a higher share of their income to taxes than other taxpayers. A progressive tax change is one that lowers average tax rates more for low- and middle-income households relative to others or raises average tax rates more for high-income households relative to others. For example the recent percentage point cut in the payroll tax is considered progressive because it reduces average tax rates more for low- and middle-income families compared to high-income families Other measures of progressivity such as measures that refer strictly to dollar changes in taxes paid or to the percentage change in taxes paid can be misleading. For example a tax cut might reduce taxes paid by low-income households from $ to $ ( a change of percent ) and reduce taxes paid by high-income households from $ to $ ( a change of just percent ) Some might argue that this change is progressive because it reduces taxes paid by lowincome households by proportionately more than it reduces taxes paid by high-income households but this measure is actually inconclusive because it tells us nothing about the change in average tax rates. Along these same lines metrics that focus on the share of taxes paid are not useful because they do not incorporate information on average tax rates by income group The definition of income or well-being can also be important when measuring progressivity. Some forms of compensation such as employer contributions to a retirement account or health insurance premiums paid by an employer may not be considered income for tax purposes but might in principle be considered as income for measuring taxpayer resources. Similarly income transfers such as unemployment compensation or Social Security benefits could be included in income when measuring progressivity The extent to which the tax code equalizes income is expressed graphically by the Lorenz curve in the box which shows the cumulative | Chapter distribution of income before and after taxes. The degree line represents a perfectly equal distribution of income ; the closer the Lorenz curve to that line of equality the more equal the distribution of income. A progressive tax code is one that shifts the income distribution closer to the degree line. In the tax code helped to improve the progressivity of the income distribution as illustrated by the graph by making after-tax income more equal than before-tax income. However even the after-tax Lorenz curve was well below the degree line meaning that the distribution of after-tax income was highly skewed towards the highest-income taxpayers Income Concentration Cumulative share of income Line of equality After-tax income Before-tax income Cumulative share of population Source : Congressional Budget Office ( 2011a ) The Vital Role of Economic Growth in Future Fiscal Outcomes Budget discipline is nearly impossible to achieve in practice without healthy economic growth.

Of particular interest are tabulations of selected items by county and ZIP Code such as migration patterns. Extensive data also are available on businesses including corporations partnerships and sole proprietorships. In response to increased globalization for example SOI produces regular reports on both foreign-owned U.S. corporations and U.S.-owned corporations operating in other counties More than detailed tables and regular reports are available to the public online through the Tax Stats pages located at www.irs.gov Periodic special reports have examined topics such as pensions foreign earned income and noncash charitable contributions.

Statistics derived from the SOI provide a rich source of information for policymakers business people researchers and public interest groups among others decrease in real GDP growth compared to its baseline forecast will add $ billion to the projected deficit The link between economic growth and fiscal stability is in fact central to the rationale for countercyclical measures like the Recovery Act and the American Jobs Act. Although the countercyclical measures in these bills may impose an initial fiscal cost,3 the cost can be considered a down payment on future economic growth which in turn can lead to a more stable fiscal policy. Economic growth leads to a sound fiscal outlook Improvement in Long-Run Budget Projections Although the need for long-run deficit reduction is evident recent Administration policies have already helped to partially close the long-run fiscal imbalance. As noted the Budget Control Act of reduced Federal spending by $ trillion over the next decade by making cuts to discretionary spending with an additional $ trillion in deficit reduction scheduled to The President s proposed American Jobs Act is deficit-neutral ; all provisions are more than fully paid for | Chapter come. The Administration regards this legislation as a down payment on deficit reduction and last fall proposed to Congress an additional $ trillion deficit-reduction package that would by the middle of this decade mean that current spending is no longer adding to the debt and that debt is falling as a share of the economy Health care legislation passed in is a key factor to gains in longrun deficit reduction. The Affordable Care Act addressed the Nation s most profound long-run budget challenge by limiting the growth in health care costs in several ways. ( Chapter discusses Health Insurance Exchanges as well as other provisions of the Affordable Care Act and existing health programs. ) The Act includes Medicare payment reforms that will restrain spending growth by rewarding improvements in health care productivity It established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation which will fund and test new strategies for providing high-quality care more efficiently and the Independent Payment Advisory Board which will recommend policies to reduce the growth in Medicare spending without limiting beneficiaries access to care. The projections presented in this chapter assume that the provisions of the Affordable Care Act are fully implemented limiting Medicare costs in the long run compared with previous law. The Medicare Trustees estimate these gains to be substantial slowing the average longrange annual growth in Medicare spending per enrollee to just percentage point a year above the growth in GDP per capita. This growth rate is significantly smaller than previous Medicare Trustee projections a reduction that is largely attributable to the Affordable Care Act. These trends indicate that in the absence of recent health care reform long-run budget projections would be substantially worse The Importance of Restoring Fiscal Sustainability Reducing the deficit while the economy continues to recover requires a delicate balance. Looming fiscal shortfalls can seem a distant concern in the face of high unemployment and sluggish economic growth. But as a result of continued growth since and a gradual recovery from the financial crisis of the Administration maintains its view that short-term economic support and long-term fiscal responsibility can be complementary policies Although reducing the deficit is a difficult task it is critical to the Nation s future. As the debt-to-GDP ratio has steadily risen economists have become increasingly concerned about the consequences of persistent deficits Not all types of deficit spending yield identical effects on the budget. The net economic effect of budget deficits depends critically on the Restoring Fiscal Responsibility | characteristics of the underlying spending. Public borrowing to finance productive investment including investment in infrastructure technology and education can yield positive fiscal returns in the future. A more productive private sector will lead to higher profits and stronger wage growth which will ultimately prove to boost revenues and reduce spending in later years. As such government spending that makes the private sector more productive is distinctly different from spending devoted to consumption in the current period Prolonged fiscal shortfalls also tend to raise interest rates. Today s historically low interest rates may make that link between interest rates and deficits seem tenuous but in typical economic circumstances budget deficits drive interest rates higher by increasing the demand for saving. The consensus view among economists is that a percent increase in the deficit relative to GDP leads to a to basis-point rise in interest rates ( Gale and Orszag ) Higher interest rates depress interest-sensitive consumption ( such as housing and durable goods ) and diminish asset values and household wealth Of perhaps greater concern is the potential for prolonged budget deficits to impact domestic private investment via elevated interest rates All else equal higher interest rates can divert savings away from productive domestic investment towards government securities ; higher interest rates also encourage domestic and foreign savers to increase their net investment in the United States. Thus higher budget deficits can be financed by a combination of reduced domestic private-sector investment increased domestic saving and additional lending by foreign investors. Although there is no consensus among economists on the relative share of each of these factors studies often assume that about percent of the increase in the budget deficit is met with increased private-sector saving ( Elmendorf and Liebman ) and about to percent through increased foreign lending ( Engen and Hubbard ) An active research agenda has considered how government debt affects the economy. According to research by economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff ( ) high debt/GDP levels ( percent and above ) are associated with notably lower growth outcomes. Several aspects of this finding warrant mention. First although slow growth and debt are correlated high debt does not necessarily cause stagnant growth. In fact some have theorized that stagnant growth leads to higher levels of debt rather than the other way around ( Irons and Bivens ) Second some question whether the percent threshold is appropriate for the largest economy in the world especially given the ongoing appetite of foreign and domestic investors for Treasury debt and the relative attractiveness of investment in | Chapter the United States. Finally some have argued that the key factor in measuring the impact of debt on the economy is debt held by the public rather than total debt ( including intragovernmental debt ; see Data Watch for further explanation ) Although the precise impact of government debt on economic growth is subject to debate economists agree that confidence is paramount in the relationship between government debt and financial markets. A long-term commitment to sound fiscal policies will reassure investors that the government can service its debt. More importantly sound fiscal policy and a commitment to living within our means and investing in the future will ensure better access to capital by domestic investors as well as higher standards of living for future generations The President s Balanced Approach to Deficit Reduction The President s proposed framework for deficit reduction laid out in the Fiscal Year Budget represents a balanced approach along several dimensions. Deficit-reduction measures are phased in gradually to avoid disrupting the economic recovery. Ineffective spending programs are eliminated while tax expenditures on the Nation s wealthiest taxpayers are limited. Targeted investment initiatives including those for education infrastructure and personal saving are paid for by eliminating ineffective tax cuts to high-income taxpayers. Most importantly the President s Budget charts a sustainable fiscal course ensuring that the budget deficit will fall to a sustainable level in the next years and beyond. In sum the President s Budget represents a critical first step toward a stable and prosperous economic future and ensures that the American economy will remain competitive and vibrant for decades The cornerstone of the President s approach to deficit reduction and perhaps the way in which it differs most from plans offered by others is the balance it strikes between sustainable tax revenues and spending cuts. A deficit-reduction framework based on spending cuts alone would preclude the provision of basic protections provided to the Nation s most vulnerable citizens and investment in the Nation s future. The balanced approach of the President s Budget preserves the basic functions of the Federal Government Medicare and Medicaid are strengthened ensuring health care for the nation s elderly low-income families and individuals with disabilities Social Security continues to provide a reliable steady stream of income for retirees. The military continues to receive funding to serve American interests at home and abroad. Veterans continue to receive the support they Restoring Fiscal Responsibility | Data Watch : Measuring Government Debt across Countries Differences in government accounting practices and in the types of assets held by central governments complicate the comparison of government debt across countries. These complications can lead to confusion over the most appropriate measure of government debt and the relative levels of debt for different countries One source of misunderstanding is the distinction between public debt and total government debt. Public debt refers to government debt held by private investors including individuals pension funds mutual funds and corporations. Total government debt is the sum of public debt and intragovernmental debt government debt held in government accounts such as government securities held in the U.S. Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Economists widely recognize public debt as the more relevant measure since it is government borrowing from the private sector that can be expected to interact with credit markets In most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) countries there is little intragovernmental debt. In the United States and Canada however budgetary conventions give rise to large accumulations of such debt. At the end of December U.S debt totaled $ trillion of which $ trillion was held by the public and $ trillion was intragovernmental debt. Intragovernmental debt is similarly important in Canada. Including intragovernmental debt when making international comparisons leads to an exaggerated impression of government indebtedness in the United States and Canada relative to other OECD nations A second source of confusion is the distinction between gross debt and net debt. The OECD measures gross debt as total liabilities outstanding including securities issued on behalf of the government ( such as Treasury securities ) currency and liabilities to government employee pension funds. Net debt is measured as gross debt minus government-owned financial assets. The importance of this distinction varies across countries. In Japan for example the difference is stark : gross government debt equaled percent of GDP in while net government debt was just percent of GDP A final source of misunderstanding concerns the particular government sector being measured. The OECD presents measures of general government debt which encompasses debt at all levels of government including State and local governments in the United States and central government debt. Both of these measures carry economic significance but the distinction matters insofar as central governments generally are not liable for debt incurred by other levels of government | Chapter deserve. Investments in education infrastructure and innovation continue to be a priority. Many other deficit-reduction plans fall short in these areas While the President s Budget makes and maintains critical investments in areas important to growth and competitiveness it also institutes broadly shared sacrifices to reduce the deficit. The Administration proposes to achieve $ trillion in discretionary spending savings over the next years through the budgetary caps established by the Budget Control Act ; $ billion in deficit reduction through cutting or consolidating ineffective duplicative or outdated Federal programs ; adopting a new defense strategy that cuts defense spending by percent relative to the Fiscal Year Budget ; limiting funding for Overseas Contingency Operations to $ billion through ; a $ billion fee on large financial firms ; adjustments to the Medicare and Medicaid programs to make them more efficient and cost-effective ; and a reform of the Federal civilian workers retirement plan that saves $ billion over the next decade As the President s deficit-reduction strategy cuts long-run deficits it also supports the economic recovery. The cornerstone of this support is the American Jobs Act one of the boldest pieces of pro-employment legislation in decades. At the end of the President signed into law several key parts of the American Jobs Act including a short-term extension of both the payroll tax cut and extended unemployment benefits that were set to expire at the end of Extending the payroll tax cut into added an average of $ to each paycheck of million American workers. If continued through as the President favors extended unemployment benefits will save million job seekers from depleting their benefits and will create nearly jobs through as workers spend their extra income. To bolster labor market conditions and spur near-term economic growth the President proposes pushing ahead with elements of the American Jobs Act and with additional job-creating measures. Among those proposals are an initial $ billion investment in roads rails and runways through surface transportation reauthorization legislation ; aid to states and localities to rehire teachers and first responders ; additional incentives for Americans to invest in energysaving home improvements through the Homestar Bill ; incentives to private industry to upgrade offices stores universities hospitals and commercial buildings through the Better Buildings Initiative ; a percent income tax credit to encourage small businesses to hire new employees and to increase wages ; the halting of an automatic increase in student loan interest to ease the burden on students ; funds to modernize at least schools ; a renewed Build America Bonds program to help finance the modernization and upgrading of America s infrastructure ; reauthorization of Clean Energy Manufacturing Tax Credits to spur the creation of manufacturing jobs Restoring Fiscal Responsibility | in the advanced energy technology sector ; continuation of provisions to allow businesses to write off the full amount of new investments next year ; and enactment of Project Rebuild a series of policies aimed at connecting unemployed workers in distressed communities with efforts to rehabilitate residential and commercial properties The President s deficit-reduction framework also calls for tax reform that will simplify the tax code and lower rates cut unfair and unnecessary tax expenditures increase growth and job creation in the United States observe the Buffett rule and raise $ trillion from the highest-income Americans to be devoted to deficit reduction. To begin a national conversation about tax reform the President has offered a detailed set of measures to close specific tax loopholes broaden the tax base and allow the high income tax cuts of the past decade to expire. With this conversation the President s Budget begins to reclaim the Nation s fiscal future and restore fiscal responsibility by making balanced and necessary policy decisions | Chapter C H A P T E R STABILIZING AND HEALING THE HOUSING MARKET T he recession that began at the end of is inextricably linked with the bursting of the housing bubble that had built up over the previous decade. The ensuing shock to financial markets and the more than $ trillion in lost housing wealth prolonged and deepened the downturn and has been a headwind for the economic recovery. Although the housing market is showing signs of stabilization the healing process is not complete in many parts of the country The bursting of the bubble was a culmination of a multiyear process of rapid growth in house prices fueled by excess capital flows into the United States. These flows were converted into home mortgages by various financial intermediaries using lax underwriting standards and channeled through the financial system with an increasingly complex web of mortgage securitizations. These trends in turn created unmoored expectations of continuous price growth that caused a spike in residential construction. The overheated housing market ultimately proved to be unsustainable and the return to more realistic levels has been very painful for the economy. As this process continues to unfold responsible policies are needed to assist the market in its transition to a new sustainable equilibrium supported by a prudent and robust financial framework. In this context healing the housing market requires laying the foundation for balanced and sustainable growth while repairing and improving the housing finance system that helped inflate the housing bubble The effects of the drop in housing prices have been amplified by the uniqueness of housing as a financial asset class. Indeed housing is the single most important asset for a majority of American households. Houses generate a steady stream of consumption services for their owners as well as enabling them to send their children to local schools and use neighborhood amenities ranging from parks to retail stores to hospitals. They also create demand and jobs as homeowners furnish their homes and invest in their maintenance. By virtue of their tangibility houses also serve as an important form of collateral for other borrowing purposes notably startup financing for small businesses. Housing collateral attracts lender financing making housing the most levered asset in household portfolios and closely linking the health of the housing market to that of the broader financial sector Consequently declines in housing wealth can have a far greater effect on the economy than equivalent losses in other financial assets such as equities Setting the housing market back on track is a key step on the road to recovery. Yet housing presents several particular challenges many of which derive from an array of institutional frictions in housing finance markets that have been exposed by the enormous scale and scope of home price declines and from very long lags in the adjustment in the stock of housing This chapter highlights some of these challenges. They include a poorly functioning system for loss mitigation of nonperforming mortgages and effective disposition of mortgaged properties ; inadequate origination of mortgage credit ; and obstacles to refinancing including the widespread phenomenon of negative equity. These deficiencies form a mutually reinforcing adverse feedback system in which negative equity raises the likelihood of delinquencies that often result in a drawn-out foreclosure process eventually concluding with distressed sales that exert further downward pressure on home prices and thereby deepen the amount of negative equity. The large overhang of unresolved properties in distress along with mortgage debt in excess of home value further feeds this negative dynamic by depressing price expectations of potential homebuyers and lenders. Left unchecked this dynamic creates a dangerous possibility for housing prices to overshoot and fall below their fundamental values posing a difficult hurdle for sustained economic recovery Some have argued that the best course of action is to rely on the market alone to work out the problems of struggling homeowners negative equity and foreclosed properties through liquidation. This approach disregards the risk of overshooting the bottom and it fails to recognize the many complex incentive conflicts that exist between purely private parties such as homeowners investors and mortgage servicers. These conflicts and the need to recognize and allocate housing losses to various economic actors present a serious collective action problem the resolution of which by the market has been sluggish at best over the past several years. Perhaps most important a laissez-faire approach also disregards the spillover effects of large numbers of delinquencies and foreclosures on local housing markets the financial system and the toll they exact on American families and the economy in general | Chapter The alternative to sitting back and waiting for these enormous challenges to work themselves out slowly and painfully is for the Government to engage in a series of coordinated measured and multifaceted policy actions This approach involves working in conjunction with market participants and housing regulators to address the lingering effects of the bursting of the housing bubble as suggested for instance in a recent Federal Reserve Board white paper ( ) This chapter describes a set of existing and proposed policy initiatives that target many of the interlinked housing market problems. Some of these policies are pursued through Government agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) and the Department of the Treasury. Others are undertaken in conjunction with private investors and still others are carried out together with the government-sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the supervision of their regulator the Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) The Housing Crisis and the Initial Policy Responses After growing at a rapid pace through the early years of the new century home price appreciation ground to a halt in the summer of This change in the path of housing prices triggered an initial wave of subprime mortgage defaults and the resulting losses quickly propagated through the global financial system bringing it to the brink of collapse and ushering in a deep recession. By the beginning of nationwide measures of home prices had declined for straight months falling by a total of nearly percent. This drop in the national average masks significant regional variation. In some states like Florida and Nevada where prices had gone up the fastest housing prices plummeted by to percent from their peak. Price drops in some other states were much milder Overall as shown in Figure the decline in inflation-adjusted home prices was unprecedented in the post-World War I U.S. economic experience in both its severity and its geographic scope. Some of the regional housing recessions notably in California and New England in the early 1990s generated sharp and long-lasting price declines but neither was as steep and prolonged as the current episode. And during the Great Depression the only other instance of nationwide price declines since WWI much of the comparably-sized decline in nominal home prices was offset by a concurrent drop in general price levels so the decline in real housing values was only about one-quarter as large as the one we recently experienced Stabilizing and Healing the Housing Market | Figure Housing Busts in U.S. History Real price level compared to peak Great Depression ( national ) California Current ( national ) Boston Years since housing peak Source : S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index ; the Great Depression time series from Shiller ( ) The unprecedented and ultimately unsustainable nature of housing market trends before is further highlighted in Figure The dashed line depicts annualized growth in real levels of mortgage debt per homeowner household between and the third quarter of Mortgage debt balances grew at a rapid pace from to one that far exceeded growth in real income during this period. There were many factors behind the escalating household debt. In part it reflected rising home prices and growing household leverage driven by extraction of home equity and shrinking down payment requirements. As households continued to accumulate mortgage debt in the expectation of ongoing housing appreciation housing was becoming less and less affordable as evidenced by the price-to-rent ratio series ( the sold line ) in the same figure. After remaining in a narrow range between and percent for nearly two decades the price-to-rent ratio accelerated rapidly to peak at percent in the first quarter of Once the bubble burst falling prices and poor economic conditions resulted in steep increases in delinquencies and foreclosures across a broad spectrum of American homeowners. By the first quarter of nonperformance rates among prime borrowers rose nearly threefold relative to their level in the first quarter of ( from to percent ) while those for subprime loans spiked to nearly percent from percent four years earlier.

The Federal Reserve undertook a series of aggressive monetary policy actions and launched a number of programs to support liquidity and lending activity in key financial markets. Congress passed the Housing and Economic Recovery Act ( HERA ) in July of which established the Federal Housing Finance Agency the new regulator of the GSEs with greatly expanded powers. The HERA was followed by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act in October of which established the Troubled Asset Relief Program In one of its first major policy actions the Obama Administration implemented the Financial Stability Plan in February A key part of Stabilizing and Healing the Housing Market | Figure S&P/Case-Shiller : January Expectations of Future House Prices and Actual Price Index Index : Jan = Actual Housing prices implied by futures contracts traded in January Source : Case Shiller the plan focused on maintaining the flow of housing credit and helping responsible homeowners stay in their homes through the Making Home Affordable ( MHA ) program. In particular the Treasury Department made an increased funding commitment to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which had been placed in conservatorship six months earlier. The Federal Reserve which had previously announced a program to purchase up to $ billion of GSE debt and mortgage-backed securities expanded the planned size of the program to $ trillion in March These actions have resulted in economically meaningful and long-lasting reductions in mortgage interest rates ( Gagnon et al. ) and credit availability ( Fuster and Willen ) To help responsible households take advantage of these lower rates the MHA included the Home Affordable Refinance Program ( HARP ) which was intended to enhance refinancing opportunities for borrowers who had insufficient equity in their homes. While HARP helped homeowners to hold onto their homes through more sustainable mortgages other components of the MHA focused on restructuring mortgages of borrowers struggling to stay current on their loans. In particular the Home Affordable Modification Program ( HAMP ) provided a streamlined approach to modification of delinquent loans and offered monetary incentives and procedural safe harbors to industry participants. To help communities manage the destruction caused when the housing market collapsed the American Recovery and | Chapter Reinvestment Act of ( the Recovery Act ) provided additional support to the housing market by extending HUD s Neighborhood Stabilization Program which began under HERA. This program allocated funds to state and local governments and nonprofit organizations to mitigate foreclosures and to pursue innovative local approaches to deal with the economic effects of abandoned properties. The Recovery Act extended the first-time homebuyer credit established under HERA and increased it to $ This program was extended further by the Workers Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of To date these initial responses to the housing crisis have assisted several million households. The most recent housing scorecard released by the Department of the Treasury and HUD indicated that as of December more than homeowners had received permanent modifications under HAMP putting the program on pace to reach the million threshold early in Of equal importance HAMP provided a template for major servicers to follow in conducting their own modifications outside of the program. To date servicers have undertaken nearly million socalled proprietary modifications many of which would not have occurred without the standards established by HAMP. The scorecard also highlights loans refinanced though HARP as well as nearly million borrowers helped through various FHA loss mitigation interventions. These programs have faced challenges from a number of structural problems in housing markets. These problems include incentive conflicts that arose when loan servicing was separated from loan ownership in mortgage securitizations as well as uncertainty about legal liability in loan origination and loss mitigation practices. These problems have been greatly exacerbated by erosion in collateral values which have increasingly fallen below the value of associated loans and put more than one in five mortgage borrowers under water. These dramatic declines in collateral necessitate eventual recognition of economic losses and allocation of such losses to various economic actors As policymakers have increasingly focused on addressing these deficiencies each of these original MHA programs has undergone substantial modification described more fully in the following sections Negative Equity : An Unprecedented and Pervasive Problem As noted widespread declines in housing prices resulted in more than a $ trillion fall in aggregate housing wealth. These losses were borne to at least some extent by most homeowners. For some homeowners however falling prices not only wiped out their housing wealth in its entirety but also pushed the value of their homes below the value of outstanding mortgages The resulting negative equity which is estimated to total $ billion has Stabilizing and Healing the Housing Market | become one of the legacy hallmarks of the housing price bubble. This negative equity resulted from large home price declines combined with a number of other factors. According to recent estimates as many as million ( or percent of ) borrowers are under water. The aggregate negative equity is unequally distributed across the nation. Six states with the highest incidence of negative equity Arizona California Florida Georgia Michigan and Nevada account for more than half of all underwater borrowers and of the aggregate amount of negative equity ( Figure ) All of these states have experienced steep declines in house prices Negative equity has been associated with a number of problems over and above those caused by the more widespread loss in housing wealth Underwater borrowers find it difficult if not impossible to take advantage of record low interest rates through refinancing because lenders and investors are unwilling to take on uncollateralized credit risk. The inability to refinance prevents households from lowering their monthly mortgage payments. It also undermines the effectiveness of monetary policy that aims to lower borrowing costs to businesses and households and thus encourage greater economic activity. ( For more on the decision to refinance see Economics Application Box ) Underwater households have weakened incentives to invest in their property since the expected gains from their investment are likely going to be absorbed by the lender. As a result underwater households underinvest Figure The Distribution of Underwater Mortgages By State Legend < % % % % % > % N/A Source : CoreLogic | Chapter in home improvements and maintenance which leads to the overall decline in the quality of the nation s housing stock ( Melzer ) Negative equity has also been associated with heightened realized default rates. Several recent academic and industry studies have found that the higher their negative equity the more likely households are to become delinquent ( Bajari Chu and Park ; Elul et al. ) Recent work by Federal Reserve Board economists ( Bhutta Dokko and Shan ) shows that a household s equity position amplifies the effect of unemployment shocks on default and that this interaction grows in strength with the degree of negative equity. ( For more on data challenges in evaluating the financial situation of homeowners see Data Watch ) Household delinquency and the ensuing foreclosures are very costly as they disrupt the social fabric of neighborhoods and cause lenders to engage in an expensive and drawn-out process of liquidation. Moreover foreclosures not only lower the value of the foreclosed property itself ; they also have a sizable spillover effect on valuations of neighboring homes. According f to a recent academic study ( Campbell Giglio and Pathak ) each foreclosure within a mile radius of a given house lowers its predicted sale price by percent Negative equity also poses a roadblock for efficient reallocation of housing resources. Families naturally buy and sell houses over their life cycle and in response to shocks such as illness or divorce. The necessity to write a sizable check to the lender upon sale makes it effectively impossible for liquidity-constrained households to trade their houses without creditimpairing actions such as delinquency ; deed-in-lieu in which a borrower returns the property to the lender ; or short sale in which a house is sold for less than the balance of debts secured by the property. Negative equity also has the potential to limit underwater borrowers ability to pursue employment opportunities in other geographic areas. The empirical evidence to date however has largely suggested that the adverse effect of negative equity on labor mobility the so-called house lock effect is fairly limited Macroeconomic Effects of Housing Market Weakness The housing sector plays an important role in determining the health of the broader economy. Two aspects of this relationship are particularly important the effect of housing wealth on household consumption and the direct contribution of residential construction to gross domestic product ( GDP ) Stabilizing and Healing the Housing Market | Economics Application Box : Making a Decision about Refinancing a Mortgage Mortgage rates in the United States reached historic lows in presenting an opportunity for many homeowners to save money by refinancing their fixed-rate mortgages. However refinancing typically involves a number of costs that push the effective interest rate above the rates reported in news media. These costs include those associated with obtaining a new loan such as title insurance and various administrative fees ; risk-management charges related to loan origination ( for example points ) ; underwriting charges for appraisal of the house ; and the more mundane costs of gathering documentation How does a homeowner decide whether it is worth paying the additional costs to reap the benefit of the lower rate ? The first step in evaluating refinancing is to get a clear and comprehensive summary of costs associated with a new loan ; these should be provided by your loan officer or mortgage broker on a HUD-1 form. While many of these costs can be rolled into the loan some have to be paid in cash up front The second step is to lay out the stream of all payments required under the original loan and the new loan used for refinancing. Although this process may seem involved it will allow you to take into account refinancing costs as well as the fact that you will be making payments on a refinanced mortgage over a longer period than you will have remaining on the existing mortgage Third those payment streams need to be converted into one number the amount of spending today that this stream of payments is worth. This is known as the net present value or NPV. The net present value discounts costs paid in the future to reflect the time value of money and the uncertainty associated with future returns. In the simplest possible form it is better to have a dollar today than a dollar tomorrow as this dollar can be invested and grow in value by the time tomorrow arrives. Hence all future payments are discounted relative to today s outlays. The choice of the discount rate merits a separate discussion that is beyond the scope of this example. However some common choices include discounting at the risk-free rate ( commonly approximated by the 10-year Treasury rate ) or the expected rate of return for the stock market ( approximated say by the long-term average return on the S&P index ) The NPV calculation can be carried out with a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel or on a number of websites. Once NPV values are computed for both payment streams the one with the lower value is the better choice | Chapter The computation and comparison of net present values is the main idea behind a broad range of online calculators designed to answer the question of whether refinancing makes sense. An example can be found on Jack Guttentag s Mortgage Professor s Website at http : //www.mtgprofessor.com/calculators/Calculator3a.html. Some mortgage brokers are fond of making use of simple rules of thumb as a shortcut for using the NPV approach. For example they may suggest that the new mortgage rate has to be percentage point lower to justify refinancing with typical closing costs. Recent estimates of such rule-ofthumb threshold differences in interest rates have varied between and percentage points One often overlooked cost of refinancing has not yet been mentioned. By refinancing today one generally forgoes the opportunity to refinance in the future if interest rates were to drop a bit further. Suppose you determine that refinancing a percent loan into a percent loan is advantageous from an NPV standpoint. Then refinancing the original loan into a percent loan would be even more beneficial but refinancing from a percent loan would not. This difference between payments at percent and percent is essentially the value of the forgone option to delay refinancing. The value of preserving this option has fluctuated over time because it clearly depends on the volatility of interest rates the economic outlook and the ability to maintain access to credit markets-a nontrivial concern for today s borrowers In recent work Sumit Agarwal John Driscoll and David Laibson ( ) calculated the optimal interest rate differential at which to refinance that explicitly takes into account the aforementioned option value ( these calculations can be found at http : //zwicke.nber.org/refinance/ ) Take for example a family that plans to stay in their house for years has a $ mortgage at percent interest rate and has a marginal tax rate of percent. For this family assuming an upfront fee of percentage point of mortgage value ( point ) and cash closing costs of $ refinancing is optimal if the interest rate on the new mortgage is percent or less. Unlike the simple rule of thumb this calculation takes into account family expectations of the future inflation rate interest rate volatility and how long they plan to stay in the house the option value determinants which affect the ultimate recommendation Stabilizing and Healing the Housing Market | Consumption Effects The standard approach in economics has been to assume that households consume about the same fraction of the increase in their wealth each year regardless of its source. Numerous econometric studies have come up with a range of estimates that relate changes in household consumption to changes in wealth ( Poterba ) Although there is no single agreed-upon value the consensus range is fairly narrow the fraction of each additional dollar in wealth consumed in a given year ( what economists call the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth or MPC ) is estimated to be roughly between three and five cents. Applying the lower of these estimates to the $ trillion in housing wealth losses to date implies consumption losses of $ billion a year or percent of GDP. Under standard Okun s law assumptions this GDP impact in turn translates into a percentage point increase in the unemployment rate. The severity of losses experienced during the recession that began in December of in both national output and in labor markets makes these estimates appear too small One of the possible explanations for this puzzle may be that declines in housing wealth have a more profound effect on consumption than equivalent declines in other forms of wealth. Case Quigley and Shiller ( ) find strong empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis by exploiting substantial variation across states in house price paths and holdings of equity assets. In particular they relate quarterly growth rates in house prices and equity holdings to quarterly growth rates in state-level retail sales and find that the consumption response is more sensitive to changes in housing wealth than to changes in stock market wealth. It is noteworthy that both the level of the response and the difference between sensitivities to financial and housing wealth shocks increase substantially once the recent experience is incorporated in the data ( the study includes data from through ) Why would households respond more to housing wealth shocks ? Part of the likely answer has to do with the very different distributions of ownership of various financial asset classes. Most financial assets other than liquidity-restricted retirement plans are heavily concentrated at the top of the wealth distribution. In contrast holdings of housing assets are much more uniformly spread across different wealth income and demographic strata. At the peak of the housing market in the third quarter of home ownership stood near a record high at percent. Although home ownership rates among African American and Hispanic households were noticeably lower ( percent and percent respectively ) they vastly exceed ownership rates of all other financial assets other than bank accounts for these two groups. Perhaps more important housing assets make up a much | Chapter Data Watch : Need for a Comprehensive Source of Data on Mortgage Debt and Performance There are currently four basic sources of loan-level data on mortgage debt : the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act ( HMDA ) database data reported by mortgage servicers credit bureau data and public records data. Each of these sources provides insight about mortgage holdings but the existing system is inadequate for measuring the extent and ownership of financial obligations backed by residential real estate The HMDA database contains data required to be publicly reported for all mortgages. It is useful for measuring long-term trends in mortgage application volumes and originations but contains little information on loan terms or performance following origination Further HMDA data are released only annually with a significant lag In contrast proprietary data sets from loan servicers such as Lender Processing Services ( LPS ) and CoreLogic have useful information on loan characteristics and performance but underrepresent certain loan and investor types. They also have little detail on borrower income or credit scores following origination and lack information on other debt obligations including those collateralized by the same real estate The credit bureau data track borrower credit scores and performance on multiple debt obligations over time but tell us little about loan terms and mortgage contract type and nothing about the employment status and current income of homeowners. Public records contain legal notices of property-related transactions such as mortgage origination and foreclosure but they contain little information beyond the reason for creating the record loan amount and an associated property identifier Linking these data sources to produce a more comprehensive database is a challenging undertaking but a pilot version developed by a team of researchers at Freddie Mac and the Federal Reserve Board has laid a strong foundation for this effort. A combined database could make available critical statistics on the health of the housing market. For example it could establish a link between first- and second-lien mortgages on the same property providing key information on the overall extent of borrowers leverage in different housing markets. This in turn would enable better risk management by first-lien lenders and private investors as well as better design and implementation of government and private-sector loss mitigation programs. In addition by utilizing statistical sampling techniques such a database could correct for known biases across different data sources. Reliance on sampling also could reduce operational burden allowing for more timely reporting Stabilizing and Healing the Housing Market | larger fraction of wealth among lower income households. Whereas housing accounted for nearly two-thirds of the overall assets of households in the bottom half of the wealth distribution in it constituted only percent of assets for those in the top decile and only percent for those in the top percentile. Shocks to housing wealth not only affect more households than other wealth shocks ; they also apply disproportionately to those at the lower end of the wealth distribution A Pew Research Center report issued in July provides a stark illustration of these trends concentrating on the disparate effects of the burst housing bubble on the wealth of minority and white households. Because home equity accounts for a much greater share of household wealth among minorities percent for African Americans and percent for Hispanics in compared with percent for whites minority households experienced much greater losses from the housing downturn. These losses were further compounded by the uneven geographic distribution of house price declines. As underscored by the Pew report more than percent of the nation s Hispanic households resided in the five states with the steepest price drops Arizona California Florida Michigan and Nevada while only about one in five of all white and African American households resided in those states. For Hispanics in those five states declining home prices have nearly wiped out household net worth with median values collapsing from about $ in to just $ in These trends matter to consumption because empirical research has pointed out systematic differences in marginal propensities to consume across income groups. For example studies that analyzed the consumption effects of the and tax rebates using actual household expenditure data found that low-income households and those with low liquid wealth spent considerably higher fractions of these rebates. These effects were identified in credit card data ( Agarwal Liu and Souleles ) the multiple-category Consumer Expenditure Survey ( Johnson Parker and Souleles ) and automobile purchases ( Parker et al. ) The fact that housing wealth losses were concentrated among the subset of households most responsive to such shocks may account in part for the magnitude of the observed declines in consumption. Indeed a recent study by Mian Rao and Sufi ( ) shows that households with low levels of nonhousing financial assets experienced much greater declines in consumption for a given decline in home prices A growing economics literature highlights the importance of household debt balances in influencing the severity of economic slumps. Most of the growth in household debt between and can be traced to mortgage-related borrowing which increased by nearly $ trillion ( or percent of the total increase ) over this period. As housing values collapsed | Chapter many households found their balance sheets tilting heavily toward debt Household efforts to bring their balance sheets closer to equilibrium leverage can potentially proceed along several avenues. Households can default on their debt obligations. They can accelerate repayment of their debts. Or they can repair their asset base through more aggressive saving. Collectively these approaches are often referred to as deleveraging A series of empirical papers attempts to quantify the effect of such deleveraging on consumption ( Mian and Sufi ; Mian Rao and Sufi ) These papers broadly suggest that the levered nature of household housing assets amplified the effect of pure wealth losses from the crash in housing prices. The studies compared the consumption response in counties with different pre-recession levels of household debt and found that counties with the highest debt levels experienced much larger and longer-lasting drops in consumption than counties with low debt levels. This finding held true for consumer durables such as automobiles appliances and furniture as well as for consumption of groceries. These counties also exhibit patterns consistent with deleveraging as increases in the numbers of defaults and debt paybacks by non-defaulters are much higher in high-debt counties than in low-debt ones. These trends in consumption in turn affect local employment particularly in sectors that produce locally consumed goods and services such as restaurants and retail establishments ( Mian and Sufi ) Figure illustrates the divergence in employment trends in such nontradable industry sectors for high- and low-debt counties. In contrast the traded goods sectors ( not shown ) display no such divergence suggesting that the run-up in debt and bursting of the housing bubble have caused the contraction in aggregate demand Aside from the consumption effects of debt reduction or increases in savings needed to deleverage households with impaired balance sheets may also have difficulty obtaining credit which would further affect their consumption ( Hall ) Before the crisis the ability to use home equity as loan collateral served as an important source of financing for household purchases of goods and services. For example Doms Dunn and Vine ( ) find that the increasing ease of tapping home equity credit in the early 2000s allowed homeowners to use their housing wealth to finance various forms of consumption. Another example of the pernicious effects of over-leveraging on access to credit discussed earlier is the inability of homeowners with low or negative equity stakes to refinance into low-interest mortgages Moreover reductions in the collateral value of houses have a negative effect on the economic recovery by restricting one of the primary channels for financing startup businesses Stabilizing and Healing the Housing Market | Indexed : = Figure Employment Growth : Nontradable Industries Low household debt counties High household debt counties Source : Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages ; Mian and Sufi ( ) Residential Construction and Home Ownership Patterns As discussed in Chapter residential construction in remained at very subdued albeit stable levels. Starts of new housing units averaged a little over roughly in line with the levels observed in and Housing starts of both single- and multi-family structures remain far below their peak levels of million units weighed down by the cyclical weakness in demand the slow pace of household formation high inventories of vacant properties for sale and tight financing conditions for homebuilders In addition to cyclical headwinds residential construction has been impeded by the need to reallocate the nation s housing stock from owneroccupied to rental units as a growing number of households exited the ranks of homeowners through foreclosures. Recent research by Federal Reserve economists analyzes the moving decisions of homeowners who went through foreclosure between and ( Molloy and Shan ) This study finds that post-foreclosure households do not tend to move in with others to defray their living expenses. Rather the overwhelming majority of them ( percent ) end up renting single-family housing units This evidence suggests that many of the newly foreclosed households will continue to exhibit strong preference for single-family structures However the conversion of an owner-occupied house to a rental property takes a certain amount of time especially if the home is repossessed at the | Chapter conclusion of the foreclosure process. Repossessed homes need to be sold often rehabilitated and then marketed to potential renters. This process is made all the more difficult by tight credit conditions for financing investment properties evidenced by historically high shares of all-cash purchases and by execution problems in amassing property portfolios necessary to realize any economies of scale through multiple foreclosure auctions In the meantime prices in rental markets have been trending upward pointing to the critical importance of efficient conversion of foreclosed properties and providing some of the necessary impetus for this process. A well-functioning mechanism for disposition and conversion of distressed properties into rental units has the potential to ease the downward pressure on owner-occupied house prices by removing a part of bank-owned and shadow inventory of soon-to-be-foreclosed properties from the sales market. ( See the Data Watch for discussion of challenges in measuring home sales. ) Demand for rental housing is likely to grow at a healthy rate over the next few years creating an ongoing need to convert existing homes to rental. First household formation is poised to accelerate. As numerous observers have pointed out household formation slowed dramatically during the recession and has only recently begun to grow. Data from the Census Bureau show formation of fewer than new households in both and well below the annual average of million. The primary part of this trend is cyclical deriving both from high unemployment rates among the young and from a substantial drop-off in immigration. A study done for the Mortgage Bankers Association ( Painter ) suggests that historically as economic conditions improved individuals who delayed forming households during recession years were more likely to turn to rental markets to fulfill their housing needs Second credit conditions have tightened considerably in recent years Successful mortgage applicants have substantially higher average credit scores and are required to put up larger down payments than was the case in the era of rapidly rising house prices. For potential homebuyers who are unable to put down percent of the purchase price loans through the FHA and the U.S. Departments of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) and Agriculture have become the primary and in many cases only avenues for mortgage financing providing a vital counter-cyclical buffer to sustain access to credit through the crisis. Consequently the agencies market share has risen rapidly with the FHA accounting for nearly percent of all house purchase loans in Among minority households in particular the FHA and VA loans became the predominant form of financing for home purchase Between and the share of FHA/VA loans has skyrocketed from Stabilizing and Healing the Housing Market | Data Watch : Need for a Comprehensive Source of Data on Home Sales On December the National Association of Realtors ( NAR ) announced substantial downward revisions going back to of previously reported data on sales of existing homes. The revisions reduced the estimated home sale projection for from nearly million units to million units and reduced the number of reported home sales between and by nearly million units. Although the implied pace of change in recent home sales was largely unaffected lower sales levels caused a reevaluation of housing market conditions and by causing realtor commissions to be revised downward are expected to lower the level of GDP To a certain extent revisions to the NAR data are inevitable. The NAR sales estimates are based on reports from a subset of regional Multiple Listing Services ( MLS ) The data from the covered areas must be weighted to represent the areas that are not covered and adjustments must be made to this weighting over time. Further the NAR can not directly measure sales transactions conducted outside of Multiple Listing Services platforms. These unlisted transactions may include houses sold by owners without realtor assistance sales carried out by builders and some foreclosure sales. These sales channels vary in importance over the housing cycle and across different geographies something that can be difficult to capture accurately on a current basis NAR revisions also reflect the fragmented nature of local MLS systems and their evolution over time. Historically many metropolitan regions were represented by several MLS databases. The NAR obtained actual sales data from a subset of these databases and adjusted the numbers to account for sales recorded in the remainder. MLS systems have undergone considerable recent consolidation. As NAR adjustments lagged consolidation of MLS systems reported sales were being grossed up by outdated factors and thus were systematically overstated Since all property sales are publicly documented by local deed registration systems it theoretically should be feasible to use these records to estimate sales volumes across all jurisdictions and all channels and with minimal time delay. The main hurdle to constructing a comprehensive national data source for real estate transactions will be to integrate data across disjointed and dissimilar county-level recording systems. Such data however would represent a reliable and timely source of information on sales activity useful information for macroeconomic forecasters and an important gauge of health in the nation s housing markets | Chapter percent to percent of all purchase mortgages originated to AfricanAmerican households and from percent to percent of all purchase mortgages originated to Hispanic households. During the past three years at least percent of all first-time home buyers financed their purchases with FHA or VA loans. Young households surveyed by Fannie Mae repeatedly cite an insufficiently strong credit history and not having enough for a down payment as two of the biggest obstacles to homeownership Third younger households that just experienced a historic decline in housing prices may be less optimistic about homeownership. Recent research ( Malmendier and Nagel ) showed that households coming of age during periods of sizable declines in the equity market stayed away from equity ownership in the future. For such households a longer lifetime perspective could not offset the dramatic price declines experienced early in life which thus tended to have a strong and long-lasting influence on subsequent economic behavior. It is premature to say whether a similar Depression babies effect is applicable to today s young renters. The scant survey evidence available on this question is mixed. On one hand the Fannie Mae surveys indicate that the majority of young households continue to regard housing as a good financial investment and homeownership as a desirable goal. On the other hand a series of special supplements to the Michigan Survey of Consumer Sentiment suggest that younger households hold more pessimistic views of homeownership although this result is limited to a subset of responders with personal knowledge of someone who experienced foreclosure or substantial home price declines ( Bracha and Jamison ) In sum the weakness in the housing sector continues to weigh heavily on macroeconomic performance. The enormity of losses in housing wealth and the uneven distribution of those losses in the population along with the substantial weakening of household balance sheets burdened by debt overhang have an outsized effect on consumption. High unresolved inventories of distressed properties along with a concurrent need for large-scale rebalancing of the housing stock contribute to ongoing difficulties in the residential construction sector These challenges are compounded by several structural problems in housing markets that have been exposed by the crisis. Understanding and addressing these institutional frictions represents a necessary step in formulating appropriate policy actions Structural Problems in Housing Market The shock to the housing market laid bare serious deficiencies in the existing infrastructure for servicing delinquent mortgage loans liquidating Stabilizing and Healing the Housing Market | foreclosed properties and adjudicating legal disputes between various parties. These deficiencies have impaired the effectiveness of loss mitigation efforts and may also be affecting borrowers ability to access mortgage credit Adjudicating Legal Disputes Rapid growth in the volume and complexity of securitized mortgage credit during the bubble years outpaced developments in case law adjudicating legal liability for representations and warranties associated with loan underwriting. The resulting legal uncertainty has the potential to impede origination of new mortgage credit if it unnecessarily adds to lender liability vis- -vis mortgage investors During the standard loan origination process an underwriter provides legally binding representations and warranties ( R&W ) backing the veracity of collected information. Representations and warranties encompass such crucial elements of the loan application as borrower income available assets and the appraised value of the house. Within a specified period of time following securitization an agent of the investors ( the Trustee ) conducts a postsale audit of loan documentation. If the Trustee finds R&W violations on a particular loan the originator is obligated to buy back that loan from the securitized pool. A similar audit may be conducted in the event of mortgage default when the discovery of R&W violations on defaulted loans would also result in the investor putting back the loan to the originator These put-back rights create a liability for originators that is designed to serve an important quality control function : the originator must bear the risk of loss on defaulted loans with R&W violations As the number of intermediaries between the underwriter and loan investor grew the transmission of this liability by each party along the chain became less well understood and quality control standards became more difficult to enforce. For example many financial institutions increasingly relied on independent mortgage brokers to carry out customer prospecting and loan underwriting especially in urban and minority-dominated neighborhoods that have been historically underserved by traditional lenders. Because mortgage brokers did not have sufficient capital to originate and hold a substantial number of loans they quickly sold their mortgages to a larger financial institution which in turn would securitize the resulting loan portfolio in broader capital markets. In effect mortgage brokers functioned as independent contractors for banks that would eventually securitize these loans. In a twist on a common description of mortgage securitization originate-to-distribute this business model was labeled as outsource-to-originate-to-distribute. | Chapter In theory established financial institutions that securitized loans had ample incentives to exercise due diligence. They retained liability for representations and warranties and carried reputational risk as well as the risk that they might not be able to pass faulty loans back to the originating mortgage brokers. Yet there is empirical evidence that at least some banks actively securitized loans originated by mortgage brokers with little or no documentation the so-called liar loans that can be easily falsified ( Jiang Nelson and Vytlacil ) The lengthening of the chain of financial intermediaries made the evaluation and assignment of liability for faulty underwriting processes considerably more complicated The complexity of the claims and the sheer number of lawsuits that are being litigated on a loan-by-loan basis suggest that court resolution will take considerable time which poses a challenge to stabilizing the housing market and accelerating a recovery Incentive Conflicts Before securitization became prevalent the majority of mortgages was funded directly by banks and other deposit-taking financial institutions These loans were held on lenders own balance sheets and were typically serviced by them as well. Securitization of mortgage credit either through GSEs or private label issuers allowed the expansion of funding to broader capital markets. As a result bank-funded ( or portfolio ) mortgages became less prevalent ceding ground to GSE and private-label securitizations ( PLS ) By the share of aggregate residential mortgage debt held on portfolio had fallen to percent from percent in while that held by the PLS investors nearly quadrupled to percent over the same time period Investors in mortgage-backed securities relied on third-party servicers to collect monthly payments transmit those payments to various investor classes and mitigate losses on nonperforming mortgages The separation of mortgage ownership and servicing gave rise to a number of incentive conflicts between loan investors and their servicers which made problem mortgages more dif icult to address. These relationf ships are generally governed by pooling and servicing agreements ( PSAs ) that specify permissible actions servicers may take in dealing with delinquent loans. Although the overriding PSA principle is maximization of the value of the loan pool some litigation was necessary to clarify this principle. Even now that the principle has been established it can be interpreted in several different ways particularly for mortgage pools with multiple investor classes or tranches. In particular junior investors that are second in line ( or lower ) to receive flows generated by mortgage pools have an incentive to legally challenge modification actions that curtail overall cash flows. The resulting Stabilizing and Healing the Housing Market | internecine tranche warfare discourages servicer actions. Indeed some observers have argued that servicers tailor their loss mitigation practices to minimize the risk of litigation by their investors. Because loan modification is an expensive and uncertain undertaking servicers may have an incentive to pursue foreclosures as the least legally contentious option. Indeed recent research found evidence of considerably lower likelihood of modifications for privately securitized mortgages than for portfolio-held loans where no conflicts of interest are present ( Piskorski Seru and Vig ; Agarwal et al. ) Moreover because servicer compensation is based on the unpaid principal balance of performing loans their incentives are skewed toward modification practices that favor reductions in interest rates and adding unpaid loan balances ( or arrears ) to the principal even when that is not the most effective approach to ensuring long-term performance of the loan These incentive conflicts coupled with the absence of established legal precedent effectively limited early modification efforts on securitized mortgages to three alternatives : adding arrears to principal and either lowering the interest rate or freezing it on adjustable-rate mortgages ( Agarwal et al. ) The unveiling of the Home Affordable Modification Program in early substantially changed the playing field for loan modifications By establishing a standardized approach to modifying mortgage contracts that explicitly maximized the return to investors as a group the program reduced the exposure of servicers performing such modifications to investor lawsuits. The HAMP standards have served as a catalyst for spurring rapid growth in mortgage modification efforts across the industry. As servicers built up their distressed loan infrastructure to accommodate HAMP they also switched their own modification focus to more aggressive methods that emphasize loan affordability Policy Actions Both the complexity of the existing challenges in the housing market and the importance to the broader economy of resolving these challenges call for a robust and multifaceted menu of policy actions. Over the past three years the Administration s housing policy has continued to expand to fit the circumstances building on the experience of the early responses to the crisis The Administration is pursuing additional innovative approaches designed to help households refinance their mortgages and maintain access to credit to avoid unnecessary and costly foreclosures to stabilize housing prices and to help communities rebuild after experiencing a wave of foreclosures and erosion in property values | Chapter Building on the Experience of Existing Programs A number of program modifications are focused on counteracting the corrosive effects of negative equity. These modifications also seek to overcome a set of institutional hurdles that have thus far limited the effectiveness of certain policy actions. In particular the Administration worked with the Federal Housing Finance Agency and private market participants to improve HARP the existing refinancing program for borrowers with insufficient or negative equity in their homes whose mortgages are guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The revised program guidelines announced in November expand the pool of eligible borrowers by removing limits on loan-to-value ratios and extending the program deadline until December The program also lowers refinancing costs by reducing unnecessary pricing overlays and negotiating favorable pricing on some of the major closing cost items such as title insurance. The revised HARP also addresses some of the difficult institutional hurdles such as coordination problems with second-lien holders and mortgage insurers. The changes also lower some of the representation and warranty requirements for existing loan servicers thereby encouraging greater lender participation. In a bid to further increase use of HARP the revised program allows servicers to solicit some potentially eligible borrowers directly. Furthermore major lenders have committed to dedicate additional origination capacity and resources to refinancing HARP borrow rs e Whereas changes in HARP were aimed at dulling the adverse effects of negative equity on the ability of currently performing borrowers to refinance their loans other HAMP initiatives tackled the issues posed by negative equity in modifying loans of delinquent borrowers. In particular the Principal Reduction Alternative ( PRA ) announced in October augments the original HAMP focus on affordability with elimination of a portion of the mortgage balance. The PRA builds on the insight that high levels of negative equity contribute to mortgage default over and above the effects of loan affordability. Consequently modifications of delinquent loans with high loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratios may be more effective if they include a principal reduction component. The PRA requires servicers of non-GSE loans to evaluate the benefit of principal reduction for loans that exceed the appraised value of the house by percent or more ( that is have LTV ratios above percent ) in making their HAMP determinations. To encourage servicers to use the PRA HAMP provides monetary incentives for investors to write down principal. At the same time the PRA seeks to lessen the risk of moral hazard by implementing principal write-down in three annual installments and making it conditional on continuous performance of the Stabilizing and Healing the Housing Market | modified mortgage. Under this earned principal reduction structure a borrower has a strong incentive to remain current which enhances the net present value of the PRA modifications to investors. To further encourage investors to evaluate the use of principal reduction in modifying problem loans the Treasury has recently announced a tripling of the PRA monetary incentives. The Treasury also offered to extend PRA incentives to Fannie Mae- and Freddie Mac-insured loans The pace of PRA modifications has picked up appreciably in the past few months with more than one in four HAMP modifications receiving principal reductions. According to the latest Treasury report more than permanent modifications that include principal reduction had been implemented by the end of November ( Department of the Treasury ) The median PRA loan had an LTV ratio of percent before modification and a target ratio after modification of percent. The median amount of principal forgiveness for active permanent PRA modifications was about $ Because servicers are not required to offer principal reduction and usually may do so only when permitted by the loan investor the growing use of the program suggests increasing acceptance of principal reduction as an effective loss mitigation tool by private investors Similar acceptance is echoed in servicer actions on private nonHAMP modifications. Several servicers have shifted their focus to principal reduction for deeply underwater delinquent loans held in securitization trusts. These reductions are typically earned over time to encourage borrowers to maintain loan performance. Principal reductions are also often coupled with a shared appreciation component that exchanges forgiven principal for an equity stake in the property. If the market value of the house in a future sale or refinancing exceeds its value at the time of principal reduction the borrower shares a part of the appreciation with the lender. Much like the earned principal reduction shared appreciation effectively raises the borrower s costs of defaulting to qualify for principal forgiveness Another HAMP-related initiative recently announced by the Department of the Treasury expands the reach of the program by broadening eligibility. One of the reasons many borrowers have not been able to take advantage of the program is that eligibility was tied to first-lien mortgages Some borrowers with high medical debts for example but relatively average mortgage burdens did not previously qualify for the program. By expanding eligibility the changes aim to extend loan modifications to such borrowers and lower the number of preventable foreclosures The Administration has also expanded housing assistance for unemployed or underemployed homeowners. To help out-of-work homeowners avoid foreclosure these programs generally provide for a period of | Chapter forbearance of all or part of the monthly mortgage payment. In July of as the length of unemployment spells continued to exceed forbearance periods for many of the unemployed homeowners the FHA and the Treasury announced the extension of forbearance to months. This change applies to mortgage servicers that participate in the HAMP s unemployment initiative program ( HAMP UP ) as well as to the FHA Special Forbearance program. Following the Administration s lead two major lenders and the GSEs have recently announced their commitment to provide up to months of mortgage payment forbearance to unemployed borrowers Mortgage payment assistance for unemployed or underemployed homeowners has become a prominent feature of state level programs developed under the Hardest Hit Fund ( HHF ) The President announced the establishment of the Fund in February to provide targeted aid to families in states that have been hit hard by the economic and housing market downturn. HHF currently provides assistance to homeowners in states and the District of Columbia. The specific programs are designed by state housing finance agencies and take into account local market conditions In addition to helping unemployed borrowers HHF programs commonly include efforts to fund innovative approaches to modification of delinquent mortgages and to allow homeowners to transition into more affordable places of residence Furthermore in June of HUD launched the Emergency Homeowners Loan Program ( EHLP ) which provided $ billion in interestfree loans to help keep borrowers in non-HHF states who are unemployed or who suffer from a severe medical condition from losing their homes. The EHLP is available to borrowers with a long track record of staying current on their mortgages but who find their ability to continue doing so compromised by job loss or illness. EHLP loans are secured by a junior lien note on the homeowner s principal residence and the balance on these loans is forgiven in percent increments for each year the borrower remains current on regular mortgage payments The Administration s Project Rebuild introduced as part of the American Jobs Act in September is another example of building on the experience of existing housing programs. While the revised HARP and the HAMP PRA focus on negative equity Project Rebuild addresses the damaging effects of foreclosed or abandoned homes on neighborhood property values economic prospects and social fabric. Project Rebuild seeks to integrate and expand strategies proven successful under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program to deal with vacant and foreclosed properties. In particular it explicitly allows federal funding to support for-profit development subject to HUD oversight. It also extends rehabilitation efforts to Stabilizing and Healing the Housing Market | commercial as well as residential properties. Project Rebuild further calls for expanding support for land banks that work at the local level to acquire hold and redevelop distressed properties. Federal funds granted under the project would provide land banks with capital infusions that can be leveraged with private-sector investments to finance long-term redevelopment strategies New Levers in Housing Policy Refinancing. The Administration has called on Congress to pass legislation that will enable more homeowners to refinance their mortgages at today s historically low interest rates. First the HARP program is available only to homeowners whose loans are owned or guaranteed by the GSEs This restriction has left some borrowers unable to refinance their loans only because their mortgages were kept on the originating bank s books or were securitized in the private as opposed to the GSE market events largely outside of a borrower s control. To remove this arbitrary distinction the Administration proposes that the FHA be authorized to offer streamlined refinancing to non-GSE borrowers with standard mortgage contracts. To limit risks to the taxpayers the proposal emulates HARP in requiring eligible borrowers to have remained current on their mortgages and to meet certain underwriting standards. Another risk-management component of the proposal includes capping the loan-to-value ratio of eligible loans Second while enhancements to HARP announced in November of will increase the reach of the program more can be done to reduce the barriers to refinancing of GSE-backed loans. Such steps would include harmonizing underwriting requirements for mortgages with LTV ratios below and above percent ; further reducing loan fees because GSEs do not acquire any new credit risk by refinancing these loans ; fully aligning the treatment of representations and warranties for refinancing with the existing or new mortgage servicers ; and removing remaining differences in HARP requirements that still exist between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac These changes are aimed at streamlining the operational requirements of the HARP program and making it more accessible to a greater number of borrowers. By leveling the playing field between existing and new servicers the proposed changes also seek to harness competitive forces to bring more interest savings to borrowers Third the Administration s proposal helps address the problem of negative equity by providing a pathway for responsible homeowners who refinance their mortgages to rebuild their equity more quickly. Under this option home owners would refinance into a shorter-maturity ( 20-year for example ) mortgage and commit to deploying the savings from refinancing | Chapter to rebuilding equity in their homes. As an example consider a borrower who has a percent mortgage originated in with an outstanding balance of $ whose house is worth $ ( a loan-to-value ratio of ) This borrower could lower the monthly payment by $ by refinancing into a 20-year mortgage at percent. Should the borrower choose to keep their mortgage payment at its original level and direct the $ in savings to principal reduction the outstanding mortgage balance would decline to $ in five years. Under the proposal underwater borrowers would have the choice of pursuing this pathway to rebuild their home equity. To assist borrowers who make this choice the proposal directs the GSEs and the FHA to cover the closing costs of their refinanced loans Servicing standards. The experience of the past few years showed that the Nation is not well served by the patchwork of rules that govern the mortgage servicing system. To improve accountability and align incentives in the mortgage servicing industry the Administration recently released a unified framework of servicing standards the Homeowner Bill of Rights that is designed to better serve borrowers investors and the overall housing market. The Administration will work closely with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and other independent regulators Congress and other stakeholders to create a more robust and comprehensive set of rules driven by a set of core principles outlined in the framework. These principles include full disclosure of all fees provided in understandable language upfront with any changes disclosed before they go into effect. The framework also requires servicers to implement standards and practices that minimize conflicts of interest such as those that exist between multiple investor classes and those that arise when the servicer simultaneously owns a secondary lien on the property. To make loss mitigation actions more timely and effective servicers are required to contact homeowners who have demonstrated hardship or fallen delinquent and provide them with a comprehensive set of options to avoid foreclosure. Servicers must further allow homeowners the right to appeal denials for mortgage modification to an independent third party and provide homeowners who find themselves in economic distress with access to a customer service employee with a complete record of previous communications with that homeowner. To minimize inappropriate foreclosure actions servicers may schedule a foreclosure sale only after they have certified in writing that all loss mitigation alternatives have been considered. To ensure compliance servicers must maintain strong controls over servicing and loss mitigation operations and subject these controls to periodic independent audits. The Homeowner Bill of Rights is meant to provide an enforceable set of rules not just guidance for the servicing industry Stabilizing and Healing the Housing Market | Conversion of Repossessed Properties into Rental Units. An orderly fair process for disposition of foreclosed properties remains a key objective of housing policy. Given the ongoing reduction in rates of homeownership many foreclosed properties will have to be converted to rental units a process that typically involves rehabilitation. The demand for this type of housing stock will come mainly from private investors whose activity to date has been hampered by execution problems in putting together property portfolios through a series of small-scale acquisitions. Tight credit conditions for financing investment properties have further limited the ability of private investors to fill the gap in demand To counteract these problems the FHFA with the Departments of Treasury and Housing and Urban Development initiated a process to manage the sale of REO properties held by Fannie Mae Freddie Mac and the FHA. The goal of this effort is to allow private investors to bid on acquiring pools of REO properties in exchange for a commitment to rehabilitate and manage the properties as rental units. Bulk purchases will make it easier for investors to achieve economies of scale as they implement their individual business strategies. Qualified bidders must demonstrate evidence of property management experience and adequate capital resources as well as agree to abide by property usage restrictions. For instance antiflipping provisions establish minimum time periods that an investor must hold the property before seeking to sell it and minimum reinvestment requirements impose certain quality standards for rented properties In many ways the REO-to-rental conversion program seeks to build on the best practices established by successful policy interventions during the crisis. The program focuses on leveraging the expertise and financial resources of private investors while preserving value for the taxpayers. It looks to avoid rigid top-down solutions allowing for customization at the local level. And it makes use of the unique position of the GSEs and FHA as owners of large nationwide inventories of distressed properties to provide a large-scale transparent and predictable mechanism for converting these properties to better suit local housing demands. Furthermore the process is intended to help the industry develop a viable framework for acquiring and managing large-scale scattered-site rental portfolios. Similar to the HAMP experience this framework may well help establish industry standards Conclusion Developments in the housing market played a central role in the financial crisis and the ensuing recession and they continue to present a headwind for the economic recovery. Although housing markets are stabilizing | Chapter in many regions the healing process will inevitably take time. This is a reflection of both the magnitude of the recent housing price collapse and the many institutional obstacles on the path to a new equilibrium. Getting to the end of this path will require unwinding accumulated inventories of foreclosed homes whether by finding new owners or by converting them to rental units. It will require enabling more homeowners to refinance their mortgages at today s low interest rates. It will require resolving multiple conflicts of interest in the modification of delinquent loans and providing meaningful assistance to unemployed homeowners as they search for new jobs that would allow them to remain in their homes. It will require restoring access to credit for responsible borrowers and repairing household balance sheets hard hit by erosion of home equity. And it will require working out legal uncertainties and fixing up mortgage finance markets Instead of waiting for these processes to play themselves out slowly and painfully the Administration has embarked on a series of multifaceted and fiscally responsible actions in partnership with private market participants and housing regulators to proactively repair the housing market and ease the transition to a new and stable equilibrium. The new policy initiatives seek to enable refinancing to unlock access to credit for responsible underwater homeowners to reallocate foreclosed properties to the rental market to prevent unnecessary foreclosures for borrowers struggling with temporary loss of income to implement sustainable modifications of delinquent loans and to repair the frayed infrastructure of mortgage servicing and mortgage finance Stabilizing and Healing the Housing Market | C H A P T E R INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINANCE O ver the past year global economic growth has slowed largely due to a range of challenges in the advanced economies. These adverse shocks are for the most part unrelated to policies or business decisions undertaken within the borders of the United States. Nevertheless in an integrated global economy the United States can not fully escape their impact One could hardly begin with a starker example of an adverse shock to the world economy than the massive earthquake that struck Japan s northeastern coast on March This earthquake was the most powerful to have hit Japan in recorded history triggering tsunami waves that leveled towns and claimed nearly lives. Alongside the devastating human toll the disaster also had a major impact on the Japanese economy. The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) estimates that the Japanese economy contracted by percent in The economic impact also extended far beyond Japan s borders. For months afterward supply chains around the world especially in the automotive industry were disrupted by production slowdowns and parts shortages While Japan s severe economic slowdown in was driven by a natural disaster those elsewhere in the developed world were largely a product of forces outside of nature. Slow growth has exacerbated sovereign debt and deficit problems in Europe and austerity measures put into place in response have impeded near-term growth in a number of euro-area countries. In January the IMF reported that the euro area s gross domestic product ( GDP ) grew percent in down from percent in and predicted that the euro area would contract by percent in Growth in the United Kingdom has also slowed significantly in part reflecting tight fiscal policies and is estimated by the IMF to have been only percent in With the European Union Japan and the United States collectively accounting for almost percent of global GDP slower growth Figure Real GDP Growth Annualized quarterly percent change Emerging markets United States European Union and Japan : Q3 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 Note : Weights come from each nation s share of GDP within each aggregate Source : Country sources ; International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook September ; CEA calculations in these economies was sufficient to lower growth at the global level in as Figure illustrates In the face of the broad-based slowdown in economic growth in the developed economies growth in emerging markets also decelerated.1 Slower growth in import demand in the large economies meant slower export growth in emerging markets.2 For example growth in China is decelerating because of a decline in export growth as well as a slowdown in domestic real estate investment. Although the IMF predicts China is likely to grow more than percent in its slowdown contributes to the loss of momentum in global growth The growth slowdown in some emerging markets also reflected the impact of policy tightening in some countries to prevent overheating. As the year progressed concerns about overheating tended to give way to concerns about the economic slowdown in the developed countries The emerging markets aggregate in Figure includes Argentina Brazil Chile China Colombia Hong Kong India Indonesia Israel Malaysia Mexico Peru Russia Singapore South Africa South Korea Taiwan Thailand Turkey Ukraine and Venezuela. Seventeen member states of the European Union ( the EU-27 ) use the euro. They are Austria Belgium Cyprus Estonia Finland France Germany Greece Ireland Italy Luxembourg Malta Netherlands Portugal the Slovak Republic Slovenia and Spain | Chapter Viewed in the context of these external challenges the growth of U.S exports over the past year has been a particular bright spot. Despite a slowing global economy America s exports of goods and services have surpassed their pre-crisis peaks and have been growing more than fast enough to meet the President s goal of doubling the export level by the end of Many factors are contributing to this fast pace of growth including continued productivity growth in manufacturing a shift in unit labor costs that favors U.S. businesses over those in other advanced countries and technological innovation in the energy sector which is improving America s trade balance in petroleum products. A possible further weakening of foreign demand conditions however could pose a risk to future U.S. export growth Global economic events could also affect the U.S. economy through financial links between the United States and the rest of the world. These links have increased dramatically in recent decades. U.S.-owned assets abroad and foreign-owned assets in the United States increased more than six-fold between and Global rebalancing has been a major theme of U.S. international economic policy since the beginning of the Obama Administration. In the years before the global financial crisis erupted in large asymmetries had developed in the global economy. Several countries characterized by large persistent current account surpluses including Germany Japan and China relied too heavily on unsustainable growth in net exports to drive economic growth. Several other countries characterized by large persistent current account deficits including the United States relied on unsustainable growth in household consumption and construction of residential real estate. A more symmetric better balanced pattern of growth is needed throughout the major economies. In the United States future growth must be driven less by consumption and more by net exports and investment. Conversely countries that have traditionally run large current account surpluses need to rely more on domestic consumption and less heavily on net exports. So far the United States has made significant progress toward rebalancing For progress to continue however U.S. exports must grow even more and consumption in the surplus countries must increase The Euro-Area Crisis and Its Implications for the United States A key potential risk in to the U.S. and global economic recoveries remains the sovereign-debt and banking crises in Europe. Economic and fiscal conditions vary greatly among the economies in the euro area as illustrated in Figure Although there is significant heterogeneity among International Trade and Finance | Figure Economic and Fiscal Indicators for Selected Euro-Area Countries a. GDP Growth ( Percent ) Greece Italy average projection Portugal Spain France Germany Netherlands Ireland Belgium Austria Finland Slovak Republic Estonia Note : Projections include revisions as of January Source : International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook September b.

Similarly the ratio of general government gross debt to GDP is projected to be roughly percent or below in Estonia Finland the Netherlands the Slovak Republic and Spain and above percent in Greece Ireland Italy and Portugal Economic research shows that there are many determinants of sovereign credit risk or sovereign borrowing costs including individual factors ( Berg and Sachs ) and global financial factors ( Eichengreen and Mody ; Longstaff et al. ) Since early both sets of factors raised borrowing costs for some smaller and a few larger economies in the euro area The European Commission ( EC ) and the IMF negotiated assistance programs for Ireland ( November ) Portugal ( May ) and Greece ( May July and October ) In October the sovereign-debt crisis intensified in Italy and Spain the third- and fourth-largest economies in the euro area.3 In response to the marked increase in sovereign borrowing costs the European Central Bank ( ECB ) intervened resuming its Securities Markets Program in an effort designed to lower sovereign bond yields by purchasing government debt in secondary markets. European leaders and institutions have also introduced and expanded various measures to inhibit contagion such as the European Financial Stability Facility. While these measures have helped contain the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe significant risks remain Market participants are expressing ongoing concerns about the fiscal conditions of Italy and Spain as well as Greece and Portugal in part because of fears that economic growth in these countries is likely to be sluggish for a prolonged period exacerbating their fiscal situation European banks are among the largest holders of European government debt. ( See Financial Stability Oversight Council for a discussion of the interconnections between U.S. banks European banks and European government debt. ) As concerns about sovereign debt rose spreads widened on sovereign bond yields relative to German bond yields in June ( as highlighted in Figure ) leading to deteriorating conditions of both solvency and liquidity among European banks. Toward the end of many European banks were facing shortened maturities and higher costs of funding in the interbank market an important source of bank liquidity In December after two successive cuts in interest rates the ECB took major steps to provide increased liquidity to euro-area banks.

Jan-2011 Jul-2011 Jan-2012 other measures the ECB s new longer-term refinancing operation extended the maturity of loans offered to banks from one year to three years and the ECB eased collateral requirements for those loans. The Federal Reserve also extended and reduced the cost of dollar liquidity swap arrangements to the ECB as it had done during the credit freeze of A currency liquidity swap is an agreement between two or more parties to exchange a set amount of a given currency for another currency at a given price until a specific date in the future. In this case the Federal Reserve provides dollars for periods ranging from overnight to as long as three months in exchange for the currency of the foreign central bank. In turn the foreign central bank can lend the dollars during the specified period in its local markets helping to relieve funding pressures in those markets and to prevent the spread of strains to markets elsewhere Given the interconnectedness of European and U.S. banks and the presence of branches agencies and subsidiaries of European banks in the United States adverse financial conditions in Europe can be transmitted to American financial institutions. According to the Federal Reserve s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey several European branches tightened standards on commercial and industrial ( C&I ) loans over the second half of in contrast to U.S. and other foreign banks. The C&I loans on the books of European branches in the United States have in fact declined noticeably since the middle of Such financial data are being monitored closely. One of the goals of recent financial oversight embedded in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is to reduce systemic risk by increasing transparency. Among other things the new law supports trading of financial instruments on central exchanges including derivatives. ( For a discussion of the role of the Office of Financial Research in fostering transparency see Data Watch ) Similarly trade and investment links between the United States and Europe are broad and deep and in recent years of growing importance relative to the rest of the world. Europe is a significant destination for U.S exports accounting for more than percent of U.S. goods exports and nearly percent of U.S. service exports. In addition sales by European affiliates of U.S. multinational firms totaled $ trillion in making up more than half of the $ trillion in total sales abroad by U.S. multinational firms. Furthermore Europe is the leading foreign source of investment and jobs in America accounting for $ billion or percent of all foreign direct investment ( FDI ) inflows into the United States in International Trade and Finance | Data Watch : The Significance of the Office of Financial Research ( OFR ) in Combating Global Risks to the U.S. Financial System The recent financial crisis presented a stark example of the need for comprehensive data on the financial system. While the initial catalyst for the financial crisis was a decline in U.S. housing prices that in led to a dramatic rise in subprime mortgage defaults ( Brunnermeier ) neither market participants nor policymakers were aware of the extent to which leverage reliance on ultra-cheap short-term funding and a web of interconnected transactions and claims had built up in the financial system prior to that time. It became clear that investors had placed too high a value on the underlying homes real estate and other assets that were supposed to stand behind their investments. Consequently as defaults on mortgages multiplied they triggered a wholesale flight from related financial securities which spread across countries and financial markets. The inadequacy of information available to assess risks properly magnified that flight from risk ( Squam Lake Working Group ) The resulting credit crunch ultimately triggered a global economic recession from which many countries are still recovering Responding to the devastating effects of the financial crisis on July Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( PL ) The creation of the OFR in that Act addresses two glaring deficiencies in the financial data infrastructure that were revealed by the crisis. First the OFR is charged with increasing the availability of financial information so that policymakers can better identify analyze and monitor potential risks to the U.S. financial system Critically given the interconnectedness of global financial markets this legislation permits the acquisition of data from financial institutions related to their activities globally that may pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. Second OFR is charged with improving the quality of financial information in part by standardizing the types and formats of data that are reported to regulators. Standardized data would make it easier for policymakers to accurately evaluate whether a financial institution or group of institutions located either domestically or abroad or certain financial activities in which they may be engaged pose a threat to the U.S. financial system Over the past eighteen months the OFR has laid the critical groundwork for enhancing both the quantity and the quality of financial information that is available to U.S. policymakers. The OFR is in the midst of comprehensively cataloguing the data that are currently held and collected by U.S. financial regulators. Concurrently the OFR will collaborate with the member agencies of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify and fill deficiencies in the collection of | Chapter data on financial markets. Likewise the OFR has taken an important step toward enhancing the quality of the financial data infrastructure through the promotion of a global Legal Entity Identifier ( LEI ) for financial institutions. At the G-20 Cannes Summit leaders supported the development of a global LEI and tasked the Financial Stability Board with coordinating this work. U.S. policymakers have partnered with the global financial services industry foreign regulators and associations such as the International Organization for Standardization to develop and begin to implement a universal standard for identifying counterparties to financial transactions ( Department of Treasury ) In time further initiatives will be undertaken to meet the information needs of regulators in fulfilling the mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and responding to potential threats to the financial stability of the United States Outlook for Europe and Implications for the U.S. Economy As noted the crisis in Europe has slowed both current and predicted growth. The IMF estimates that euro-area growth in was percent but for the IMF forecasts that economies in the euro area will contract by percent Faltering consumer confidence in Europe has spread to countries outside the euro area. Britain s Nationwide Consumer Confidence Index fell for the fifth month in a row in November reaching an all-time low of points compared with a historical average of Economic growth projections for the European Union for are lower than for : percent in compared with percent for ( IMF ) A slowdown in Europe could affect the U.S. economy through two channels in addition to the finance channel mentioned above : trade and direct investment Exports. The share of U.S. goods exports to Europe has been over percent for decades. A severe financial episode in Europe could reduce exports from businesses throughout the United States. As is the case with flows of inward investment exports to Europe are distributed broadly across the United States as displayed in Figure The European Union is the destination for more than percent of total goods exports from Alabama Connecticut Indiana Massachusetts South Carolina and West Virginia Exports range from cars aircraft and semiconductors to coal gold soybeans kaolin and live chickens. Moreover export data for commodities underestimate the extent of U.S. trade with Europe because as noted more than one-third of U.S. service exports go to Europe.

Declines in output profit and investor confidence in Europe could have an adverse effect on the ability and willingness of European firms to invest in American firms and jobs. The United States received more than $ billion in FDI from all foreign sources in over percent of which came from Europe. Between and FDI flowed into every state with Texas receiving the most followed by Alaska California New York Indiana Illinois Ohio Alabama South Carolina and Georgia International Cooperation in Resolving Crises The data in Figure starkly reflect growing concerns of market participants regarding the scope and magnitude of euro-area bank and sovereign-credit risk. In the last decade systemic risk related to financial crises has received more attention in the economics literature including studies by Allen and Gale ( ) Kaminsky Reinhart and Vegh ( ) Frankel and Wei ( ) Reinhart and Rogoff ( ) and Ang and Longstaff ( ) While Europe has the capacity to take responsibility for addressing its crisis through decisive policy action and a credible financial backstop the United States has made clear that the international community has a strong interest in the successful resolution of the crisis. The Administration | Chapter is engaging with European governments both bilaterally and in multilateral forums. The United States has also been involved in the response to the crisis through its role in the IMF The Administration continues to urge movement along several dimensions in Europe : robust implementation of countries agreed fiscal and structural reform programs in the context of steps that euro-area leaders have outlined to reform fiscal governance in the euro area ; a more substantial financial firewall to ensure that governments can borrow at sustainable interest rates while executing policies to strengthen the foundations for growth and to reduce their debts ; and measures to ensure that European banks have sufficient liquidity and are adequately capitalized to maintain the full confidence of depositors and creditors Global and U.S. economic performance will depend in part on the swift resolution of problems in the euro area. In such times of global economic and financial disequilibrium U.S. coordination with international partners remains essential Foreign Direct Investment International Trade and the U.S. Economy Experience and economic theory suggest that a global economy can provide enormous advantages for American workers consumers and firms In the absence of international trade and investment a country can consume only what it produces it can invest only what it saves it can use only the technology that it creates and it can take advantage of only those natural resources within its borders. Countries that have deliberately cut themselves off from international trade and investment for extensive periods of time have paid a stiff price in forgone opportunities for investment consumption and growth. North Korea a nation that has pursued this kind of isolation assiduously illustrates this point in a powerful and tragic way. Before Kim Il-Sung seized power in northern Korea it was at least as rich as southern Korea. Today per capita GDP in South Korea is over times higher than that of North Korea One of America s achievements after World War II was helping to build the open and integrated global trading and investment system that now incorporates almost all of the world s economies. Of course this system brings challenges along with opportunities. The Obama Administration has focused on meeting the challenges of this system in ways that enable American workers and firms to make the most of the rich opportunities provided by a more open global trading and investment system. At the same time the Administration has sought to ensure through strong enforcement International Trade and Finance | efforts that other countries play by the rules of the system and it has sought to protect those who are potentially adversely affected by global competition with a stronger safety net and an improved training and reemployment system ( discussed in Chapters and ) Investment in the United States by Foreign Companies The United States had the largest annual flow of inbound FDI of any economy in the world in every year between and By the cumulative FDI stock in the United States had reached nearly $ trillion more than three times the FDI stock in each of the next three largest recipients ( Hong Kong France and the United Kingdom ) and more than five times China s cumulative inbound FDI stock ( $ billion ) Given the rapid GDP growth of large emerging markets such as Brazil India and China both before and after the global financial crisis it is not surprising that these countries and other emerging markets are absorbing an increasing fraction of the world s FDI. Nevertheless their inflows remained substantially below those into the United States throughout this period Like trade flows FDI flows tend to be procyclical rising when the global economy expands and contracting when it shrinks. In late and as the global economy sank into its deepest postwar recession FDI inflows around the world contracted ( Figure ) ; by total FDI flows were roughly percent of their levels. Nonetheless the United States remained the largest destination for new FDI inflows. As both the U.S. and global economies recovered from the recession FDI inflows into the United States increased percent from to Then as global growth slowed again in FDI into the United States also decelerated. Through the third quarter of FDI inflows into the United States were running roughly percent below levels If the global economy returns to normal growth rates FDI inflows into the United States will likely resume their growth. The Nation continues to offer a set of fundamental attractors to foreign investors that other countries struggle to match. One such attractor is the sheer size of America s domestic market. In America s GDP was nearly two-and-a-half times larger than that of China the world s second-largest economy. The United States also offers potential investors a strong rule of law a highly skilled motivated workforce a highly developed financial system and effective protection of property rights. The United States continues to lead the world in key technologies attracting investment by firms eager to conduct worldclass research in close proximity to the world s top universities. For all of these reasons leading companies around the world continue to be attracted to investment opportunities within the borders of the United States | Chapter Figure Annual FDI Inflows Selected Countries $ Billions United States China Brazil Russia India Source : United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) The Benefits of FDI. U.S. affiliates of foreign firms make significant contributions to U.S. employment output investment research and development ( R&D ) and exports. The Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) of the U.S. Department of Commerce surveys the activities of foreign-owned affiliates in the United States. According to its data in subsidiaries of foreign companies accounted for nearly percent of U.S. private-sector jobs more than percent of all U.S. private capital investment more than percent of all U.S. private-sector R&D and percent of all U.S. goods exported. In that year the U.S. employees of these global companies earned an average annual compensation of about $ about one-third more than the economy-wide average Economic research shows that the benefits of foreign investment are even greater than these measures indicate. When foreign subsidiaries use advanced technologies and effective management to achieve high levels of productivity in their U.S. operations the benefits can spill over to their American competitors ( Keller and Yeaple ) As U.S. firms increasingly interact in their home market with highly productive foreign subsidiaries the U.S. firms may be able to learn from their competitors strengths Keller and Yeaple find that percent of the aggregate productivity growth between and ( a period of rapidly rising FDI in the United States ) resulted from FDI-related productivity spillovers. These spillovers were International Trade and Finance | particularly valuable for small firms which do not routinely encounter these competitors in markets outside the United States. One reason proximity matters is that employees who move from foreign firms to domestic firms are often an important conduit through which knowledge diffuses from foreign to domestic firms ( Poole forthcoming ) While foreign firms sometimes establish entirely new enterprises in the United States with newly constructed plants and newly hired work rs e ( known as greenfield investment ) they more often gain a foothold in the U.S. market by merging with or acquiring existing domestic businesses These transactions can be beneficial. Finally FDI can help connect domestic firms to export networks and opportunities. The importance of such connections is well documented in developing countries ( Aitken Hanson and Harrison ) but the United States can also benefit from such connections Encouraging FDI in the United States. The Obama Administration has taken vigorous steps to facilitate and promote inward FDI in the United States. As emerging markets expand the forces of economic gravity are likely to pull more and more of the world s FDI inflows into these economies. Recognizing the reality of greater global competition for FDI the Obama Administration has set up SelectUSA a one-stop shop based in the Department of Commerce that helps both foreign and U.S. investors find the best options for their prospective businesses within the borders of the United States. SelectUSA is the first systematic Federal Government initiative to identify inform assist and attract potential investors to the United States. It is also finding ways to partner with state and local economic development agencies so that governments at all levels can coordinate efforts to attract investment. In the United States state local and regional economic development organizations ( EDOs ) facilitate business investment attraction retention and expansion. SelectUSA can help these organizations compete more successfully with alternative production sites outside the United States ; it can also function as an important resource for these organizations on international investment issues SelectUSA s activities cover a broad range of investment promotion functions. Staff respond to investment inquiries help connect investors to appropriate federal and state agencies and educate investors regarding relevant U.S. policies and procedures. SelectUSA staff and senior leadership also serve as ombudsmen for the investment community in Washington working across the Federal Government to address investor concerns and issues involving federal agencies. Finally SelectUSA works with U.S. EDO officials and U.S. embassies and consulates to organize events abroad that enable U.S locales to promote themselves as a destination for FDI. President Obama has recently called for a substantial increase in support for SelectUSA proposing | Chapter $ million in new resources and an increase in staff to full-time employees. Complementing this investment President Obama has proposed to increase the presence of the Department of Commerce s U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service officers in key markets. These new officers will enhance the ability of the U.S. global network of embassies and consulates to promote FDI in the United States President Obama has also called for tax reforms that will help attract more FDI. These proposals include a decrease in the United States corporate income tax rate as well as additional tax incentives for firms that manufacture conduct R&D or invest in the capability to produce clean energy products within the borders of the United States. At the same time the President s proposals eliminate incentives for U.S. firms to move jobs and production offshore. By complementing the United States fundamental attractors with well-targeted FDI promotion efforts the Federal Government can help ensure that the United States remains a premier destination for foreign direct investment for many years to come The National Export Initiative In his January State of the Union address President Obama set a goal of doubling U.S. exports of goods and services in five years meaning that nominal exports would double from their level of $ trillion to an annual level of $ trillion by the end of To meet that goal nominal U.S. exports must grow an average of percent a year. So far exports have grown even faster putting the U.S. economy on track to meet the President s goal. In fact the United States is currently ahead of schedule despite the recent global trade slowdown. Over the months ending in November total U.S. exports of goods and services exceeded $ trillion surpassing the pre-crisis peak level of $ trillion and establishing a historical record. Current data suggest that the ratio of exports to GDP nearly reached percent in another historical record Anatomy of Recent Growth in Goods Exports. U.S. trade data provide an interesting picture of the markets and goods in which America s export growth has been concentrated since the global financial crisis. Table ranks U.S. export goods categories in order of the biggest increases in export value between the first half of and the first half of The top categories collectively account for percent of the total value increase in exports between the two periods The biggest increases have been concentrated in manufacturing industries characterized by high technology and capital intensity and in primary products reflecting America s abundant endowments of human and physical capital its technological prowess and its natural-resource wealth International Trade and Finance | Between the first half of and the first half of the United States increased its exports of vehicles by more than $ billion ( percent ) ; its exports of engines appliances and general machinery by more than $ billion ( percent ) ; and its exports of electrical machinery by more than $ billion ( percent ) Exports of plastics organic chemicals and steel and ferrous metals increased by percent percent and percent respectively. These data point to America s competitiveness in important sectors of manufacturing At the same time the data reaffirm the United States strength as an exporter of natural-resource-intensive goods. Exports of mineral fuels and oils ( a commodity dominated by shale oil ) surged by percent or more than $ billion over the two-year period. That surge stems from technological breakthroughs in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing that are allowing U.S. producers to extract oil from previously unusable areas ; these technological developments are reviewed further in Chapter Fuel exports have grown so much that the United States became a net exporter in for the first time in decades. The United States remains the world s largest importer of crude oil and U.S. net imports of crude remain large relative to net exports of fuel products but increased domestic production is offsetting some crude oil imports. Exports of gold diamonds and precious metals grew percent reflecting the high prices of those commodities on international markets Exports of cereals grew percent reflecting America s strength as a producer of agricultural commodities. This strength is also reflected in the impressive growth of total agricultural exports a broader category not shown in the table which increased by percent over the same period an expansion of $ billion in dollar terms. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that U.S. agricultural exports reached a record high of $ billion in Fiscal Year and that America s agricultural sector recorded a trade surplus of $ billion over that period. America s ranchers farmers and producers are benefiting from the Administration s focus on free trade agreements and increased market access abroad Trends Driving Growth in Goods Exports. The sharp growth in goods exports reflects in part the impact of recovering from the depth of the global financial and economic crisis. It also reflects the impact of coordinated Federal Government action flowing from the President s National Export Initiative. These actions amplify the positive influence of longer-term trends that are enhancing the competitiveness of the U.S. tradable goods sector particularly in manufacturing. U.S. workers are more productive than those of any other G-20 economy and U.S. productivity growth has been especially strong in the manufacturing sector. However highly productive | Chapter Table Growth in U.S. Goods Exports by Product Product HS-code Export growth : H1 : H1 Change ( $ Billions ) Change ( % ) 12-month sum ( Sept.

This disadvantage was especially severe in the early years of the 2000s when the enduring effects of earlier financial crises in many parts of the world depressed production costs in much of Asia Brazil Russia and elsewhere Since then continued robust productivity growth in the United States particularly in the manufacturing sector has been reinforced by a gradual realignment of the currencies of many U.S. trading partners. The result has been a sharp improvement in relative unit labor costs in the United States For example the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) tracks changes over time in the unit labor cost of manufacturing in the United States and in key trading partners. U.S. hourly compensation in manufacturing has grown over the past decade but rapid productivity growth in the United States has reduced the cost of producing a unit of manufactured output. Meanwhile measured in U.S. dollars the cost of producing a unit of manufactured output in key trading partners has risen in some cases substantially. Of the economies tracked by the BLS only Taiwan managed to improve its unit labor cost position more than the United States did.4 Figure displays changes in manufacturing unit labor costs for some of the key economies tracked by the BLS Although the BLS does not track Chinese unit labor costs it has tracked an index of import prices from China since and the most recent movements in this index suggest that Chinese unit labor costs are also rising International Trade and Finance | Percent Figure Change in Manufacturing Unit Labor Costs Taiwan Singapore Japan United Korea Sweden Germany France Canada Italy Kingdom United States Source : Bureau of Labor Statistics The impact of these shifts can be seen in a number of industries including the auto industry. As U.S. auto demand recovers the Big domestic auto companies and the foreign-domiciled companies have been expanding U.S. production. This expansion is designed not only to serve the U.S. market but also to use U.S. production sites as an export platform from which to serve other markets within the Americas and beyond. Ford has announced intentions to increase investment in the United States both to serve the U.S. market and to export. Such plans include insourcing production of its F-650 and F-750 medium-duty trucks to Ohio from Mexico ; it also reportedly plans to move manufacture of components like transmission oil pumps from China to Michigan Improved competitiveness also appears to be reflected in employment data. U.S. manufacturers have added jobs for two consecutive years something that had not happened since the late 1990s. Manufacturing employment has grown faster in the United States than in any other leading developed economy since the start of the recovery. As of the most recent period for which comprehensive data are available the United States has added more net manufacturing jobs since the start of than the rest of the Group of countries put together with over created since December While the economy is still far from recovering all the manufacturing jobs lost during the recession signs suggest that the United | Chapter States may be experiencing a manufacturing revival. Between : Q1 and : Q3 manufacturing employment rose percent in the United States compared with percent in Germany and percent in Canada In some industries the advantage created by high U.S. productivity is reinforced by the additional advantage of abundant domestic low-cost natural gas. Only a few years ago leaders of the domestic organic chemical industry predicted that shortages in natural gas would dramatically raise the domestic price of natural gas one of their key inputs. Without adequate domestic supplies of natural gas at reasonable prices it seemed likely that chemical production would have to shift overseas Since the mid-2000s however the discovery of new natural gas reserves such as those within the Marcellus Shale Formation and the development of hydraulic fracturing techniques to extract natural gas from these reserves have led to rapidly growing domestic production and relatively low domestic prices for households and downstream industrial users. By keeping domestic energy costs relatively low the increased supply from this resource supports energy-intensive manufacturing in the United States. In fact companies such as Dow Chemical and Westlake Chemical have announced intentions to make major investments in new U.S. facilities over the next several years. In the longer run the scale of America s natural gas endowment appears to be large enough that exports of natural gas to other major markets could be economically viable. The Obama Administration is taking steps to ensure that this resource is developed in a safe and environmentally responsible way However in most of the manufacturing industries where American firms con inue to enjoy robust export sales U.S. producers rely principally t on high productivity rather than inexpensive inputs to offset the higher wages and other labor compensation they pay their U.S. workers. The openness and competitive intensity of the American economy have been a key source of our national strength since they have increased the efficiency of U.S. firms and industries. ( See Hsieh and Klenow for recent research. ) As a consequence even extremely low wages in developing countries are not sufficient to provide a commanding cost advantage with respect to U.S. firms at least in some product categories Exports can also be measured by looking at major destination markets. Table ranks destination markets by the increase in value of exports between the first half of and the first half of The top markets collectively accounted for percent of the total increase in export value Export flows to Canada and Mexico increased by nearly $ billion. Much of the rest of the U.S. export expansion was driven by exports to Asia.

The main components of the current account include exports and imports of goods exports and imports of services and the income balance the difference between the income American firms earn from their foreign businesses and the income foreign firms earn from their U.S. businesses A look at the recent history of the U.S. current account balance and its key components reveals some interesting patterns. Although U.S. exports of goods are at historical highs reflecting in part the improved competitiveness of American manufacturers the U.S. trade deficit in goods ( which does not include trade in services ) has nevertheless widened significantly since early as an expanding economy has boosted demand for imports ( Figure ) The trajectory of the U.S. current account however is following a different path now than it did in the previous recovery and the difference primarily reflects the impact of the other two main elements of the current account services trade and the U.S. income balance | Chapter From the early 2000s through the current account balance tracked the trade balance in goods quite closely. The two series began to diverge in late The balance on goods remained in deep deficit but the trade surplus in services began to increase and the income balance grew even more rapidly. When the global financial crisis hit in earnest in the third quarter of U.S. growth and import demand dried up and the two series moved closely together ( this time rapidly toward balance ) through early Then as financial markets stabilized and growth resumed a gap opened up once again. The balance on goods deteriorated but the services surplus expanded and the income balance grew even more sharply largely offsetting the declining balance in goods and keeping the current account relatively stable. More recently the goods trade balance appears to have broadly stabilized whereas the services surplus and the income balance continue to grow. With a need to further strengthen the current account balance federal policymakers recognize the need not only to encourage exports of goods but also to expand the important role that services trade can play in that process The Prospects for Trade Growth in Services. Like most other advanced economies U.S. GDP is dominated by service industries. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis services broadly defined account for more than percent of U.S. GDP. However the role of business services within Figure U.S. Current Account Balance and Its Components $ Billions Balance on income Balance on services Overall current account balance Balance on goods : Q1 : Q3 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 Note : The current account balance above includes goods services and income but does not include unilateral transfers Source : Bureau of Economic Analysis International Trade and Finance | the U.S. economy is less widely recognized. In a year unaffected by the recent severe downturn and gradual recovery business services a collection of industries that includes finance engineering services research and development services and software production employed percent of the U.S. workforce according to data from the Economic Census. The share of employment in business services was substantially larger than in the entire manufacturing sector in that year ( percent ) and the average wage in business services $ was significantly higher than in manufacturing ( $ ) ( Jensen ) While services remain more difficult to trade than goods advances in communications technologies and the growing ease and declining expense of international travel are making business services increasingly tradable across countries. As this trend gained strength employment in the business service sector increased almost percent between and while manufacturing employment decreased more than percent. Most tradable business services rely intensively on highly skilled experts which the United States has in large numbers. In other words the growing tradability of business services plays to America s comparative advantage. Some evidence of this potential is apparent when one looks at the broader context of America s trade across the full range of service industries Services exports have expanded dramatically growing by percent between and according to official data. They now account for nearly percent of total U.S. exports. Imports of services have also expanded rapidly but the U.S. surplus in services trade already large has more than tripled since What are the categories of services exports and what is their relative contribution to the surplus ? Figure depicts the aggregate service trade flows in the five main categories tracked by official statistics and measures their contribution to America s overall services trade surplus Travel exports reflect the spending of foreign tourists and business travelers to the United States who purchase goods and services here while travel imports reflect purchases made by U.S. residents traveling abroad The United States remains among the world s leading tourist destinations and runs a surplus in travel trade. The Obama Administration has sought to expand U.S. travel exports with unprecedented federal action to promote international tourism in the United States. In the President signed into law the Travel Promotion Act which established the Corporation for Travel Promotion now known as Brand USA a public-private partnership dedicated to promoting travel to the United States. The State Department has also increased its visa-processing capacity in priority countries like Brazil | Chapter Thousands Figure Contribution to Services Surplus by Service Sector Category $ Billions Royalties and license fees Other private services Travel Passenger fares Other transportation Source : Bureau of Economic Analysis and China to ensure that the United States benefits from the rapid expansion of outbound tourism from these emerging markets Moreover on January the President established a Task Force on Travel and Competitiveness that will develop a National Travel and Tourism Strategy with a goal of making the United States the world s top travel and tourism destination. The benefits of that strategy include not only the potential increase in travel exports but also lower travel imports as it will provide Americans with more and better choices of travel and tourism destinations within the United States. Because of their value as public goods the government has an important role in ensuring that national treasures such as Yellowstone National Park and the Statue of Liberty are appropriately maintained and made accessible to domestic and international tourists While there are many private state and local destinations in the United States public expenditures on the National Park System ( NPS ) are much lower than the benefits they provide to all Americans even to those who are not necessarily planning a vacation or visit to one of the destinations that make up the NPS ( National Research Council ) This provides yet another example of the ways in which investments in the environment yield benefits for the economy ( Chapter ) In the category of passenger fares exports are those received by U.S carriers from foreign residents ; imports are those paid by U.S. residents International Trade and Finance | to foreign carriers. Other transportation exports and imports include U.S international transactions arising from the transportation of goods by ocean air land pipeline and inland water carriers Royalties and license fees cover transactions with nonresidents that involve intangible assets including patents and trade secrets which are involved in the production of goods. This category also includes copyrights trademarks franchises rights to reproduce or distribute motion pictures and television recordings rights to broadcast live events software licensing fees and other intellectual property rights. In this category was the largest single contributor to the services surplus highlighting the importance to the United States of enforcement of strong intellectual property rights in other countries.5 The final category other private services ( OPS ) generates by far the highest level of exports and it is this category in which the promise of business services exports is seen. The main services included in OPS are education financial insurance telecommunications and business professional and technical services. The most important subcategory business professional and technical services accounts for more than half of OPS exports. Altogether OPS exports expanded by about percent from through a compound average growth rate of nearly percent a year The additional detail on service exports and imports presented in Table and Table underlines two important facts about U.S. services trade. First the other advanced industrial countries are still America s dominant trading partners in this sector both as markets and as suppliers As rapid economic growth raises income levels in large emerging markets however U.S. service export flows to these countries are likely to grow Second as noted the surplus in services is disproportionately driven by two categories other private services and royalties and licensing that are skillintensive and thus conform to America s comparative advantage as a technologically advanced nation with an abundant supply of highly educated workers. This supply of skilled workers and the broader role that education plays in the U.S. labor market is discussed in Chapter In addition to exporting services U.S. firms provide services through affiliates in foreign markets. Over the past decade services provided through affiliates have grown rapidly and in the most recent year for which comprehensive data are available services supplied through the foreign affiliates of U.S. firms totaled $ trillion. Of course U.S. customers also In fact the official numbers for royalty and license fees may understate perhaps substantially America s receipts for the use of its intangible assets. A report submitted last year by leading international economists ( Feenstra et al. ) noted the ability of multinational corporations to effectively locate their intellectual property in low-tax jurisdictions minimizing their global tax liability as well as measured U.S. royalties and license fees | Chapter purchase services from the U.S. affiliates of foreign firms. These purchases totaled $ billion in The difference between services received from and supplied to the United States via the channel of affiliate sales was $ billion providing yet another reflection of America s comparative advantage in this domain ( Koncz-Bruner and Flatness ) Policy Initiatives to Support Export Growth in Goods and Services Recent economic research has focused on U.S. firm productivity and the fixed cost of exporting as fundamental determinants of U.S. exports at the firm and product level ( Bernard et al. ; Melitz ) Fixed costs for firms are associated not only with the decision to begin exporting but also with the decision to export to a specific country. Before significant exports to a given country can begin a prospective exporting firm must develop a strategy that allows it to compete successfully against experienced rivals in that country which operates under a different legal system and may use a different language. Successful exporters must invest considerable management attention and time to developing this strategy before they can begin to earn any returns from exporting. The costs of serving a particular foreign market may also increase if the firm s products and complementary services must be significantly altered to meet the demands and tastes of customers in that market. Exporters also must incur the costs of finding distribution channels in the foreign country and the ongoing costs of transporting their goods across national borders and contending with tariff or nontariff barriers to trade. These costs are worth incurring only if the firm is dynamic and productive enough to have a high probability of success Federal programs exist to help firms deal with these costs. While private firms must take the lead in crafting their export strategies the Department of Commerce s International Trade Administration maintains offices of trade professionals in more than U.S. communities and foreign countries to help U.S. firms become export-ready identify target markets and navigate the demands of foreign regulation and cultural differences. The Federal Government can also use effective multilateral bilateral or regional trade negotiations to reduce the costs imposed on U.S. firms by foreign tariff and nontariff barriers. It can also seek to ensure that American firms face a level playing field by insisting that U.S. trading partners honor their treaty commitments regarding market access for U.S. firms. Finally in circumstances in which a particular exporter faces financing constraints or the threat of subsidized finance for international competitors the Federal Government can seek to alleviate these constraints and counter foreign International Trade and Finance | Table Cross-Border Services Exports by Type and Country Exports ( $ Millions ) Country Royalties Passenger Other transand license fares portation fees Other private services Total private services Travel All countries Total for the top countries Canada United Kingdom Japan Ireland Germany Mexico China Switzerland Brazil France Other countries Source : Bureau of Economic Analysis Table Cross-Border Services Imports by Type and Country Imports ( $ Millions ) Country Royalties Passenger Other transand license fares portation fees Other private services Total private services Travel All countries Total for the top countries Canada United Kingdom Japan Ireland Germany Mexico China Switzerland Brazil France Other countries Source : Bureau of Economic Analysis | Chapter government efforts. Over the past three years the Obama Administration has placed renewed emphasis on all of these policy domains Free Trade Agreements with Colombia Panama and Korea. The Obama Administration has worked to restore the Nation s economic stability and support jobs for more Americans with the expansion of smart responsible trade policy. From day one the Obama Administration has insisted on higher standards for trade agreements. The President moved to address important concerns that the Administration certain stakeholders and Members of Congress had with respect to the situations in Colombia Panama and Korea. This domestic consultation and further consultations with U.S. trading partners took time as did negotiations with Congress to ensure that the passage of the free trade agreements was accompanied by a strengthening of America s Trade Adjustment Assistance program for workers adversely impacted by international competition and by an extension of key trade preference programs. Once this process was complete Congress passed the three agreements in quick succession in the fall of marking the biggest step forward in American trade liberalization in nearly two decades. Of the three agreements the most economically significant was the Korea United States free trade agreement which was expected to boost annual U.S. goods exports to Korea by as much as $ billion. The agreement also included Korean commitments expected to result in considerable expansion of U.S. services exports The Trans-Pacific Partnership. In November President Obama announced the Administration s intention to participate in Trans-Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) negotiations to conclude a free trade agreement with key trading partners in the Asia-Pacific region. The agreement aims to set a new and higher standard for regional free trade agreements not only addressing the traditional core issues in such agreements but broadening the scope to include regulatory coherence and priorities for small and medium-size enterprises. In addition to the United States the other countries participating in the negotiations currently include Australia Brunei Darussalam Chile Malaysia New Zealand Peru Singapore and Vietnam At the November APEC meeting in Honolulu TPP leaders announced the broad outlines of a TPP agreement. In addition to existing negotiating partners Japan Canada and Mexico have formally expressed their interest in joining TPP negotiations. While no decision has been made yet by the TPP countries regarding expanding negotiations interest by Japan Canada and Mexico in the TPP demonstrates the economic and strategic importance of this initiative to the Asia-Pacific region Support for Small Exporters. In a world of imperfect financial markets the costs of financing export operations pose an additional barrier for International Trade and Finance | smaller firms. Given that export opportunities can come to small exporters with significant risks attached domestic financial institutions may regard a small firm that is highly dependent on exports as a riskier ( and therefore less creditworthy ) borrower than one with an exclusively domestic focus. The relatively modest financing needs of small exporters are a further disincentive to private financial institutions which would have to engage in timeconsuming assessments of the firm its products and the country-specific risks involved in a transaction to originate only a small loan with limited value for the lending institution. Unless it is obvious to the lender that the firm has excellent prospects for significant export growth and brings with it the near certainty of rapid expansion in loan volume the money a private bank can make on such a transaction is limited relative to the transaction costs themselves To address these issues the Federal Government has directed the Export-Import Bank of the United States to proactively support small and medium-size firms. First established in the 1930s to finance U.S international trade when and where private-sector financing was difficult or unreasonably costly to obtain the Ex-Im Bank has historically focused much of its lending activity on larger established exporters. The Obama Administration however has encouraged the bank to substantially increase lending to smaller firms and in Fiscal Year the Ex-Im Bank authorized $ billion percent of its total authorizations to support small businesses as primary exporters. The Ex-Im Bank approved transactions involving small business exporters percent of total authorizations. In the same year the bank issued insurance policies to small business exporters percent of such policies for the year. The bank also authorized a record $ billion in working-capital guarantees percent of which supported small business Financial support for the expanding international activities of small business extends beyond the Ex-Im Bank. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation ( OPIC ) the U.S. Government s development finance institution extends medium- to long-term financing through direct loans loan guaranties political risk insurance and support for investment funds to eligible investment projects in developing and emerging markets where conventional financial institutions often are reluctant or unable to lend. In Fiscal Year percent of OPIC s projects representing nearly $ billion in commitments involved American small and medium-sized businesses.6 The Ex-Im Bank and OPIC follow the Small Business Administration s definition of a small business using guidelines that reflect among other things sales employment levels and sector of economic activity. These guidelines are available online at http : //www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/Size_Standards_Table.pdf | Chapter Promoting U.S. Economic Interests Abroad. Even as it seeks to open up new markets for American business through new trade agreements the Obama Administration is also working to protect American commercial interests under existing trade agreements. An historic victory came in May when the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) issued a final ruling siding with the United States in its case against the European Union over illegal subsidies to Airbus. After decades of dispute and more than five years of official proceedings the WTO ruled that the EU governments had provided $ billion in illegal subsidies to Airbus and ordered them removed by the end of the year. U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk hailed the ruling saying The WTO Appellate Body has confirmed without a doubt that Airbus received massive subsidies for more than years and that these subsidies have greatly harmed the United States including causing Boeing to lose sales and market share in key markets throughout the world. If the European Union fails to comply with the WTO directive the United States can seek the right to impose countermeasures In its ongoing dialogue with China the Obama Administration secured a strong commitment from Chinese President Hu Jintao that China would stop discriminating against U.S. technologies and intellectual property in its government procurement plans. The Administration is monitoring developments closely to ensure that market realities conform to central government directives. The United States has filed a WTO case against China challenging the troubling imposition by China of antidumping and countervailing duties against imports of U.S. chicken broiler products. The Administration scored another major victory in January when the WTO s Appellate Body upheld a WTO panel ruling condemning Chinese export quotas and duties on certain key industrial raw materials as a violation of China s WTO commitments. These actions add to a series of cases in which the Federal Government has taken action at the WTO to protect U.S. economic interests jeopardized by Chinese policy in areas such as steel products electronic payment services and wind power equipment In November the United States gained China s confirmation through bilateral negotiations that it would not require foreign electric vehicle manufacturers to transfer technology to Chinese enterprises or to establish Chinese brands as a condition for investing and selling in China One year earlier the United States successfully persuaded China to adopt transparent and non-discriminatory technology standards for its emerging smart grid market and to remain technologically neutral with regard to the development of third-generation and future technologies for its telecommunications market International Trade and Finance | Several of America s trading partners including China have effectively imposed bans on U.S. meat product exports. These bans have no scientific basis and the Administration has been trying to bring these bans to an end as soon as possible. In agreements were reached to resume exports to Chile and Egypt. Fifty-seven countries have removed their avian influenza bans on imports of poultry products from the United States since Most of the countries that imposed bans on the import of U.S. swine pork and pork products in the wake of international concern over the H1N1 virus have removed those bans With strong support from the United States Russia concluded negotiations to join the WTO in December In supporting Russia s WTO accession the Obama Administration has laid the basis for a more effective rules-based approach to managing U.S. trade relations with the largest economy not yet inside the WTO system. The Administration will be working with Congress to end application of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to Russia so that the United States can enjoy all of the benefits of Russia s membership in the WTO and U.S. companies and workers can compete on a level playing field with those of other WTO Members in exporting products and services to Russia.7 To further enhance the Federal Government s ability to protect the Nation s commercial interests the President is creating and seeking funding for a new Trade Enforcement Unit which will significantly enhance the Administration s capabilities to aggressively challenge unfair trade practices under international and domestic trade rules. The President is also proposing to improve trade inspection capabilities of the Customs and Border Patrol and the Food and Drug Administration to increase the likelihood of stopping counterfeit pirated or unsafe goods before they enter the U.S. market Certain countries including China aggressively use subsidized capital to promote their exports and appear to offer such export financing on better terms than allowed under current international best practices. In response the Administration will actively employ its existing authorities so that the Ex-Im Bank can provide U.S. firms competing for domestic or third-country sales with matching financial support to counter foreign noncompetitive official financing that fails to observe international best practices The IMF estimates that sub-Saharan Africa will grow by percent in faster than advanced emerging and developing economies as a whole. Between and five of the fastest-growing economies in the world were in sub-Saharan Africa and trade between Africa and the The Jackson-Vanik amendment is a provision in the Trade Act that denies most favored nation status to certain countries that restrict emigration. It was introduced during the Cold War partly as a response to efforts by the Soviet Union to restrict emigration | Chapter rest of the world increased more than percent. Central to the United States economic policy for Africa is the African Growth and Opportunity Act ( AGOA ) which provides duty-free access to a broad range of exports from eligible sub-Saharan African countries. To help African countries make the most of AGOA s trade benefits the United States funds technical assistance work at Regional Trade Hubs. The United States also fosters investment by negotiating Bilateral Investment Treaties ( BITs ) with African countries. In the United States launched BIT negotiations with Mauritius and in the U.S. Senate ratified the U.S.-Rwanda BIT In agriculture and other sectors the U.S. Agency for International Development uses public-private partnerships to build new markets and has been recognized by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as the best among its peers with respect to private-sector engagement. The Millennium Challenge Corporation ( MCC ) is partnering with American and local businesses. From helping the Port of Cotonou in Benin cut its average customs-clearance time in half to facilitating an American company s efforts to provide much-needed power to Tanzania s national grid the MCC is investing in infrastructure to expand trade commerce and development across the African continent. Other agencies including OPIC and the Ex-Im Bank have significantly increased their investment in Africa. These activities are consistent with the goals of President Obama s Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development signed in September that establishes a new model for U.S. development efforts Tax Reform to Promote American Competitiveness. The Administration s proposed reform of the U.S. corporate income tax seeks to enhance American competitiveness promote investment in the United States and support continued robust growth of American exports. As part of a comprehensive tax reform plan the President has proposed a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate with additional incentives available for firms that manufacture conduct research and development or invest in the capability to produce clean energy products within the borders of the United States. At the same time the President addresses longstanding features of the American corporate tax system that encourage some companies to move jobs and production overseas Increasing Market Access for Services. As noted the United States has a strong comparative advantage in services. The global market for services trade however remains far more closed than the global market for manufactured goods. The long history of extensive trade in goods the relatively simple nature of many barriers ( tariffs and quotas ) to such trade and the cumulative result of six decades of multilateral bilateral and regional trade International Trade and Finance | liberalization efforts have resulted in a global economy in which formal barriers to trade in manufactured goods are reasonably low especially in the advanced industrial countries The barriers to trade in services are more complex and harder to quantify. Hufbauer Schott and Wong ( ) review a number of methodologies for quantifying the barriers to trade in services and present new estimates at the country level of the tariff equivalents of these barriers. Their findings suggest that the aggregate level of discrimination against services imports in important emerging markets such as China India and Indonesia is equivalent to a tariff on these imports of more than percent. The size of these barriers may not be surprising extensive international trade in services is a recent phenomenon and diplomatic efforts to open services markets are just beginning but these barriers deprive American firms of critical export opportunities to rapidly emerging markets in an area where their international comparative advantage is the strongest America s productive exporters of services can not solve this problem on their own. The President is committed to negotiating effectively and aggressively for increased liberalization of services trade. The Administration has already made progress in bilateral and regional trade agreements but the largest emerging-market economies have not yet been fully engaged in these initiatives. The primary multilateral means for seeking greater services market access has been through negotiations pursuant to the General Agreement on Trade in Services ( GATS ) and to a lesser degree the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement. While taking existing GATS disciplines and market access commitments into account the United States is also pursuing additional pathways to services liberalization including a new multiparty agreement open to any country ready to take on high standards and address new issues such as trade in the digital economy. Other advanced countries and progressive developing countries are likely to share the U.S. interest in pushing for greater liberalization of services trade and may be willing partners in this effort Recent scholarship demonstrates that services liberalization is in the interest of countries that are importing services as well as those that are exporting services. Better access to world-class services raises productivity and living standards in emerging-market economies. Interesting evidence on this point comes from a randomized experiment in India ( Bloom et al ) Researchers based at Stanford University and the World Bank randomly selected a set of Indian textile factories to receive a complimentary five-month program of consulting services from a leading international firm Upon arriving in these factories the researchers and consultants found that productivity was hampered by poor management practices. Over the next | Chapter five months the consultants worked with the firms to implement standard management practices proven to have enhanced productivity output and profitability in the West. When the project ended the treated factories had cut defects roughly in half substantially reduced inventories and increased output while the control factories saw little change. The authors calculate that these performance improvements increased profits by about $ a year. These are sufficiently large increases that the firms would have made enough money from the consulting projects to be able to pay the consultants commercial rates for their engagement in the projects Given the magnitude of the improvement why had the firms not adopted these practices earlier ? The researchers results suggest that informational barriers were the primary factor explaining the lack of adoption What is true for India is likely to be true throughout the developing world By reducing barriers to trade in services developing countries can help their own firms move toward the productivity frontier achieved in the West Conclusion Over the course of the pace of growth in the global economy slowed posing challenges for the U.S. recovery. Nevertheless U.S. exports have climbed to record high levels the current account deficit narrowed to percent of GDP in the third quarter and the economy has begun to rebalance its sources of growth laying the foundation for sustained future expansion. The greatest threats to continued progress in these domains lie beyond America s borders. Provided Europe s debt crisis can be resolved America s export growth and progress toward rebalancing are likely to continue at a brisk pace. Other developments in the global economy notably the continued expansion of international trade in services and the interest of major trading partners in new U.S. trade initiatives provide a foundation of new opportunities on which the U.S. economy can build in the years to come International Trade and Finance | C H A P T E R JOBS AND INCOME : TODAY AND TOMORROW R ecessions caused by financial crises typically cause large declines in aggregate demand as households that have borrowed excessively during the boom years bring down their debt during and after the recession This deleveraging cycle takes time and disrupts the labor market because reductions in consumer spending mean that employers require fewer workers to satisfy customer demand. Long-term problems that have been building over several decades pose a further set of challenges for the labor market Inequality was sharply rising and earnings were stagnant for middle-income families for many years before the latest recession. And job growth from the end of the recession through was the weakest for any recovery in more than five decades. The Great Recession exacerbated these problems Despite the severe damage caused by the recession that began in December the labor market is gradually improving. Sustained privatesector job growth resumed more quickly after the official end of the recession than it did after the two previous recessions ( Figure ) Private employers have now added jobs on net every month since February In million private-sector jobs were added to the economy the most in any year since But given the depth of the recession the recovery has not yet resulted in enough new jobs to replace all of those that were lost Continuing the recovery is essential to putting more Americans back to work. And even as the economy and job market recover long-term trends that predate the recession continue to pose a challenge for American families and businesses. Responding to these challenges the President has proposed measures that independent economists predict would create millions of jobs To make sure that Americans are equipped to compete in the economy of the future the President has also taken steps to improve K education and to make college more accessible and affordable for middle-class families Figure Monthly Change in Private-Sector Employment Thousands Jan-12 Jan-1980 Jan-1985 Jan-1990 Jan-1995 Jan-2000 Jan-2005 Jan-2010 Note : The large fluctuations in private-sector employment in were due to strike activity. Shading denotes recession Source : Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics actions that should help to mitigate the long-term trend of growing income inequality Jobs and Employment The traditional pattern has been that as both the U.S. economy and population have grown so too has the number of jobs filled by American workers. Between January and July from business-cycle peak to business-cycle peak total U.S. employment grew by an average of net new payroll jobs a month ; it grew even more quickly at a rate of payroll jobs a month between July and March again from business-cycle peak to business-cycle peak. But this long-term pattern of job growth changed around the turn of the millennium. Between March and December the economy added a monthly average of only total jobs and only private-sector jobs. U.S. job creation slowed even as productivity growth remained relatively strong and even as other developed countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada maintained robust job growth Against this backdrop of weak employment growth beginning in about the economy fell into recession in December and began to shed jobs at the end of at a rate unprecedented in the postwar era | Chapter During and the economy lost an average of jobs a month reaching a high of jobs in January As the recession continued the unemployment rate doubled from percent in April to a peak of percent in October a rate not seen since ( Figure ) Soon after the President signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( Recovery Act ) on February the pace of job loss slowed. The private sector has added jobs in each of the past months registering a cumulative gain of million jobs since February including million jobs in Private-sector job growth has averaged jobs per month since February and jobs per month in the last three months ( ending in January ) The recession has had a large and continuing negative fiscal impact on State and local governments however and they continue to shed workers thus offsetting some of the private-sector job growth. Nonetheless with the support provided by the Recovery Act and by the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance extensions contained in the Tax Relief Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of the U.S. economy has added jobs in every month since February excluding temporary Census hires. The continuing recovery has brought the unemployment rate down from a peak of percent in October to percent in January Percent Figure Unemployment Rate Jan-12 Jan-1980 Jan-1985 Jan-1990 Jan-1995 Jan-2000 Jan-2005 Jan-2010 Note : Shading denotes recession Source : Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics Jobs and Income : Today and Tomorrow | The percentage point decline in the unemployment rate that occurred in is the largest in any calendar year since The pace of the recovery has varied across sectors of the economy with those sectors most harmed by the financial crisis the slowest to recover Since February when the private sector began consistently adding jobs job growth has been strong in industries such as education and health services ( jobs as of January ) ; trade transportation and utilities ( jobs ) ; and manufacturing ( ) but is still weak in some sectors notably construction ( jobs ) and State and local government ( jobs ) The continued weakness in these two sectors reflects the severity of the financial crisis and the recession s impact on the housing market and on government revenues The pace of recovery has also differed across demographic groups The Hispanic unemployment rate reached a peak of percent twice first in August and then again in November The unemployment rate for African Americans reached percent in March and then again as recently as August The unemployment rates for Hispanics and African Americans as of January are well below their respective peaks down percentage points for Hispanics and percentage points for African Americans but still remain elevated Trends in the labor force participation rate and in the employmentto-population ratio that pre-date the recession and were exacerbated by the recession are a continuing concern. After trending upward for most of the post-World-War-II period largely because of increases in the fraction of women in the labor force the participation rate has been in a secular decline since the late 1990s driven by declining participation of Americans between the ages of and as well as by the aging of the workforce. These same developments have also lowered the employment-to-population ratio. The labor force participation rate fell further in the recession. As discussed in Chapter many of those who have left the labor force since the beginning of the recession have enrolled in school Extended unemployment insurance benefits have encouraged workers who lost their jobs through no fault of their own to keep searching for work thereby maintaining a connection to the labor force. Helping more Americans get back to work more quickly remains the top priority of the Administration s economic policy. That is why in September President Obama proposed the American Jobs Act to support and speed up the ongoing recovery for American workers and their families. More recently the President s State of the Union Address and Fiscal Year Budget laid out a blueprint for an economy built to last on American manufacturing American energy skills for American workers and American values | Chapter The Dynamics of Labor Market Trends Underlying the changes in employment is a dynamic process through which firms are born and die jobs are gained and lost and workers transition in and out of employment and between jobs. These labor market dynamics have strong cyclical properties that have been very much at work during and since the recession but secular trends are also changing the functioning of the U.S. labor market over the long run Job Dynamics The job market is dynamic with new firms entering and others exiting and some growing and others contracting. The dynamic job market is supported by a safety net that helps to protect workers when job transitions do not occur smoothly and that gives entrepreneurs a backstop when they take risks with potentially high payoffs in future productivity. The importance of the many facets of the safety net is discussed in detail in Chapter These job dynamics are characterized by gross flows of job gains and job losses across firms. Gross job gains are measured as jobs created in new and expanding firms while gross job losses are measured as jobs that disappear in firms that are contracting or closing.1 Net job growth in a given period is the difference between gross job gains and gross job losses : where and NETt is the net number of jobs created by firms in the economy in period t ; Gt is the amount of gross job gains in the period ; Lt is the amount of gross job losses ; i is a firm ; C is the set of firms that are either new or have grown in period t ; D is the set of firms that have either exited or contracted in period t ; and N is the number of jobs To calculate the rates of net job growth gross job gains and gross job losses each of these values is divided by overall employment in the economy Alternative measures of gross job gains and gross job losses use units of observation other than the firm such as the establishment generally a physical location of business activity where goods and services are produced. Using units smaller than firms leads to higher rates of gross gains and losses because jobs that flow across the units within a firm are counted in the gross measures Jobs and Income : Today and Tomorrow | averaged between one period and the next period. So for example the rate of gross job gains in period t is : Recent work by economists using the Business Dynamic Statistics ( BDS ) data at the U.S. Census Bureau demonstrates the tremendous dynamism of private-sector employment in the United States ( Haltiwanger Jarmin and Miranda ; Haltiwanger ) Between and ( the most recent year of BDS data ) approximately percent of all jobs in the private sector in an average year were added in that year at new or expanding firms ; approximately percent of jobs in an average year were gone by the next year because firms closed or contracted. While both large and small firms contribute to gross job gains and losses small firms tend to gain and lose jobs disproportionately and to account disproportionately for net job growth Recent research suggests that an important part of the explanation for the disproportionate amount of both gross job gains and gross job losses accounted for by small firms is that they tend to be young. Put differently startups and other young firms drive the large rates of job gains and losses in small firms. Between and for example percent of overall gross job gains each year were in new firms mostly small new firms even though new firms accounted for only percent of employment ( Data Watch ) These numbers make clear the importance and contribution of America s entrepreneurs to the dynamism of the economy The annual average rates of job gains and losses between and mask two important features of heterogeneity across time secular or long-term trends and cyclical patterns. The rates of both gross gains and gross losses have been declining over time. Whereas on average percent of private-sector jobs in the 1980s were newly created positions in startups or expanding firms gross job gains fell to percent of total private-sector employment in the 1990s and to percent between and ( Figure ) Similarly gross job losses were slightly more than percent of overall private-sector employment in the 1980s but fell to percent in the 1990s and then remained largely the same between and These secular declines also are apparent when one focuses more narrowly on startups. Gross job gains from startups accounted on average The data on U.S. firms capture gross flows over a 12-month period beginning and ending in March. So for example the rate of job gains in year t = refers to information on jobs gained in firms between March and March | Chapter Data Watch : Measurement of Startups Research based on a new Census Bureau data set called the Longitudinal Business Database ( LBD ) has led to new discoveries about the important role that startups play in creating jobs. The LBD contains annual information on virtually the entire universe of U.S. nonfarm private businesses that paid Federal payroll and income taxes between and and it will continue to be updated as new data become available LBD data are available both at the level of the firm a measurement unit combining all of the economic activity of a business that occurs under common operational control and at the level of individual establishments physical locations of economic activity where goods and services are produced. The initial data are derived from quarterly Internal Revenue Service filings that are compiled by the Census Bureau and augmented with data collected through the Census Bureau Economic Censuses and business surveys. The final LBD data set contains annual information on payroll employment size industry and other key economic variables for both firms and establishments One of the key advances of the LBD is its ability to track the births and deaths of firms. When a new economic entity is reported in the administrative sources used to create the LBD the Census Bureau determines whether that new economic entity is a new firm a new establishment that is part of an existing firm or an establishment that has undergone a change in legal form because of a merger change in ownership or some other similar change. Through this process the Census Bureau is able to identify essentially all new private payroll startups The creation of the LBD has allowed researchers to study comprehensively the process of private-sector job gains and losses. One of the most important findings has been how important startups are to the dynamism of the U.S. economy. For example Haltiwanger Jarmin and Miranda ( ) find that about million net new private-sector jobs were gained in Firm startups created nearly million net new jobs in that year while all other firms together lost about million jobs on net More information on the LBD is available from the Census Bureau at http : //www.ces.census.gov/index.php/bds/bds_home. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has produced a separate database the Business Employment Dynamics ( BED ) which tracks gross quarterly job gains and losses ; more information about the BED is available at http : //www.bls.gov/bdm Jobs and Income : Today and Tomorrow | Figure BDS Estimates of Annual Gross Job Gain and Loss Rates Percent of total U.S. private-sector jobs Gross jobs gained Gross jobs lost Note : Shading denotes recession Source : Census Bureau for percent of the overall number of private-sector jobs in the 1980s but for only percent between and The rates of gross job gains and losses exhibit not only secular declines but cyclical patterns as well. Gross job gains are procyclical increasing in expansions and declining in recessions whereas gross job losses are countercyclical increasing during recessions and declining in expansions. In the depths of the recent recession gross job losses rose sharply but the decline in gross job gains was even more notable An alternative data set produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) offers more frequent and more recent data than the BDS. The Business Employment Dynamics ( BED ) reports quarterly data on payroll employment at the level of the Employer Identification Number ( EIN ) An EIN is a tax-reporting construct rather than an economic construct but the unit of observation in the BED consists in most cases of all of the operations of a particular firm located within a given U.S. state. Movements in gross job gains and losses in the BED on an annualized basis since its inception are broadly similar to those in the BDS ; most important the BED also shows a trend decline in gross gain and loss rates since The quarter-to-quarter movements shown in Figure which are based on BED data through the second quarter of ( the most recent quarter of data available ) show a large increase in the rate of gross job losses toward the beginning of the recession ; the rate reached a peak in the | Chapter Figure BED Estimates of Quarterly Gross Job Gain and Loss Rates Percent of total U.S. private-sector jobs Gross jobs gained Gross jobs lost : Q2 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 : Q1 Note : Shading denotes recession Source : Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics Source : : Q1 : Q1 first quarter of and then returned to approximately the pre-recession trend by the beginning of The BED data also show a precipitous fall in the rate of gross job gains during the recession and although that decline reversed and gross job gains exceeded gross job losses by the second quarter of the gains so far have resulted in too few new jobs to accommodate the large number of individuals who lost jobs in the recession Now that researchers have documented the long-term secular slowdown in job gains and losses the underlying reasons for the slowdown and its implications for the future of the U.S. economy are fast becoming the subject of an active debate. One possible reason for the slowdown in job reallocation is the aging of the population. Older workers may be less likely to become entrepreneurs and research has documented a positive correlation between worker age and job tenure ( Davis et al. ; Krueger ) But while the U.S. population is indeed aging it is and will remain much younger than the population in the countries of Western Europe. So to the extent that aging can explain part of the slowdown in job flows in the United States other countries can be expected to experience slowdowns as well Further research is needed to better understand the secular trends in job flows in the United States and international comparisons could be helpful in this regard Because of the importance of entrepreneurship to the vitality of the economy the President last year launched Startup America a national Jobs and Income : Today and Tomorrow | campaign to improve the environment for high-growth entrepreneurs by expanding their access to capital and connecting them with mentors helping the Nation s veterans start businesses reducing barriers to entrepreneurship and fostering entrepreneurship in communities Worker Flows The reallocation of jobs across firms is accompanied by the flows of individual workers between firms and in and out of employment. Overall the net change in employment at a firm must by definition equal the difference between the firm s hires and separations. But the rates of worker flows are larger than the rates of job reallocation : a firm may maintain stable employment ( no gross job gains or losses ) from one year to the next while having many individual workers come and go from within its employee ranks On a monthly basis flows of workers into firms ( hires ) and out of firms ( separations ) are large. As captured since December in the BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey hires and separations have both averaged more than million a month and have tended to track each other closely over time. As Figure illustrates firm hires and separations before the start of the recession in were notably below the levels observed before the start of the recession Figure Hires and Separations Thousands Separations Nov-11 Hires Jan-2001 Jan-2003 Jan-2005 Jan-2007 Note : Shading denotes recession Source : Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics | Chapter Jan-2009 Jan-2011 As the U.S. economy fell into recession in December worker flows slowed notably with large monthly declines in the number of separations and even more precipitous monthly declines in the number of hires A decline in separations during a recession may seem counterintuitive but it is attributable to a large decline in the frequency of workers quitting their jobs ; quits are usually a sign of workers leaving jobs voluntarily for better opportunities. So while layoffs were increasing over this period the decline in quits swamped the increase in layoffs. Overall the economy on net was shedding jobs at a very fast pace during the recession because the decline in hiring in absolute numbers was larger than the decline in separations. Hires and separations both began to rise in the second quarter of but both remained below pre-recession levels at the end of One can also study flows of workers into and out of employment unemployment and the labor force. Perhaps most important over time are the flows into and out of unemployment which can be calculated using the Current Population Survey ( CPS ) Because of the structure of the CPS in any given month three-quarters of the sample members have also been interviewed in the previous month making it possible to use these repeat respondents to follow transitions into and out of unemployment. The BLS has been constructing these flows each month since in a manner that also matches up with the level of reported unemployment. Figure Figure Flows into and out of Unemployment as Percent of the Labor Force Percent Inflow rate Outflow rate Jan-12 Feb-1990 Feb-1994 Feb-1998 Feb-2002 Feb-2006 Note : Shading denotes recession Source : Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics Feb-2010 Jobs and Income : Today and Tomorrow | displays the extent of inflows and outflows as a percent of the total labor force for each month from the start of through January Although the BLS labor force flow series goes back only to and is dominated by strong cyclical movements the data in Figure through the end of suggest a secular decline in both the inflow and outflow rate. A similar decline has also been documented elsewhere ( see for example Davis Faberman and Haltiwanger ) for years before using alternative methods of calculating unemployment inflows and outflows. As with job flows the aging of the population may account for some of these secular declines because older workers tend to leave jobs less often than younger workers and when they do are more likely to leave the labor force permanently. But the declining flows into and out of unemployment also may reflect other forces that have lowered the rates of gross job gains and losses over the past three decades As the recession began monthly inflows and outflows from unemployment both stood at approximately percent of the labor force. Both began to rise steeply but the inflow rate rose more quickly than the outflow rate increasing the unemployment rate to levels not seen in approximately years. Put differently both the increase in the monthly average probability of a worker entering unemployment and the decrease in the monthly average probability of an unemployed worker exiting unemployment have as in a typical recession contributed to the observed rise in unemployment ( Elsby Michaels and Solon ) Since March unemployment inflow and outflow rates measured as a share of the labor force each have been over percent. Because the outflow rate was notably higher than the inflow rate near the end of the unemployment rate has fallen The labor market is still recovering from the cyclical impacts of the recession. And it is still subject to the long-term slower trend in gross job gains and losses as well as to the long-term decline in the share of the population that is employed. In the face of these trends the Administration has pursued and continues to pursue robust policies to foster faster job creation in the short run as well as an economic environment in which existing firms have reasons to increase employment new firms are able to grow and innovate and workers can find satisfying employment Earnings and Income Mobility over the Career and between Generations Although the Nation s labor market is highly dynamic in terms of worker flows the United States has had low rates of income mobility for decades both across the career and across generations | Chapter Low rates of income mobility across the career are especially notable for men whose higher rates of labor force attachment make them much less likely than women to have years with zero earnings. Kopczuk Saez and Song ( ) show that the annual earnings of a man averaged across years early in his working career are highly predictive of his annual earnings averaged across years later in his working career. For example a man in one of the bottom two quintiles of the income distribution early in his lifetime has less than a percent chance of rising to the top quintile years later Family ( or individual ) incomes in one generation are also highly correlated with family ( or individual ) incomes in the next generation. In other words the children of parents who are poor are more likely than the children of well-off parents to be poor when they grow up. A common measure of mobility across generations is the intergenerational elasticity ( IGE ) of earnings or income which is defined as the percentage difference in a child s income associated with a percent difference in the parent s income.3 These IGE estimates are sensitive to several measurement issues particularly fluctuations in incomes from year to year. Studies based on U.S data that deal appropriately with these measurement issues suggest that plausible estimates of the average IGE between fathers and sons are between and An IGE of means that if one father earned percent more than another over their lifetime the first father s son on average would earn percent more than the second father s son ; an IGE of means that the first father s son would earn percent more on average than the second father s son. That is the higher the IGE is the lower economic mobility is between the generations Data limitations make it difficult to infer whether the IGE or the correlation between parents and children s income has changed significantly over time ( Data Watch ) Lee and Solon ( ) conclude that the IGE in the United States was fairly stable for cohorts born between and while Aaronson and Mazumder ( ) present evidence suggesting that it has increased in the past years implying that intergenerational mobility has fallen. None of the available research has suggested a decline in the IGE over time. Moreover the widening of income inequality has meant that it is harder for someone born into the bottom to move to the middle or the top of the income distribution The high degree of persistence in incomes between generations in the United States is especially noteworthy in the context of cross-country comparisons. Corak ( ) makes such a comparison and finds that the average IGEs most commonly have been estimated as the regression coefficient resulting from a linear regression of the logarithm of the income ( or earnings ) of a child on a measure of the logarithm of income ( or earnings ) of a parent or family Jobs and Income : Today and Tomorrow | Data Watch : Intergenerational Mobility One measure of opportunity is the extent to which children grow up to live in better economic and social circumstances than their parents. While there has been useful research on this topic data limitations have hampered attempts of economists and other social scientists to measure the extent of intergenerational mobility. Researchers interested in intergenerational mobility in the United States most commonly have used one of two nationally representative surveys to assess the relationships between the income and occupations of children and those of their parents the Panel Study of Income Dynamics or the National Longitudinal Survey. Neither of these surveys was designed specifically to address questions concerning intergenerational mobility however and the lack of precision resulting from the relatively small numbers of people surveyed makes it difficult to discern trends in economic mobility Grusky and Cumberworth ( ) have suggested that if organized into an administrative database with strict confidentiality protections information gleaned from U.S. tax records could allow researchers to gain a much fuller picture of the evolution of earnings and career outcomes between generations. Mazumder ( ) has taken a step in this direction using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation linked to Social Security earnings records to study the relationship between parents earnings and the later earnings of their adult sons. He finds that the intergenerational elasticity of earnings is around which is larger than had been found in previous studies probably because he had access to more accurate earnings histories estimated IGE of for men in the United States while lower than the IGE for countries such as the United Kingdom ( ) and South Africa ( ) is much higher than the IGE for men in countries such as Sweden ( ) Norway ( ) Finland ( ) and Denmark ( ) J ntti et al. ( ) also compare IGEs for men s incomes in some of the same countries and report similar estimates.4 While many factors contribute to cross-country differences in intergenerational mobility one clear pattern is that countries with more intergenerational mobility also tend to have lower point-in-time income inequality Figure plots the relationship across industrialized countries between the IGE of the earnings of fathers and sons as reported in Corak ( ) One exception is that J ntti et al. report a somewhat lower IGE ( ) for the United Kingdom below that of the United States but still well above those in Nordic countries Following the literature this discussion focuses on IGEs for men because in many countries the inconsistent labor force participation of women complicates the estimation of their IGEs | Chapter and the Gini coefficient of after-tax income as reported in the OECD statistical database. The Gini coefficient shown along the horizontal axis of the figure is a common measure of income inequality ; higher values mean higher levels of income inequality. Higher IGEs along the vertical axis mean less intergenerational mobility. The United States appears in the upper right part of Figure indicating both high inequality and low intergenerational mobility As other research has shown the finding of a positive relationship between IGE and inequality a relationship that Krueger ( ) has referred to as the Great Gatsby Curve is robust to alternative choices of countries intergenerational mobility measures and year in which income inequality is measured ( see for example Corak ; Andrews and Leigh ; OECD ) This robust relationship suggests that at least some of the same mechanisms that drive income inequality also drive intergenerational mobility For example a rise in the rate of return to schooling can be expected to lead to both a rise in point-in-time income inequality and a decline in intergenerational mobility because educational attainment is positively correlated across generations The educational system also may contribute to the pattern in Figure Research has found a strong negative correlation between spending on public education and IGEs across countries ( Ichino Karabarounis and Figure The Great Gatsby Curve : Inequality and Intergenerational Mobility Intergenerational earnings elasticity Italy United Kingdom United States France Spain Germany Finland New Zealand Sweden Japan Norway Canada Denmark Gini coefficient ( ) Source : Corak ( ) and OECD Jobs and Income : Today and Tomorrow | Moretti ) This pattern suggests that public investments in supporting children may help to reduce persistent inequality across generations Similarly the OECD has concluded that educational policies ranging from support for early childhood education to measures that support postsecondary education for students from low-income backgrounds can increase intergenerational income mobility ( OECD ) As discussed later in this chapter the Administration has taken multiple steps to improve the quality of education and to provide opportunities for all students to earn a postsecondary credential or degree Overall Trends in Income and Rising Inequality Irrespective of the persistence in income across generations the rungs on the ladder of the income distribution in the United States have moved farther apart and income growth has been stagnant for the middle class for a decade One indicator of the evolution of income over time is annual real median household income which rose in the United States from the late 1960s through the late 1990s was stagnant in the first part of the 2000s and then as is typical during recessions and their aftermath fell between and ( the last year for which data are available ) Figure Percent of Households with Annual Income within Percent of the Median Percent Source : Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics ; CEA calculations | Chapter Figure Growth in Real After-Tax Income Percent change Lowest quintile Second quintile Middle quintile Fourth quintile 81st-99th Top percent percentiles Source : Congressional Budget Office Rising income inequality is another major development in the United States economy ( see for example Autor Katz and Kearney ; Card and DiNardo ; CEA ) Growing dispersion of household incomes a manifestation of growing dispersion of earnings means that fewer and fewer households have incomes in the middle band of the income distribution. This can be seen clearly in Figure In just over percent of households had incomes within percent of the median ; that share fell to just over percent in and to just over percent in Another way to look at changes in the distribution of income is to examine the rates of income growth for households at different income levels. A report released by the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) in October examines real growth in after-tax ( and transfer ) household income from through across quintiles and the top percent of the income distribution. Figure reproducing information from the CBO report provides stark evidence of the rise in inequality showing that real after-tax incomes grew by just percent over nearly years for those in the bottom income quintile and rose only somewhat more rapidly for those in the middle percent of the distribution but grew by a stunning percent for those in the top percent of the distribution As a result of these divergent growth rates increasingly more income has been concentrated at the top and less at the bottom of the income distribution. The CBO reports that the share of total after-tax household income Jobs and Income : Today and Tomorrow | for the bottom four income quintiles was lower in than it was in and the share for those in the 81st to 99th percentiles was essentially flat For the top percent however the share more than doubled from almost percent in to percent in Piketty and Saez ( ) using data and definitions of income slightly different from the CBO report focus on income inequality between those at various places in the very top of the distribution and the rest of the population. They find that the share of income prior to taxes and transfers excluding capital gains going to the earners in the 95th percentile of the distribution barely changed between and and that the share of income going to those in the 99th percentiles rose from almost percent to about percent. But the share of income going to the top percent of earners rose from percent in to percent in the highest it had been since the Roaring Twenties and it still stood at over percent in ( Figure ) Rising inequality has important implications in the context of low rates of intergenerational mobility. As incomes become more unequal larger increases in household income are necessary for families to move from a lower part of the income distribution to a higher part for example from a level of household income that classifies a family as living in poverty to one that puts it in the middle of the distribution. Low rates of economic Figure Share of Total U.S. Income Earned by Top Percent Percent of total U.S. income Note : Total income includes wages and salaries ( including bonuses and stock -option exercises ) pensions profits farm income dividends interest and rental income Source : Piketty and Saez ( ) ; authors provided an estimate for based on partial returns | Chapter mobility across generations imply that children born in poverty are more likely to remain in poverty as adults while children born to higher-income parents are more likely to have higher incomes as adults. As long as income inequality is increasing those adult children will find themselves even farther away from the middle class than their parents were. Perhaps even more worrisome the Great Gatsby curve in Figure suggests that a rise in inequality for the current generation of families could lead to a slowdown in economic mobility for the next generation The confluence of rising inequality and low economic mobility over the past three decades poses a real threat to the future of the United States as a land of opportunity. Social and economic mobility across generations are at risk of declining unless concerted efforts are devoted to providing more opportunities for those born into lower-income households Long-Term Unemployment The upheaval in the labor market brought on by the recession that started in late is primarily a cyclical phenomenon. A major challenge especially given the long-term changes in the labor market that were underway even before the recession is how to prevent these cyclical dislocations from having permanent effects on workers prospects. This means that pathways for the long-term unemployed to return to the workforce are a particular priority The protracted high level of unemployment has led to large numbers of long-term unemployed workers those who have been out of work for more than weeks. Currently million workers more than two-fifths of all unemployed individuals have been jobless for more than weeks and over million have been without a job for more than two years Historically as depicted in Figure the share of the unemployed that has been unemployed for more than weeks has been quite cyclical starting at a relatively low point right before a recession growing thereafter and usually peaking many months into the recovery before gradually declining. Another useful measure of unemployment duration is the median duration the amount of time that the person in the middle of the distribution has spent unemployed to date. Typically this measure has been similarly cyclical and as a result of the recession it remains elevated at weeks A long period of joblessness is obviously first and foremost a serious hardship for the individuals involved. The loss of income due to unemployment can wreak havoc on households finances often necessitating liquidation of savings. Households with unemployed members are more likely to fall behind on their bills and to suffer foreclosure or bankruptcy ; foreclosures Jobs and Income : Today and Tomorrow | Figure Median Duration of Unemployment and Long-Term Unemployed as a Percent of Total Unemployed Percent Jan-12 Weeks Long-term unemployed as a percent of total unemployed ( left axis ) Median duration of unemployment ( right axis ) Jan-1980 Jan-1985 Jan-1990 Jan-1995 Jan-2000 Note : Shading denotes recession Source : Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics Jan-2005 Jan-2010 also can have adverse effects on the prices of neighboring homes. To help the long-term unemployed keep their homes the Administration created a version of the Home Affordable Modification Program ( HAMP ) for the unemployed called HAMP UP in which unemployed homeowners were given a three month forbearance period on their mortgage payments. In July this forbearance period was extended to months Income losses associated with job loss can persist even after reemployment. Recent research examined male workers age or younger with at least three years of tenure who lost their jobs in mass layoffs ( defined as employment decreases of at least percent over two years at their place of employment ) between and The researchers concluded that job displacement led to a loss of years of earnings on average accumulated over years. Moreover job displacement led to an average accumulated earnings loss of years if the job was lost when the unemployment rate was above percent but the earnings loss was only half as large years if the job was lost when the unemployment rate was below percent ( Davis and von Wachter ) In addition to the mortgage forbearance program mentioned above the Administration has supported the long-term unemployed by calling for extended unemployment compensation which provides much-needed income to these workers and their families while the recipient searches for work. As explained in Chapter continued extensions of the Emergency | Chapter Unemployment Compensation and Extended Benefits programs through are vital to those who remain unemployed. Additionally the American Jobs Act proposal for extending unemployment benefits also included significant reforms to the unemployment insurance system designed to speed the return of benefit recipients to work As part of his Fiscal Year Budget the President is proposing a $ billion Pathways Back to Work Fund to provide employment opportunities for vulnerable youth low-income adults and the long-term unemployed and an expanded community college initiative to support state and community college partnerships with business to give workers the skills employers need. The President also is proposing to streamline training and employment services for dislocated workers improving access to critical supports for getting the unemployed back into employment Preparing for Tomorrow s Labor Market Even as the Administration remains focused on strengthening and sustaining the recovery from the recession the President continues to address the longer-term challenges in the structure of the American economy and labor market. To ensure that American workers are prepared to meet the evolving needs of employers the Nation s education and training system must provide the workers of tomorrow with the skills they will need for the jobs of tomorrow. At the same time jobs and workplaces also must evolve to enable workers to fulfill family and other nonwork responsibilities ( Box ) This section describes what the jobs of tomorrow are likely to look like why educating workers is a cornerstone of economic opportunity and growth and how the Administration s policies are working to prepare Americans for the jobs of tomorrow Education and the Workers of Tomorrow The rise in wage and income inequality over recent decades is largely attributable to long-lasting structural changes in the U.S. economy. Among the changes are technological advances that have increased employer demand for a relatively more highly educated workforce a slowdown in the expansion of educational attainment and increased competition from overseas for many lower-paid jobs. Another is a decline in the share of the workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements and the decline in the real value of the minimum wage both of which historically helped protect the wages of lower-paid workers.5 Extensive reviews of existing research can be found in Acemoglu and Autor ( ) and Autor and Katz ( ) Jobs and Income : Today and Tomorrow | Box : Work-Life Balance in the Jobs of Tomorrow American household life has changed dramatically over the past half century in ways that have caused many workers to face conflicts between their work and personal lives. Women are now the majority recipients of bachelor s and advanced degrees and compose nearly percent of the workforce. Families rely increasingly on women s earnings to make ends meet. In addition to managing care of children both men and women juggle elder caregiving responsibilities with work. In approximately million Americans served as unpaid caregivers to a family member over the age of Workplace flexibility is also important for older Americans themselves. In the first of the baby boomers turned age Workplace flexibility policies such as part-time work or job sharing facilitate a phased retirement that helps older workers transition slowly out of the workforce allowing them to take care of their health needs and maintain their economic security while moving toward retirement Workplace flexibility can be expanded by increasing workers control over when where and how much they work. These goals can be achieved through a variety of different arrangements that allow workers to continue making productive contributions to the workforce while also attending to family and other responsibilities. Arrangements range from job sharing to phased retirement of older workers to telecommuting Workplace flexibility policies not only help employees balance work and family responsibilities but also can improve employers bottom lines. As in all business decisions the critical considerations for employers in adoption of flexible workplace policies are the benefits and costs Almost one-third of firms cite costs or limited funds as obstacles to implementing workplace flexibility arrangements. On the benefit side however as documented in CEA ( ) these practices can reduce turnover and improve recruitment increasing the productivity of an employer s workforce. Moreover flexible workplace practices are associated with improved employee health and decreased absenteeism a major cost for employers. The CEA study estimated that wholesale adoption of flexible workplace policies could save as much as $ billion a year through greater productivity lower turnover and reduced absenteeism. Should more firms adopt such practices the benefits to society in the form of reduced traffic improved employment outcomes and more efficient allocation of workers to employers could be even greater than the gains to individual firms and workers ( Galinsky et al. ) Although the academic literature has identified numerous benefits from flexible workplace practices along a variety of dimensions the | Chapter adoption rates for these practices differ across industries and employers of different sizes. Goldin and Katz ( ) explored the prevalence of flexible workplace arrangements across industries and found that although these practices are gaining in popularity some industries lag behind in particular the business and financial sectors. Overall the CEA study reported that more than half of employers report allowing some workers to periodically change their starting and quitting times However only percent of full-time workers and percent of parttime workers report actually having flexible work hours. Even if some employers offer more flexible workplace arrangements there remains the concern that their employees may not be taking advantage of those arrangements because either in the case of unpaid leave they can not afford to bring home a smaller paycheck or in the case of paid leave they are afraid to take leave for fear of missing out on advancements or not being viewed as a team player. A lack of data has hindered deeper understanding of the benefits and costs of flexibility as well as knowledge about who is taking advantage of that flexibility. The largest most detailed source of data a survey of employers provides information on practices that is now three years old and does not contain information for the smallest firms. The only nationally representative data from workers are seven years old and provide little information on the prevalence of flexible practices. While the existing evidence has demonstrated a strong connection between flexibility and productivity additional research exploring the mechanism through which flexibility influences worker s job satisfaction and firms profits would better inform policymakers and managers alike In the summer of the results of a module added to the American Time Use Survey will provide expanded information about workplace flexibility from the workers perspective. The module asks survey respondents about their access to leave and flexible scheduling how they use such policies to balance their work and personal responsibilities and whether they fail to take advantage of existing policies because of a fear of negative consequences. These data will add to the existing knowledge base on workplace flexibility. Although the literature is small the best available evidence suggests that adoption of more flexible practices can boost productivity improve morale and benefit the U.S. economy all while strengthening families. Jobs and Income : Today and Tomorrow | Because these structural changes have shifted demand toward a workforce with relatively more education a substantial fraction of the overall increase in wage and income inequality is related to a growing divergence in earnings between those with more years of education and those with fewer years of education as depicted in Figure For example in workers with a bachelor s degree or higher earned nearly twice as much as those with a high school degree a premium that has risen since when college graduates earned percent more than high school graduates. In fact even long before the most recent recession the average real annual earnings of those with a high school degree or less fell below the levels of the 1970s One important way to help stem the tide of rising inequality and potentially to ameliorate the effects of low intergenerational economic mobility is to increase the number of workers who obtain postsecondary education and earn higher wages as a result. For this reason President Obama has set the ambitious goal of returning the United States by to the world s top spot in the share of to 34-year-olds with a college degree Increasing the number of workers who obtain postsecondary education is also vital for meeting the changing skill needs of firms. The BLS Employment Projections Program produces forecasts of employment by industry occupation and education on an approximately biennial basis The industry employment forecasts are based on incorporating projections of the size of the labor force into a model of output growth across U.S. industries. These detailed industry employment forecasts are then mapped into projections of employment growth by occupation and then into forecasts of growth in employment by education group. Beginning with the newly released projections for the BLS is projecting employment growth by education group by assigning to each occupation the typical level of formal education needed to enter the occupation and then aggregating by education group the projected employment growth in the occupations requiring that level of education. As shown in Figure the BLS projects that in the coming years jobs requiring education beyond a high school degree will grow by more than the average while occupations requiring at most a high school diploma will grow by less than the average For example between and employment in jobs that require an associate s degree is projected to grow by percent percentage points more than the average projected employment growth of percent. Much of the divergence in employment growth across education groups is driven by the projected growth of sectors such as health care and education that intensively utilize workers in occupations that typically require education beyond a high school diploma | Chapter Figure Average Annual Earnings by Worker Education Level Dollars ( ) Bachelor 's degree or higher Associate 's degree or some college High school degree Less than high school Note : The sample includes workers aged who worked at least hours a week and for at least weeks in the calendar year. Before education groups are defined based on the highest grade of school or year of college completed. Beginning in groups are defined based on the highest degree or diploma earned. Earnings are deflated using the CPI-U. Calculations are based on survey data collected in March of each year and reflect average wage and salary income for the previous calendar year Source : CEA calculations using March Current Population Survey Information that tracks the changing skill needs of firms can help Americans make informed career decisions. In addition to the statistics published by the BLS on existing and projected jobs by industry occupation and education the potential exists to harness new data sources to gain a deeper understanding of what skills are in high demand. For example the more than million U.S.-based members of LinkedIn an online professional networking company typically provide to LinkedIn their job titles and the companies they work for and upon joining many members also provide information on their past work history. LinkedIn classifies members jobs by industry and occupation often at a more detailed level than is available in government statistics. The resulting information can be used to track changes over time in the industries and occupations in which LinkedIn s members work and to identify emerging sectors and job titles. LinkedIn s members are not a nationally representative sample of the U.S. workforce but because they tend to work in sectors of the economy that require higher levels of education the information embodied in the changing distribution of the industries and occupations in which members are employed has the potential to inform the decisions of individuals considering specific educational and career paths Jobs and Income : Today and Tomorrow | Figure Difference Between Projected Employment Growth Rate by Education and Average Projected Employment Growth Rate Doctoral or professional degree Master 's degree Bachelor 's degree Associate 's degree Postsecondary non-degree award Some college no degree High school diploma or equivalent Less than high school Percent change minus average percent change Source : Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics LinkedIn has produced initial tabulations from among its U.S. members of the growth rate of employment in industries and occupations since These tabulations are for a longitudinal sample of individuals based on aggregated historical data from their resumes and other information that they provide LinkedIn reports that two of the fastest-growing industries among their members between and were the Internet and oil and energy ; two of the fastest-shrinking industries were newspapers and construction. Among the fastest-growing occupations were social media ( including jobs titles such as social media manager social media marketing manager and social media specialist ) and digital technology ( including digital producer digital product manager digital strategist and digital sales manager ) ; LinkedIn reports that teachers and middle-management positions were among the shrinking occupations One of the main drivers of the increasing relative demand for workers with more education and training is the continuing shift toward using machines or computers to perform the routine tasks once done by workers Although the BLS assuming a continuation of these trends projects that the number of manufacturing jobs will decline between and the U.S manufacturing sector has added more than net new jobs since the beginning of the first sustained job growth in manufacturing since the late 1990s | Chapter Some of the recent growth in manufacturing jobs is the direct result of firms that are choosing to produce goods in the United States rather than using overseas labor. The Administration is supporting this insourcing with new tax proposals that eliminate tax advantages for moving jobs overseas and reward companies that choose to invest in or bring jobs back to the United States. In addition the President has proposed measures to revitalize the manufacturing sector. These measures include initiatives to help develop and produce advanced technologies ensuring clean energy technologies that will fuel the 21st century economy are built in the United States ; funding to help catalyze partnerships between universities and industries to develop new technologies for manufacturing products and processes ; the creation of a new Interagency Trade Enforcement Center to challenge unfair trading practices ; and tax incentives to promote job growth in communities hard-hit by factory closings Increasing Educational Attainment To prepare for the jobs of tomorrow it is essential to invest in the American workforce and to increase the number of young people who attain a college degree. Meeting the President s college completion goal for to 34-year-olds requires investments in early primary and secondary education to increase the number of students who are college-ready when they graduate from high school. Meeting the goal also requires policies and programs that make college more affordable and accessible Teachers in the Nation s public schools are crucial to preparing children for the jobs of tomorrow. During the depths of the recession however many State and local governments were forced to make cuts resulting in the loss of more than education jobs over the past three years. Had it not been for the combined $ billion in targeted assistance through the Recovery Act s State Fiscal Stabilization Fund and the Education Jobs Fund the cuts would have been worse : these programs provided the resources to support teacher job-years. Given the continued need to prevent teacher layoffs and to rehire many of the teachers who lost their jobs during the recession the President s FY Budget proposes a $ billion teacher stabilization fund The Administration also has made improving the quality of education a priority and has taken an innovative approach using grant competitions and evaluations to fund promising practices and learn more about what works from early childhood education through high school. A key part of this effort has been Race to the Top grants established as part of the Recovery Act. Competitive grants have been awarded to states to undertake innovative reform in four areas of K education : implementing rigorous Jobs and Income : Today and Tomorrow | standards and assessments ; using data to improve instruction and decisionmaking ; recruiting and retaining effective teachers and principals ; and turning around the lowest-performing schools. Race to the Top grants have catalyzed widespread reform even in states that did not win an award In Race to the Top funds were also used for Early Learning Challenge grants to promote evidence-based evaluation of programs develop strategies for families and parents to assess the quality of early learning programs and create age-appropriate curricula and assessment systems The Early Learning Challenge fund announced nine state grant winners in December As with the K Race to the Top competition although not all proposals were funded the framework of providing competitive grants to states to formulate their own solutions focused local conversations on education reform. The Early Learning Challenge grants complement the Administration s major investments in improving a cornerstone of early childhood education the Head Start and Early Head Start programs by increasing funding by $ billion in two years through the Recovery Act by nearly doubling the number of children and families served by Early Head Start and by taking key steps to increase Head Start Center program quality and accountability. Notably the Department of Health and Human Services has begun implementing new regulations that for the first time require current grantees that do not meet quality benchmarks to compete for continued funding In addition to Race to the Top the Administration has funded other important innovations in education. The Investing in Innovation Fund supports projects in K education that test validate and scale up promising strategies and interventions that raise overall student achievement close the achievement gap and improve outcomes for high-need students. The Promise Neighborhoods initiative supports cradle-to-career wraparound services to improve educational outcomes for students in distressed highpoverty neighborhoods. The President s State of the Union Address challenged all states to do what states have already done : require all students to graduate from high school or stay in school until age Raising the compulsory schooling age increases average educational attainment and for those induced to stay in school longer leads to higher earnings when those students become adults. In view of the positive externalities from schooling economists Milton and Rose Friedman wrote What kind of governmental action is justified ? The most obvious is to require that each child receive a minimum amount of schooling of a specified kind ( Friedman and Friedman ) The President has committed to continued investments in America s education system. Beyond making investments to help all students prepare | Chapter for college the Administration is working to make college affordable for American families. In recent years published college tuitions have risen sharply posing a threat to the Nation s growing need for workers with college-level skills. The Administration has made college accessibility and affordability a top priority. Through the Recovery Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act passed in the Administration raised the maximum Pell Grant award from $ in to $ in and the FY Budget calls for the maximum to increase to $ for the school year. Some million college students received an average of $ in Pell Grants in These figures are up sharply from the year before President Obama took office when million college students received an average of $ apiece in Pell aid and the President remains committed to protecting these historic increases in Pell Grant awards In addition the American Opportunity Tax Credit ( AOTC ) established through the Recovery Act provides up to $ a year for college tuition and related expenses for American families. Compared with the Hope Scholarship that it largely replaces the AOTC offers a higher maximum benefit ; can be claimed for up to four rather than only two years of undergraduate education ; has a higher income eligibility cutoff making the credit available to more middle-class families ; and is partially refundable thereby also reaching lower-income families. This credit is estimated to have benefited million students and their families in In December the President signed an extension of the AOTC through the end of and his FY Budget request proposes to make the AOTC permanent Data from the College Board ( ) demonstrate the effectiveness of these Administration initiatives to keep college affordable ( see also CEA ) The estimated average net price for full-time students attending public four-year institutions increased by only about $ between and and the estimated average net price for full-time students attending public two-year and private nonprofit four-year institutions actually fell To build on the successes of Pell expansions and the AOTC as well as lessons from K education reform the President has proposed a Race to the Top for College Completion and Affordability to make public colleges more affordable and a better value and to drive reforms that will help more students complete their degrees on time. The FY Budget also proposes reforms to the distribution of campus based-aid to reward colleges that are serving low-income students setting tuitions responsibly and offering a quality education that prepares students to obtain employment and repay their loans. Finally the Budget proposes a new First in the World Fund that introduces an evidence-based framework modeled after the Investing in Innovation initiative to develop validate and scale up effective approaches Jobs and Income : Today and Tomorrow | in higher education. ( For a discussion of financing the cost of college see Economics Applications Box ) Federally Supported Job Training The education of workers does not end when they complete formal schooling and enter the labor market. As the economy evolves workers often need to develop new skills to meet the changing demands of firms In many cases firms partner with their workers to help them acquire new skills but for workers who have lost their jobs or are seeking to change fields or careers this option may not be available. Providing such workers with opportunities for training is especially important in today s economy given the continued high rates of unemployment that are the direct result of the recession and it will remain important in ensuring a skilled workforce well into the future The Federal Government funds two main training programs for adults the Trade Adjustment Assistance ( TAA ) program and the Workforce Investment Act ( WIA ) formula grant program. The WIA Adult and Dislocated Programs have by far the largest reach serving million participants in ( the most recent year for which data are available ) at a total annual cost of $ billion.6 Created in the WIA system provides reemployment and training services to adults who are economically disadvantaged and to workers who have been displaced from their jobs Importantly WIA moved the design and management of job training programs to the local level by creating one-stop employment centers where job seekers can access all employment services of the Department of Labor WIA provides both short-term services including job search assistance and basic skills assessments and longer-term services that involve more substantial career counseling as well as training services. Program participants work with a case worker to choose the menu of services that best meets their needs although limited funds mean not all participants have access to all services deemed appropriate. Research suggests that the average WIA participant benefits from the program although the quality of the services provided is somewhat uneven. One recent study found that on average WIA training programs for adults boosted employment and earnings although there was substantial variation across states and across participants depending on which WIA program they were in and what kind of services they received ( Heinrich Mueser and Troske ) Growing evidence from studies of state programs particularly studies that track participants for a longer Other smaller programs serving many fewer participants include the Employment Services Program and the Adult Basic Education Program. In addition WIA also has a small program that serves economically disadvantaged youth | Chapter Economics Application Box : Calculating the Cost of College The decision to attend college is one of life s most important decisions. Individuals with a college degree earn substantially more throughout their working lives than otherwise similar non-degree holders on average but the dollar costs of college can be high and many students accumulate substantial debt. In addition there is an opportunity cost of college students are unable to work for pay while performing school-related tasks One key piece of information that a prospective student should have is the actual dollar price of college that the student is likely to pay. The published costs of a year of college do not tell the full story Many students receive Federal assistance and individual colleges and universities often have their own need-based aid programs as well as merit scholarships The Department of Education has two particularly useful tools for prospective college students who would like to understand better what they are likely to pay in tuition room and board expenses and fees. While the exact financial aid available to any particular student depends on a number of factors including household size household income and asset net worth the Department of Education s FAFSA4caster ( http : // fafsa4caster.ed.gov/ ) can help students learn how much aid might be available. Using the College Navigator tool ( https : //nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/ ) a prospective college student can learn how Federal state and local and institutional aid affect net prices at specific colleges. A menu-driven format allows a prospective student to select a college or set of colleges ( say by geography or type of degree ) and discover the average net price paid by students of various income levels at each college on the prospective student s list. The average net prices across schools can vary widely and can deviate substantially from the published costs. For example information from the College Calculator shows that for households with income between $ and $ the average annual cost of attending one of the top ten national universities ( as ranked by U.S. News and World Report ) in was $ The average net price for those who received aid at one of those institutions however was a substantially lower $ Meanwhile large state schools with much lower published costs than the private universities can have higher net costs. For households in the $ $ income range that received aid the average annual net cost ( including the costs of living on campus ) in at the top ten largest public universities was $ Jobs and Income : Today and Tomorrow | period of time shows that training for adults can have large positive effects on earnings. Combining classroom learning with more hands-on training usually has led to the largest and most lasting impacts ( Hotz Imbens and Klerman ; Dyke et al. ) The Trade Adjustment Assistance program was established in and has undergone numerous changes since its inception but its basic purpose remains to provide training to workers displaced as the result of foreign competition. Eligible workers receive the same kinds of reemployment and training services offered to WIA participants but more generous funding allows them to receive training for a longer period of time. Moreover TAA provides income supplements to regular unemployment insurance benefits as well as an allowance for relocation. If the displaced worker is over years old and finds a new job paying less than $ a year TAA also provides the worker the option to receive wage insurance in the amount of half the difference between his or her old and new wage ( up to a cap of $ ) for up to two years Recognizing the importance of job training to American workers and their families the President has proposed a major initiative to provide workers with the tools and skills they need to find new jobs by forging new partnerships between community colleges and businesses to train million skilled workers and by streamlining access to training and employment services for dislocated workers The current system does not treat all workers who were dislocated because of economic shifts equally. As noted above workers in tradeimpacted industries are eligible for extensive income support training and reemployment services under the TAA while those who lose their jobs for other reasons receive less generous assistance. In this increasingly global economy it is difficult to distinguish between trade technology outsourcing consumer trends and other economic shifts that cause displacement The President believes that dislocated workers should be able to access a single program visit a single location or go to a single web site to find information about and assistance with job and training opportunities in their community. Ensuring that displaced workers have the information and training they need to successfully return to work is important not only for those who have lost their jobs as a result of the recession but also for those who will be in need of these services in the future | Chapter Conclusion The recession severely disrupted a labor market that was already under stress from decades of rising inequality stagnant middleclass incomes and weak job growth in the recovery period. The job market has been recovering gradually since the end of the recession and the Administration continues to make strengthening and sustaining the recovery in the job market a top priority. The policies proposed by the Administration will promote continued economic growth and job creation by supporting aggregate demand through an extension of the percentage point payroll tax cut the continuation of extended unemployment insurance benefits investments in infrastructure and assistance to states and localities to retain school teachers and first responders. Investments in expanded reemployment services and training for low-skilled and displaced workers will help get Americans back to work. And the President s proposals to invest in elementary and secondary education and to make college more affordable will lay the foundation for a stronger economy in the future Jobs and Income : Today and Tomorrow | C H A P T E R PRESERVING AND MODERNIZING THE SAFETY NET T oday s dynamic global economy driven by rapid technological change offers abundant benefits and opportunities but also entails many risks The Great Recession has made clearer than ever that a strong and flexible economy requires a robust safety net to protect families against major risks and to reduce the likelihood that temporary economic shocks will inflict permanent harm on families and the economy In the first weeks after President Obama was inaugurated the President and the Congress enacted policies to expand and strengthen the safety net in response to the ongoing economic crisis. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of ( the Recovery Act ) provided increased funding for a number of key safety net programs including unemployment insurance ( UI ) Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) Medicaid and the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) These and other safety net programs have been critical in cushioning American families from the effects of the Great Recession and in stabilizing the economy by supporting aggregate demand One way to gauge the impact of the safety net is to consider the number of American families that would have been in poverty were it not for the support provided by specific programs. These effects are significant. In the official poverty rate was percent which translates to roughly million people living in poverty. According to U.S. Census Bureau estimates were it not for unemployment insurance benefits million more Americans would have been in poverty in This figure includes about million nonelderly adults children and adults age and older. Among families participating in the program the receipt of UI benefits has the effect of cutting the poverty rate roughly in half ( Gabe and Whittaker ) Data Watch : The Census Bureau s Supplemental Poverty Measure The official poverty measure was developed in the 1960s. According to this measure a family is considered to be poor if its before-tax income falls below a poverty line that varies according to family size and composition In the Census Bureau released an alternative to the official poverty measure that presents a more complete picture of poverty and of the effects of policies to support low-income families. This Supplemental Poverty Measure ( SPM ) developed early in the Obama Administration is based on an approach recommended in by the National Academy of Sciences. Like the official poverty measure the supplemental measure compares the resources available to a household with a threshold level of income that takes into account household composition. It differs from the official measure however both in how it calculates resources and in how it sets the thresholds. The supplemental measure adds in-kind assistance such as nutritional assistance and subsidized housing to household resources and subtracts necessary expenses such as taxes child care and other work-related expenses as well as medical out-of-pocket costs. Its thresholds are calculated differently than those for the official poverty line and they reflect geographic differences in housing costs Overall percent of all Americans were estimated to be in poverty in according to the supplemental measure compared with percent using the official methodology.a Differences between the two measures vary across demographic groups. For example because they disproportionately benefit from programs like the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) children are more likely to be in poverty according to the official measure which does not account for support from these programs By contrast the poverty rate for elderly Americans is higher according to the supplemental measure since unlike the official measure it subtracts out-of-pocket medical expenses from income The supplemental poverty measure allows researchers to isolate more accurately the effects of a specific policy source of income or category of expense on the prevalence of poverty. Among the programs studied by the Census Bureau the EITC has the largest antipoverty effect ; according to the supplemental measure in the absence of the tax credit an additional million people would have been in poverty in Accounting for medical out-of-pocket expenses in the supplemental measure on the other hand moved million individuals into poverty in a This official estimate differs from the usual published rate ( of percent ) as unrelated individuals under years of age are included in the universe | Chapter The official definition of poverty does not account for the effect of taxes paid and tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. Nor does it incorporate the value of in-kind benefits. As a result the official measure does not reflect the benefit that American families receive from the EITC or important safety net programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) on the official poverty rate. However such a calculation is possible using an alternative measure of poverty known as the Supplemental Poverty Measure ( Data Watch ) Using the supplemental measure the Census Bureau estimated that in the absence of the EITC another million Americans nearly half of them children would have been in poverty in In that same year SNAP benefits lifted million adults and million children out of poverty. Considered all together it is estimated that the social insurance and means-tested transfer programs that make up the safety net reduce the number of Americans falling below the poverty line by more than half ( Ziliak ) Safety net programs can improve economic efficiency by supplementing private markets if they fail to provide adequate insurance against major economic risks. A fundamental market failure common to both insurance and annuity markets is adverse selection which arises when consumers know more than insurers about their own risk their expected medical claims their likelihood of becoming unemployed or their expected longevity ( Rothschild and Stiglitz ) If insurance or annuity contracts are priced according to the average risk in a population coverage will be attractive to those who know that they are at high risk and unattractive to those who know that they are at low risk. To the extent that high-risk consumers are more likely to purchase insurance the cost of coverage will rise which in turn will make coverage even less attractive to their low-risk counterparts The gravity of the adverse selection problem will vary across types of insurance and for a given type across market segments. Some types of insurance such as unemployment insurance have virtually no private market. Private health insurance and annuity markets exist though not without substantial support from tax and regulatory policies ; even with this support coverage remains costly and incomplete In addition to addressing specific types of market failure a strong safety net can promote growth and entrepreneurship. By providing a basic level of security well-designed safety net programs help create an environment that encourages people to engage in value-creating activities such as changing jobs or starting a new business. A strong safety net is especially important in a global economy in which international trade and financial integration can bring both substantial benefits and increased risk. Robust cross-country evidence finds that economies that have stronger safety nets Preserving and Modernizing the Safety Net | also tend to pursue more efficient economic policies ( Rodrik ) Safety net programs also protect workers and their families from the labor market disruptions that can arise from technological change and other sources of fluctuation in demand. Finally safety net programs can be an important component of automatic stabilizers providing expansions in aggregate demand that help counteract the weakening of the economy during economic downturns An effective and efficient safety net must adapt and evolve in response to changes in technology and economic conditions. This chapter provides an overview of the key components of the safety net in the United States emphasizing recent policy developments and proposals to keep the nation s safety net strong Unemployment Insurance Unemployment insurance has long been an essential component of the safety net for workers who have lost a job through no fault of their own In the recent period of high unemployment the basic UI program and emergency extensions have provided critical support for millions of American families. In almost percent of households received UI benefits and that share is expected to fall back toward the pre-recession average of about percent as the economy recovers Unemployment insurance is a joint Federal-state program that covers nearly all civilian workers. During normal economic times workers and employers contribute to state systems that pay benefits to unemployed workers for up to weeks. During periods of high unemployment extended benefits ( EB ) are available to workers who have exhausted regular UI benefits with the costs normally shared between the Federal Government and states. Benefits are determined as a function of past wages up to a cap Although key program parameters vary across states on average UI benefits replace roughly half of a recipient s lost earnings. In the average weekly benefit was roughly $ Historically the Federal Government has funded benefits for extended periods while the economy recovers from a serious downturn. It did so once during the 1950s once during the 1960s twice during the 1970s and once each during the early 1980s the 1990s and the early 2000s. In each instance since the 1970s extended benefits have been reauthorized usually multiple times in reaction to continued weakness in the labor market. In June Congress enacted the Emergency Unemployment Compensation ( EUC ) Program that added weeks of Federally funded UI benefits. As the labor market continued to deteriorate Congress extended the program | Chapter for workers in the hardest-hit states several times. In addition starting in February Congress provided full Federal funding of extended jobless benefits. Together these policies allow workers in high-unemployment states to qualify for up to weeks of benefits The Economics of Unemployment Insurance Unemployment insurance benefits enable workers to minimize disruptions in spending caused by unanticipated income shocks ( Baily ) Economic research indicates that this consumption-smoothing effect is important. According to one study in the absence of UI a typical family whose household head becomes unemployed lowers spending on food by percent while a family receiving UI benefits spends only percent less on food ( Gruber ) In addition to helping families whose income has been reduced due to job loss by providing income to families that they can spend UI benefits mitigate the impact of the recession on the broader economy These benefits must be weighed against the cost of longer spells of unemployment potentially induced by the availability of UI although in the current environment any effect on spell length is likely to be comparatively small. Theoretical models of labor supply and job search predict that unemployed workers covered by more generous UI systems can take longer to find a new job ( see for example Mortensen ) More recent work has shown that it is important to distinguish among reasons why UI increases the duration of unemployment. Traditionally economists have interpreted the relationship between UI and duration in the context of a worker s choice between work and leisure assuming that UI reduces the effort devoted to job search. An alternative view given that a large fraction of unemployed workers have limited assets is that UI benefits allow workers to meet their basic needs while they search for a job that is a good match for their talents ( Chetty ) Better matches generally translate to higher wages ( leading to higher tax revenues ) increased job satisfaction and greater employment stability ( which reduces employers hiring costs ) The empirical research literature on the relationship between UI benefits and unemployment duration is sizable. Recent research suggests that UI benefits have small effects on unemployment duration even when the economy is strong ( Card and Levine ) In periods of high unemployment the consumption-smoothing benefit of UI will be especially valuable to workers and any negative effects on worker search effort will be less important because of the scarcity of jobs ( Kroft and Notowidigdo ; Schmieder von Wachter and Bender ) Consistent with this premise research suggests that the recent expansion of extended and emergency benefits has had a minimal effect on the duration of unemployment spells and Preserving and Modernizing the Safety Net | the unemployment rate ( Farber and Valletta ; Rothstein ; Daly et al. ) Moreover to the extent that the extension of benefits has affected the measured unemployment rate it has done so not by reducing the probability that unemployed workers look for and find jobs but by reducing the number of unemployed workers who have given up on searching for a new job ( Rothstein ) This finding is important in light of evidence suggesting that during periods of high unemployment many older workers who exhaust their UI benefits end up applying for Social Security Disability Insurance ( Rutledge ) Recent Trends in UI Receipt and Its Effect on Household Income The share of households receiving UI rose from percent in to percent in Over the same period the average annual amount received by households benefiting from UI rose from $ to $ mainly because of longer duration of benefit receipt but also because of the extra $ in weekly benefits provided through FY by the Recovery Act This money was crucial to keeping many families in their homes and able to pay other household expenses. As noted UI lifts millions of families out of poverty. However because a large share of benefits flows to middle-income workers these antipoverty effects understate the economic impact of the program on participants. Households that received UI benefits in had a median income of $ the previous year which is only slightly less than the median income of working households that did not receive UI. Among all recipients UI payments represented percent of household income in The share of income represented by UI ranged from percent for multiple-earner households without children to almost percent for households with a single worker and no children ( Figure ) In addition to providing income insurance to families of unemployed workers the UI system helps the economy as a whole ( Auerbach and Feenberg ) Unemployment insurance is an automatic stabilizer that leans against the negative cycle of increased unemployment leading to reduced consumption which leads to a further decline in economic activity Since unemployed workers tend to spend rather than save their benefits the impact on aggregate demand is fairly immediate. Because of the way that the emergency and extended benefits programs increase economic activity they generate partially offsetting income and payroll tax revenues for the Federal Government and help state and local budgets by increasing sales tax revenues. In addition without the income support provided by these Because previous research suggests that recipients tend to understate the amount of unemployment benefits they receive ( Meyer Mok and Sullivan ) these figures can be seen as lower-bound estimates of the effect of UI on household income | Chapter Figure Share of Household Income from Unemployment Insurance among Recipients in by Household Type Percent Total Sole earners Sole earners Multiple earners Multiple earners with children without children with children without children Source : Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement programs more families would draw on other public programs. For these reasons the Congressional Budget Office notes that extending UI benefits is the most timely and cost-effective policy for increasing economic activity and employment ( CBO ) Policy Innovations The U.S. unemployment insurance system dates to the Great Depression of the 1930s. Originally most covered workers were employed in manufacturing. At its inception the UI system allowed for income smoothing for workers who would ultimately return to their old job or one like it. Research based on data from the early 1980s suggests that at that time percent of UI spells ended with the worker being recalled to his or her original job ( Corson and Nicholson ; Katz and Meyer ) Today temporary layoffs are less common ; increasingly workers receiving UI benefits have been dislocated as the result of structural changes in the economy and must find a new industry or occupation. In many cases wages in the new jobs these workers find are significantly lower than their former wages Thus workers today need income support while they are searching for a new job but they also need training job search support and other assistance to help ease what can be a difficult transition Preserving and Modernizing the Safety Net | The first step to modernize the unemployment insurance program was taken in the UI Modernization Act a part of the Recovery Act. The UI Modernization Act made $ billion available to states that made reforms to their UI programs. States could receive a part of the incentive payment for using the most recent quarter as a part of the base period of earnings on which UI eligibility and benefit amounts are determined. This made it more likely that recent labor market entrants would meet the minimum earnings threshold for UI eligibility. States could receive the other part of their apportioned payment by adopting two of the following policies : allowing workers who were employed part-time previously to continue receiving UI while looking for part-time work providing UI benefits to those who left their jobs for certain compelling family reasons allowing workers to continue receiving UI for an additional six months if in an approved training program and providing additional benefits for households with more dependents. These small incentive payments resulted in states changing their UI laws Building on these reforms in the American Jobs Act the President called for further steps to improve the unemployment insurance program and expand reemployment services and job training and has made these reforms a part of the FY Budget proposal. Although most UI policy innovations target workers who have already lost their jobs another important policy goal is to reduce the number of workers who are laid off in the first place. One promising initiative is work-sharing. Under a work-sharing arrangement workers whose hours are reduced in lieu of temporary layoffs receive partial UI benefits while remaining on the job and keeping their skills sharp. By allowing employers to retain skilled workers at reduced hours rather than laying them off work-sharing makes it easier and less costly for employers to scale up production when orders increase. Twenty-four states now have work-sharing programs and in the American Jobs Act President Obama proposed incentives to help expand the program to more states Workers who have been laid off need help finding a new job. The American Jobs Act included the Reemployment NOW program a set of reforms to help UI claimants get back to work more quickly. The FY Budget continues this support. As a part of this initiative the Administration has proposed requiring states to provide reemployment services such as career and job search counseling skills assessments and assistance in identifying helpful resources to EUC recipients to speed their return to work. Face-to-face contacts also provide an opportunity to assess recipients eligibility for UI benefits. Research suggests that these services can lower program costs by reducing spells of UI receipt and eliminating payments to ineligible individuals ( Black et al. ) | Chapter Because entrepreneurship is key to a dynamic economy a modern UI system should make it easier for displaced workers to start their own businesses. The Administration has proposed allowing states to use Reemployment NOW funds to expand Self-Employment Assistance programs that pay UI benefits to recipients who are working full-time to establish a new business. Seven states already permit a similar use of unemployment insurance benefits. Under this program entrepreneurship training would be facilitated through One-Stop Centers in collaboration with the Small Business Administration. A demonstration project Growing America Through Entrepreneurship ( Project GATE ) provided training and one-onone counseling to anyone interested in creating sustaining or expanding a small business. A recent study found that GATE had a positive effect on new business starts for unemployed participants and higher total earnings after five years than a comparison group ( Michaelides and Benus ) For jobless workers seeking to change occupations lack of experience can be a significant barrier. With Reemployment NOW funds states could experiment with Bridge to Work programs which would allow EUC recipients to get short-term work-based experience that helps them maintain or enhance their skills. Under this program private employers would be able to take on EUC recipients for up to hours a week for a trial period of up to eight weeks with the workers receiving compensation through the EUC program. In addition all program participants would be covered by workers compensation and be guaranteed at least the minimum wage Finally to support state creativity and flexibility upon approval of the Secretary of Labor states would be permitted to use Reemployment NOW funds to implement their own innovative strategies for connecting the longterm unemployed to employment opportunities In addition to these efforts that build upon the existing Federallyfinanced unemployment compensation system to help with getting the long-term unemployed back to work the President s Budget includes other important and complementary initiatives that will contribute to the goal of ensuring that every American who wants a job can find one. As discussed in Chapter these initiatives include streamlining training and employment services so that job seekers can visit a single location or go to a single web site to find the help they need ; providing a universal core set of services to serve all dislocated workers ; and introducing a new Pathways Back to Work fund to support employment opportunities for low-income youth low-income adults and the long-term unemployed Preserving and Modernizing the Safety Net | Other Safety Net Programs Several means-tested programs also provide support to American families especially those who have experienced adverse economic shocks Table reports the number of participants and Federal cost of several important programs. One of the largest Federal programs targeted at lowincome families is the Earned Income Tax Credit a refundable tax credit for low-income workers. The assistance is available only to those with earnings and the amount of the credit increases with a worker s earned income up to a maximum level and then phases out at higher income levels. The maximum benefit amount increases with the number of children in the family and the income level at which the credit begins to phase out differs according to taxpayer filing status ( single or married couple filing jointly ) As part of the Recovery Act Congress created a new category with a higher credit for taxpayers with three or more children providing those families as much as $ extra and increased the income level at which the credit phases out for married couples filing jointly by $ over levels. The Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of extended these changes through Over million working families and individuals received the EITC on their tax return with the average claimant receiving $ The benefits of the EITC go beyond the amount of the credit received Studies have found that the EITC increases participation in the labor market ( Eissa and Liebman ; Meyer and Rosenbaum ) improves maternal health outcomes ( Evans and Garthwaite ) and helps low-income individuals acquire additional experience that contributes to higher earnings growth ( Dahl DeLeire and Schwabish ) The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) is another critical safety net program targeted at low-income families. SNAP benefits are funded by the Federal Government and administered by states Families and individuals qualify if their income and assets are sufficiently low. Participants usually receive their benefits on electronic benefit transfer cards that can be used only to purchase food. Nondisabled adults who have no dependents and who are not working or participating in a work training program can usually receive SNAP benefits only for three months over a three-year period Roughly half of all SNAP participants were children and more than three-quarters of all participant households included a child an elderly person or a disabled nonelderly person. Roughly a quarter of all children participated.

Current projections are that SNAP enrollment will begin falling next year as the economy continues to recover. Thus like UI SNAP not only provides direct benefits to participant households but also has a stabilizing effect on the economy by limiting declines in consumption during economic downturns The Recovery Act established the Emergency Contingency Fund for state Temporary Aid for Needy Families programs which provided $ billion to states for increased spending for basic assistance nonrecurrent shortterm benefits or subsidized employment. States expanded efforts in all three areas including committing $ billion to the largest targeted employment initiative in the history of welfare reform. Thirty-nine states in addition to the District of Columbia Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands established subsidized employment programs with an estimated job slots created for adults and youth many of them involving subsidies that created jobs with private sector employers. While most of these subsidized employment Preserving and Modernizing the Safety Net | efforts were not sustained at previous levels after Recovery Act funding ended many jurisdictions have maintained programs at a smaller scale Based in part on the success of this initiative the President has proposed the Pathways Back to Work Fund ( discussed in Chapter ) that would provide employment opportunities for low-income individuals and the long-term unemployed Housing is the largest component of virtually every family s budget especially low-income families. The Federal safety net includes several programs designed to ensure that financial stress does not result in homelessness. Stable housing allows families to weather labor market shocks and is a precondition for children s educational success. In addition to the million families assisted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development s project-based rental assistance and public housing programs the largest Federal program aimed at low-income households is the Housing Choice Voucher program. The Housing Choice Voucher program served million families in FY of which percent included children the elderly or individuals with disabilities. As discussed in Chapter the Administration has also developed new programs that help unemployed homeowners avoid foreclosure Two other programs that are critical to the safety net provide benefits to Americans with disabilities. Social Security Disability Insurance ( SSDI ) is a social insurance program designed to offset the loss of wages of workers with long-term health conditions that prevent substantial gainful activity. Individuals with adequate Social Security covered employment history or children ( disabled before age ) of a retired deceased or disabled worker entitled to Social Security benefits are covered by the program. Beneficiaries receive a cash benefit based on their income before becoming disabled adjusted upward by wage inflation. In December more than million people received SSDI benefits. Recipients become eligible for Medicare after two years offsetting the loss of employer-sponsored health insurance A second Federal program that assists persons with disabilities is Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) a means-tested entitlement program that provides cash benefits to needy aged blind or disabled individuals. In December roughly million Americans received SSI benefits ; of that total about million qualified on the basis of a disability. The program is a particularly important source of income for older working-age adults : roughly one-quarter of all participants are between the ages of and A recent study illustrates how critical these programs are to their participants ( DeCesaro and Hemmeter ) Using data from the study shows that nearly a quarter of SSDI and roughly half of SSI beneficiaries had family incomes that fell below the Federal poverty level. However | Chapter the programs play an important role in keeping their beneficiaries out of extreme poverty which is defined as having an income below percent of the Federal poverty threshold. According to this study the majority of SSDI recipients relied on that program for at least percent of their income While only percent of SSI beneficiaries were in extreme poverty taking away SSI benefits would have raised that figure above percent Health Insurance In March the President signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( the Affordable Care Act ) When fully implemented the Affordable Care Act will significantly strengthen the health care safety net substantially increasing the number of Americans with health insurance and providing new protections and benefits to those who are already insured. The Affordable Care Act builds on and maintains the strengths of the current private system of employer-sponsored health coverage and insurance provided through Medicare Medicaid and the Children s Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) Therefore the changes brought about by the new law need to be considered in the context of the current system The Economics of Employer-Sponsored Health Insurance One of the defining features of the U.S. health care system is the central role played by employers. Today roughly nine in ten Americans with private health insurance obtain their coverage through the workplace either through their own employer or through the employer of a family member Employer-sponsored insurance is generally much less costly for workers who pay for coverage through reductions in their wages as well as direct premium contributions than coverage purchased directly in the individual market. There are three main sources of savings First employer-sponsored group coverage greatly mitigates the problem of adverse selection. Because employer-sponsored groups are formed for reasons other than purchasing health insurance they represent stable risk pools. Employer policies themselves contribute to this stability and to the spreading of risks. Within firms the amount that employees are required to contribute toward premiums generally does not vary with health risk Common employer and insurer policies such as limiting periods when employees can sign up for coverage and requiring a minimum employee participation rate prevent employees from declining coverage when they are healthy and joining the plan only when they need medical care A stable risk pool translates to lower administrative costs as insurers need to devote fewer resources to underwriting. Administrative savings also Preserving and Modernizing the Safety Net | come from economies of scale in marketing and administration. Because important costs vary with the number of contracts rather than the number of individuals covered by a contract it is less expensive on a per-person basis to sell to a group of than to sell to individuals Third because employer expenditures on health insurance premiums are exempt from Federal and state income taxes and Social Security payroll taxes employer-sponsored insurance can effectively be purchased with pretax dollars. For a typical worker in the percent tax bracket the tax exclusion reduces the cost of insurance by roughly one third ( Gruber ) Overall the estimated FY tax expenditure associated with the exemption from Federal taxes is $ billion Although the cost savings associated with employer provision of insurance can be large the savings are not evenly distributed among employers. The advantages of more efficient risk pooling and economies of scale in marketing and administration increase with firm size. The value of the tax exemption is not explicitly tied to firm size but because compensation tends to be higher in larger firms this advantage is correlated with size as well. As a result the larger the firm the greater the probability it will offer health insurance. Figure illustrates that whereas nearly all firms with more than employees offer health benefits less than half of those with to employees do. Between and the share of private sector establishments with fewer than workers that offer health insurance benefits declined from percent to percent Firm size affects more than just whether workers are offered coverage Among firms that offer insurance large firms are substantially more likely to offer a choice of plans : more than percent of private sector establishments with or more employees offered a choice of health insurance options in compared with percent of establishments with or fewer employees. Employees who have a choice of plans tend to report greater satisfaction with their insurance coverage and their health care ( Schone and Cooper ) And some very large firms have actively promoted strategies to improve health care quality and patient safety Over the past two decades rising health care costs have eroded the accessibility of employer-sponsored health insurance especially for middleclass families who experienced relatively little income growth over that period. Figure plots the percentage of workers who lack health insurance ( left axis ) against an estimate of their per capita health spending divided by their median income ( right axis ) Because the growth in health spending is a principal determinant of rising insurance premiums this ratio can be seen to capture changes in the affordability of health insurance. The figure indicates that during the 1980s insurance became less affordable as health care costs | Chapter Figure Percentage of Private Sector Establishments Offering Health Insurance by Number of Employees Percent employees employees employees employees Source : Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Insurance Component grew faster than median incomes and the percentage of workers without coverage grew. In the mid-1990s health care spending grew less rapidly and a strong economy caused median income to rise. As a result of this confluence the affordability index remained relatively constant and insurance coverage stabilized. However health care cost growth picked up again in the late 1990s and has outstripped income growth for the past decade causing coverage to decline once again Medicaid and CHIP : A Health Care Safety Net for Children As insurance coverage has declined among working-age adults over the past two decades coverage among children has actually increased because of expanded eligibility for public programs. Until the mid-1980s Medicaid eligibility was tied to eligibility for Aid to Families with Dependent Children the cash welfare program. Starting in the two programs were delinked and income eligibility limits for Medicaid were increased. The most significant eligibility expansions came as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Acts of and As the data in Figure depict with these expansions the share of children without health insurance began to decline even as the share of uninsured adults rose. By while percent of nonelderly adults were uninsured the share of children who were uninsured was percent Preserving and Modernizing the Safety Net | Figure Percentage of Workers Without Health Insurance and the Ratio of Per Capita Health Expenditures to Median Income Ratio of expenditures to income Percent uninsured Percent of workers without insurance ( left scale ) Per capita health expenditures for privately insured adults divided by median income among workers ( right scale ) Source : CEA extension of Gilmer and Kronick ( ) That same year Congress established the State Children s Health Insurance Program ( initially referred to as SCHIP now CHIP ) as part of the Balanced Budget Act of Like Medicaid CHIP is funded jointly by states and the Federal Government although CHIP allows states more flexibility in designing their programs. States began implementing CHIP in late and by every state program was up and running. Today the income eligibility limit in states and the District of Columbia is percent of the Federal poverty level or greater. As a result of Medicaid and CHIP the percentage of children who are uninsured has fallen since the late 1990s and is now less than half the adult rate President Obama has built on the success of Medicaid and CHIP by making these programs even stronger. In the early days of the Administration the President signed the Children s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of which extended funding for CHIP through September This legislation also introduced administrative reforms that improve program effectiveness including new performance bonuses for states that successfully increase coverage by streamlining eligibility and enrollment procedures. Also in the Recovery Act provided additional support to states by boosting the Federal share of Medicaid at a time when program enrollment was increasing and state budgets were in crisis. Between and June over | Chapter Figure Percentage of Children and Adults Without Health Insurance Percent Age Age under Note : Data for to adjusted to reflect CPS 's revision to the health insurance editing process Source : Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement million children gained coverage through Medicaid and CHIP. In the Affordable Care Act extended funding for CHIP through Because of Medicaid and CHIP insurance coverage of children tends to be less sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions than that of adults. Research suggests that holding other factors constant a percentage point increase in the national unemployment rate translates to almost a point decrease in the percentage of nonelderly adults and children covered by employer-sponsored insurance ( Holahan and Garrett ) Without a strong public insurance safety net for adults more than half of the working-age Americans who lose employer-sponsored insurance during an economic downturn end up uninsured. For children however the loss of private coverage is mostly offset by an increase in public insurance. This discrepancy between the experience of adults and children will change with the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act described below Many studies indicate that the expansion of Medicaid and CHIP has also significantly improved access to health care. One study using data from the 1980s and early 1990s found that eligibility for public insurance roughly halved the probability that a child failed to have at least one physician visit a year ( Currie and Gruber 1996a ) Other research shows that increased Medicaid eligibility for children leads to an increase in hospitalizations Preserving and Modernizing the Safety Net | overall but a decrease in preventable admissions ( that is those that are avoidable if a child receives appropriate primary care ) ( Dafny and Gruber ) Improved access to care translates into better health outcomes ranging from improvements in subjective health status ( Currie Decker and Lin ) to reduced child mortality ( Currie and Gruber 1996a 1996b ) Expanding Health Care Coverage : The Affordable Care Act The Affordable Care Act builds on the strengths of employersponsored insurance and on the success of earlier expansions of Medicaid and CHIP to expand and strengthen the health care safety net. By the Affordable Care Act is expected to increase the number of Americans with health insurance by more than million. Roughly half of the coverage gain will come from raising Medicaid eligibility limits to percent of the Federal poverty level. Because income eligibility limits for CHIP in all states already exceed this level the law will expand Medicaid coverage mainly among nonelderly adults. Although the primary responsibility for administering Medicaid will remain with the states funding for the expanded coverage will come almost entirely from the Federal Government Most of the remaining coverage gains will come from private insurance purchased through state-level Affordable Insurance Exchanges. Individuals and families with incomes up to percent of the Federal poverty level who do not have access to affordable employer-sponsored coverage that meets a minimum value will be eligible for premium tax credits that they can use to purchase coverage through an Exchange. These new tax credits are targeted at lower- and middle-income families who currently receive little or no benefit from the large tax subsidies that implicitly support the system of employer-sponsored insurance. The Affordable Care Act also establishes a Small Business Health Insurance Options Program ( SHOP ) in each state that gives small employers and their employees access to private health insurance plans and small business health insurance tax credits as well The state-level Exchanges will extend to workers at small firms the self-employed part-time workers and nonworkers many of the advantages of employer-sponsored insurance already enjoyed by employees of large firms : more efficient risk pooling and greater administrative economies of scale than are available in the current individual and small group market Within an Exchange consumers and employers will be able to choose from a broad menu of plans. To improve consumer choices Exchanges will provide transparent information on premiums benefits cost-sharing and plan quality information that will help cut the high consumer search costs that push up premiums in the small group and individual health insurance markets ( Cebul et al. ) By creating a marketplace in which consumers | Chapter can easily compare plans on the basis of price and quality the Exchanges should increase competition among insurers. Considerable evidence from large employers shows that when employees are given a choice of health plans and clear information about premiums and benefits they switch plans in response to small differences in premiums ( Buchmueller ) The Affordable Care Act establishes new consumer protections for health insurance coverage purchased either through an Exchange or in the outside individual or small group market many of which are already in effect today. Insurers will not be allowed to deny or limit coverage on the basis of an individual s health status. Within certain limits premiums may vary by age geography and smoking status but not by individual health status gender or other factors. The Act also includes a requirement that individuals who can afford insurance maintain minimum essential coverage These market reforms fill an important gap in the health care safety net Provisions of the Affordable Care Act Now in Place Many of the insurance market reforms along with the expansion of Medicaid and the creation of the Exchanges will not take effect until Some provisions of the Affordable Care Act however have already been put into place. Insurers are now prohibited from retroactively cancelling coverage because of honest mistakes made on the application. The Act also eliminates lifetime dollar limits on essential health benefits and restricts the use of annual dollar limits. ( Annual benefit limits will be eliminated completely by ) Since July consumers who are uninsured and unable to get insurance because of a pre-existing condition can find subsidized coverage through the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan. This temporary program gives uninsured individuals with costly conditions access to affordable insurance until the full set of consumer protections takes effect in As of the end of individuals were enrolled Another coverage-related provision of the law that is already in force allows young adults to remain on their parents private insurance policies until they reach age This policy targets a population that is disproportionately uninsured. Although one reason large numbers of young adults have no health insurance is that people in this age group tend to be in good health and do not perceive a need for health care ( the young invincibles hypothesis ) a second important reason is lack of access to affordable coverage because many young adults have not yet settled into full-time jobs that offer health benefits. As a result the probability of being uninsured jumps between the ages of and as many young adults lose coverage under their parents employer-sponsored insurance. This loss of coverage Preserving and Modernizing the Safety Net | translates to a significantly lower use of health care services ( Anderson Dobkin and Gross ) The dependent coverage provision of the Affordable Care Act took effect on September Data from several independent sources indicate that the policy has significantly increased the insurance coverage of young adults. Figure presents data from one such source the National Health Interview Survey highlighting the change in insurance coverage for youth age to in comparison to a slightly older group age to Because these two groups should face roughly similar labor market conditions the experience of the older group provides a sense of what would have happened to the younger group had this provision of the Affordable Care Act not gone into effect Estimates from the third quarter of show that percent of the younger group was uninsured compared with percent of the older group. Between the third quarter of and the second quarter of insurance coverage was essentially unchanged for the older group. In contrast among the younger group the share uninsured fell percentage points. This change translates to a gain in health insurance coverage for approximately million people. Because even before this policy college students were able to stay on their parents insurance plans or obtain coverage through their school the coverage gains arising from the Affordable Percent Figure Percentage of Young Adults Without Health Insurance Q3 and Q2 Q2 Q3 Ages Source : National Health Interview Survey | Chapter Q3 Q2 Ages Care Act have been concentrated among non-students and recent graduates Many of these newly insured young adults are from lower middle-class families who are working to maintain their position in the economy in the face of not only the recent economic downturn but long-run forces that have been working against the middle class for decades The Economic Benefits of Expanding Insurance Coverage Expansion in health insurance coverage from the ACA can be expected to positively affect access to care health and financial security These effects and the impact of other provisions of the Affordable Care Act will be important topics of research ( see Data Watch ) Research on previous coverage expansions suggests that health insurance can significantly improve all three outcomes. As noted considerable research has examined the benefits of health insurance for children. One recent study ( Finkelstein et al. ) examines the effect of insurance coverage on low-income adults. The study which uses data from Oregon s Medicaid program has two especially notable features. First its population sample is similar to the group that will gain Medicaid coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act. Second because of budgetary constraints access to Medicaid coverage was determined randomly by a lottery in the same way patients are assigned to treatment and control groups in a randomized control trial. As a result the study avoids the fundamental problems of inference inherent to observational studies The study finds that in the program s first year insurance coverage significantly increased the use of outpatient and inpatient care and of prescription drugs. The added care led to increases in the share of men and women screened for high cholesterol and high blood sugar and in the share of women receiving mammograms and Pap tests. The study also noted significant gains in several self-reported measures of physical and mental health. These findings are especially striking because the health benefits of improved access to care are likely to grow over time In addition to improving access to appropriate care health insurance protects individuals and families from the financial risk associated with uncertain and potentially catastrophic medical costs. Today few uninsured families have the resources to cover the cost of a serious illness. According to one recent study about a third of uninsured families have no financial assets at all and the average uninsured family can afford to pay only percent of the cost of a single hospitalization ( Chappel Kronick and Glied ) The Oregon study used several financial outcomes to assess economic benefits of insurance. It found that individuals with health insurance were less likely to have unpaid bills sent to a collection agency and that they were significantly Preserving and Modernizing the Safety Net | Data Watch : Health Data for Policy Health policy formulation and evaluation requires high-quality data on a broad range of outcomes. Federal surveys have provided the basis for a large research literature that informed the design of the Affordable Care Act. These surveys along with other Federal data programs will be important resources for monitoring the impact of the Act One objective of the Affordable Care Act is to substantially increase the number of Americans with health insurance. The National Health Interview Survey ( NHIS ) sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) and three other surveys conducted by the Census Bureau the Current Population Survey s Annual Social and Economic Supplement the Survey of Income and Program Participation and the American Community Survey provide data on various aspects of insurance coverage. Increased insurance coverage should lead to improved access to care and improved population health The NHIS and another HHS survey the Household Component of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey ( MEPS ) combine information on insurance coverage with information on medical care utilization and health status. Another component of the MEPS surveys employers on key features of the health insurance they offer employees. Additional information on utilization comes from HHS surveys of health care providers including office-based physicians ambulatory care facilities and hospitals Two Federal data programs the National Health Expenditure Accounts produced by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the National Income and Product Accounts produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis provide independent estimates of national health spending. Efforts also are under way at the Bureau of Labor Statistics to improve the collection of health data to better measure health sector prices and productivity ( Bradley et al. ) Current initiatives by Federal agencies and academic researchers are aimed at developing data systems that support disease-based estimates of health spending ( Aizcorbe Retus and Smith ) Research in this area focusing on selected conditions has shown that disease-based measures allow for a more nuanced understanding of what drives the growth in health spending. The results suggest that failing to account for changes in the inputs used to treat a particular condition and for improvements in health outcomes leads to an overestimate of health care inflation and an underestimate of productivity gains in the health sector ( Aizcorbe and Nestoriak ) Whether this conclusion can be generalized is the subject of ongoing research | Chapter less likely to report having to borrow money or skip paying other bills to pay medical expenses. These findings are consistent with earlier research showing that the advent of Medicare in generated large benefits in the form of reduced exposure to out-of-pocket medical expenditure risk ( Finkelstein and McKnight ) The benefits of the Affordable Care Act s coverage expansion are likely to spill over to the labor market as well. Because small firms can not offer health insurance that matches in cost and quality the insurance offered by larger firms they often find it difficult to compete with large firms in attracting and retaining workers. Similarly the lack of affordable insurance options in the individual health insurance market poses a barrier to workers who would like to start their own business work part-time or retire before they are eligible for Medicare. Indeed numerous studies find that the link between health insurance and full-time employment distorts decisions regarding labor supply job mobility and retirement ( Gruber and Madrian ) By improving the health insurance options available to small employers and expanding the availability of affordable individual coverage the Affordable Care Act should greatly reduce if not eliminate these distortions The Affordable Care Act and Medicare Given the high and uncertain medical expenses faced by seniors the health insurance coverage that Medicare provides for individuals age and older is a critical component of the health care safety net. The inability of private markets alone to provide adequate health insurance coverage for seniors is a classic example of adverse selection ( Akerlof ) Indeed before Medicare was enacted in only an estimated one-quarter of seniors had meaningful private insurance ( Finkelstein ) Today Medicare covers roughly million elderly Americans and million people under age who qualify on the basis of disability Although the Affordable Care Act s coverage expansions and insurance market reforms are targeted at nonelderly Americans the new law has important implications for Medicare as well. It provides new benefits to seniors by eliminating cost sharing for recommended preventive services adds an annual wellness visit and reduces out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs in the Medicare Part D coverage gap. By the end of more than million elderly Americans have benefited from the elimination of cost sharing for preventive benefits and million beneficiaries have received $ billion in drug discounts The Affordable Care Act also puts in place several strategies for reducing the growth in Medicare spending. Such efforts to bend the cost curve are essential to maintaining the long-run fiscal status of the program Preserving and Modernizing the Safety Net | and reducing long-run Federal budget deficits. The Act includes important changes in the way Medicare pays doctors hospitals and other health care providers to create strong incentives for providers to redesign the way they deliver care both to improve health and to use scarce resources more efficiently. The Medicare Shared Savings Program for example encourages physicians hospitals and other organizations to form Accountable Care Organizations ( ACOs ) to provide cost-effective coordinated care to Medicare beneficiaries. Both the Shared Savings program and a similar Affordable Care Act initiative developed through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation ( the Innovation Center ) reward ACOs that are able to reduce the growth in health care spending while achieving high standards for clinical quality and patient satisfaction The mission of the Innovation Center is to help transform the Medicare Medicaid and CHIP programs to deliver better health care better health and reduced costs. The center s portfolio of initiatives includes demonstration projects that test new strategies for providing higher-quality health care more efficiently. These strategies include models of enhanced primary care ; the use of episode-based bundled payments to improve care coordination ; and a challenge grant program that will award up to $ billion in grants to applicants who will implement the most compelling ideas for delivering better health improved care and lower costs to people enrolled in Medicare Medicaid and CHIP. Because of Medicare s outsized role as a purchaser of health care these initiatives are likely to spur similar innovations by private insurers Retirement Security For older Americans retirement savings in combination with Social Security benefits are a critical element of the safety net. These savings and benefits together allow retirees to maintain the living standards they had during their working lives and to protect themselves against downturns in the financial markets unexpectedly high health care costs and the risk of running down one s assets. In addition some Americans elect to accumulate additional savings in hopes of bequeathing assets to their heirs. From a broader societal perspective private retirement savings fuel capital accumulation. Capital thus accumulated leads to greater investment which in turn leads to a more productive workforce and stronger economic growth. In this sense saving not only bolsters the standard of living in retirement for participating workers but also raises the quality of life for future generations Over the years policymakers have implemented a variety of policies to encourage capital accumulation to protect retired households against | Chapter economic shocks and to increase the likelihood that Americans enjoy the same quality of life during retirement that they enjoyed during their working years. The most prominent of these programs is Old Age and Survivors Insurance also known as Social Security which pays retiree benefits to more than percent of elderly individuals in the United States. Social Security is the nation s retirement security bedrock paying out $ billion to million beneficiaries in an average annual benefit of $ Social Security payments combined with private savings and employer-provided retirement benefits provide sufficient income to enjoy a comfortable retirement and for many others make the difference between meeting basic needs and living in poverty. In Social Security income lifted an estimated million elderly Americans out of poverty. The program also provides a key safety net for survivors of deceased workers helping roughly million surviving spouses and children Even as Social Security helps provide a stable source of income in retirement tax preferences for retirement saving give working-age households greater incentive to accumulate assets toward retirement. Most tax-preferred accounts allow workers and their employers to make pre-tax contributions to a retirement account and also allow earnings on those contributions to accumulate tax-free ; other accounts allow after-tax contributions to grow and be withdrawn tax-free. Many American households have responded to these tax incentives by building assets toward retirement with total balances in defined-contribution and individual retirement accounts ( IRAs ) rising to nearly $ trillion in The overall tax expenditure for the principal retirement saving incentives is substantial totaling almost $ billion in fiscal year Declining Retirement Preparedness Despite the availability of tax-related incentives to spur saving many households have not accumulated sufficient assets to overcome the potential risks faced in retirement. By some estimates the proportion of households with adequate retirement saving has been in decline for decades As illustrated in Figure the share of households at risk of experiencing marked declines in consumption in retirement rose from percent in to percent in with much of the recent change owing to declining housing values.2 For members of Generation X ( individuals born between These estimates are based on the National Retirement Risk Index ( NRRI ) produced by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. For each household the NRRI estimates household income in retirement ( based on projected assets at retirement ) as a share of pre-retirement earnings ; this percentage represents the replacement rate of pre-retirement earnings. Each household is assigned a benchmark adequate replacement rate ; households that are more than percent below the benchmark are deemed to be at risk. Preserving and Modernizing the Safety Net | the mid-1960s and ) the situation is even more troubling with nearly three in five households in that age group in danger of becoming unable to maintain their living standard in retirement ( Munnell Webb and GolubSass ) Although retirement preparedness has been in decline in the aggregate specific demographic groups are particularly vulnerable. Single individuals and low-income households are all especially likely to enter retirement with insufficient assets. For example one estimate for identified percent of low-income households as inadequate savers compared with percent of high-income households ( Munnell Webb and Golub-Sass ) Another estimate found that percent of single men had insufficient retirement wealth to maintain preretirement consumption compared with percent of married couples ( Haveman et al. ) Recent economic shocks have impacted individuals nearing retirement. Between and Americans aged to saw their real median household income decline by percent and their median net worth fall percent from $ to $ ( Bricker et al. ) In addition the value of housing a key source of wealth for older Americans has dropped percent since the housing market s peak in April The value of financial assets also declined precipitously following the financial crisis and has yet to rebound fully to pre-recession levels. The combination of declining asset values and lower income has further weakened retirement preparedness Challenges to the Retirement Safety Net Several developments have contributed to the problem of inadequate retirement saving. A first-order concern is declining participation in employer-sponsored retirement plans. Between and the share of private sector workers between the ages of and who participated in an employer-sponsored retirement plan fell from percent to percent The past several decades have also seen changes in the nature of private employer retirement plans. The share of private-sector workers covered by defined-benefit pension plans fell from percent in to percent in as many private employers switched to defined-contribution plans like ( k ) plans. Section ( k ) and other defined-contribution plans offer workers particular benefits such as portability high potential for growth and flexibility. However the shift to ( k ) plans ( and to a lesser degree a shift from traditional defined-benefit pensions to hybrid defined-benefit plans such as cash balance plans ) has also transferred substantial risk away from employers placing greater responsibility on workers to accumulate and manage assets and exposing them to greater financial risk | Chapter Figure The National Retirement Risk Index Percent of households " at risk " Source : Munnell Webb and Golub-Sass ( ) To take full advantage of the wide array of incentives for retirement saving workers must assess complex details associated with establishing an account making contributions managing investments and eventually making withdrawals. In the face of complex saving and investment decisions some workers put off enrolling in employer-sponsored retirement programs or taking advantage of tax-preferred saving vehicles outside of employment. Such delays are costly in terms of lifetime asset accumulation. ( See Economics Application Box for more information on common mistakes made by retirement savers. ) Another challenge to the retirement safety net is the uneven distribution of the benefits of the tax code s generous incentives for retirement saving. Because these tax incentives are often provided as a deduction or exclusion from income they are most valuable for taxpayers in higher tax brackets. In the aggregate these incentives flow disproportionately to upperincome households ; almost percent of the total tax benefit is projected to go in to the richest percent of households and more than percent to households in the top percent of the income distribution ( Toder Harris and Lim ) The availability of employer-sponsored retirement saving options also varies by firm size. As with health insurance small employers face significant challenges in establishing retirement plans. High per-participant Preserving and Modernizing the Safety Net | administrative costs frequent employee turnover uncertain revenues and lack of familiarity with plan design and characteristics all discourage small business owners from providing retirement plans. Their inability to provide these plans not only threatens retirement security for employees of small businesses but also can make small businesses less attractive to workers than larger employers are These obstacles to retirement saving keep account balances low for many households. In more than half of all workers reported that the total value of their household s savings is less than $ ; percent said they have less than $ in savings ( Helman Copeland and VanDerhei ) Although some of these workers may participate in defined-benefit pensions others will enter retirement with little income outside of Social Security. One analysis of households aged to in showed that the median household had just $ in financial assets and $ in private retirement assets ( Poterba Venti and Wise ) Most households in the sample had more wealth in housing equity than in liquid assets ( Table ) One of the toughest retirement challenges involves uncertainty about how long retirees are likely to live. With extended longevity comes the possibility that an individual will live longer than expected and will thus outlive his or her accumulated assets. This possibility increases as the time between retirement and expected age of death lengthens. In a worker retiring at age could expect to live another years ; by that figure had grown to years. Although extending life expectancy is an exceptional achievement for the United States it also increasingly exposes retirees to the risk of outliving their assets outside of Social Security. In just percent of Americans aged to relied on Social Security for more than percent of their income but the share almost doubled to percent for Americans age and older ( Figure ) Another serious risk is costly health shocks. Even with the protection provided by Medicare many retirees face high out-of-pocket health expenditures diminishing their retirement assets and threatening their well-being Recent research estimates that for a 65-year-old couple the expected present value of lifetime out-of-pocket medical costs exceeds $ with a percent risk that expenses will exceed $ ( Webb and Zhivan ) As discussed in Data Watch out-of-pocket health costs can push retirees into poverty The risk of large health expenditures and the possibility of outliving one s assets force retirees to face difficult decisions about how much of their assets to consume in any given year.

Today workers must take much more responsibility for ensuring that they have adequate income throughout retirement. Achieving that goal requires avoiding some mistakes commonly made in saving for retirement Below is a list of five mistakes that people often make Missing out on the tax benefits of saving. The tax code affords strong incentives for retirement saving. Participation in an employer-sponsored retirement plan or individual retirement account can yield thousands of dollars of extra retirement wealth over time. In addition low- and middle-income households can take advantage of the Saver s Credit which effectively provides workers with a Government match on new saving Workers can substantially increase their retirement savings by contributing early and taking advantage of tax benefits for retirement saving. For example if a 25-year-old contributes $ toward retirement in a taxable account that $ can be expected to grow to approximately $ in today s dollars by the time the worker reaches age Taking advantage of tax benefits for saving can substantially increase this amount. If the same worker contributes $ to a Roth IRA that $ can be expected to grow to nearly $ in today s dollars by the time the worker reaches age As illustrated in the figure below the benefits of tax-preferred saving increase over time Simulated Accumulation for an Intial $ Contribution to a Taxable Account or Roth IRA Dollars ( ) Roth IRA Taxable Account Note : Calculations assume a percent real rate of return and percent tax rate Source : CEA calculations | Chapter Failing to participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan Some employer-sponsored retirement plans provide an employer match for money that an employee deposits into a retirement account. Taking advantage of an employer match is one of the best ways to leverage retirement contributions and rapidly accumulate saving. Many workers especially new hires and young employees however leave this free money on the table by failing to sign up for a retirement plan. In only percent of workers aged participated in a company retirement plan even when one was offered ( Kawachi Smith and Toder ) Failing to diversify retirement savings. Investment needs and risk appetites vary across households. However concentrating all assets in one particular type of investment can prove risky especially if that asset is stock in an employee s company. One study found that in nearly million workers invested in excess of percent of their employer retirement plan assets in own-company stock ( Mitchell and Utkus ) In general investors can protect themselves against risk by spreading their assets across various types of investments Losing investment returns to high fees. High fees can inhibit rapid accumulation of retirement wealth. Savers should pay attention to all investment fees including those charged at purchase of a mutual fund ongoing fees fees charged by brokers and registered investment advisors and fees charged on the purchase of annuity products. Although these fees are ordinarily charged for legitimate services provided investors should incorporate the cost of fees in their purchase decisions Cashing-out retirement savings. When workers leave a job some fail to rollover their pension wealth into an IRA and pay a penalty for cashing out their retirement savings. These leakages in retirement savings make it difficult to arrive at retirement with adequate amounts of savings. In workers aged to cashed out $ billion in retirement assets when changing jobs ( GAO ) Failing to protect against longevity and health care risk in old age As lifespans increase more Americans will face the prospect of running out of money in old age. Planning for and protecting against the risk of outliving family assets as well as the need for long-term care is an essential part of the retirement security picture Preserving and Modernizing the Safety Net | behavioral aversion to annuities and inadequate savings to purchase an annuity ( Benartzi Previtero and Thaler ) Policies to Address Retirement Saving Challenges The President has proposed several policies to bolster Americans retirement saving behavior and lead to a more secure retirement for millions of families. Perhaps the most significant policy is the establishment of automatic IRAs for tens of millions of workers. This proposal builds on a broad literature showing that automatic enrollment can dramatically increase participation rates in workplace retirement plans. For example Madrian and Shea ( ) show that the participation rate after one year of employment at a large corporation increased from percent to percent following the adoption of automatic enrollment The President s proposal would require most firms without qualified employee retirement plans to offer employees an automatic IRA option. By default automatic IRA contributions would be funded by payroll deductions equal to percent of pay unless employees opted out of the program or elected to contribute a different amount. Firms would not contribute on behalf of the employee and companies offering the automatic IRA to workers could claim a tax credit for the employer s associated expenses up to $ for the first year and $ for the second year along with an additional tax credit of $ per employee up to a maximum of $ a year for six years The automatic IRA would transform the retirement saving landscape Employees who previously accumulated little or nothing toward retirement would begin accumulating assets immediately. Upward of million workers all previously ineligible for workplace retirement saving plans would be covered by the new proposal. About percent of these workers would be low- and middle-income employees with less than $ in annual wages indicating that the IRA would primarily be targeted at workers who are more likely to have accumulated little savings The Administration also proposes to increase the tax credit for small businesses that adopt for the first time a qualified employee retirement plan. Under current law small businesses can receive up to $ in tax credits each year for up to three years for establishing an employee retirement plan. The President proposes to double the maximum credit to $ annually to provide a stronger incentive for small employers to establish workplace retirement plans The Administration s Budget eases the compliance burden for retirement savings by exempting retirees with modest accumulated saving from minimum required distribution ( MRDs ) rules. MRDs are established to ensure that retirees with high accumulated retirement assets direct those | Chapter assets towards retirement and not use retirement accounts to shelter their income from estate taxes. The Administration proposes to exempt retirees with less than $ in retirement savings from these rules. This move would simplify tax compliance for millions of elderly Americans who would no longer need to calculate the amount and timing of their minimum required payouts. It would give millions of seniors greater freedom of choice as to when and how rapidly to spend their limited assets in retirement while also adding flexibility to purchase lifetime income products such as longevity annuities that might violate MRD regulations The Administration has made a commitment to financial literacy as a means of assisting Americans in making sound decisions regarding saving and investment. In the President signed an Executive Order creating the President s Advisory Council on Financial Capability to assist the American people in understanding financial matters and making informed financial decisions. In addition the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which is charged with educating consumers about financial matters and enabling them to make sound financial decisions. And in the Financial Literacy and Education Commission established to coordinate Federal efforts to promote financial literacy developed a new national strategy to enable Federal agencies to coordinate and promote all the Federal initiatives aimed at helping Americans make better financial choices Taken together these policies will lead to a more inclusive retirement saving landscape. Workers who would defer retirement saving because of financial inertia or behavioral obstacles will automatically be put on a path toward better saving. Easing MRD rules will simplify financial decisions in retirement for millions of elderly Americans. A coordinated national financial literacy campaign will help Americans become more active savers and will lead to improved investment decisions and smarter consumer behavior. More active saving coupled with improved investment behavior will increase the level of assets earmarked for retirement saving leading to a more stable retirement for millions of Americans Conclusion A strong and dynamic economy requires a robust and modern safety net to protect families against economic shocks and to provide a level of security that promotes entrepreneurship and economic growth. The challenging economic times of the past decade have made clear the important role that public policy can play in this area. In particular unemployment insurance benefits the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Supplemental Preserving and Modernizing the Safety Net | Nutrition Assistance Program have kept millions of American families out of poverty. Medicaid and the Children s Health Insurance Program have ensured that children are able to maintain health insurance coverage even if their parents lose access to employer-sponsored plans New policy initiatives will further strengthen the safety net. Although the current system of unemployment insurance has provided critical support for dislocated workers the system can be modernized and improved The President has proposed a number of innovative programs that would make it easier for jobless workers to invest in new skills or even start their own businesses. These proposals build on current programs that have been proven to work The Affordable Care Act represents the most significant improvement in the health care safety net since the advent of Medicare and Medicaid in the mid-1960s. By the Act is expected to increase the number of Americans with health insurance by over million and it will put in place new consumer protections ensuring that health insurance coverage remains available and affordable for all Americans regardless of an individual s health status or medical history In the area of retirement security the President has proposed a number of policies that will boost retirement savings making it more likely that Americans will enter retirement with adequate assets to maintain their desired level of consumption. These efforts to strengthen the safety net will provide tangible benefits for the economy and families in the coming decades | Chapter C H A P T E R IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGH SMART REGULATION INNOVATION CLEAN ENERGY AND PUBLIC INVESTMENT R ecent years have seen an unprecedented number of official efforts to improve develop and implement new measures of the quality of life and economic performance. Much of the groundwork for these efforts was laid in two important National Research Council reports. Nature s Numbers published in considered how to expand the national income accounts that track the country s economic activity to properly take into account the environment and natural resources. Beyond the Market published in proposed ways to integrate nonmarket activity into the accounts This work has implications for economic policy. Carefully designed regulations can promote economic growth and improve the Nation s quality of life. Water pollution for example can cause illness and destroy the livelihood of fishermen and others who rely on a healthy ecosystem to earn a living. Pollution as Robert Kennedy noted does not subtract from the gross domestic product. Appropriately balanced efforts to restrict harmful pollution can improve economic performance along with the health and safety of Americans The theme of this chapter is that properly measured both economic growth and the Nation s well-being can be increased by smart regulation innovation and public investment in such fields as medical research clean domestic energy and transportation infrastructure A Smart Approach to Regulations For more than a century the United States has been a world leader in protecting the health and safety of its citizens through well-chosen regulations. Fuchs ( and ) attributes gains in life expectancy prior to World War II to improvements in nonmedical factors : nutrition sanitation housing and public health measures. For example in response to yellow fever and cholera outbreaks caused by water pollution the Rivers and Harbors Act of gave the Army Corps of Engineers the authority to regulate the discharge into waterways of refuse matter of any kind or description. Similarly public health concerns about unsanitary meat packing conditions and patent medicines containing narcotics gave rise to the Pure Food and Drug Act of which authorized the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to inspect food and drug products and regulate their sale. In roughly one in every Americans was addicted to narcotics found in patent medicines ( DOJ n.d. ) Following the disclosure requirements in the Pure Food and Drug Act sales of patent medicines containing those substances fell by nearly a third ( Musto ) As society evolves and technology changes such basic protections afforded to citizens through regulation are updated and improved. Today the water pollution controls provided for in the Rivers and Harbors Act have been incorporated into more expansive provisions in the Clean Water Act of and the Safe Drinking Water Act of which enable the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to promulgate regulations with the goal of making U.S. waters safe for drinking swimming and fishing Similarly the Pure Food and Drug Act of was amended by the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act of to give the FDA the authority to require evidence of safety for new drugs and to tighten food quality standards. It was amended again in to require manufacturers to prove drug effectiveness ( Randall ) Most recently the Food Safety Modernization Act of further improved the safety of food sold in the United States by among other provisions giving the FDA the authority to directly issue mandatory food recalls requiring food processors to have plans in place for addressing safety risks and requiring importers to verify food safety Measuring the benefits of regulations for the quality of life is a formidable task. Some forms of regulation have a positive effect on economic growth for example by improving the health and vitality of the workforce by promoting stable and efficient operation of financial markets by speeding the adoption of energy-saving technologies by improving educational outcomes or by upgrading the operation of the transportation system Much of the benefit from those types of regulations eventually translates | Chapter into increases in GDP. In other cases such as the protection of the National Park System safeguards against invasive species or cleaner lakes for swimming and fishing the benefits of regulation help the economy but are less easily charted in the national accounts. For example increased tourism or higher returns to commercial fishing resulting from cleaner water would be reflected in GDP whereas the public s increased appreciation of that cleaner water would not be Designing Smart Regulations On January President Obama issued Executive Order Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review which lays out a balanced approach to regulation to protect the health and safety of the American people in a way that maximizes net benefits to society that uses the best information available and that avoids unnecessary or overly burdensome requirements. The President called for an agency-wide review to reduce burdensome regulations. Underlying that approach is a belief that a smart effective regulatory system depends on careful analysis of costs and benefits both before and after regulatory action including an informed public discussion. The Executive order directs the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs ( OIRA ) of the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) to provide oversight transparency and discipline for executive agencies in the regulatory process and coordinates that interagency review of rulemakings to ensure that regulations are consistent with applicable law. The net benefits of regulations finalized in are expected to be at their highest level in the last years. And monetized savings from the retrospective review of regulations called for in the new Executive order are likely to exceed $ billion over the next five years Many of those regulations are intended to improve the quality of life by correcting market failures that lead to unsafe living or working environments. Effective regulations put into place rules that correct for significant market failures and thus achieve greater social benefits. Smart regulations are those that maximize the net benefits of a regulatory action to society Benefit-cost analysis attempts to quantify and assign dollar values to the various effects of a regulation which can be used to determine how it can reach its goal in the most efficient manner that is how it can generate the largest net benefits ( the difference between total benefits and total costs ) to society. Such information is useful for both policymakers and the public even when economic efficiency is neither the only nor the overriding public policy objective as in the case of protecting privacy Benefit-cost analysis is used to estimate likely future benefits and costs of a proposed regulation but it can also be used to look back at existing Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation | Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment regulations based on evidence about the actual realized benefits and costs of those regulations. Such retrospective analyses can be used both to improve existing regulations and to better evaluate new ones Smart regulations thus seek to use the best information available in order to maximize net benefits by setting regulatory stringency at the most efficient level the point at which the incremental benefits are equal to the incremental costs. For example even though the marginal costs of seat belt standards increased over time ( front-seat shoulder and rear-seat lap belts were mandated for cars in and for light trucks and vans in and three-point belts were required in the mid-1970s ) those costs were far outweighed by the corresponding number of lives saved per year by seat belts ( DOT ; Kahane ) The buckle-up laws of the mid-1980s raised the number of lives saved by wearing seat belts to a year by and subsequent increases in belt use raised the annual number of lives saved to more than in each year from to All together between and seat belt regulations saved an estimated lives ( Kahane ; DOT ) ( For another example of how benefit-cost analysis works see Economics Application Box ) Smart Regulations in Practice Benefit-cost analysis has long been used to evaluate regulations within the Federal Government. For example the Flood Control Act of declared that the Federal Government should improve or participate in the improvement of navigable waters or their tributaries including watersheds thereof for flood-control purposes if the benefits to whomsoever they may accrue are in excess of the estimated costs and if the lives and social security of people are otherwise adversely affected. The use of benefit-cost analysis in evaluating Federal regulations has become widespread since when President Reagan issued Executive Order formally requiring that regulatory action shall not be undertaken unless the potential benefits to society for the regulation outweigh the potential costs to society and that regulatory objectives shall be chosen to maximize the net benefits to society. President Clinton issued Executive Order which focused OIRA oversight on significant rules and increased transparency. As noted earlier President Obama issued Executive Order which reaffirms the principles in Executive Order and outlines a regulatory strategy to support continued economic growth and job creation. In particular Executive Order offers new directions for regulatory review including a requirement that agencies use the best available techniques to quantify anticipated present and future benefits and costs as accurately as possible while authorizing consideration of values that are | Chapter difficult or impossible to quantify including equity human dignity fairness and distributive impacts. Based on the quantified benefits and costs in current regulations smart regulations are generating the highest level of net benefits for U.S. citizens in the last decade. In calendar year the Administration completed regulatory reviews of which were interim final or final rules from executive agencies. Of the interim final and final rules reviewed percent were economically significant meaning that they are anticipated to have an effect on the economy of more than $ million in any given year. Those economically significant rules are expected to result in $ billion in costs and $ billion in benefits annually ( in dollars ) Over the past three calendar years the annualized net benefits of completed rules have totaled about $ billion. In alone annualized net benefits totaled more than $ billion. Those figures reflect an estimate of not only purely monetary savings but also an estimate of the monetary value of prevented deaths illnesses and injuries. Figure shows the benefits and costs of regulations which are detailed in the agencies Regulatory Impact Assessments for each economically significant rule and summarized annually in OMB s annual Regulatory-Right-to-Know report to Congress Data and estimation methods have improved substantially over time as have modeling tools for projecting a regulation s effect into the future. For Figure Benefits and Costs of Regulations Billions of dollars Total benefits Net benefits Total costs Note : Total benefits total costs and net benefits are based on the midpoints of agency estimates for regulations completed during the calendar year Source : Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation | Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment Economics Application Box : Comparing Benefits and Costs How do policymakers determine whether a regulation is a smart regulation ? For example in the Department of Transportation ( DOT ) decided to require that all new passenger vehicles weighing less than pounds be equipped with electronic stability control ( ESC ) systems which reduce crashes by improving braking in critical situations when the driver is beginning to lose control. This rule will increase the fraction of new vehicles with ESC from percent in to percent in How did the DOT decide this was a smart regulation ? First the DOT identified what is arguably a market failure : a relatively affordable technology existed that lowered the risk of a crash but it was not being offered by some manufacturers and when offered the choice many consumers declined. This market failure was caused by asymmetric information ( drivers purchasing a vehicle could not fully assess the protection afforded by ESC systems ) and by a negative externality ( consumers purchasing a car without an ESC system did not fully account for the risks of a crash to others ) .a Second the DOT then examined the likely costs and benefits of equipping all passenger cars and light trucks/vans with ESC by model year Approximately million vehicles will be subject to this regulation ; however DOT estimates that as of manufacturers would have installed ESC in percent of their fleet absent the rulemaking Therefore both the benefits and costs were calculated by raising ESC installation from that baseline of percent to percent. The benefits of the rule include reductions in fatalities injuries property damage and travel delays all resulting from fewer accidents. To monetize those benefits the DOT multiplied the total number of loss-of-control crashes by the average effectiveness of ESC systems and found that crashes would be avoided each year. Using historical accident data DOT estimated that a decline of crashes would reduce total annual fatalities by and decrease total annual injuries by 46,896.b The monetary value of those benefits depends on the discount rate that is on how much benefits in the future are worth today ( a high discount rate implies that people discount the future more and thus any benefits that accrue in the future would be valued less today ) At a percent discount rate the reduction in injuries and fatalities translates into $ billion in benefits ; at a percent discount rate those benefits are $ billion as the Box Table shows. To determine the noninjury component of benefits the DOT multiplied the individual unit costs for travel delays and property damage by the crashes that would be prevented by the rule yielding $ million in benefits at the discount rate of percent | Chapter Annual Costs and Benefits by Discount Rate Millions of dollars % discount Injury and fatality benefits Savings from reduced property damage and travel delays % discount $ $ Total benefits Vehicle costs Fuel costs Total costs Net benefits Note : Vehicle costs are not discounted because they occur when the vehicle is purchased whereas benefits occur over the vehicle s lifetime and are discounted back to the time of purchase Source : Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( ) The DOT determined that production costs would rise by between $ and $ for each affected vehicle depending on whether the vehicle was already equipped with anti-lock braking systems a necessary component of ESC. The expected costs of the standard above the baseline total $ million. Because the average weight of passenger cars is expected to increase by pounds as a result of the new equipment the lifetime fuel use of those vehicles is expected to go up by gallons. At discount rates of percent and percent the total additional fuel costs are $ million and $ million respectively. Summing vehicle and fuel costs gave the total costs of the regulation : about $ billion. Net benefits then are the difference between total costs and total benefits or between $ billion and $ billion each year for the lower range of accident prevention a For further discussion of market failures and automobile safety standards see Mannering and Winston ( ) Arnould and Grabowski ( ) and Viscusi and Gayer ( ) b The appropriateness of including private benefits net of private costs in a benefit-cost analysis varies from rule to rule. By including private net benefits the value of reducing injuries and fatalities of the consumers minus the purchase cost of the technology the DOT is making the implicit assumption that consumers have made a suboptimal purchasing decision ( one of the market failures being addressed by the regulation ) However if consumers do not face an information problem a traditional approach would assume that consumers have made the purchasing decision that maximizes their welfare. If this were the case it would be inappropriate to include those private net benefits in the analysis. For further discussion see Gayer ( ) Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation | Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment example the health benefits from reducing different air pollutants over different time periods and populations have been estimated by epidemiologists using air quality monitoring data and various health endpoints ( EPA 2011a ) Improvements in computing power and data records now allow air quality modelers to forecast the effects of regulatory actions on future air quality under different scenarios. Combining those estimates allows policymakers to weigh the expected health results of a given air quality regulation with the expected costs associated with the controls required by the rule A peer-reviewed study by the EPA using the Criteria Air Pollutant Modeling System estimated that the Clean Air Act prevented more than premature deaths cases of chronic bronchitis nonfatal heart attacks and million cases of asthma exacerbation between and Those adverse health outcomes could have led to emergency room visits for respiratory problems million lost school days and million lost work days ( EPA 2011b ) Some health benefits from Clean Air Act regulations will likely raise economic growth indirectly and over time through intermediate factors For example a healthier population will arguably be a more productive one a change that can be measured in improved labor productivity. A growing consensus has identified certain of those intermediate drivers of growth including increased human capital capital investment research and development economic competition physical infrastructure and good governance. Some evidence strongly suggests that regulations promoting educational attainment may improve human capital accumulation thereby increasing economic growth over time ( for example see Cohen and Soto ) Other studies show a positive link between increased life expectancy and economic growth. A survey of the existing literature on health and economic outcomes ( Bloom et al. ) finds in cross-country analysis that a one-year increase in life expectancy generates a percent increase in economic output controlling for other variables. Similarly Murphy and Topel ( ) find that progress made battling various diseases after added about $ trillion a year to national wealth Retrospective Analysis The prospective benefit-cost analysis that goes into crafting smart efficient regulations is necessarily fraught with uncertainty. Prospective analysis requires that the costs and benefits of a regulation be identified and quantified before ( ex-ante ) the regulation is implemented. Only after a | Chapter regulation has gone into effect can its actual ( ex-post ) effects become known ( see Data Watch ) Changes in technology often make pollution abatement cheaper. For example the actual costs to utilities of the cap-and-trade system for sulfur dioxide allowances set up by the Clean Air Act Amendments of were much lower than had been predicted. Scrubbing technologies turned out to be more efficient at removing sulfur dioxide from emissions and power plants were able to blend a higher percentage of cheaper low-sulfur coal than had initially been assumed. Moreover the benefits of reducing sulfur dioxide emissions have since been found to be much larger than originally thought. As a result subsequent regulations for utilities have tightened controls on those emissions Similarly during the 1970s automobile technologies were improved by new pollution standards. Regulators were phasing lead out of gasoline and again the costs of the regulation were overestimated and the benefits underestimated. Lead impairs brain development in children and has been linked to serious health problems in adults such as hypertension heart attacks and premature death ( Lovei ) Concern about high blood lead concentrations in the U.S. population led the EPA to begin in to phase in a stringent standard reducing the amount of lead allowed in the gasoline supply. Subsequent studies found that the annual benefits of banning lead in gasoline would be more than $ billion ( in dollars ) but would cost around $ million a year ( Schwartz ) Harrington Morgenstern and Nelson ( ) note that those costs may have been overstated but that it was difficult to disentangle the effects of a phase-out of leaded gasoline from the much larger effect of changes in oil markets around that time. Research also found that the benefits of lowering lead exposure were greater than initially thought. The EPA s benefit estimate implied that reducing mean blood lead concentrations in the population by microgram per deciliter ( or g/ dl ) was worth at least $ billion a year ( Schwartz ) By however researchers were finding that a reduction of g/dl in mean blood lead concentrations resulted in much greater benefits than earlier estimates as high as $ billion a year ( dollars ) ( Schwartz ) The phase-out of leaded gasoline was completed in ; by then the average blood lead concentration was approximately g/dl down from more than g/dl in the early 1970s ( Weaver ) Retrospective analyses of benefits and costs are also subject to uncertainty because they require evaluation of a counterfactual scenario in which the rule was not adopted. Identifying that counterfactual is often difficult in part because changes that occurred due to the rule are difficult to distinguish from changes that the industry would have adopted voluntarily Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation | Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment Data Watch : The Value of Information the PACE Survey One of the few data sources for benchmarking costs of air and water pollution controls is the Pollution Abatement Costs and Expenditures ( PACE ) survey which recently has been funded by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and administered by the Census Bureau. From to the PACE survey was administered annually to nearly manufacturing and mining facilities and electric utilities. Since because of resource constraints the Census Bureau has conducted this survey only twice ( for and ) To estimate the overall regulatory burden facing American manufacturers the PACE survey collects data on overall pollution abatement expenditures by manufacturers for treatment prevention recycling and disposal rather than trying to allocate costs to specific regulations. It is the only survey that measures environmental compliance costs at both the individual and aggregate levels ( Ross et al. ) Pollution equipment expenditures have fallen over time on average accounting for percent of all investments made by manufacturing industries in the early 1990s and percent in There is considerable variation in spending across industries but given that pollution levels ( and the negative externalities associated with pollution ) also vary by industry that is neither surprising nor necessarily suboptimal The EPA has used PACE data to estimate the cost of both past and proposed regulations ( see for example Gallaher Morgan and Shadbegian ) Academics have used the data set to investigate the relationship between EPA regulations and economic outcomes. For example Levinson ( ) used the PACE data to develop a new index of state environmental compliance costs. Similarly Shadbegian and Gray ( ) examined the relationship between of pollution abatement and productivity. And Becker ( ) found expenditures on environmental compliance for small facilities differ from larger facilities Look-Back Initiative President Obama s Executive Order issued in directed executive agencies to conduct retrospective reviews of their regulations to determine whether any of the agencies regulations should be modified streamlined expanded or repealed. This Executive order was followed by Executive Order which called on independent agencies to conduct such retrospective reviews to the extent possible. Look-back exercises enable regulatory agencies to learn whether they can increase net benefits by modifying existing regulations expanding regulations or even eliminating existing regulations that may turn out to be ineffective or duplicative | Chapter Incorporating ex-post benefits and costs of regulations is the key goal of the new Executive order requiring agencies to conduct retrospective reviews of their regulations. In the past agencies have undertaken such reviews in certain situations but only on an ad hoc basis. The new Executive order aims to improve regulatory analyses by providing a formalized process for incorporating new information into regulations and for gaining insight into the costs and benefits borne by the private sector in practice The President s regulatory look-back initiative has produced more than reform proposals detailed in agency plans and monetized savings from this review are likely to exceed $ billion over the next five years A number of recent actions eliminate or streamline unjustified or excessive regulations and the Administration has put in place an improved regulatory system that will generate more current and accurate information on regulatory costs and benefits. Moreover pursuant to Executive Order issued in July some of the major independent regulatory agencies have also issued preliminary retrospective review plans for public comment.2 Five examples illustrate the effectiveness of the look-back initiatives First the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) has announced a final rule that will eliminate redundant reporting burdens ; the regulation is expected to save employers million hours and $ million annually. OSHA also plans to finalize a rule projected to result in more than $ million in savings each year by making U.S. hazard classifications and labels consistent with other nations Second since the 1970s the EPA has treated milk as oil subject to regulations designed to prevent oil spills. In response to feedback from the agriculture community and the President s Executive order the EPA recently concluded that the rules placed unjustifiable burdens on dairy farmers and decided to exempt milk from those regulations. That exemption will save the dairy industry including many small businesses as much as $ million per year Third to reduce burdens on railroads the Department of Transportation has proposed to refine its requirements for tracks that are to be equipped with positive train controls. This equipment can automatically control a train in emergency circumstances reducing the risk of an accident The potential refinements would eliminate the need for costly wayside components and mitigation measures along as much as miles of track where they are not needed for safety. The initial 5-year savings are expected to be as high as $ million with total 20-year savings of up to $ million Specific retrospective analyses by executive and independent agencies can generally be found on the relevant websites ; for example the Federal Trade Commission provides information on its retrospective review process at http : //www.ftc.gov/ftc/regreview/index.shtml Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation | Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment Fourth the EPA has proposed to eliminate a requirement for air pollution vapor recovery systems at local gas stations in many states on the ground that modern vehicles already have effective air pollution control technologies. The anticipated annual savings from eliminating the requirement are estimated to be as high as $ million Fifth the Health and Human Services Department has proposed or finalized several rules that reduce regulatory burdens and restrictions on doctors and hospitals and that are expected to save more than $ billion over the next five years There are many other look-back efforts in all the initial round of retrospective proposals is expected to eliminate millions of hours of required paperwork for individuals businesses and State and local governments and to save billions of dollars Improvements in Everyday Life Every time Americans drive a car take a breath swim in a lake or take a medication they are benefiting from regulations. As noted such improvements in quality of life often show up in national accounts only as a fraction of their total benefit to society. For example although the growth and size of the pharmaceutical industry are reflected in GDP the value of assurances given to the U.S. public that the medicines they are taking have been tested and verified to be effective and safe goes far beyond the measured value of that sector to the national economy Similarly the Clean Water Act and its associated permitting requirements have reduced effluent discharge into U.S. streams lakes and estuaries. Putting a price tag on the benefits of being able to swim fish and boat in those bodies of water is difficult. Regardless of the value some of those benefits ( for example increasing expenditures on fishing equipment and recreation ) will show up in a calculation of GDP while many others ( such as reducing the level of fecal coliform in the water ) will not. The EPA estimates the benefits of reducing discharge of conventional pollutants to U.S. rivers and streams to be approximately $ billion annually ( Bingham et al. ) The EPA s Superfund program which identifies investigates and cleans the Nation s most contaminated hazardous waste sites has also improved public health. Since the Superfund program has prevented millions of people from being exposed to hazardous substances by requiring protective and containment measures and the removal from industrial sites of many millions of tons of material contaminated with toxic chemicals such as lead arsenic mercury and benzene ( EPA 2011c ) Studies have shown that Superfund cleanups have lowered the risk of acute poisoning improved infant health and decreased the risk of cancer ( Currie Greenstone and | Chapter Moretti ; and EPA 2011c ) Those improvements are generally not captured well in GDP for any given year Even though smart regulations can impose restrictions on the private sector as Figure illustrates the resulting benefits do not come at the cost of prosperity or sacrifices in U.S. standards of living. Over a period of decades air quality has improved while the economy has grown ; indeed the demand for clean air and water has risen along with income across countries ( see for example Grossman and Krueger ; and World Bank ) Even though those benefits do not show up directly in GDP measures they are consistent with increases in conventional ( albeit incomplete ) measures of growth. Per capita GDP has shown substantial growth between and rising by percent while at the same time per capita emissions of criteria pollutants ( lead carbon monoxide sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides particulate matter and ozone ) have declined by nearly percent. Similar achievements have been made in other areas as well. The number of fatalities on U.S. roads per million vehicle miles traveled ( VMT ) has declined by percent between and while VMT per capita increased by percent reflecting the effectiveness of road and vehicle safety regulations Innovation Innovation loosely defined as the introduction of a new or improved product service or process is the primary source of long-run increases in productivity and human welfare ( Grossman and Helpman ) When new ideas are integrated into the economy they offer new possibilities for both production and consumption. Innovation comes in two general forms : process and product innovation. Process innovations involve new or improved methods of production or distribution often as firms seek to reduce costs The cost savings are reflected in conventional accounting statistics as greater productivity. Over time rising productivity drives the growth in the amount of output that the economy can produce. By contrast product innovations introduce new or improved products or services into the marketplace. As noted consumers benefit from product innovations in ways that conventional accounting statistics do not adequately measure Although there is no perfect measure of the importance of innovation to an economy by many measures innovation has played an increasingly important role in the U.S. economy in recent decades. For example the industries classified by the OECD as knowledge- and technology-intensive have steadily increased as a share of the U.S. economy from percent of GDP in to percent in according to the National Science Foundation ( ; ) Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation | Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment Figure Economic Growth Vehicle Safety and Air Quality Percent change from Per capita real GDP Per capita VMT Per capita emissions of criteria pollutants Fatalities per million VMT Note : VMT is vehicle miles traveled. Criteria emissions are linearly interpolated from 5year interval data between and Source : National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ; Federal Highway Administration ; Environmental Protection Agency ; Bureau of Economic Analysis Private-sector competition is the primary driver of innovation. Firms in innovative industries must continually work to improve their products or increase their efficiency to avoid losing market share to competitors Businesses that successfully invest in innovations are rewarded in the marketplace. Incentives for businesses to invest in innovation are often less than optimal from the perspective of society as a whole however primarily because the innovator may not be able to capture all of the benefits generated by the innovation. The positive spillovers from innovation mean that the private returns from innovation will often be less than the social returns particularly when it comes to basic research. Private firms have limited incentive to conduct basic scientific research from which they generally can capture only a small fraction of the value that emerges from that research. As a result private markets may lead to underinvestment in basic science and limited diffusion of scientific advances Because private incentives to invest in innovation are often inadequate public-sector support for innovation has important benefits. Government can promote innovation in many ways. By operating a well-functioning system of intellectual property rights the government can help innovators earn returns commensurate with the social value of their innovations Government can increase investment in innovation through research and development ( R&D ) expenditures both by direct funding and by tax | Chapter incentives. It can facilitate the commercialization of innovations by removing barriers that prevent the private sector from transforming inventions into marketable products. It can provide infrastructure necessary for innovation for example by allocating spectrum to support the growth of wireless broadband itself an important platform for innovation in mobile devices applications and services. The government can also target innovation initiatives to areas of key public importance including education health care and energy. This section of the chapter discusses these issues and describes some of the Federal Government s current efforts to promote innovation in the U.S. economy Measuring Innovation Innovation s crucial role in economic growth and welfare has prompted efforts to improve the tools to measure it. One longstanding approach to measuring innovation is to infer that any economic growth not attributable to additional capital and labor must be due to some sort of technical change. This so-called Solow residual approach ( Solow ) however leaves unanswered many questions about the nature of the technical change Data on patenting activity can provide a useful if imperfect measure of innovation. Although many innovations are kept secret to preserve competitive advantage many others are made public through patent filings. The innovations for which patents are granted vary greatly in their significance however and a raw count of patents can not account for these differences Moreover increases in patent activity over time may be attributable at least in part to more aggressive patenting of marginal innovations rather than increases in innovation itself ( Hall and Ziedonis ) To address these limitations studies of innovation have often relied on measures of patent citations. For example the number of times a firm s patents are cited by other patent applications is more closely correlated with the firm s market value than is the raw number of patents it holds ( Hall et al. ) New measurement efforts have focused on the funds allocated to R&D within the economy. Historically R&D has been treated as an intermediate input to the production process and is therefore excluded from GDP estimates. Beginning in the GDP estimates produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) will include R&D under the category of investment increasing measured GDP. Spending on R&D is large and growing ; if the new definition had been in effect earlier current-dollar GDP in would have been on average percent higher and R&D would have accounted for percent of real GDP growth between and Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation | Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment In addition to help improve understanding of the role of R&D in fostering innovation the Census Bureau and the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) have introduced the Business R&D and Innovation Survey. This new survey combines firm-level data on R&D expenditures with measures of new or improved products or processes and patenting and licensing activity The first group of for-profit firms was surveyed in and some preliminary findings have been reported. For example the NSF reports that companies that invest in R&D exhibit far higher rates of innovation than other firms ( Boroush ) Measuring innovation is particularly challenging in the growing medical care sector. For example medical science has established that aspirin an old and inexpensive product can substantially reduce heart attack risk. Patients have seen enormous benefits from that scientific advancement but those benefits are not captured by estimates of GDP. The National Institute on Aging has sponsored research on the development of national health accounts that would gauge the population s health status and measure how medical care and other factors affect health Intellectual Property Rights and Patent Reform Innovation is spurred in part by the desire to reap rewards for developing new products and services that people will value. The central purpose of intellectual property ( IP ) rights which include patents trademarks and copyrights is to promote innovation by giving IP owners the right to exclude others from making use of their novel product or service. Well-designed IP rights enhance the private returns to innovation and bring them closer to the social returns thereby increasing the incentives to invest in socially valuable innovation. As President Lincoln famously said the patent system added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius ( Edwards ) The United States has long had a robust system of IP rights. In fact one of the powers explicitly given Congress in the Constitution is To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries. In recent years however many observers have raised concerns about the U.S. patent system. For example the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) describes concerns that the patent system has failed to keep up with the challenges posed by the growth of the knowledge-based economy Similarly the National Academy of Science ( NRC ) describes unease among academics and practitioners that the escalation in the number of patents possibly encouraged by a lowering of the threshold to their President Lincoln was himself an inventor. He was granted patent no. in for a flotation system for lifting riverboats stuck on sandbars | Chapter acquisition was creating thickets of rights that could impede innovation. Shapiro ( ) sees the core problem as being that in some circumstances the patent system predictably provides excessive rewards to patent holders. The opportunity for excessive returns can arise when patents are issued for technologies that are not genuinely novel or when a patent covers a small component of a complex product that allows the patent s owner to extract royalties disproportionate to the incremental value of the component. Some empirical evidence suggests that at least in certain industries greater patenting activity has in fact led to reduced R&D intensity ( Hunt and Bessen ) To address concerns about the performance of the patent system President Obama on September signed into law the America Invents Act the most significant reform of U.S. patent law since By allowing third parties to provide the patent office with additional information that may be helpful in assessing the novelty of an invention for which a patent application has been filed the new law will reduce the number of improperly issued patents and thus increase patent quality. The law will also reduce unnecessary litigation by creating new ways of resolving patent disputes more quickly and cheaply allowing inventors to invest with more confidence in the validity of their IP rights while reducing the drag on innovation caused by improperly granted patents. The law will also reduce wait times for patent applicants by giving the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office more resources to reduce the backlog of applications and by creating a fast-track option for time-sensitive patent applications such as those from fast-growing startups or entrepreneurs seeking venture capital. Last the new law will harmonize the American patent system with patent systems in the rest of the world by adopting a first inventor to file system. This change will make the U.S. system more efficient and predictable allowing innovative entrepreneurs to market their products more easily in the United States while simultaneously exporting them abroad Private and Public Investments in R&D R&D is a critical driver of innovation. Investments aimed at creating new knowledge or applying existing knowledge in new ways are often a necessary precursor to developing new or improved products or processes or entire new industries. Although innovative activities extend far beyond conventional R&D and innovations arise in industries that perform little R&D as such investing in R&D is generally an important element of innovative activity A large body of research confirms that investments in R&D increase productivity growth ( CBO ) Other research demonstrates that the social returns to R&D investment are generally substantially greater than Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation | Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment the private returns. For example Nordhaus ( ) concludes that only a minuscule fraction of the social returns from technological advances over the period was captured by producers indicating that most of the benefits of technological change are passed on to consumers. ( See also Hall Mairesse and Mohnen ; Bloom Schankerman and Van Reenen ; and Jones and Williams ) These findings support the conclusion that R&D investments often have important positive spillover effects that prevent private firms from fully capturing the benefits of their innovations thus giving them inadequate incentives to invest in R&D. In addition Hall ( ) finds evidence that capital market imperfections may lead to underinvestment in R&D even in the absence of these spillovers. In short economics research provides persuasive support for a robust government role in promoting R&D The United States is a world leader in R&D investments. With an estimated $ billion in public and private expenditures in the United States invested more in R&D than China Japan and Germany combined Moreover R&D spending as a share of the U.S. economy has been increasing in recent years with the ratio of R&D spending to GDP reaching nearly percent in the highest since the 1960s. During that interval however the composition of U.S. R&D spending shifted dramatically. During the 1950s and 1960s the majority of total R&D expenditures was federally funded ; today nonfederal sources predominate. Private industry investments have consistently accounted for about percent of all nonfederal R&D expenditures Despite the increasing role of private-sector investment in R&D public support for R&D remains critically important particularly in basic research which aims to expand scientific knowledge and thus does not generally have immediate commercial applications. Private firms can thus find it especially difficult to capture the benefits that stem from this research and the positive spillover effects of basic research can be especially large. For example NSF-funded basic research into the principle of nuclear magnetic resonance ultimately led to the development of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) machines a medical imaging technology that has significantly improved diagnosis for cancer and other conditions. Not surprisingly the Federal Government is a strong supporter of basic research. In while the Federal Government accounted for only percent of U.S. development expenditures and less than one-third of applied research expenditures it accounted for nearly percent of the Nation s basic research expenditures Overall the Federal Government provides substantial support for R&D. In when the Recovery Act helped Federal R&D spending reach percent of GDP the U.S. Government invested a greater share of GDP | Chapter in R&D than did the government of any other OECD country. Even in other years the U.S. Government s R&D investments relative to GDP have substantially exceeded the OECD average. Although this largely reflects U.S dominance in military R&D ( national defense has historically accounted for more than half of Federal R&D expenditures ) many defense-related innovations ultimately have significant benefits in the private sector. Research into communications networks by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for example ultimately led to the emergence of the Internet Recognizing the importance of R&D for innovation in April the President set the goal of devoting more than percent of GDP to R&D both public and private a share that surpasses the record of almost percent set in at the height of the space race. In its effort to reach this goal the Administration has supported large increases in Federal R&D funding. The Recovery Act s investment of $ billion in research funding was part of the largest annual increase in R&D funding in U.S. history. The President s Fiscal Year Budget has proposed additional support for science and basic research making progress toward the goal of doubling funding for three key basic research agencies the National Science Foundation the Office of Science in the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. A particular success story is the Small Business Innovation Research ( SBIR ) and Small Business Technology Transfer ( SBTT ) programs competitive programs that provide about $ billion annually to the most promising research projects at small firms. From to about one-fourth of the top innovations selected by R&D Magazine came from companies that had received an SBIR grant at some point in their history. Recognizing the importance of continuing these successes on December President Obama signed a bill reauthorizing the SBIR and SBTT programs for the next six years In addition to direct Federal funding for R&D the Administration has promoted incentives to support private R&D investment. The Research and Experimentation tax credit for example enacted in provides a tax credit based on qualified research expenses to encourage businesses to increase their investments. Subsidizing this activity through the tax system allows the private sector rather than the government to choose the research projects and the method for conducting the research. Recent studies show that the credit is a cost-effective way to encourage research spending ( U.S Treasury ) On September the President proposed to expand and simplify the credit and to make it permanent ; that proposal is also included in the President s FY Budget. The proposal will further enhance private firms incentives to invest in research and will provide Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation | Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment businesses with assurance that the credit will be available for the duration of long-term research projects Commercialization An important stage in the process of innovation is commercialization of new technologies. New inventions and new knowledge alone will have little effect on economic welfare unless they are converted into marketable products or processes that change how firms do business. One obstacle to realizing the economic benefits of innovation is the difficulty in transferring new ideas from universities and Federal laboratories to the marketplace. For example recent empirical studies point to substantial frictions attributable to licensing costs and show large gains in innovation when these frictions are reduced ( Williams ) Other researchers have found that universities often adopt technology transfer policies that constrain the volume of innovations brought into the marketplace ( Litan Mitchell and Reddy ) As the President announced in January one of the goals of the Administration s Startup America campaign is to foster innovation by increasing the rate of technology transfer. Since then the Administration has announced a number of initiatives in support of this goal. In October the President issued a Presidential Memorandum directing the heads of Executive departments and agencies to take action to accelerate technology transfer and commercialization of Federal research in support of high-growth businesses. The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences at the National Institutes of Health assists biomedical entrepreneurs by identifying barriers to commercialization and speeding development of new drugs and diagnostics. The Administration s National Bioeconomy Blueprint lays out a number of steps designed to advance biological research innovations including reforms to speed commercialization and open new markets. The NSF s Innovation Corps program is a public-private partnership that will connect NSF-funded researchers with private-sector mentors who will help to transform the results of scientific research into commercially successful technologies. The Department of Energy ( DOE ) launched a program called America s Next Top Energy Innovator which offers startup companies low-cost and streamlined procedures for licensing new energy technologies patented by DOE labs. Together the Administration s lab-to-market initiatives will encourage universities and government research centers to streamline their technology transfer procedures support additional government-industry collaboration and encourage the commercialization of novel technologies flowing from research programs in short they will facilitate the commercialization phase of the process of innovation | Chapter Wireless Broadband and Spectrum Policy Information and communication technology ( ICT ) is vitally important to the U.S. economy. A large body of research has linked economic growth in recent decades with ICT expansion. For example Roller and Waverman ( ) estimate that one-third of the growth in per capita GDP in developed economies from to is attributable to investments in telecommunications infrastructure. Similarly Bloom Sadun and van Reenen ( ) note that the great majority of growth in U.S. productivity since the mid-1990s has been in sectors that either intensively use or produce information technologies.4 Wireless broadband is a form of ICT that can transform many different areas of the American economy by providing a platform for innovation in areas ranging from media-rich consumer products to health care and education technologies. Much of the investment necessary to realize the potential of wireless broadband will come from the private sector. According to the Census Bureau total capital spending by wireless telecommunications carriers has exceeded $ billion in each year since ( U.S. Census Bureau ) Public support is necessary in some important areas including developing a nationwide wireless broadband network for public safety and extending wireless broadband services into rural communities both of which are discussed in this chapter in the section on infrastructure. Another important way that the government can help to support the growth of wireless broadband is by making more spectrum available both for licensed and unlicensed use. With the proliferation of smartphones tablets and other mobile devices with Internet access mobile data traffic has been growing tremendously more than doubling between and and industry forecasters expect data traffic to continue to grow rapidly ( Cisco ) To accommodate this surging demand wireless carriers will need access to additional spectrum In early President Obama introduced his National Wireless Initiative. The proposal aims to nearly double the spectrum available for wireless broadband in the next years by freeing up megahertz ( MHz ) of spectrum currently allocated to other uses. Some of this spectrum will be shifted away from Federal Government uses in part by finding ways to make more efficient use of the remaining Federal and shared spectrum. Any changes in the use of Federal spectrum will be designed to ensure that there is no harmful interference with public safety needs or other critical public uses of the spectrum. Doubling the spectrum for wireless broadband will Jorgenson et al. ( ) estimate that ICT accounted for percent of productivity growth during and percent during Most recently Brynjolfsson and Saunders ( ) conclude that most U.S. productivity growth since can be attributed to ICT Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation | Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment also require changes in commercially licensed spectrum. Shifting to wireless broadband a portion of the spectrum now licensed for over-the-air television broadcasting will yield substantial economic benefits. To ensure that commercially held spectrum is reallocated efficiently and that the economic benefits are widely shared the Administration supports using voluntary incentive auctions to guide the reallocation. These auctions will allow existing licensees to receive a portion of the auction proceeds in exchange for voluntarily making their spectrum available for wireless broadband The auctions will also generate substantial revenues for the U.S. Treasury providing support for important goals including deficit reduction R&D for emerging wireless technologies and a nationwide interoperable wireless broadband network for public safety Clean & Secure Energy In his State of the Union address President Obama noted that This country needs an all-out all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy. A strategy that s cleaner cheaper and full of new jobs. The President has outlined goals that will set the United States on a path toward lowering its dependence on oil and developing cleaner domestic energy sources that reduce emissions of air pollutants. Those include goals to continue focusing on increasing responsible domestic oil and gas production to reduce foreign oil imports by a third by and to increase the share of electricity generated from clean energy sources including nuclear power natural gas clean coal and renewables like wind and solar to percent by The President has outlined a Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future to guide the Nation s transition to a clean and secure energy economy. While the market provides key signals that greatly influence energy production and consumption decisions energy markets are subject to market failures so the government has an important role to play in guiding the mix of energy supplies and uses that is best for the Nation. The government also has a role to play in increasing energy security reducing air pollution promoting clean energy through investments in innovation and infrastructure and establishing rules of the road that promote a cleaner and more secure energy future Enhancing Energy Security The short-run demand for energy is relatively inelastic so consumers will bear the brunt of sudden unexpected energy supply disruptions in the form of price increases causing them to reduce their consumption of other goods and services or reduce savings. Elevated global energy prices can | Chapter in turn slow economic growth. Promoting the development of alternative energies and energy-efficient technologies reduces the economy s vulnerability to international energy supply shocks and improves energy security Oil consumption per thousand dollars of real GDP has fallen by about half since ( from almost one barrel per thousand dollars of GDP in to about barrel per thousand dollars of GDP in ) Despite progress in reducing the petroleum intensity of the economy vulnerability to increases in the global market price of crude oil remains. We can improve energy security by lowering demand for petroleum and by increasing the supply of domestic conventional and alternative energy Reducing Demand During the past year the Administration has pursued a course that reduces demand for petroleum. In November EPA and DOT proposed new fuel economy standards for vehicle model years building on the successful programs for the and model years. These standards will save consumers money at the pump dramatically reduce the Nation s dependence on oil and increase investment in new technologies and new manufacturing here in the United States. Under the proposed rules fuel economy standards from the DOT greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emission standards from the EPA and State of California regulations will be harmonized and auto companies will be able to rely on well-defined regulatory targets to help steer their investments in producing advanced vehicles Annualized costs of the rule are expected to be between $ billion and $ billion ; annualized fuel savings are expected to range between $ billion and $ billion ( dollars ) Additional annualized benefits from improved health greater energy security and lower GHG emissions are expected to range between $ billion and $ billion. Taken together the fuel economy standards proposed for model years are projected to reduce oil consumption by over million barrels per day by and save consumers $ trillion in fuel costs The President has also proposed a new tax incentive to offset half of the incremental cost of dedicated alternative-fuel commercial vehicles such as natural gas and electric trucks for a five-year period. In addition the President has proposed transforming the individual tax credit for consumers who purchase advanced vehicles into a rebate Increasing Domestic Energy Supplies The Nation has pursued strategies to safely increase domestic energy sources. As part of this focus the President is committed to advancing the responsible production of domestic oil and natural gas resources. Thanks Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation | Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment to higher domestic production and lower imports dependence on foreign oil is being reduced. In for the first time in over a decade the United States relied on net imports for less than half of the oil we consumed ; in import dependence declined even further to percent. Since the United States has been the leading natural gas producer in the world To help ensure safe and responsible development of abundant natural gas resources the Administration is taking a number of steps including : exploring home grown technologies and methods to improve safety and environmental performance of shale gas production ; encouraging greater use of natural gas in transportation ; and requiring disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing on public lands. As Box describes the development of unconventional oil and gas deposits across the United States illustrates how American enterprise and innovation in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing combined with government-supported research have unlocked vast new domestic oil and gas resources The United States has also increased the amount of ethanol and biodiesel blended into the nation s fuel supply. In ethanol and biodiesel production in the United States were estimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) to be roughly billion gallons and million gallons respectively ( EIA ) That represented about percent of U.S. gasoline demand and percent of diesel demand for In March the President set the goal of breaking ground on at least four commercial-scale cellulosic or advanced bio-refineries over the next two years and we are on track to exceed that goal. In addition the Administration announced a partnership between the Departments of Agriculture Energy and the Navy to invest in multiple domestic commercial or pre-commercial scale bio-refineries to produce advanced drop-in biofuels substitutes for diesel and jet fuel Reducing Emissions The Administration has taken historic steps to address air pollution from stationary sources such as aging coal-fired power plants. The Mercury and Air Toxics Standard ( MATS ) regulation announced by the EPA in December for example will reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide mercury and other toxic air pollution and generate between $ billion and $ billion in net benefits annually by improving people s health In addition to create a market for innovative technologies that will encourage the deployment of clean energy and the benefits that come with it such as reduced emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases the President has proposed a Clean Energy Standard ( CES ) | Chapter A CES works by giving electric power plants clean energy credits for electricity they generate from clean energy. Utilities that serve retail customers are responsible for making sure they have enough clean energy credits to meet their target. Utilities that generate more clean energy than needed to meet their target can bank their extra credits for later use or sell them to other companies. Under the President s proposal the target would increase over time so that by percent of the country s electricity would be generated from clean sources. This flexible approach would harness privatesector incentives to minimize the cost of generating electricity from clean energy sources Because of cleaner power plants greater use of alternative fuels and more energy-efficient vehicles buildings and appliances EIA ( ) expects per capita emissions of carbon dioxide in the United States to fall over time by an average of percent a year between and Supporting Clean Energy R&D and Infrastructure Public investments in innovation and infrastructure are critical to solving the twin objectives of increasing energy security and reducing GHG emissions. Private-sector investment in energy R&D and infrastructure will be less than optimal because the positive externalities from such investments prevent private firms from fully capturing the benefits. Support for innovation is a key piece of the Blueprint strategy which involves creating markets for clean technologies that are ready to deploy and funding cutting-edge research to deliver the next generation of technologies. In addition investments in modernizing the energy infrastructure with advanced technologies will help to increase efficiency and reduce waste. Innovation and adoption of new technologies will be critical to improving energy efficiency and shifting the Nation s energy use toward low-carbon energy generation Among the DOE offices that provide support for clean energy innovation is the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy ( ARPA-E ) an organization modeled after the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ARPA-E provides funds to develop advanced energy technologies that reduce energy-related emissions and increase energy efficiency focusing on transformational energy research that the private sector by itself is unlikely to support. The Obama Administration funded ARPA-E for the first time with $ million as part of the Recovery Act. This funding along with subsequent appropriations has been used to support about projects including technologies for plug-in electric vehicles batteries that convert wind power into a steady power source and microorganisms that produce liquid biofuels from sunlight and carbon dioxide. The President s Fiscal Year Budget proposes $ million in new funding for ARPA-E to continue Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation | Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment Box : Developing Domestic Energy : Shale Gas and Shale Oil Shale gas and shale oil ( also known as tight oil ) are deposits trapped inside formations of fine-grained sedimentary rocks or shale. As recently as a decade ago many of these deposits were viewed as uneconomical to extract. Now they are being profitably extracted leading to a boom in production from these unconventional oil and gas deposits The President has been clear about the importance of domestic oil and gas production including the central role responsible natural gas development will play in our energy future increasing energy independence and supporting jobs The percent of new wells directed to shale gas and oil deposits surged from percent in to percent in That dramatic increase is in large part due to rising energy prices in the early 2000s which made it profitable for oil and gas companies to pursue higher cost reserves. But it is also due in part to R&D investments made by the Department of Energy ( DOE ) Between and the DOE invested about $ million in the Eastern Gas Shale program which helped develop and demonstrate directional and horizontal drilling technology Horizontal drilling allows multiple wells to be completed from one drilling pad by drilling vertically for several thousand feet and then drilling horizontally. Hydraulic fracturing pumps water chemicals and sand into the well to fracture the surrounding rock releasing trapped natural gas and oil allowing more gas and oil to be captured ( see figure ) From through the average annual growth rate of shale gas production was percent. By shale gas is expected to make up percent of total U.S. natural gas production up from percent in ( EIA ) Increased supply has caused wholesale natural gas prices to fall more than percent from their peak in October through October This led to a percent drop in prices charged for natural gas used to generate electricity and a percent decline in residential natural gas prices Domestic oil production also grew in and in part due to horizontal drilling methods. That growth helped improve America s energy security. We reduced our imports of crude oil from million barrels per day in to an estimated million barrels per day in EIA ( ) projects that domestic oil production will continue to increase through We are also exporting more refined petroleum products than ever : between the first half of and the first half of exports of mineral fuels and oils jumped percent an increase valued at more than $ billion ( see Chapter ) In addition the United States is at the forefront of exporting extraction technologies and related services to other countries interested in tapping their own unconventional oil and gas reserves | Chapter This expansion of natural gas and oil production has also supported jobs for thousands of Americans. Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) data show that oil and gas extraction and drilling services jobs have grown by between and with much of that increase tied to horizontal drilling for shale gas and oil. The industry also indirectly supports many more jobs including jobs associated with the transportation processing and distribution of oil and natural gas products. Furthermore downstream industries such as the chemical and plastics sectors that use natural gas as an important input benefit from the expanded supply of natural gas Such tremendous growth also comes with the responsibility to develop these new resources safely. A number of concerns have been raised regarding the potential adverse environmental impacts associated with current shale gas extraction practices particularly the use of hydraulic fracturing. The Obama Administration is taking a number of steps to ensure that the United States can realize the economic benefits of its natural gas resources in a an environmentally responsible way. An important part of this effort consists of targeted research coordinated between the DOE the Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency to assess and address potential impacts of natural gas and oil development using hydraulic fracturing and to identify innovative ways to reduce adverse environmental impacts. For example the DOE is actively involved in research exploring improved methods to treat the water used in shale gas extraction so it can be reused or disposed of safely. The Administration is committed to ensuring that natural gas and oil extraction will be pursued in a prudent manner that is safe for the environment Horizontal Well ( A ) vs. Vertical Well ( B ) Source : EIA ( ) Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation | Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment to support breakthrough clean energy research in areas such as solar energy energy storage carbon capture and storage and advanced biofuels An important part of the effort to transition to a clean energy future is the SunShot Initiative announced by the DOE in February This initiative supports innovation to reduce the cost of solar energy by percent by making unsubsidized solar energy cost-competitive with other forms of energy. Achieving the goal will require major innovations in the ways solar technologies are conceived designed manufactured and installed SunShot is investing in solar technology and manufacturing improvements and working to reduce installation and permitting costs. According to DOE ( ) analysis by reducing the cost of solar electricity to about six cents per kilowatt hour SunShot has the potential to increase the share of electricity generation from solar photovoltaics to percent by As the United States transitions to a clean energy future an important way to improve energy efficiency reliability and security is to upgrade the electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure to make greater use of advanced technology and to incorporate real-time communications monitoring and control systems. Transforming the electricity infrastructure into a smart grid could lead to substantial cost savings and efficiencies help avoid blackouts and improve the integration of renewable energy sources on the grid. The Recovery Act included $ billion in grid modernization investments matched by contributions of more than $ billion from the private sector. Building on these investments the Administration announced a number of new initiatives to support the development and deployment of smart-grid technologies including $ million in loans to deploy smart-grid technology in rural areas under the Rural Utility Service In June the White House released a report by the National Science and Technology Council A Policy Framework for the 21st Century Grid : Enabling Our Secure Energy Future outlining policy recommendations that build on existing smart-grid investments to foster continued modernization of electricity infrastructure In addition to efforts to support smart grid development the Administration has announced efforts to improve Federal coordination and ensure timely review of proposed renewable energy projects and transmission lines through the formation of two interagency Rapid Response Teams one for transmission and one for renewables. The Rapid Response Team for Transmission is focused on seven pilot project transmission lines which cross through states. These projects were selected from lists produced through independent stakeholder processes. When built these seven pilot projects will help increase electric reliability and integrate renewable energy into the grid. The agencies participating in the Renewable Energy Rapid | Chapter Response Team have all made significant strides toward the deployment of renewable energy through the development of better government processes to issue permits for renewable energy projects Infrastructure As emphasized energy infrastructure is critical for developing our domestic clean energy potential. Infrastructure also includes transportation systems like roads railways ports and airports ; information and communications networks ; and schools parks and other public facilities. As economic activity grows the infrastructure that supports it must grow as well. Moreover physical infrastructure deteriorates over time and requires ongoing investment for maintenance. If investments to maintain upgrade and expand infrastructure do not keep pace with the growth in demand the result is congestion : too many hours sitting in traffic or in an airplane stalled on the tarmac too many dropped calls slow Internet connections. Such disruptions impose substantial economic costs through wasted time and resources and diminished quality of life. As a result efficient infrastructure investments can have a significant positive impact on economic welfare The State of the Nation s Infrastructure The value of the U.S. transportation capital stock steadily increased from to reaching more than $ trillion in ( the most recently reported year ) The greatest percentage increase in mileage for any mode of transportation from to was in light transit rail track which increased by percent followed by commuter rail track which increased by percent. At the same time the overall condition of many parts of the Nation s transportation infrastructure remained disappointing. In nearly percent of urban interstate highways and percent of urban collector roads were in poor or mediocre condition according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Moreover in nearly bridges more than percent of all U.S. bridges were rated as structurally deficient The current disappointing state of transportation infrastructure is partly reflected in rising levels of congestion on many parts of the transportation system particularly urban roadways. According to the Texas Traffic Institute s ( TTI ) Urban Mobility Report traffic congestion in urban areas in accounted for billion hours of travel delay and billion gallons of wasted fuel for an aggregate congestion cost of more than $ billion an increase of more than percent over in constant ( inflation-adjusted ) dollars ( Schrank Lomax and Eisele ) If current trends continue TTI projects that the total cost of congestion in U.S. urban areas could grow by Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation | Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment a further percent in real terms by These estimates likely understate the real effects of congestion on welfare because they do not take into account the reduction in quality of life that results from additional time spent commuting. Studies of how individuals experience the activities of daily life have found that commuting is among the least enjoyable and most stressful ( Kahneman et al. Stutzer and Frey ) The U.S. electricity grid is also showing signs of strain with investment in capacity generally lagging behind growth in demand. According to the DOE ( ) growth in peak demand for electricity has exceeded transmission growth by almost percent every year since Power outages and interruptions have become more frequent and are now affecting more consumers. The DOE reported that percent more outages affected or more consumers in the second half of the 1990s than in the first half and the average outage affected percent more consumers. By power outages and interruptions cost Americans an estimated $ billion each year Broadband is another important category of infrastructure where the United States faces significant investment needs. Described by the Federal Communications Commission as the great infrastructure challenge of the early 21st century ( FCC ) broadband s growth over the past decade has been substantial. Thanks to significant investments by telecommunications and cable companies percent of the U.S. population had access to wired broadband service in and industry analysts project that by wireless providers will offer such service to about percent of the population ( Atkinson et al. ) At the same time many households particularly in rural areas continue to have Internet access only at much slower speeds. As discussed perhaps the most significant challenge to the Nation s broadband infrastructure is the threat of growing congestion on wireless networks Overall evidence is growing that the United States has been underinvesting in many kinds of infrastructure. For example the Nation invests annually approximately percent of GDP on infrastructure compared with percent and percent respectively for China and Europe. In addition compared with other OECD countries Americans are relatively dissatisfied with their local public infrastructure systems according to the Gallup World Poll. Americans satisfaction with public transit ranks 25th out of OECD nations and satisfaction with roads and highways ranks 17th out of Many observers including the American Society of Civil Engineers ( ) have concluded that the United States faces a substantial need for infrastructure investment over the next five years. Although the optimal level of infrastructure investment is difficult to quantify precisely the evidence strongly suggests that the United States has not been investing adequately to meet future infrastructure needs | Chapter Government and Private Sector Roles in Infrastructure In the United States some kinds of infrastructure including most roadways and public transit systems are typically owned and financed by government ; other kinds such as freight railways and telecommunications networks are largely privately owned. In part these patterns of ownership reflect historical accident. In choosing how much public support for infrastructure to provide and how to finance it the United States like other nations faces questions about how best to balance the roles of the public and private sectors in infrastructure investment. Two key economic principles are whether it is costly or difficult for a private owner or investor to earn a return by monetizing access to the network through tolls or user fees and whether important positive spillover benefits from infrastructure investment would prevent private investors from fully capturing the overall economic benefit even if there were a dedicated revenue stream from users The most important potential positive spillover effect is that many infrastructure investments improve economic efficiency increase productivity and promote rapid economic growth. Through these effects as a large body of research has shown investments in infrastructure can substantially improve the long-run performance of an economy. For example Munnell ( ) reviews the evidence on infrastructure investment and economic growth and concludes that in addition to providing immediate economic stimulus public infrastructure investment has a significant positive effect on output and growth. Gramlich s ( ) review of the same research cautions that the rates of return on investments vary widely across different types of infrastructure and highlights the need for policies that direct public investment toward projects with the highest social return. More recent studies have found further evidence that public infrastructure investment often offers considerable returns in some cases higher than those from private capital investment. This research is reviewed in a U.S. Treasury-CEA report ( ) In addition to their long-run benefits on economic growth and productivity investments in infrastructure can also provide short-run benefits during times when economic resources are underutilized by supporting employment in construction and in materials production. These short-run effects depend on the state of the overall economy. When the economy is operating at or close to its full potential the new employment generated by infrastructure projects generally requires diverting workers from other productive activities and the expenditure of public funds may similarly divert funds from other investment opportunities. Certain infrastructure investments may still be justified during such times but the opportunity costs of Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation | Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment diverting economic resources from other activities reduce the net benefits of such investments By contrast today the economy is gradually recovering from the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression and is operating significantly below its full potential with unemployment still unacceptably high In over million workers in the construction industry were jobless with an industry unemployment rate of percent. In these circumstances public infrastructure projects create net jobs for workers. With excess capacity widely available in the economy increased public spending on construction materials and increased private spending by newly hired workers are unlikely to divert goods or materials from other uses. Similarly with interest rates exceptionally low there is little risk that Federal investment will crowd out private investment and more infrastructure investments will yield a positive rate of return. Moreover State and local governments which typically fund a significant portion of infrastructure spending have been forced to cut back on spending because of revenue shortfalls since the recession of Recent macroeconomic research confirms the intuition that the expansionary effect of Federal investment spending is likely to be significantly greater during times of substantial slack in the economy. For example Auerbach and Gorodnichenko ( ) find that expansionary fiscal policy is substantially more effective during recessions than during expansions Overall with so many resources sitting idle the opportunity costs of using those resources for infrastructure investment are greatly reduced. Moreover postponing necessary infrastructure investments until after the economy has rebounded would have the undesirable effect of occupying productive resources just when the private sector needs them most Financing Infrastructure Investments Government funding for infrastructure draws on a number of different sources including Federal disbursements of Highway Trust Fund revenues and State and local issues of municipal bonds. Recent years have seen increased interest in alternative financing mechanisms that may expand the pool of available capital and improve the efficiency of project selection A common theme in these alternative approaches is the goal of attracting more private capital for direct or indirect investment in transportation infrastructure. Increased reliance on the private sector to finance transportation infrastructure investments can help increase funding for those investments and may also improve the efficiency of project selection and drive greater returns on investment. For example to attract private financing many projects incorporate a dedicated revenue stream often from user fees or other forms of usage-based pricing. Because these revenue streams | Chapter link investment returns directly to user demand they can help to guide capital toward the most efficient projects. In general innovative financing mechanisms can engage the private sector in infrastructure investments with important public benefits. In particular this chapter considers three innovative approaches to private-sector engagement : public-private partnerships particularly in the area of rail freight ; Build America Bonds ( BABs ) as an alternative to municipal bonds that can attract new sources of private funding into the market for financing infrastructure projects ; and a National Infrastructure Bank that has the potential to leverage private capital into projects of national significance Public-Private Partnerships. In the United States most investment in freight railway infrastructure is privately financed because it is largely owned by the rail carriers themselves. However even in a network based on private ownership important public benefits can be realized through investments that improve the flow of freight across the railway network The benefits of diverting freight efficiently from trucks to rails for example include reduced highway congestion greater safety and reduced pollution. Public-private partnerships between State and Federal agencies and the rail carriers can be an efficient way to promote such investments. For example the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency program is a public-private partnership between the U.S. Department of Transportation the State of Illinois the City of Chicago Metra commuter rail and Class I railroad companies. The partnership formed to develop and implement a set of multimodal infrastructure improvements to untangle congestion choke points in the Chicago transportation hub involves significant financial cooperation between the private railroad industry and public government entities Build America Bonds. Introduced in BABs are taxable bonds for which the U.S. Treasury Department pays a direct subsidy to the issuer to offset borrowing costs for public capital infrastructure projects. These bonds can function as an attractive alternative to municipal bonds which deliver a borrowing subsidy only indirectly through the Federal tax exemption to investors for interest earnings. BABs appeal to a broader class of investors than tax-exempt municipal bonds including nonprofits pension funds and many other institutional investors. Since the inception of the program in April BABs have had a very strong reception from both issuers and investors. They have supported more than $ billion of financing in transactions in all states the District of Columbia and two territories for new public capital infrastructure projects such as schools bridges and hospitals. An empirical study by the Treasury Department ( ) found that State and local governments that issued BABs realized considerable savings Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation | Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment relative to the cost of issuing tax-exempt bonds. The study also found that expanding the BABs program would lead to continued savings on borrowing costs for State and local governments. Although the initial program expired at the end of December the President s Fiscal Year Budget has proposed extending the program for two years at a subsidy rate of percent and extending it permanently thereafter at a revenue-neutral subsidy rate of percent. The Administration has also proposed expanding the program to include a broader range of eligible municipal projects National Infrastructure Bank. Another new approach to increasing private-sector participation in infrastructure investment is a National Infrastructure Bank as President Obama has proposed as part of the American Jobs Act. The proposed bank would help increase overall investment in infrastructure by attracting private capital to co-invest in specific infrastructure projects and would help improve the efficiency of infrastructure investment by relying on a merit-based selection process for projects To ensure substantial leverage of private capital the bank would finance no more than percent of the total costs of any project. It would fill in an important gap in the Nation s infrastructure funding system by focusing on projects of national or regional significance whose effects cross over state and jurisdictional lines. Such projects are often at a disadvantage under current financing mechanisms including state-level infrastructure banks and bonds issued by State and local governments. As a result the National Infrastructure Bank would be a valuable complement to existing sources of funding and would improve the efficiency of U.S. infrastructure investment Recent and Current Federal Infrastructure Initiatives Infrastructure investment has been an important priority throughout the Obama Administration. As discussed above the modernization of the electricity grid is a key element of the effort to transition to a clean energy future. This subsection reviews some of the Administration s other recent and current initiatives to support infrastructure investment Transportation. The Recovery Act of provided over $ billion to fund transportation infrastructure investments. In the Federal Highway Administration announced that it had finished obligating more than $ billion of that amount for road highway and bridge projects and in June President Obama visited Columbus Ohio to commemorate the breaking of ground on the 10,000th such project. The Recovery Act also provided funds for investments in the Nation s air and sea transportation infrastructure including $ billion to construct new runways and improve air traffic control facilities and equipment as well as more than $ billion to support transit and high-speed rail. Many of these | Chapter and other recently completed transportation infrastructure investments have already produced substantial economic benefits for the American people including increased flows of traffic in congested areas improved highway safety expansion of public transit service into new communities and rehabilitation and maintenance of aging infrastructure Despite these substantial achievements there is still a pressing need to revitalize America s infrastructure networks. Recognizing this need President Obama has proposed $ billion in immediate investments in transportation infrastructure as part of the American Jobs Act. The proposal includes investments to speed up the permitting process to make highways safer and more efficient to repair and modernize public transit systems to improve intercity passenger rail service and airports to develop high-speed rail corridors to support innovative multi-modal transportation programs and to modernize the air traffic system by investing in the Next Generation Air Transportation System or NextGen. The President also supports a robust renewal of surface transportation programs now scheduled to expire on March to keep existing and planned transportation projects moving forward Broadband. The Recovery Act provided $ billion to upgrade the Nation s broadband infrastructure including $ billion for broadband infrastructure programs at the Department of Commerce s National Telecommunications and Information Administration ( NTIA ) and $ billion for the Department of Agriculture s Rural Utilities Service ( RUS ) to expand broadband access in rural areas. These two programs together received more than applications requesting more than $ billion in support for potential projects in all states and territories. When the final awards were announced in September NTIA had awarded approximately $ billion for projects throughout the country. The funds will support the construction or upgrade of approximately miles of broadband infrastructure and will improve broadband access for approximately community institutions including schools libraries and health care facilities. In addition RUS has awarded more than $ billion in grants and loans for broadband projects which will provide broadband access for million households and businesses in rural areas As part of the National Wireless Initiative the President has called for investment in a state-of-the-art nationwide wireless broadband network for public safety communications. Developing and deploying such a system would help enable interoperability at the national level making first responders more effective when they are called on to cross jurisdictional lines. An interoperable network would also reduce the costs of the assorted interoperability measures now being used ranging from swapping radios to Improving the Quality of Life through Smart Regulation | Innovation Clean Energy and Public Investment using Internet-based gateways to patch together noninteroperable systems Moreover deploying a single nationwide network would realize important scale economies eliminating duplicative operating and maintenance costs and enabling public safety entities to obtain commercially supplied devices and equipment at substantially lower cost than they can today. Finally with clear nationwide standards that help make public safety communication systems interoperable across jurisdictions and vendors software and hardware developers will find it more economical to invest in innovative public safety devices and applications further enhancing the effectiveness of first responders Conclusion Through smart regulation innovation promotion of clean domestic energy and public investment the Federal Government helps Americans every day improving safety and health laying the groundwork for technological breakthroughs and putting into place the infrastructure that facilitates commerce and travel and raises productivity. The benefits of these activities are not fully reflected in standard measures of economic activity such as GDP but they do significantly improve the quality of life and our economy Jan Tinbergen ( ) the first winner of the Nobel Prize in economics commented that progress in our understanding can only be based on our push for measurement of phenomena previously thought to be nonmeasurable. Spurred by the creation of new measurement techniques and the need to improve conventional measures of well-being several recent official efforts have aimed at expanding the boundaries of measurement of the quality of life. As this year s Economic Report of the President suggests further innovation and advances in measurement through improvements to traditional economic indicators and the development of new indicators of societal well-being will help bring about further improvements in the Nation s quality of life and the economy | Chapter REFERENCES Chapter To Recover Rebalance and Rebuild Choi Hyunyoung and Hal R.
