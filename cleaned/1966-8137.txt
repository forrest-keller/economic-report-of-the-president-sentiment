MAJOR LEGISLATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS OF ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE IN APPENDIX B. REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS DURING APPENDIX C. STATISTICAL TABLES RELATING TO INCOME EMPLOYMENT AND PRODUCTION IV ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT To the Congress of the United States : A year ago I reported that we were " in the midst of the greatest upsurge of economic well-being in the history of any nation. " That upsurge now about to enter its sixth year continues without let-up The value of our Nation 's annual output of goods and services rose more than one-third from to Last year alone our gross national product ( GNP ) made a record advance of $ billion This swelling production has generated an unprecedented rise in the incomes of the American people. Total personal income in December was at an annual rate of $ billion up percent in the past years and 7/ percent in the latest months In the past years the number of Americans at work increased by nearly million ; in alone by about 2/2 million. The rate of unemployment dropped from percent in December ( and a high of percent in May ) to percent in December And American jobs are better than ever before. The weekly take-home pay of the average manufacturing worker with three dependents has risen percent in the past years. In the last months alone his gain was percent The profits of our corporations after taxes last year were percent ahead of their earnings years earlier up percent over And average farm income last year rose percent breaking all records Our Nation 's industries shops and farms our workers owners of businesses professional men and women prosper today far beyond the dreams of any people anytime anywhere NEW ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT In the light of these unprecedented and continuing gains some observers are posing questions not heard in almost a decade Will there be enough plant capacity to produce all the goods and services buyers will seek ? Can our employers find the labor they will require to man their production lines ? Can we avoid bottlenecks in major industries or key skills that would hamper our expansion ? Can we keep a destructive price-wage spiral from getting underway ? Can we move ahead with the Great Society programs and at the same time meet our needs for defense ? My confident answer to each of these questions is YES But the fact these questions are seriously asked and require serious answers is proof enough that we are in a new economic environment We are approaching full use of our resources and this brings new problems To those who fear these new problems I say this : These are the problems we have been waiting to encounter for nearly years These problems are the price of our success These are the welcome problems of prosperity Over the past years we have faced very different economic problems In meeting these problems we have learned that recessions are not inevitable ; high production does not necessarily mean overproduction ; expansion need not generate inflation or imbalances that make further expansion unsustainable ; affluence has not sapped the inherent strength and dynamism of the American economy ; automation need not create mass unemployment ; millions who were unemployed are not unemployable ; prudently expansionary fiscal policies can restore high employment ; and domestic expansion can go hand in hand with strengthened external payments and a sound dollar We have learned how to achieve prosperity. Now we must sustain it deal with its problems and make the most of the opportunities it presents VIETNAM AND OUR ECONOMY We face the challenges of prosperity while some of our fellow citizens and billions of dollars of our resources are engaged in a bitter defense of freedom in Vietnam. The true costs of this conflict are death pain and grief ; interrupted careers and separation from loved ones. They are incalculable. But the economic cost of Vietnam imposes no unbearable burden on our resources Vietnam does however add to the usual problems of maintaining balanced prosperity. It imposes special burdens on some industries and raises as well uncertainties both for the fiscal planning of Government and the private planning of business. These uncertainties underscore the need for flexibility in Government policies and responsibility in private decisions Production for Vietnam accounts for less than * /> percent of our GNP These expenditures are a part of the total demand that provides a full market for our manpower and our production. But the private demands of consumers and businesses and high-priority civilian programs of Government could and would provide a far more welcome market for that output if there were no war in Vietnam. Our prosperity does not depend on our military effort THE PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMIC POLICY In a time of high prosperity economic policy faces new problems. But it is still guided by the basic principles that have served us so well Twenty years ago next month the Employment Act of which prescribes this Report became law. The principles of our policy emerge from that Act and from our two decades of experience under it The essential and revolutionary declaration of the Employment Act was that the Federal Government must accept a share of responsibility for the performance of the American economy. The nature of that share has been more and more clearly defined over the years by the recommendations of four Presidents and the enactments of ten Congresses I see these as the main tasks of Federal economic policy today : To attain full employment without inflation ; to use fiscal and monetary policies to help to match total demand to our growing productive potential while helping to speed the growth of that potential through education research and development manpower policies and enlarged private and public investment ; To help to open the doors of opportunity to all through developing human resources and removing barriers of discrimination ignorance and ill-health ; To help to solve social and economic problems that neither private action nor State and local governments can solve alone an efficient transportation system the protection of our environment the health of our agriculture the reconstruction of our cities ; To achieve and maintain equilibrium in the Nation 's external payments and to press for improvements in the international economic order ; To maintain and enhance healthy competition ; To achieve national purposes as far as possible by enlisting the voluntary cooperation of business labor and other groups Recognition of these responsibilities of the Federal Government neither lessens the responsibilities nor impairs the freedoms of individuals and private groups ; nor does it challenge the authority of State and local governments The tasks involve new and growing problems of an increasingly complex and interdependent economy and society. Only the Federal Government can assume these tasks. But the Federal Government by itself can not create prosperity reduce unemployment avoid inflation balance our external accounts restore our cities strengthen agriculture eliminate poverty or make people healthy Only through a creative and cooperative partnership of all private interests and all levels of government a creative Federalism can our economic and social objectives be attained. This partnership has written the story of American success. And a new vitalization of this partnership and a new confidence in its effectiveness have produced the extraordinary economic and social gains of recent years OUR ECONOMIC GAINS Our economy is so vast and our progress has been so rapid that it is difficult to keep our gains in proper perspective. Here are a few examples : In only seven other countries of the world is total output in a year as large as the increase in our output last year Our stock of private plant and equipment valued in constant prices increased as much in alone as it did in the years through The increase in Federal cash receipts between fiscal years and in spite of $ billion of tax cuts will exceed the entire cash receipts of the Federal Government in any peacetime fiscal year prior to JOBS INCOMES AND PRODUCTION The register of our economic gains during starts with jobs : million more over-all ; million more for teenagers ; more for Negroes ; more for women ; million more for blue-collar workers ; more on manufacturing payrolls ; more on State and local government payrolls ; million more in trade and services It continues with pay : average hourly earnings up percent in manufacturing / percent in retail trade ; average weekly earnings up 3l/2 percent in manufacturing ] / $ percent in trade Other forms of income rose too : farm proprietors ' average income up percent ; average income of owners of unincorporated businesses and professional workers up 71/2 percent ; total dividends paid up percent And corporations prospered with profits before taxes up percent ; profits after taxes up percent ; corporate retained earnings up percent With more people earning and earning more total personal incomes rose $ billion or 71/2 percent ; aggregate consumers ' incomes after taxes rose $ billion also 71/2 percent Governmental units benefited from the surge of incomes Federal cash receipts rose $ ^ billion State and local governments took in $ 4/3 billion more reducing the need for tax rate increases to meet their expanding burdens The higher incomes of individuals businesses and governments came from expanding production ( year over year ) : Production of goods and services for consumers up $ 29/ billion Production of new plants and machinery up $ 9/ billion Production for use of the Federal Government up $ 11/2 billion Production for use of State and local governments up $ billion Production for additions to inventories up 2l/2 billion Residential construction no change Production for export ( less imports ) down $ 11/2 billion Total production ( GNP ) up $ billion We could produce $ billion of additional output last year because : We had a large net addition of million to our labor force ; We put to work this entire net increment plus about who were previously unemployed ; On the average each employed person worked a few more hours during the year ; and Each man-hour worked in the private economy produced on the average percent more output than in Increased employment and higher productivity were possible because business investment had provided a substantial expansion of plant capacity ; because the new and the previously existing capacity were used more fully than in the year before ; and because our labor force was better educated and more skilled than ever before. Our efforts to equip the unskilled and inexperienced to take advantage of rapidly expanding job opportunities have been and will continue to be an investment in our productive capacity The enlarged market demands which called forth this higher output came from every sector. The two dominant forces however were the growing boom in business spending for new plant and equipment and the continued dependability of consumer spending following close on consumer income. Excise tax cuts and larger social security benefits in helped to swell the income and buying of households. The tax cuts provided by the Revenue Act of were sustaining private demand all year. By year 's end they had added $ billion to GNP GAINS FOR THE DISADVANTAGED The disadvantaged and less fortunate members of our society also shared in our economic gains P'or the poor who were able to earn there were lower unemployment fuller work schedules and higher pay For the poor who were capable of earning more there were job training and help in finding jobs improvements in education and the breaking down of barriers of discrimination For the poor who could not earn there were more adequate social security benefits new medical programs and better social services For the poor too young to earn there were more effective education assistance to enable them to stay in school and better health services Between and an estimated million persons moved above the poverty line. Millions of others mostly children and young people will have a better chance to break out of poverty in the years ahead as a result of the help they will receive from new Federal education health and antipoverty programs enacted in and But million Americans remain in poverty and millions more are unable to realize their full economic potential. America 's abundance leaves behind too many who are aged who are stranded in declining rural areas who are in broken families who are uneducated or handicapped or victims of discrimination. Unemployment among Negroes remains twice that of whites. And an unemployment rate of percent among teenagers means that too many youths find disappointment in moving from school into jobs The war on poverty ignorance ill-health discrimination and inadequate opportunity must go forward STRENGTHENED PAYMENTS BALANCE In we reduced our balance of payments deficit to less than half that in and We have shown a skeptical world that a voluntary program relying on the patriotic cooperation of businesses and banks could work We made substantial progress in despite the fact that our new program did not start until late in thefirstquarter of the year ; despite increased responsibilities in Vietnam ; despite a temporary decline in our trade surplus ; despite conversion by the U.K. Government of more than $ / billion of U.S. securities and other assets Last year we moved forward toward payments balance without sacrificing our vital domestic or international objectives. And we intend to complete the job this year T H E RECORD OF COSTS AND PRICES Until a year ago American costs and prices had been essentially unchanged since Last year largely through a surge in agricultural and food prices the record was blemished. Even so we have not lost ground to our major competitors overseas whose prices and costs have generally risen more than ours Some internationally traded raw materials particularly metals and hides are costing us more. And higher prices for petroleum products and some machinery have also nudged up our price indexes But labor costs the most basic element in the structure of our costs have barely moved as gains in productivity have largely offset moderate increases in hourly labor costs In many major sectors of our economy price stability is still the rule and some important prices are still going down in line with lower costs In December some of the wholesale prices that were lower than a year earlier were : fresh and dried fruits and vegetables millwork plant and animal fibers building paper and board coal motor vehicles electric power heating equipment packaged beverage materials household appliances manmade fibers televisions radios phonographs inedible fats and oils floor coverings paint materials flat glass crude rubber gypsum products Many industries and markets have demonstrated that the gains of lower costs and rapidly rising productivity can be shared with consumers Wholesale prices of the following categories of products in December averaged at least percent lower than in : fresh and dried fruits and vegetables tires and tubes grains plywood plant and animal fibers building paper and board packaged beverage materials heating equipment manmade fibers household appliances paint materials televisions radios and phonographs drugs and pharmaceuticals asphalt roofing crude rubber Those who proclaim inflation is already here have not turned over all the price tags ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR Demand will continue to grow rapidly in and production will respond. The vigor of investment spending demonstrates strong business confidence in the growing sales rising profits and firm operating rates which spur expansion and modernization. The rising defense needs of the Federal Government are an important new force in the economy With growing support from Federal grant programs State and local purchases will keep moving ahead. Rising consumer incomes from wages dividends interest professional work and farming will again largely be devoted to expenditures for better living These forces should add very nearly as much to our GNP in as the record gain of $ billion last year. As the midpoint of a $ billion range $ billion is the projected level of GNP in With that output we foresee an extra $ billion of spending and production for civilian needs both private and public ; unemployment shrinking below percent and below any yearly average rate since ; great advances in the productive capacity of our industries ; further good gains in productivity ; and full use without overuse or strain of our productive capacity FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY The fiscal program I recommend for aims at full employment without inflation. It is a responsible program. It recognizes that vigorous private demand and required defense spending could upset the balance of supply and demand so diligently pursued by fiscal and monetary policies in recent years and now so effectively achieved Until this year pursuit of this balance has pointed fiscal policies toward the stimulation of demand. Now a stimulus is no longer appropriate I have reviewed every program of Government to make room for the necessities of defense. I have sharply reduced or eliminated those civilian programs of lowest priority But as I indicated in my State of the Union Message I am unwilling to declare a moratorium on our progress toward the Great Society. My budget will add $ billion to our war against poverty ignorance and disease. Yet savings elsewhere will hold the rise in the Administrative Budget apart from the added costs of Vietnam to only $ million Moreover I am asking the Congress to enact promptly a combination of proposals affecting tax payments in the year ahead : a rescheduling of the January and later excise tax reduction enacted last June for automobiles and telephone service ; a graduated withholding system that will improve the pay-asyou-go basis of our personal income taxes without increasing tax rates or tax liabilities ; a corresponding speed-up in payments of corporate income taxes this year and next also without increasing tax rates or tax liabilities ; and a method of paying self-employment Social Security taxes on a current basis These measures will let us stay close to a high-level balance between the revenues that the Federal Government draws out of the economy and the expenditures that it puts back into the spending stream and to a highlevel balance between total demand and the economy 's capacity to produce. It is my judgment that this budget provides the appropriate fiscal environment for the maintenance of basic price stability with continued growth I will also look to the Federal Reserve System to provide assistance in promoting the objectives we all share : meeting the credit needs of a vigorous and growing economy while preventing excessive credit flows that could carry the pace of expansion beyond prudent speed limits T H E UNCERTAINTIES We have made the best economic judgments we can. This year they were unusually difficult. If the tax measures I am now proposing in conjunction with the moderating influence of monetary policy do not hold total demand within bounds of the Nation 's productive capacity I will not hesitate to ask for further fiscal restraints on private spending Nor will I hesitate to ask for such further fiscal action if additional defense requirements demand it during the year. And I will welcome II the opportunity to alter my budget in the event that a relaxation of international tensions permits lower defense outlays than are now foreseen Our defense needs are great ; but our growth is far greater. The demands on our economy are strong ; but its productive capabilities are enormous. Surprises surely lie ahead ; but our ability to cope with change is strong and improving MAINTAINING COST-PRICE STABILITY IN One of the problems of prosperity we face in is that of achieving stability of prices and costs at full employment The basic precondition for price stability is a fiscal-monetary policy that deters total demand for goods and services from outrunning potential supply. But history proclaims that something more is needed : a sense of responsibility to the public interest by labor and business in setting wages and prices The vigorous economy we foresee in will tempt labor unions to demand wage increases that would raise costs and businesses to raise prices when profit margins are already fully adequate. Labor must remember that growing employment and productivity are the foundation of higher wages and business that an expanding economy is the basic source of profit gains. These foundations must not be jeopardized The Federal Government does not have authority to impose ceilings on wages and prices But when of our fellow citizens are risking their lives in the defense of freedom overseas the Government 's duty is to ask those who enjoy a comfortable prosperity at home to exercise responsibly their freedom to set prices and wages Foregoing the freedom to act irresponsibly is no real sacrifice. For irresponsible action can only bring on an inflation that would damage all labor business and the national interest The attached Report of the Council of Economic Advisers contains a thorough discussion of its guideposts for noninflationary wage and price behavior. To maintain price stability in the expanding economy of it is vitally important that labor and industry follow these guideposts The public can expect that the responsible actions of labor and management will be strengthened and supplemented by all the policies of the Federal Government : * Manpower education and rehabilitation programs will continue to train the unemployed and to prepare our youth increasing the supply of qualified workers and their productivity Where available surplus Federal stockpiles will be used to prevent unnecessary shortages of materials and commodities Defense procurement agricultural and other policies will be adjusted where necessary to avoid contributing to instability of prices Fair Labor Standards legislation and Government pay increases should be consistent with the guideposts There are no general labor shortages in our economy now and none should develop in the year ahead. But in some industries occupations and areas limited stringencies are appearing Prompt and effective action will be taken to meet any problem of specific labor shortage. I have instructed the Secretary of Labor to take all possible and necessary steps. And I have asked all other Departments to cooperate in this effort It will not be easy to reconcile price stability and full employment Some price movements reflect worldwide changes in supply and demand But over-all stability of costs and prices will be preserved in the year ahead provided that during public policies maintain a balance between over-all supply and demand and address themselves vigorously to any emerging sectoral imbalances and business and labor accept the principles of the guideposts for noninflationary behavior We will have demonstrated that a free economy can both maintain full employment and avoid inflation and do so without arbitrary controls INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICIES FOR These are the objectives of our international economic policies in : to correct our remaining balance of payments deficit so that the dollar will remain strong ; to work toward reduction of trade barriers so that all nations may reap the benefits of freer trade ; to improve the international monetary system so that it will continue to facilitate sound and orderly growth of the world economy ; to press forward with the other fortunate nations in the great international task of our age : helping those countries now economically less advanced which are prepared to help themselves make rapid progress toward a better life in freedom BALANCE OF PAYMENTS Decisive progress was made in toward reducing our balance of payments deficit. Though the results for are gratifying we can not afford to relax. We have not yet balanced our external accounts J For external balance is our goal. It requires that Business continue to cooperate wholeheartedly in following the strengthened guidelines governing capital flows announced in December ; Banks and financial institutions maintain their excellent performance of last year ; Businesses sell even more abroad this year in spite of full domestic order books ; Business and labor keep costs and prices stable in order to maintain the competitiveness of our goods and services in international markets ; Government work vigorously to minimize the dollar drain abroad of its aid and defense programs as well as all other activities ; The Congress pass the tax legislation I recommended last year to enhance opportunities for foreigners to invest in the United States ; We intensify our efforts to encourage our own citizens and foreigners to travel in the United States. I am directing that high priority be given to these efforts TRADE The year is the year when the world can take a giant step forward in liberalizing international trade by successfully concluding the Kennedy Round of negotiations to reduce trade barriers on all classes of products. The resulting growth of world trade and world income will benefit all countries developing as well as industrial. The United States will bend every effort to get meaningful negotiations back on the track. This great venture in international cooperation must not fail We shall continue our efforts to improve the trade prospects of the developing countries by helping to stabilize commodity trade by supporting regional integration among them where practicable by providing access to markets and by giving positive assistance to export promotion INTERNATIONAL MONETARY REFORM As we achieve and maintain balance in our external accounts dollars will no longer add to international monetary reserves as they have in the past. We learned long ago that we can not rely on gold alone. The free world must look to new sources of liquidity rather than to deficits in the U.S. balance of payments to support growing international trade and payments We are therefore pressing forward with other nations to assure the adequate and orderly growth of world monetary reserves ; to improve the adjustment of imbalances by both surplus and deficit countries ; to strengthen the monetary system that has served the world so well I hope that the major industrial nations and then the entire community of free nations will reach an agreement that will make creation of new reserve assets a deliberate decision of the community of nations to serve the economic welfare of all ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE We have molded our foreign assistance policies into more efficient tools with which to confront one of history 's gravest challenges the development of the impoverished but awakening and turbulent two-thirds of the world The United States stands ready to continue to assist those countries which have demonstrated their commitment to the task of moving their economies forward toward self-sustaining growth under freedom In recent years I have consciously held back further increases in our foreign assistance request while we designed a lean but effective program to give maximum impact to each dollar we spend Today we are ready to move forward with special emphasis on three areas in which the United States is particularly well qualified to help : agriculture to stimulate food production where it fails to keep pace with spiraling populations ; health to strengthen millions who could contribute more fully to their own economic progress ; education and training to provide the modern skills needed for development URBAN PROBLEMS AND POLICIES We are an urban society. In America 's urban areas contained million people percent of our population. By the year million percent of our population are likely to be urban. The quality of American life increasingly depends on the physical economic aesthetic and social qualities of our urban centers American cities possess some of the rarest treasures of art the finest music and theater the greatest universities the loveliest parks the most splendid vistas the most elegant and luxurious living in the entire world Yet they also contain degrading poverty revolting slums incredible traffic congestion bitter racial tensions physical decay and ugliness political disorganization and rising crime and delinquency The Congress created last year a Department of Housing and Urban Development giving it responsibilities for coordinating Federal programs affecting housing urban areas and urban people and for administering many such programs. I have no intention of letting it become merely a housekeeping agency to supervise miscellaneous programs With the help of the finest minds in the Nation we have been developing a program to rebuild in cooperation with State and local governments private agencies business enterprises and local citizens the physical institutional and social environment of our urban areas. Each city should plan on an integrated basis for its own physical economic and social development. And where those plans are imaginative farsighted and efficient the Federal Government should help to make them realities I am asking the Congress to consider proposed legislation to carry out these objectives. I am also preparing proposals for legislation to bar discrimination in the sale or rental of housing a condition which has contributed to many urban problems TRANSPORTATION The revolutionary changes in transportation technology of the past half century have not been matched by equal progress in our public policies or our Federal organization I am recommending the creation of a Department of Transportation to manage the vast Federal promotional programs in highways waterways air travel and maritime affairs and to take leadership in the development of new transportation policies in accord with current realities I am proposing again this year increased user charges on highways and aviation and the introduction of nominal user charges on inland waterways. Such charges will improve efficiency in the use of resources and reimburse the Federal Government for a part of its expenditures which directly benefit the users of these facilities We spend billions of dollars in medical research each year to conquer disease and prolong life. Yet we still put up with the senseless slaughter of thousands of Americans on our highways Fifty thousand Americans met their death in traffic accidents during About / million were injured. The economic cost of accidents is estimated at around $ billion a year We can no longer ignore the problem of automobile safety. We can no longer procrastinate and hope that the situation will improve. I will propose new programs to protect the safety of our citizens and the efficient flow of our commerce CONTROLLING POLLUTION Our means for attacking the shameful pollution of our environment were strengthened in the first session of this Congress by important new standard-setting authority over water quality and automotive exhausts Federal agencies have begun cleaning up the numerous and extensive sources of water pollution from their own facilities in response to my Executive Order. Despite budgetary stringency expenditures for this purpose will be given high priority. I shall issue an Executive Order covering air pollution from Federal installations I propose that in cooperation with appropriate State and local authorities and private interests we carry out projects to clean up several entire river basins following the example of our efforts to clean up the Potomac Special Federal financial assistance will be necessary ; this should be conditioned on new financial and organizational arrangements by State and local authorities LABOR AND MANAGEMENT UNION SECURITY AGREEMENTS Strong and responsible collective bargaining is an important instrument of a free and healthy economy To improve its functioning and to make the national labor policy uniform throughout the country I again urge the Congress to repeal Section ( b ) of theTaft-HartleyAct STRIKE EMERGENCIES The recent transit strike in New York City illustrates our helplessness in preventing extreme disruption to the lives and livelihoods of a city of million people. I intend to ask the Congress to consider measures that without improperly invading State and local authority will enable us to deal effectively with strikes that may cause irreparable damage to the national interest UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE Our system of Unemployment Insurance has not kept pace with our advancing economy. The time to modernize it is now when unemployment is low and the cost of improved protection can be readily absorbed We need a program that will provide more realistic benefits including benefits for more workers and for longer periods of joblessness ; that will correct abuses and assure efficient and responsible administration ; and that will broaden the system 's tax base and strengthen its financing. I urge the Congress to enact such a program FAIR LABOR STANDARDS Millions of workers at the bottom of our wage scale still lack the protection of Federal minimum standards. At the same time we need to reinforce this protection by raising the minimum wage I recommend the extension of the Fair Labor Standards Act to large numbers of additional workers. In enacting higher minimum wage levels the Congress should consider carefully their effects on substandard incomes on cost and price stability and on the availability of job opportunities for marginal workers TAX REFORM AND SIMPLIFICATION Against a background calling for fiscal restraint I can not this year endorse any specific legislative measure however meritorious involving significant net tax reduction. The danger of inflation from increased demand would be too great and any special tax reduction now would postpone the time when we can achieve a meaningful general tax reduction Although tax reduction is not feasible this year improvement of our tax system is a continuing need which will concern this Administration and which deserves the support of all Americans One major goal must be simplification of the tax law. Another aim must be a more equitable distribution of the tax load. The great variation of tax liability among persons with equivalent income or wealth must be reduced. Further when tax reduction once again becomes feasible particular attention must be given to relief of those at or near poverty levels of income Finally we must review special tax preferences. In a fully employed economy special tax benefits to stimulate some activities or investments mean that we will have less of other activities. Benefits that the Government extends through direct expenditures are periodically reviewed and often altered in the budget-appropriation process but too little attention is given to reviewing particular tax benefits. These benefits like all other activities of Government must stand up to the tests of efficiency and fairness We must constantly seek improvements in the tax code in the interests of equity and of sound economic policy I welcome the concern over these problems shown by the Chairmen of the tax committees of the Congress As a specific tax reform which can be accomplished this year I call upon the Congress to deal with abuses of tax-exempt private foundations We must always be prepared to meet quickly any problems that arise in the path of continued stable economic growth whether the problems call for fiscal stimulus or fiscal restraint. Background tax studies by both the Congress and Executive Branch should therefore be adequate to permit quick decisions and prompt action to accommodate short-run cyclical changes. If quick action is ever needed we should not have to begin a long debate on what the changes in taxes should be FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN OUR CHANGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT The vigor and soundness of our financial institutions are vital to the vigor and soundness of our economic expansion. Actions to ease unnecessarily restrictive regulations have been taken in the past ; they have borne fruit in stronger competition and a more efficient flow of funds from savers to borrowers with the most urgent needs But appropriate regulations are clearly required to protect the safety of savings of American families to assure the most efficient and equitable regulation of financial institutions and to create still better channels for theflowof funds to borrowers For these reasons I recommend Congressional action on financial legislation to arm regulatory agencies with a wider range of effective enforcement remedies ; strengthen statutory provisions dealing with savings and loan holding companies ; increase the maximum amount of insurance coverage for bank deposits and savings and loan accounts ; provide safeguards against conflict of interests in the management of these institutions ; and make regulations applying to various types of institutions as parallel as possible ; provide for Federal chartering of mutual savings banks CONSUMER PROTECTION I have already asked for the cooperation of business and labor in preserving the stability of costs and prices. But the consumer also has a responsibility for holding the price line To fulfill his responsibility the consumer must have access to clear unambiguous information about products and services available for sale. This will enable him to reward with his patronage the most efficient producers and distributors who offer the best value or the lowest price We should wait no longer to eliminate misleading and deceptive packaging and labeling practices which cause consumer confusion. The fair packaging and labeling bill should be enacted While the growth of consumer credit has contributed to our rising standard of living confusing practices in disclosing credit rates and the cost of financing have made it difficult for consumers to shop for the best buy in credit Truth-in-lending legislation would provide consumers the necessary information by requiring a clear statement of the cost of credit and the annual rate of interest Our legislation protecting the public from harmful drugs and cosmetics should be strengthened. I shall propose legislation for this purpose CONCLUSION A few years ago much was heard of the " European economic miracle. " Today across the Atlantic and around the world one hears once again of the " American economic miracle. " For the American economy in the past years has demonstrated anew the confident vitality the internal dynamism and the enormous productivity which had long been its hallmark. We had settled for a while on what seemed a plateau of affluence ; now once again there has been the strong thrust of progress- but a newly steady and balanced progress We have again shown the world what free men and a free economy can achieve. The peoples struggling toward economic development see with renewed interest that free markets and free economic choices can be a mighty engine of progress Moreover there is new respect in the world for an America concerned with using its abundance to enhance the quality of human life : for a people who undertake a war on poverty along with the defense of freedom ; who seek to restore their cities to greatness and to conserve the beauties of their landscape ; who are determined to break down a centuries-old barrier of prejudice and injustice ; who are resolved to lift the quality of education at every level ; who are determined to promote and reward excellence in every endeavor ; who have provided new health services and better social security for their older citizens ; who offer to share their abundance and technical skills with a needy world The new vigor and progress of America can be a source of satisfaction Yet we can not rest on past accomplishments. Continuing problems challenge our determination and our resourcefulness Perhaps our most serious economic challenge in will be to preserve the essential stability of costs and prices which has contributed so significantly to our balanced progress I do not know what additional burdens of defense the American economy will be asked to assume in Whatever they are they will be met and they will be small relative to the growth of our abundance But in an economy approaching full use of its resources the new requirements of Vietnam make our task of maintaining price stability more difficult To insure against the risk of inflationary pressures I have asked Americans to pay their taxes on a more nearly current basis and to postpone a scheduled tax cut. If it should turn out that additional insurance is needed then I am convinced that we should levy higher taxes rather than accept inflation which is the most unjust and capricious form of taxation We know that we do not need to put our growing economy into a straight jacket or to throw it into reverse. But the extent of the fiscal or monetary restraint that will be needed to avoid inflationary pressures will depend directly on the restraint and moderation exercised by those who have power over wages and prices I again ask every leader of labor and every businessman who has price or wage decisions to make in to remember that his decisions affect not alone the wages of his members or the returns of his stockholders. Shortsighted pursuit of short-run interests fails in the longer run to advance the interests of either labor or management. And it surely does not advance the interests of the Nation I am confident that the overwhelming majority of private decisions in will be sound and responsible just as I am determined that public decisions will be fully responsible If they are the American economic miracle will remain in the single most important force in the economic progress of mankind January THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS Washington D.C.

" It was the fifth year of uninterrupted economic expansion and the second year of declining unemployment as output moved closer to the economy 's growing productive potential Since the Revenue Act of became effective the economy has shown new vigor. Living standards have risen at an unprecedented rate and businessmen have found new and stronger incentives to expand and modernize their productive facilities. Employment has forged ahead dramatically enlarging job opportunities particularly for the young and the less advantaged groups in the labor force. As the year closed the unemployment rate was percent within inches of the percent interim goal set by the Kennedy Administration in the Economic Report and below any rate achieved since the mid-19505s. Meanwhile despite some pressures on prices for particular commodities the over-all price record remained far better than in that earlier period. In addition last year witnessed significant progress toward equilibrium in the balance of payments Today our vigorous economy is in a strong position to carry the new burdens imposed by expanded national defense requirements. With another large advance in total production ahead defense needs will be met while consumer living standards again improve strongly and the capital stock is further enlarged. Indeed the increase in output available for civilian uses this year is expected to be one of the largest in our history National security of course has first priority on the budget and the first claim on production. It certainly represents a less welcome use of our national output than would Federal civilian programs or the private spending that would come from tax reduction. Progress will continue in building the Great Society but the pace of Federal civilian programs reflects the current urgency of national defense Furthermore rising defense requirements clearly complicate the task of economic policy. The stimulative fiscal policies of recent years have achieved their mission. Consumer spending and investment demand have both been invigorated. The same logic that called for fiscal stimuli when demand was weak now argues for a degree of restraint to assure that the pace of the economy remains within safe speed limits. Measures to moaerate the growth of private purchasing power are needed to offset in part the expansionary influence of rising defense outlays if intensified price and wage pressures are to be avoided. A combination of such measures affecting excise tax rates and the timing of individual and corporate tax payments is thus a key proposal in the President 's fiscal program At the same time the Administration looks toward further declines in unemployment during the year ahead indeed to the lowest level since These ambitious targets are a renewed expression of confidence in the vigor adaptability and productivity of our private economic system a confidence which has been richly reaffirmed and rewarded in the past years by the Nation 's smooth progress and efficient performance in approaching full employment. Nonetheless this is a year of many uncertainties : the advance into the new territory of still lower unemployment must be made with care ; meanwhile defense requirements could shift suddenly in either direction in the months ahead. Fiscal policy stands ready to meet any changing needs and unanticipated developments and will look to assistance from monetary policy in maintaining flexibility This chapter reviews the recent record of progress toward full employment appraises the current state of the economy evaluates the outlook for gross national product and employment in in the light of fiscal and monetary policies and explores future contingencies. Chapter examines in detail the outlook for price-cost stability. Problems of the U.S balance of payments are reviewed in Chapter PROGRESS TOWARD FULL EMPLOYMENT Nearly years of expansion have yielded a gain of $ billion in gross national product ( GNP ) Revised historical estimates of our national product through were published last August by the Department of Commerce and updated provisional estimates for were released at the start of this year ; these new estimates give a more accurate picture of the growth of GNP and the relationship of its components. They show that total GNP advanced at a percent annual rate in the last ^ years After adjustment for the modest upward drift in prices the average annual rate of growth of real output over this period was percent When measured from the peak year of to real growth averaged percent in sharp contrast to the percent annual rise from to This rapid growth in the United States exceeds the target rate for the 's established collectively by the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) At mid-decade the Secretary General of the OECD reported to the Ministers " During the period gross national product for OECD countries taken together has increased at a somewhat higher rate than that needed to meet the target of percent for the decade [ percent a year ] set by the Ministers in " The United States accounts for virtually all of the surplus above the target rate. In contrast to the decade of the 's when most OECD countries enjoyed virtually uninterrupted expansion while the United States suffered periodic downturns it has been the United States that has experienced continuing strong expansion thus far in the 's Sustained and balanced progress is the hallmark of the current expansion. But the pace of the advance has varied over time ( Chart ) In the initial recovery period from the recession output rebounded sharply ; the unemployment rate which had been percent early in fell rapidly late in the year reaching 5j/ percent by mid-1962. The upswing was spurred by the characteristic shift from liquidation to accumulation of inventories and by higher Federal Government spending partly associated with the Berlin crisis. However the expansion then faltered when fixed investment outlays failed to take over as the main expansionary force in the economy. As the growth of total output slowed unemployment threatened to be stuck on a 5J4 percent plateau. The Kennedy Administration was convinced that adequate total demand could reduce Chart Changes in Gross National Product Since CHANGES I N BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OTHERy BUSINESS FIXED INVESTMENT STATE AND LOCAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT J PERSONAL CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES -I/RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES CHANGE IN BUSINESS INVENTORIES AND NET EXPORTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES SOURCE : DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE unemployment at least to percent without inflation. To accomplish this objective it developed a comprehensive program of tax measures including lower personal and corporate tax rates depreciation reform and an investment tax credit. The personal tax cuts raised after-tax earnings and spurred more spending by consumers. The corporate measures added further to private investment incentives and to the volume of investible funds The economy responded well to these measures and especially to the major tax cut of February GNP rose by nearly $ billion in compared with the gain of almost $ billion in and the unemployment rate fell to percent by the end of the year Statistical analysis of the impact of the tax reduction suggests that it was responsible for nearly the entire $ billion step-up in the annual increase of GNP. The reduction in tax liabilities in boosted the after-tax incomes of households and businesses. Spending by these sectors particularly consumer outlays rose in response to these larger after-tax incomes. This higher spending increased sales employment and earnings. Larger earnings in turn provided the basis for still more consumption spending Investment was also stimulated by gains in business sales and higher capacity utilization. By early the contribution of the tax cut in lifting consumption and investment spending was more than $ billion ( annual rate ) Since the effects of the tax cut cumulate through time its contribution has grown further reaching $ billion by the end of As opened the remaining lift from the Revenue Act of was not in itself sufficient to assure a sustained reduction in unemployment Consequently a good opportunity was presented for a long-awaited reduction in excise taxes and a liberalization of Social Security benefits both of which were desirable on equity grounds. These actions were proposed in the fiscal budget presented in January In combination with expected modest increases in other expenditures they more than offset the normal growth of Federal revenues and thus provided a net fiscal stimulus for calendar The stimulus was planned for the second half of the year since heavy stocking of steel inventories in anticipation of a strike was expected to stimulate demand early in the year and subsequently to be reversed The fiscal actions in were a success. The economy did move further toward full employment even more rapidly than anticipated ; yet demand did not outstrip capacity to produce SOURCES OF STRENGTH Personal consumption and business fixed investment the two types of spending expected to be most responsive to the major tax reduction surged ahead in and Buoyancy in these sectors outweighed sluggishness in residential construction outlays and moderation in inventory investment ( Table ) T A B L E Changes in gross national product since early Percentage change per year Expenditure group IV IV1 I IV to to IV1 IV Billions of dollars Gross national product Personal consumption expenditures -_ Private business fixed investment_ Change in business inventories Residential structures Net exports of goods and services Government purchases of goods and services Federal State and local 5io Preliminary Seasonally adjusted annual rates Percentage change not computed because of small or negative base NOTE. Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding Sources : Department of Commerce and Council of Economic Advisers Consumption The consumer was a bulwark in the strong general economic gains of and Except for the fourth quarter of when strikes curtailed automobile sales consumption grew by $ billion or more in every quarter of this period. Only twice before once at the start of the Korean war and again at the beginning of had quarterly increases of this size occurred A notable feature of the recent sharp advance in consumption expenditures is its pervasiveness. The sharpest relative increases occurred in purchases of durables which are generally most sensitive to fluctuations in the growth of income. From the end of to the end of real expenditures on automobiles toppled all previous records rising on average by percent a year. Yet this strong rise was closely paralleled by outlays for other durables. And real outlays on both nondurables and services rose at an unusually strong l/i percent annual rate Consumers were able to take these forward strides because of rapid gains in their purchasing power. Real disposable income grew at an average annual rate of percent in the years after the tax cut in contrast to the growth rate of percent in the preceding years. The consumer continued to be a dependable performer in the economy. During the past years the rise of almost $ billion in consumption amounted to percent of the $ billion increase in disposable income. Spending on consumer goods and services has typically absorbed approximately this proportion of increases in disposable income when allowance is made for some lag in adjustment to unusually large income gains The largest beneficiaries of the rapid rise in income were workers rescued from unemployment. Other consumers also benefited although less dra- T A B L E Changes in employment and income since early [ Seasonally adjusted ] Percentage change per year Series Civilian labor force : Employment Unemployment Unit _do_do I IV to to IV i IV < Millions of persons. do Personal income : * Total ( before taxes ) r Billions of dollars .do Wage and salary disbursements Disposable ( after taxes ) .do Corporate profits : Before taxes After taxes I IV 1965IV1 U2.4 Preliminary Adjusted for comparability with subsequent data Quarterly data at annual rates Profits data relate to III Sources : Department of Labor Department of Commerce and Council of Economic Advisers matically through lower taxes higher wages and fuller work schedules ( Table ) Thus expansionary fiscal policies were translated for most Americans into rising standards of living more and better provision of the physical necessities the social amenities and the personal conveniences of civilized life. Real consumption per capita ( prices ) grew over the 2-year interval by $ as much as in the preceding years Investment A buoyant economy with rising sales and operating rates surging profits and the incentives of tax reduction gave new stimulus to business to expand and modernize capacity. The result was an l/i percent jump in outlays for business fixed investment in and a 15J ^ percent spurt in These gains compare with an average annual rate of increase of 7j ^ percent in the preceding years Investment plans were repeatedly revised upward in and as business confidence grew. The second time that businessmen reported spending plans for a given quarter in the Department of CommerceSecurities and Exchange Commission survey their plans exceeded the first anticipations. Their actual outlays invariably topped the second anticipations ( Table ) a clear indication of the general availability of capital goods. In sharp contrast during and early businessmen were not able to invest as much as they had planned because of bottlenecks in construction and delivery of equipment The stepped-up pace of final sales in and also required additional inventories. Nevertheless the $ billion accumulation of nonfarm stocks in was unusually small in relation to the advance in final sales as inventory-sales ratios declined during most of the year.

Thus the upswing in residential construction activity ended early in The number of private housing starts fell from an annual rate of million units in the first quarter of to a low of million units in the third quarter of The real value of home construction held up somewhat better because of a shift toward bigger and better quality new homes. Nevertheless residential construction added practically nothing to the growth of GNP even in current prices in and was again a conspicuously lagging sector in THE RECENT RECORD The strength of the advance in was exceptional and surpassed expectations. The Council 's Annual Report of which contained one of the more optimistic forecasts current at that time estimated a gain of $ billion in GNP for the year the midpoint of a $ billion range In contrast the actual gain was a record $ billion The major reason for the unforeseen gain was the unusually large revision in investment plans. Evidence available at the beginning of pointed to a rise in business fixed investment for the year which would be close to but not quite match the increase in The actual advance however totaled $ 9/ billion substantially exceeding the $ billion rise in the preceding year. Federal purchases of goods and services rose by $ 15/2 billion for the year as a whole compared with the $ ^ billion increase that had been anticipated. Consumption outlays exceeded the Council 's original estimate but this was primarily because of higher disposable income that in turn reflected the greater strength of other sectors The extraordinary strength of demand became more clearly established as the year progressed. Much of the unusually large advance in the opening quarter was attributable to the rebound from the strike in the automobile industry which had depressed output in the closing quarter of Even though automobile output retreated in the second quarter GNP advanced strongly. Sharp increases in fixed investment in the third and fourth quarters reinforced continued rapid rises in consumption Finally defense outlays added to demand particularly from the second to the fourth quarter when they rose by $ billion. About $ billion of this rise came from the military pay increase enacted in September Moreover the prospect of further substantial increases in Federal defense expenditures was a major factor contributing to buoyant expectations and investment demand in the second half of the year Thus gains in GNP grew to $ billion each in the third and fourth quarters of The advance in the fourth quarter was especially remarkable in view of the liquidation of steel inventories at an annual rate of about $ billion following the September labor settlement. Although the impact of the slowdown in steel production was evident in the industrial production index in September and October the index rose strongly thereafter ; for the year as a whole it was percent above the average The strength of spending lifted the economy toward more complete use of its resources. Under the influence of favorable fiscal and monetary policies the economy has achieved the best balance of over-all demand and productive capacity in nearly a decade THE BALANCE OF THE ECONOMY TODAY The potential output of the American economy has continued to grow rapidly in the past years. Aggregate demand however has advanced even faster. Output has risen to within / percent of the economy 's estimated potential. Meanwhile private investment has forged ahead to match highemployment private saving. The good balances of demand with potential output and of investment with high-employment saving are two related measures of our progress BALANCE OF OUTPUT AND POTENTIAL In the American economy achieved fuller utilization of its vast human and physical resources than at any time since Jobs were provided for more persons able and willing to work thus leading to a more equitable distribution of the Nation 's output and reducing the ranks of those unfairly condemned to a meager subsistence because they can not find work. More and more Americans have had the chance to exercise their preference for employment rather than doles. Adult males had an unemployment rate of percent in The rate fell to percent by the end of not because attitudes toward work were uplifted but because opportunities for work widened greatly A high-employment economy generates benefits for the rest of the Nation as well as for the previously unemployed. The additional output directly attributable to the efforts of the reemployed is just one part of the larger output that accompanies increased employment. In addition productivity is higher as a result of improved utilization primarily reflecting the more efficient use of overhead labor such as clerical professional maintenance and managerial employees Improving employment opportunities also attract more persons into the job market and thus add to the measured labor force. Manpower supplies are further increased in periods of advancing activity by the lengthening of the work week as part-time employees are converted to full-time and as overtime work increases In the last four Economic Reports the Council has discussed the concept of potential GNP defined as the volume of goods and services that the economy would ordinarily produce at the interim target unemployment rate of percent. The measurement of potential GNP must incorporate the effects of the higher productivity the larger labor force and the fuller work schedules which accompany reduced unemployment Potential GNP does not stand still. Over time population trends add to the number of persons in the labor force. Furthermore increases in the quantity and quality of capital advances in technology and improvements in the quality of labor raise the potential productivity of the labor force The evidence indicates that from the mid-1950 's and into the early 's the potential labor force grew at the rate of about * percent a year Normal growth of man-hour productivity for the entire work force ( including Government as well as private workers ) was 2J/2 percent a year. Hours worked a year trended downward at a rate of nearly one-fourth of percent annually. Thus potential GNP grew by 3J4 percent a year For recent years a real growth rate of actual GNP somewhat greater than / percent has been required to hold the unemployment rate constant Hence the Council last year raised its estimated rate of growth of potential GNP to ? percent beginning in More rapid growth of the labor force will further increase the growth rate of potential GNP in the years ahead. During the Department of Labor will release a study summarizing the results of extensive research on the prospects and patterns of growth by The disparity or " gap " between potential and actual output ( Chart ) represents the goods and services foregone because of the underutilization of resources. The persistent gap since the mid-1950 's has meant a total of $ billion ( in prices ) in lost output. This loss was at a peak annual rate of $ billion in the first quarter of The gap was reduced during the next few years. It shrank dramatically in reaching $ billion in the final quarter when the unemployment rate was ^ percent During the second half of unemployment fell somewhat more rapidly than would have been expected from the rate of advance of real GNP. It now appears likely that the unemployment rate will reach percent while the trend calculation still shows a small GNP gap. Recent experience has been influenced by the expansion of the armed services and of Government antipoverty programs for training young unskilled workers both of which have a stronger effect on unemployment than on output. Despite the discrepancy between the estimate of the gap and the movement of unemployment that emerged late in it is clear that the Council 's estimates of the potential GNP associated with percent unemployment have been close to the mark throughout the expansion.

But aggregate demand policies have not been alone. Other public and private policies have improved the functioning of markets and the skills of the labor force as Chapters and explain in detail. These policies have now made prudent a reduction in the unemployment rate to a level below percent BALANCE OF INVESTMENT AND SAVING The resurgence of private demand in was marked by an improved balance of investment and private saving As statistically measured total national saving personal saving gross business saving and the net surplus of Federal State and local governments is always necessarily equal to private investment ( except for whatever statistical discrepancy may creep into the measurement of income and product flows ) Total gross national income equals the value of spending for current production consumption government purchases and investment. Saving is that part of total income which is neither spent for personal consumption nor used for government purchases. Therefore it must equal the value of spending for the remaining portion of GNP i.e. investment This equality of saving and investment will hold whether the economy is depressed or fully employed. But the economy can have high employment only if actual investment demands of businesses are large enough to match the amount that consumers businesses and governments wish to save at high-employment incomes. If actual investment falls short of high-employment saving total spending will fall short of high-employment output Because of insufficient demand production will be held to some lower level where a smaller volume of saving does match the forthcoming investment Actual gross investment did in fact fall short of high-employment saving for nearly years after Balance between the two was finally restored during Much of the discrepancy prior to is attributable to a fiscal policy that would have yielded excessively large surpluses at high income levels. Since investment demand was not strong enough to match this excessive Federal high-employment surplus lower incomes resulted A comparison between actual private investment and estimated total high-employment saving from to is given in Chart At high employment total private saving would be expected to remain a fairly stable fraction of GNP between ^ and percent. It will of course vary from year to year reflecting changes in the personal saving rate changes in tax rates and transfer payments that would alter the share of disposable income in GNP and shifts in corporate dividend policies or in depreciation allowances Chart Investment and High-Employment Saving BILLIONS OF DOLLARS * ( ratio scale ) _ HIGH-EMPLOYMENT TOTAL SAVING * HIGH-EMPLOYMENT GOVERNMENT ^ ! * V HIGH-EMPLOYMENT \ PRIVATE SAVING-2/ ^ i I INVESTMENT ^ / / I ACTUAL GROSS i i i i I I / f I I t I * SEASONALLY ADJUSTED ANNUAL RATES H FEDERAL HIGH-EMPLOYMENT SURPLUS PLUS STATE AND LOCAL ACTUAL SURPLUS 2/ 15J/4 PERCENT OF TREND GNP IN CURRENT PRICES 3/ GROSS PRIVATE DOMESTIC INVESTMENT PLUS NET FOREIGN INVESTMENT SOURCES : DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS Nevertheless no great variation would ordinarily be expected ; total private saving is approximated on the chart at % percent of potential GNP Private saving thus appears as an almost straight line in the chart since potential GNP ( even in current dollars ) grows rather smoothly. State and local governments typically stay very close to balanced budgets on a national income accounts basis. Their contribution to high-employment saving is approximated by their actual small surpluses or deficits The Federal contribution to total high-employment saving is measured by its high-employment surplus a concept that has been explained in previous Annual Reports. It is the excess of Federal revenues that would be generated by high-employment incomes over actual Federal expenditures adjusted for the reduced level of unemployment compensation The unevenness of the total high-employment saving line is due almost entirely to fluctuations in the high-employment Federal surplus. This reflects the major changes in fiscal policy during the post-1957 period. The dip in is a result of vigorous fiscal measures to stimulate recovery from recession ; the steep rise in and marks an extremely restrictive fiscal policy. This rise is reversed in and early reflecting expenditure measures taken by the Kennedy Administration to stimulate recovery and strengthen defense as well as the depreciation reform and investment tax credit. The line turns up sharply late in as a result of leveling expenditures. The Revenue Act of shows up in a sharp decline in saving as do the late excise tax reduction social insurance liberalization and step-up in defense purchases These fiscal measures have brought total high-employment saving down from excessive levels. Equally important they have had a decisive impact on the investment side of the balance. Investment demand looked particularly weak in and and there were doubts that it could reach the range of * /2 to percent of GNP even at high employment. In that event sizable and persistent Government deficits would have been required to achieve high employment. But the experience of the past years has refuted these pessimistic assessments of the strength of private demand With stronger consumer markets and higher after-tax profits business fixed investment has broken out of its earlier lethargy. Balance was restored in between private investment and private high-employment saving demonstrating that high employment was in fact achievable without substantial permanent Government deficits FINANCING BALANCED EXPANSION The availability and cost of credit significantly influence spending. Stable prosperity must have a sound underpinning of credit. And the appropriate growth of credit is an important element in the over-all balance of the economy The appropriate amount of credit expansion depends on a variety of factors including ( ) the balance between total demand and potential output in the economy with proper allowance for the role of fiscal policy ; ( ) the structure and position of financial institutions ; and ( ) the ability of borrowers to absorb further debt. Only from an over-all view of the needs of the economy can the appropriate growth of credit and the appropriate role of monetary policy be evaluated The Federal Reserve System exerts a major influence on the cost of credit and the rate of growth of credit from all financial institutions The reserve credit it supplies is particularly significant because it provides the base for a multiple expansion in commercial bank credit to borrowers thereby affecting all credit markets. Reserve credit is the keystone of the system although it is only a small portion of total credit. It rose by only $ billion in compared with almost $ billion of funds supplied by financial institutions as intermediaries and the total of almost $ billion raised in all credit markets PATTERN OF CREDIT FLOWS AND THE DEMAND FOR FUNDS The flow of funds through financial markets accelerates when the pace of economic activity is stepped up. The similarity in the behavior of credit flows between the current upswing and the two weaker preceding expansions is striking. In however total credit flows to private domestic sectors rose somewhat faster relative to GNP than in earlier periods of prosperity primarily in response to the growing external financing needs of businesses ( Table ) TABLE Net funds raised by private domestic nonfinancial sectors Types of credit as percent of funds raisedl Period Net funds raised a s percent of GNP i Consumer credit State Bank and local loans to government business obligations Corporate securities Home mortgages3 Expansion years : * ( ) Downturn or early recovery years : Net funds raised by private domestic nonfinancial sectors include in addition to types of credit shown here mortgages on multi-family dwellings and on farm and commercial land and buildings ; and acceptances commercial and finance company paper and Commodity Credit Corporation ( CCC ) loans Bank loans to nonfinancial business not classified elsewhere Mortgages on one- to four-family homes Preliminary estimates Loans were less than $ million NOTE. Data are based on flow of funds accounts Source : Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System The composition of borrowing during the current expansion has also been similar to that of other recent expansions although the sources of funds have differed. Consumer credit and bank loans to business have risen substantially relative to other types of borrowing. When employment and income are high a larger proportion of households ' income typically is spent for durable goods and housing which are likely to be financed by credit The share of GNP going into inventories and plant and equipment also rises spurring business borrowing particularly from banks Households Borrowing by households has been rising significantly since the end of As a proportion of disposable personal income however it reached a peak of percent in ; this figure had been surpassed only in and Since the proportion has edged down to about percent. Nevertheless borrowing remains large relative to consumers ' " capital " expenditures. Even though there has been a rapid advance in ^ ( consumer expenditures on durable goods total household expenditures for durable goods plus home construction have been smaller relative to disposable income than in previous expansions since the Korean war Households have simultaneously stepped up their borrowing and the growth of their financial assets. Households ' financial assets have grown annually by to percent of disposable income since compared with slightly below percent in Higher incomes have made more households both creditworthy and able to save. Moreover the growing importance of contractual saving through insurance and pension funds has often led even the same households to add both to their financial assets and to their liabilities Business While borrowing by households and State and local governments maintained a fairly rapid pace in it was the financial demands of businesses which accounted for the acceleration in credit flows. Last year business capital expenditures significantly outpaced the strong rise in gross retained earnings and the ratio of capital outlays to retained earnings rose abruptly. Indeed it exceeded the ratio for all years in the post-Korean period except External financing however rose even more sharply reaching a new high relative to gross retained earnings that surpassed even the relationship. This strong rise is partly attributable to the growing volume of funds committed by corporations to uses other than capital outlays. In the past years corporations have markedly increased their net extensions of trade and consumer credit. Meanwhile corporate holdings of liquid assets have declined steadily as a proportion of their financial assets Consequently corporations are now less able to economize on liquid assets in order to provide for other uses of funds A number of special factors in also contributed to the sharp increase in business borrowing. Inventories were rising rapidly and foreign investment by corporations was unusually high early in the year All in all the volume of borrowing was not significantly out of line with past experience. Furthermore the total demand for goods and services supported in part by the expansion of credit was in good balance with the supply capabilities of the economy in POSITION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS Sustainable growth of credit depends on the sound operation of financial institutions. As new types of financial " intermediation " evolve to meet new needs more lending and institutional saving will take place. Such credit growth will occur smoothly if financial institutions adjust to innovations without assuming dangerous risks During the current expansion the most striking institutional change in the financial area has been the rapidly growing role of commercial banks Total bank credit has risen at an average rate of 8/2 percent a year since the end of I960 while total credit to nonfinancial sectors of the economy has risen by percent a year. Commercial banks have accounted for over one-third of total funds raised in credit markets during recent years in contrast to the one-sixth share in earlier post-Korean periods of prosperity. The larger proportion of credit flowing through the commercial banking system has resulted from various influences : first a sequence of increases in the ceiling rates of interest permissible on time and savings deposits which has enabled the commercial banks to compete more aggressively for deposits and thus to expand their lending ; second the greatly expanding scope of bank lending and investment practices ; and third the more liberal policy pursued by the Federal Reserve System in supplying bank reserves Much of the recent growth of bank deposits has taken the form of time certificates of deposit. Another sizable increase in such certificates and in commercial bank lending can reasonably be expected in the early part of this year in response to the increase last December in the maximum permissible interest on time deposits. Nevertheless banks which have expanded lending greatly on the basis of short-term certificates of deposit have at times found it costly to raise needed funds when the certificates mature in quantity. This experience should introduce more caution in the pursuit of new business Savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks have borne the brunt of competition from commercial banks. Meanwhile the demand for mortgages in which such institutions customarily place most of their funds has grown less rapidly than other types of credit and yields on mortgages showed little change during most of the 's. Consequently some savings institutions eager for growth have sought higher yielding and occasionally more risky outlets for investment while repeatedly raising their dividend or deposit rates. In order to prevent the assumption of excessive risk by savings and loan associations the Federal Home Loan Bank Board strengthened its surveillance and issued several new selective regulations in the past year The President 's current legislative program includes proposals to reform the structure of financial regulations to give regulatory agencies a greater variety of enforcement powers and to increase deposit insurance coverage This important legislation includes proposals that will make regulations over various types of financial institutions more consistent with each other thus fostering competition while providing the authority to curb speculative excesses. These same objectives have prompted legislative recommendations to allow Federal chartering of mutual savings banks for the first time POSITION OF BORROWERS Rapid growth in borrowing by households and businesses relative to their incomes raises the question whether still more debt can be readily absorbed without threatening an abrupt cutback in future spending. Danger signals are commonly sought in three basic types of indicators : growth of the ratio of debt repayment to income or of total debt to total assets ; growth of " easier " credit terms such as smaller downpayments longer maturities or higher appraisal values ; and growth of certain losses such as foreclosures or defaults The ratios of household debt repayments or income commitments to disposable personal income have risen over the past years ( Table ) TABLE Relation of selected commitments of the household sector to disposable personal income Percent of disposable personal income Year Repayments of instalment and mortgage debt Basic fixed commitments i _ ._ ._ _ _ _ _ ___ _ _ _ _ Basic fixed commitments and essential2 outlays Repayments of instalment debt Consists of repayments of instalment and mortgage debt tenant rent and property taxes on households Essential outlays consist of consumer outlays for food clothing utilities and local public transportation Based on first quarters * Not available Sources : Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Department of Commerce National Industrial Conference Board and Council of Economic Advisers Most of the rise is accounted for however by widening use of instalment credit rather than the rise in the average repayment burden for families using credit. Almost one-fourth more families particularly young parents are now using instalment credit. Debt repayment however is only one type of commitment undertaken by households. Whether households are overextending themselves must be viewed in terms of a broader concept of commitments including other contractual obligations and essential consumer outlays. When viewed in this way the measure of " burden " has been roughly stable. Certain claims on income substitute for others : mortgage payments for rent and automobile payments for some purchased transportation Use of aggregate ratios can hide distributional problems. Surveys suggest that families which have a relatively small amount of liquid assets account for a large proportion of the instalment debt outstanding ; their creditworthiness is established by their earnings rather than their accumu- lated assets. However there was a slight decline from to in the proportion of families which have as much as percent of their disposable income committed to instalment debt repayments " Easier " terms of credit may be either a warning signal of excessive credit expansion or a welcome evolution. The widening availability of credit has been a key feature of American financial development over the long run Certain types of lending that were once considered " risky " such as consumer instalment credit have proven to be quite sound and profitable Other such innovations have come at a rapid pace in recent years Delinquency rates on consumer credit have varied in the post-Korean period mainly reflecting fluctuations in economic activity but they have remained consistently well below their level In contrast the rate of mortgage foreclosures has shown a distinct upward trend during the past years. From World War II through the Korean war the inflation of real estate values bailed out poor credit risks and held down mortgage defaults. Subsequently foreclosures on conventional mortgages began to rise but they have increased only slightly since Much of the uptrend in the over-all foreclosure rate since has taken place in Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) insured mortgages which had been written with unusually liberal terms. Thus FHA procedures and regulations have recently been tightened. By any reasonable criterion today 's over-all foreclosure rate on home mortgages about l /<z percent a year is not out of line with the risk premium that such assets carry Nevertheless a sharp drop in incomes could certainly have unfavorable financial repercussions. Despite the strong position of financial institutions and the insurance of various types of deposits and mortgages the quantity of outstanding credit is an element increasing the economy 's vulnerability to cumulative declines if aggregate demand is permitted to collapse. Welltimed fiscal and monetary policies to maintain economic stability hence become even more important MONETARY POLICY The growth of total credit in the current expansion has contributed to the improved balance between total spending and potential output. Until mid-1965 the cost and availability of credit remained unusually stable for a period of strong advance in economic activity. The increase in the discount rate announced last December was the first monetary policy action aimed specifically at domestic credit flows Previous movements toward less ease in monetary policy had been directed primarily toward restraining the flow of funds abroad for balance of payments reasons. The discount rate increase in November was aimed at forestalling outflows of short-term capital threatened by an increase in the British Bank rate. Reserve availability was again reduced after new balance of payments measures were announced last February ( Chart ) Following this move free reserves remained almost continuously in the Chart Free Reserves MILLIONS OF D O L L A R S ^ J/AVERAGE OF DAILY FREE RESERVES OF MEMBER BANKS ( EXCESS RESERVES LESS BORROWINGS ) SOURCE : BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM negative range ( i.e. borrowings from the Federal Reserve System exceeded member bank holdings of excess reserves ) From October to the end of Treasury bill rates rose by nearly percentage point almost equaling the total rise in the discount rate. Moreover in long-term interest rates turned up after a period of remarkable stability ( Chart ) Yields on newly issued corporate and State and local bonds began to rise in the first quarter of the year as the volume of new issues expanded rapidly relative to the supply of funds. Short-term funds remained readily available during the spring and summer buttressed by the exceptionally large cash flow to particular industries ( such as automobiles and steel ) early in the year by funds repatriated from abroad in connection with the new balance of payments measures and by net repayments of Treasury debt during this period. After mid-summer however these funds had largely been absorbed and virtually all interest rates began to rise more substantially. Expectations were buoyant corpoxate security flotations began to grow again and the Treasury became a net borrower Furthermore despite a rapid growth of total bank credit and of deposits at commercial banks ( Table ) rising interest rates reflected both surging credit demands and firmer monetary policy. During and most of the reserves needed by the commercial banking system to meet credit demands were supplied through the open market operations of the Federal Chart Selected Interest Rates PERCENT CONVENTIONAL MORTGAGES ON HOMESy t 3-MONTH TREASURY BILLS I I I I | | | | | | | | 1/SERIES BEGINS IN NEW AND EXISTING HOMES THROUGH I AND NEW HOMES ONLY THEREAFTER NOTE : VERTICAL LINES SHOW GNP PEAK QUARTERS : III AND I SOURCES : FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM MOODY 'S INVESTORS SERVICE AND STANDARD & POOR 'S CORPORATION TABLE Changes in commercial bank credit money supply and time deposits [ Based on seasonally adjusted data ] Percentage change ( annual rate ) during Item Yeari Commercial bank loans ( excluding interbank ) and investments II III IV Investments : U.S. Government securitiesOther securities Loans ( excluding interbank ) _ Money supply and time deposits Money supply Time deposits Preliminary Changes based on averages of daily figures for last month in period Currency outside banks and demand deposits * Time deposits at all commercial banks Source : Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Reserve System. During the first three quarters of however open market operations supplied a smaller proportion of the growth in banks ' required reserves resulting in slower growth of nonborrowed reserves More reserve needs were met by borrowing at the discount window Reduced availability of reserves tended to moderate the growth of bank credit THE CURRENT FISCAL PROGRAM The strong advance of the economy over the past years is reflected in a remarkable rebound of Federal revenues following the tax reduction. From the close of to the final quarter of Federal revenues advanced by about $ billion ; yet during this period tax reductions of $ billion had taken effect through the Revenue Act of and the Excise Tax Reduction Act of As Federal expenditures grew very modestly in and early the budget on the national income accounts basis swung quickly into balance and showed a surplus exceeding $ / billion in the first half of Its subsequent retreat to a $ * /2 billion deficit in the second half of the year resulted from several important deliberate stimulative measures plus the unforeseen rise in defense spending THE IMPACT OF BUDGET ACTIONS The President proposed excise tax reduction in last January 's budget ; his specific recommendations were submitted to the Congress in May and the legislation was enacted month later. The final act called for $ billion of reductions in several stages extending to The first stage took effect immediately in mid-June and reduced taxes by $ % billion ( annual rate ) mostly on consumer durable goods In line with recommendations by the President the Social Security Act was amended by the Congress last July. In addition to the initiation of medical insurance for the aged which will take effect this July and increased payroll tax rates effective January the legislation provides for increased old-age benefits which were made effective retroactively to January The retroactive portion of increased benefits amounting to $ million was disbursed in September. The liberalization raised transfer payments thereafter by more than $ billion annually Furthermore once payments on tax liabilities were completed last spring a final dividend of personal tax reduction provided by the Revenue Act of helped to lift disposable income in the second half of These measures together with the unexpectedly strong rise of Federal purchases provided expansionary actions totaling $ ^ billion ( annual rate ) in the second half of With normal semiannual revenue growth of a little more than $ ^ billion at high employment there was a net fiscal stimulus of about $ billion in the second half of Scheduled tax changes are having a marked restrictive fiscal impact in the first half of as the rise in payroll taxes of nearly $ billion far outweighs the expansionary influence of the $ ^ billion " second-stage " of excise cuts that took effect at the start of On the other hand further increases in defense expenditures will be stimulating the economy in this period and will continue to do so throughout the next months. The combined effect of budgeted expenditures including the benefits that will begin under hospital insurance in July and tax laws now in effect would be more stimulative than now seems appropriate for the period ahead FISCAL PLANS FOR The objective of promoting balance between over-all demand and productive capacity pointed to tax cuts in recent years when demand was inadequate. That same criterion now calls for tax action to moderate the growth of private spending. In line with these principles the President has asked the Congress to enact promptly four measures affecting tax payments The first of these would reform the withholding system for individual income taxes and place the income tax more firmly on a " pay-as-you-go " basis. The present system with a single percent rate overwithholds from some low-income individuals and underwithholds from many other taxpayers requiring large final settlements the following year. The proposed graduated rate schedule and other modifications will reduce both underwithholding and overwithholding. Once in effect the new system will siphon off $ billion ( annual rate ) from disposable income for the rest of The second proposal would place corporate tax payments also on a more nearly current basis. Under present law corporations with tax liabilities exceeding $ are scheduled to pay only percent of the estimated tax due on incomes by the end of the calendar year with the remaining percent not paid until the first half of There is already a formula under existing law that would move corporations to a current basis by It is now proposed to accelerate this step-up to achieve current payment status within This action would increase cash payments to the Treasury by an estimated $ billion this spring and $ billion in the spring of reducing the carry-over of unpaid liabilities into and by comparable amounts The rescheduling of corporate tax payments will not add to final tax liabilities nor will it alter after-tax profits in either business or national income accounting. It will nonetheless reduce the availability of internal funds for investment and should thus have a moderating influence on investment demands particularly in the light of firmer credit conditions A third proposal to put tax payments on a more current basis affects the social security taxes of the self-employed. It calls for quarterly declarations paralleling those of the individual income tax instead of a single large pay- ment at year end. It also more nearly parallels the treatment of wage earners whose social security taxes are collected on a current basis through withholding. The proposal would increase revenues by $ million in each of the fiscal years and It will reduce disposable income by $ million ( annual rate ) in the second half of this calendar year The fourth proposal affects excise taxes. In view of the large revenue involved in the excise taxes on automobiles and telephone service they were scheduled to be cut gradually in the Excise Tax Reduction Act of The Congress is being asked to reschedule the reduction to meet current economic needs. Each step in the present timetable commencing with the January instalment would be shifted forward years The reinstatement will restore $ billion of revenues and the postponement of the scheduled January cuts will avoid a further revenue drop of $ billion next year With these measures both the actual and high-employment budgets on the national income accounts basis are expected to be approximately in balance in fiscal Over the full budget planning period to the first half of Federal expenditures are estimated to rise about $ * billion from their level in the second half of The increase includes $ billion in defense purchases $ * /i billion in transfers and $ billion in grants to States and localities. Normal revenue growth at high employment will total about $ ^ billion over this period. Meanwhile tax measures that have already been enacted and those now proposed will result in a net addition of $ billion to Federal revenues The aim of fiscal policies in the next months is to preserve the sound expansion enjoyed in to maintain a strong and healthy prosperity ; to promote a cautious movement toward lower unemployment without moving so far or so fast that bottlenecks and inflationary pressures arise THE OUTLOOK FOR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY In the light of the fiscal program outlined above GNP for is expected to be within a $ billion range centered on $ billion given the $ billion level now estimated for At the midpoint of this range the advance would be $ 5/2 billion virtually identical with the gain scored in No major departure is expected from the percent increase of over-all prices in as explained in Chapter Thus total real output should advance by nearly percent in Civilian employment which rose by million persons in should register a similar large increase this year. In addition the armed services will expand by On the other hand the total labor force will rise strongly. The unemployment rate which averaged percent in should decline this year to about % percent the lowest rate since GAINS BY SECTOR While strong demands will be characteristic of most sectors of the economy defense spending and business fixed investment will provide the major thrust to over-all demand. The special implications of these sectors are explored in more detail below. In brief the increase in Federal purchases made necessary by the Vietnam situation will deliver a major stimulus to the economy accounting for most of the prospective $ billion rise in total Federal purchases. Business expenditures for fixed investment will rise strongly again in although the advance is not expected to match the I55/2 percent increase of last year. According to present indications capital outlays are likely to exceed the total by about $ billion State and Local Government State and local government purchases a particularly reliable component of GNP are expected to rise by about $ billion continuing their recent trend. They will receive continuing support from growing Federal grants that meet pressing needs for public services Inventories Last year 's inventory investment of $ billion ( prices ) was in line with the real growth of $ billion in final sales Still irregular and special factors in the automobile and steel industries added a little on balance to inventory investment last year. In the absence of such special influences a fractional decline from last year 's rate is probable in Homebuilding The fundamental demographic factors influencing residential construction will not change significantly in : the increase in the number of households is expected to be about the same as the average. Financing conditions may be less favorable since conventional mortgage rates began to rise last September for the first time in years and some further increases appear possible. On the other hand the excess supplies of new housing in selected areas seem to be dwindling. On balance the value of residential construction is likely to change little in Consumption Consumer outlays depend primarily on the growth of disposable income Unlike and tax reductions and increases in transfer payments will provide no net stimulus to consumer incomes this year. Between and cuts in personal income taxes added about $ billion directly to consumer take-home pay and government transfer payments increased by nearly $ billion. This year transfer payments are expected to rise strongly paced by the launching of the hospital insurance program. However social insurance taxes are higher the new withholding system will moderate the growth of after-tax income and the second stage of excise reduction will be adding very little to household purchasing power once the President 's proposals are enacted. Nevertheless rapid gains can be expected in disposable income this year owing to strong increases in wages and salaries interest dividends and self-employment incomes Little change in the personal saving rate is anticipated for The saving rate of percent in was close to the average of recent years Consumer confidence and spending intentions remain high. Allocation of income among various types of consumer goods may shift moderately. The fraction of disposable income spent on automobiles and parts may decline somewhat from the exceptionally high percent in ( which included purchases deferred by the late-1964 strike ) Prospects seem particularly bright however for durable goods other than cars ; color television sets are a notable example. Sales of nondurable goods other than food should also rise strongly and continue to reflect upgrading of quality In sum consumer expenditures are expected to account for about percent of the rise in GNP this year compared with their percent share in the advance KEY ROLE OF BUSINESS FIXED INVESTMENT This year business fixed investment is again expected to be one of the two major expansionary forces in the economy. After years of rapid increases it reached 10J/2 percent of GNP late in This surge followed a period of weak investment dating from and extending into the early years of the current expansion. The proportion of GNP devoted to nonresidential fixed investment averaged only percent from to well below the percent average during the preceding decade Major Determinants The revival of fixed investment in the past years can be traced to improvements in three major determinants of investment demand. First the economic expansion has raised final demands relative to the stock of productive facilities. In manufacturing for example percent of capacity was utilized in in contrast to an average of percent in the preceding years. To avoid bottlenecks delays and lost sales businessmen now have the incentive to build capacity in advance of rising demand. Second the generation of internal funds through profits and depreciation has facilitated corporate financing while monetary policy has enabled external financing needs to be satisfied readily. Third the anticipated future returns from investment have been enhanced by the prospect of continuing economic expansion and by the investment tax credit the liberalized depreciation rules and the lowered corporate income tax rates This year financing conditions may be less favorable after-tax profits are unlikely to repeat last year 's exceptional percent spurt and available internal funds will be held down by the new corporate payments schedule Nevertheless the major determinants of investment spending suggest that capital outlays should rise strongly again in According to the investment anticipations reported in the Government survey last November the annual rate of plant and equipment spending by nonagricultural businesses in the first half of will exceed the full-year level by $ billion or by l/i percent. The rise is expected to continue in the second half of the year. Nonresidential fixed investment for the entire year will probably be slightly above 10/ percent of GNP Longer-Term Prospects The current strength of investment demand provides new evidence and at the same time raises new issues concerning the longer-term prospects for capital outlays. Nagging doubts about a possible secular weakening of capital spending have now been resolved. Yet it is obvious that business fixed investment can not continuously grow twice as fast as GNP as it did in and and that it can not always be a propelling sector of demand Nor is it certain that the economy can regularly maintain the current 10J/2 percent investment share at full employment a share which matches the postwar peak Some of the current strength in investment demand may represent a catching-up after a period marked by slow growth of plant and equipment capacity and by aging of the capital stock. From to manufacturing capacity grew less than 3J/2 percent a year. This kept pace with actual manufacturing output but was considerably less than the normal full-employment growth of manufacturing output. As the economy returns to full employment additional capital facilities are needed to complement higher employment and output. The same catching-up process occurs in the modernization of the capital stock. Prolonged economic slack leaves the Nation with older productive facilities. Because the Great Depression and World War II reduced investment drastically the average age of capital rose from about years in the mid-1920 's to over years by the end of Rapid investment during the first postwar decade reduced the average age of the capital stock to years by This trend was subsequently altered by the sluggish pace of investment. Now however businessmen have stronger incentives to make up for lost time in their pursuit of modernization programs Even after catching-up is finished several factors are likely to be working to strengthen investment demand. A higher prospective return can stimulate " capital deepening " i.e. investment that provides each worker with more capital. Profitability will be higher owing to the investment tax credit and lower corporate income tax rates as well as improved prospects for sustained full utilization. Some cost-cutting investments which would not have been profitable in the past may now yield an expected after-tax return high enough to justify the required outlay In addition a more rapidly growing labor force can add to investment demand providing full employment is maintained. In that event unless capital is expanded more rapidly each worker would have fewer tools Businessmen will find it profitable to equip the additional workers. If businessmen respond fully the extra growth of capital stock will match the additional growth of employment. Over the remaining years of the 's the labor force is expected to grow about one-half of percent faster on average than its yearly growth rate of percent in the past decade Adding an extra percent to employment in any year and providing the new workers with the usual amount of equipment and facilities would require a matching percent increment to the capital stock. It would take an addition of about percent to the current annual total of investment to provide that extra capital To be sure the possibility can not be ruled out that a part of the strength of current investment might be associated with overly optimistic expectations by some businessmen. Errors can be made in investment decisions because such decisions are necessarily forward looking and based on anticipations of future profits and sales. On the other hand market experience does provide incentives and information about recent and prospective developments. And businessmen have increasingly used scientific techniques to rationalize their capital budgets. Business investment programs in the past years seem to have added to capital in the right places and in appropriate amounts as discussed in Chapter Programs planned for should continue these trends THE IMPACT OF DEFENSE National defense outlays will be the other major expansionary force this year. The upward movement in defense spending alters a pattern of stability maintained from mid-1962 into During that period the national defense establishment was considerably modernized and better equipped ; yet over-all defense expenditures were stable or declining. Since the economy was expanding rapidly the percentage of GNP channeled into defense purchases declined from in to in the first half of We are not now engaged in wartime mobilization nor entering such a mobilization period. The present defense buildup is vastly different in size from the mobilizations at the outset of World War II or the Korean conflict. When the United States entered World War II it had to build a military establishment almost from scratch ; and the Korean war followed a period of rather thorough demobilization and de-emphasis of defense. In both cases the outbreak of hostilities required a fundamental reevaluation of the country 's defense posture leading to vast increases in expenditures Ever since the Korean war the United States has given greater attention to the requirements of military preparedness in an uneasy world. After Korea defense expenditures dropped sharply from their peak rate of nearly $ billion but they have never fallen below $ billion. In contrast they had totaled $ billion in Since the country has invested mightily in defense ; it has continually rolled over its stock of defense goods and equipment to take advantage of new developments in weapons systems and has maintained general purpose defense capabilities. The Vietnam conflict therefore finds us well prepared. The procurement and personnel increases are modest by earlier standards and by comparison with total supply capabilities The percentage increase in defense expenditures this year will slightly exceed that in over-all national output. Defense purchases of goods and services which were percent of GNP in the fiscal year ended June are expected to average percent in both fiscal and fiscal ( Table ) This contrasts markedly with the buildup after the outbreak of T A B L E Defense impact in relation to GNP Korean war period and current period Budget expenditures for national defense ( billions of dollars ) Period and fiscal year Korean war period : Current period : i Federal purchases of goods and services for national defense Amount Percent ( billions of dollars ) of GNP Estimates Sources : Bureau of the Budget Department of Commerce and Council of Economic Advisers the Korean war when defense outlays more than tripled in years and rose from under percent of GNP in fiscal to over percent in fiscal The increase in purchases for defense of $ billion this calendar year represents nearly percent of the increase in GNP. These outlays will exert a broad fiscal stimulus. Indeed because they directly and immediately add to GNP defense purchases tend to have a somewhat larger and more rapid economic effect than a tax reduction ( or increase in transfers ) of the same size which must be respent before it can stimulate production. Although not as general as most tax cuts would be even the direct impact of defense is felt throughout the economy. This is evident in the distribution of added defense expenditures among various types of products. About percent of the step-up in defense expenditures for is for direct personnel costs pay and allowances of the increased number of military and civilian personnel. An additional percent of the total increase is for training food lodging clothing and transportation costs directly associated with the increased manpower. Another percent represents gasoline ammunition ordnance and similar mass-produced production-line items. A further percent can be attributed to large sophisticated weapons systems such as aircraft ships and missiles Defense procurement by itself will not be placing extreme demands on particular industries although textiles and selected other industries receiving increased defense orders are already experiencing high operating rates as a result of buoyant private demand The present Defense Materials System which has been in effect since the end of the Korean war will continue to deal with allocation problems It gives priority to defense and defense-related orders in the event of any conflict with civilian orders for the same materials or for use of industrial capacity and allots certain categories of controlled materials on the basis of priority. With the economy operating considerably below capacity these priorities and allocations have been routinely executed in the past without bumping private demands to any noticeable extent. With operating rates now higher than before there may be some cases where the execution of civilian orders will be somewhat delayed. However these will be exceptional and will not be such as to require alteration in our present machinery for materials priorities and allocations THE NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY Economic policy for is guided by a thorough and realistic assessment of the outlook for the economy and by the objective of maintaining a well-paced advance. Fiscal policies for have been fashioned in the light of an evaluation of both the strength of private demand and the moderating influence of monetary policy. Clearly fiscal and monetary policies must be closely coordinated and effective coordination has prevailed in the past years. The Administration regretted that the discount rate increase last December interrupted that pattern. Consultations between the Federal Reserve and the Administration continue helping to assure that monetary and fiscal policy together will provide appropriately for sustained and balanced expansion. Both are keenly aware of uncertainties in the outlook and are prepared to respond to emerging developments CONTINGENCIES IN This year the economy will be moving into new territory as rates of unemployment reach the lowest levels in more than a decade. While prospects are excellent that this course can be safely traversed there can be no certainty. The defense program introduces an especially important set of uncertainties into the outlook. The budget is based upon a careful judg- ment of the defense requirements imposed by our commitments in Vietnam and throughout the world. Nevertheless these requirements could change in the year ahead in either direction. Finally private demand is a constant source of uncertainty. Its particular strength in was a surprise This buoyancy has been recognized in the forecast for but the accuracy of such an evaluation can not be guaranteed In considering these uncertainties it is important to appreciate the internal resistance of the economy to disturbances as reflected in the record of recent years. To be sure the economy can be pushed into boom or recession by sufficiently potent forces. But it is a mistake to view the path of economic activity as a tightrope from which one false step would mean spiralling inflation or cumulative contraction. One important sector of the economy residential construction lagged behind during most of and again during much of ; nevertheless its sluggishness was barely noticeable in the aggregate pattern of activity. The strikes in the automobile industry in the fourth quarter of left a clear mark on the output of that quarter but had no lasting effect on the vigor of expansion Nor did the recent strong buildup and subsequent absorption of steel inventories disturb the over-all pace of economic activity Production and employment have shown stability in the face of volatile movements in financial markets. The sharp plunge of stock prices in the late spring of presumably was associated with a marked shift in investors ' sentiment ; yet spending for goods and services by consumers and business remained remarkably unaffected by the gyration Perhaps the clearest recent example of the economy 's inherent stability was its response to the deliberate stimulus of tax reduction. The tax cut was indeed massive but the response was gradual and the effect in lifting national output was spaced out over many quarters. Meanwhile labor markets adapted and investment responded to create new capacity which permitted a remarkably balanced noninflationary advance While the economy 's own adaptation is the first line of defense economic policy has a major role to play in countering disturbances. The program outlined earlier in this chapter is designed to meet the prospective needs of the Nation. But major changes in the outlook during the year could require new actions by the Administration the Congress and the Federal Reserve System. If military needs should prove to be larger than is anticipated in the fiscal budget or if private expenditures should advance sharply so as to endanger price stability further fiscal or monetary restraints would be necessary to prevent the rise in total demand from outpacing the growth in productive capacity. The President has indicated that he will not hesitate to recommend further tax increases in such circumstances On the other hand a peaceful conclusion of the Vietnam hostilities could point to a reversal of policy actions premised on rising military spending It would offer the welcome opportunity to encourage private expenditures 6i O by reducing taxes once again or to add to high-priority Federal expenditures for civilian programs now limited by defense requirements. It could also point toward easing monetary policy LONGER-RUN OUTLOOK In the longer run defense will not continue to contribute as strongly to aggregate demand as in The current defense buildup meets an exceptional need and will be reversed as soon as reduction of world tension permits. In the years ahead moreover investment will certainly not rise consistently as fast as it will this year. It may even decline as a proportion of GNP. Yet the factors determining investment do not point to a slump in capital outlays provided that alert policies preserve the general health of the economy Shifting patterns of defense and capital outlays need not throw the economy off its track. The maintenance of steady advance at full employment does not require a growth of demand as strong as that needed to eliminate slack. The economy would face serious inflation if such strong expansionary pressures continued for very long. But continual growth of demand is needed to maintain balance with potential output. Strength in other types of spending will be required to lead that growth in the future New sources of strength may be generated elsewhere within the private economy. In particular later in this decade more vigor can be expected from residential construction an important component of private investment which for demographic and temporary reasons has been conspicuously lagging. Moreover if additional demand is needed fiscal policy can help through new or expanded productive civilian programs or through tax reduction to support consumer purchasing power The prospects for sustained expansion thus continue to be favorable for the longer run. Even so our ability to counter recession can and should be improved. Long-needed reforms in the unemployment insurance system are one important step that should be taken this year. There is also a good opportunity now to intensify discussion and study of the type of tax action which could best combat the threat of recession. A social consensus on this issue would help to avoid prolonged debate in a time of urgency Both in meeting surprises and in laying systematic plans the lessons learned in the last years will remain relevant. The American economy has demonstrated its capacity for strong growth and its ability to move steadily ahead as long as a reasonable balance between total supply and over-all demand is maintained. The promotion of such a balance will remain the basic task of domestic fiscal and monetary policies Chapter Prospects for Cost-Price Stability A S THE ECONOMY enters its sixth year of uninterrupted expansion * ^ * and its third successive year of high growth the gap between potential and actual production is fast disappearing. Unemployment is near percent and operating rates in many industries are moving close to preferred rates. The past years have demonstrated that the economy can operate free of recurrent recession. Now the United States is entering a period that will test whether sustained full utilization of our human and physical resources is possible without the injustice dislocation and decline in competitive position that accompany inflation History alone is not reassuring. Still there are sound reasons for confidence that a higher degree of cost and price stability can be achieved at high employment than during previous such periods since World War II The pattern of economic activity shows superior balance. Productivity gains are larger and more extended. Private attitudes in key wage and price decisions are considerably more responsible. New competition from abroad reinforces keen domestic competition for markets and new policies of active manpower development are permitting the fuller use of our human resources If both full employment and price stability can be maintained the United States will enjoy continuing real growth that will provide abundant resources to meet simultaneously the demands of national security and of domestic welfare. The last few years have shown what the American economy can do when its progress is free of interruption. Incomes from wages and profits have leaped ahead. With over-all unemployment down sharply the disadvantaged groups that suffered most during the period of slower growth are improving their positions. If the economy remains on its path of balanced growth it will be an engine of great social progress and together with the Great Society programs will move us steadily closer to our ideals. But only if inflation can be avoided will prosperity be sustainable and the economy achieve its full promise DETERMINATION OF THE PRICE LEVEL The relation between the volume of economic activity and the price level is not simple. As a first approximation the classical law of supply and demand leads one to expect that the change in the price level will depend mainly on the size of the gap between capacity and actual output. The more production falls short of potential i.e. the greater is excess productive capacity the further prices should drop. Conversely when demand outruns aggregate supply the imbalance should raise prices. History shows that things are rather more complicated. For example the second half of was a period when there was no gap between potential production and actual production yet the GNP deflator our most comprehensive indicator of the price level rose little. In and when the gap was beginning to assume considerable size the GNP deflator rose substantially. The GNP deflator rose at a fairly steady and modest pace both in the years when the gap was large in and when it narrowed substantially from to Clearly more detailed analysis is necessary Some important components of the price level have risen continuously over the years particularly in construction services and Government Other components of the price level especially agricultural and some raw material prices are influenced by supply conditions which move relatively independently of the general economy The industrial component of the price level has proved to be most systematically responsive to the general degree of prosperity. But even industrial prices can not be accurately predicted by reference to levels of activity alone. For example industrial prices have been much more stable for any given degree of utilization of industrial capacity in the last years than in the preceding decade Industrial price movements are mainly determined by four elements : First prices move roughly parallel with the basic cost trends. This does not mean that the causation runs wholly from costs to prices. Both are subject to many common influences ; moreover prices directly influence costs because wage increases respond in part to price and profit levels. But clearly other things equal higher costs tend to raise prices Second the state of demand affects prices. When markets are weak and part of capacity is idle list prices are discounted and may even be lowered Delivery periods are shortened quality may be raised freight absorbed and other terms of the transaction changed. When markets become stronger business finds it easier to raise prices. Once shortages develop and industry is unable to keep shipments in pace with desired purchases the likelihood of price rises becomes very much greater Third the nature of the price-setting process of an industry can influence the price changes associated with any given set of cost and demand conditions. In highly concentrated industries where a few producers or a single price leader can determine prices the response may be quite different from that in an industry of many small firms where wholly impersonal market forces keep supply and demand in balance through price adjustments Differences are especially great in bad times. In competitive industries prices are likely to fall ; in concentrated industries production is more likely to be cut back with only limited price adjustments. When markets are roughly in balance the sequence and magnitude of price changes is less predictable. What happens in the more concentrated industries depends on the price policies followed by the principal producers. The Government 's price guidepost is an attempt to avoid inflation resulting from industry 's use of discretionary pricing power Expectations and attitudes also affect actual price changes. An economy accustomed to price stability is less vulnerable to inflation. Price adjustments to changing conditions come more slowly and moderately and include both pluses and minuses. It is free of the inventory hoarding that adds to inflationary demands. And speculation in commodities does not raise raw material costs. Conversely when an inflationary psychology takes hold inventory hoarding and anticipatory placing of orders accentuate any market imbalances and further raise costs of production and distribution Finally in a mixed economy such as ours Government actions have an important effect on industrial prices. Fiscal policies help determine the over-all size of markets. The Government is the biggest customer for many industries and hence the largest single influence on demand. It also affects competitive conditions through tariff policies quotas and other forms of protection through regulatory policies stockpile and commodity stabilization policies and in other ways. If the objective of price stability is given recognition in the full range of economic policies prices will be more stable THE PRICE RECORD Our over-all price record during the present expansion has been remarkable unmatched by any industrialized nation. But during the record developed some blemishes ; prices as measured by any of the major indicators advanced more rapidly After increasing at an average annual rate of percent between and the GNP deflator rose by percent in The most prominent elements in this acceleration were more rapid increases in the deflators for construction nondurable goods and the Federal Government ( reflecting the large military pay increase in ) Consumer prices rose at an average annual rate of only percent a year from to but by percent in ( Chart ) Substantial advances in the prices of food apparel and footwear were mainly responsible for the faster rise. The reduction of excise taxes mitigated the increase of the index by percent The wholesale price index increased percent from to after years of stability ( Table and Chart ) Farm and food products accounted for over half of this increase. Industrial prices which had remained virtually constant from to moved up by percent last year.

The rise in prices of nonferrous metals reflected increases of world prices which do not influence adversely our competitive position. And the sharp rise in food prices in large part reflected production cycles in agricultural products SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE PRODUCT MARKETS The fiscal and monetary policies outlined in Chapter are intended to assure that total civilian and military purchases of goods and services do not exceed the economy 's ability to produce. But price pressures can also develop from imbalances within specific sectors. If prices do not fall in sectors where potential supply exceeds demand as readily as they increase where demand outruns supply imbalances in the composition of demand will raise the price level In recent years measures have been developed which can serve as rough indicators of the supply-demand relationships of specific industries OPERATING RATES OF INDUSTRIES Operating rates of industries are a direct measure of the relation between production based on current demand and the capacity to produce Although the concept of capacity is an elusive one most producers seem able to give it quantitative meaning and also to identify a rate of utilization of that capacity which is " preferred " presumably a level of operation which management feels can be sustained efficiently for an extended period Starting from a low of percent at the beginning of the expansion ( compared with an average preferred rate of percent ) the seasonally adjusted average rate of utilization of manufacturing capacity as measured by McGraw-Hill rose by points to percent at the end of During the following year a parallel growth of output and capacity kept utilization rates rather steady. In output began to rise faster raising average utilization to percent by the end of The strength of industrial investment in enabled capacity in manufacturing to increase by an estimated ^ percent. Manufacturers increased output dramatically without running into significant bottlenecks The average operating rate climbed to percent by the end of the year as the gain in the rate of output accelerated under the impetus of investment and military demand The pattern of investment last year contributed to the general balance between output and capacity. Of the four industries which were operating at or above their preferred rates in December two subsequently succeeded in building up their productive capacity by more than the growth of output ( Table ) Others which were operating below preferred rates at the end of added more slowly to capacity in so that they too came closer into balance In four industries high demand has raised production beyond preferred utilization rates. In three of these industries particularly large increases of investment are planned for the first quarter of TABLE Manufacturing capacity utilization j Output as percent of capacity * Industry December Total manufacturing Iron and steel Nonferrous metals Machinery Electrical machinery Autos trucks and parts Other transportation equipment Fabricated metals and instrumentsStone clay and glass Chemicals Paper and pulp Rubber Petroleum and coal products Food and beverages Textiles Miscellaneous manufacturing December Preferred rate ( percent ) Qfi VO o Qfi Data for except iron and steel from McGraw-Hill ; estimates for iron aud steel for and all industries for by Council of Economic Advisers after consultation with McGraw-Hill From McGraw-Hill survey of business plans for new plant and equipment April Not comparable with data in Table C-34 because of differences in methods of computation Sources : McGraw-Hill Publishing Company Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Council of Economic Advisers When the operating rate for all manufacturing averages ( say ) points below the preferred rate there will be less price pressure if each individual industry shows a similar 2-point gap between its actual and its preferred rates than if some are above preferred rates and some far below. While there are always some differences among industries the balance was unusually favorable in Sectoral balance can be measured by the weighted average of the absolute amounts by which the gap between each industry 's own operating rate and its own preferred rate exceeds the gap between the operating rate for all manufacturing and the preferred operating rate for all manufacturing. This average " excess gap " was percentage points in down from in In contrast the average " excess gap " was in reflecting the severe sectoral imbalance of that high employment year. Investment expected in will raise manufacturing capacity by about percent. This should keep the average operating rate essentially unchanged from The sectoral composition of rates should also continue in general balance For the nonmanufacturing sectors of the economy less information is available on capacity utilization. Indexes prepared at the University of Pennsylvania show that operating rates outside of manufacturing rose by to points in the last year as output rose substantially ( Table ) Output is expected to rise again considerably in but the anticipated high rates of investment should generate rapid growth of capacity as well TABLE Capacity utilization and change in output of selected industries Industry Capacity utilization ( percent ) Coal mining Metal mining Stone and earth minerals Electric utilities Gas utilities Services * Percentage increase in output to Output as percent of the trend line through peaks in output except for services Average of first quarters Average of available months in over average of equivalent period in Based on seasonally adjusted data Includes air and rail transport office space rental and residential housing.

Summers " An Index of Capacity Utilization in Service Industries " Wharton School of Finance * Not available Sources : Wharton School of Finance and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System BACKLOG OF ORDERS In those industries where production is based significantly on orders ( mainly durable goods industries ) the relation of orders to shipments provides further indication of the state of demand relative to supply in the market. Since producers wish to translate an irregular flow of orders into a smooth production schedule some backlog of orders is normal and desir- able. But when the ratio of unfilled orders to shipments increases rapidly it may indicate that demands are exceeding producers ' present supply capabilities or that buyers are placing orders for future delivery farther ahead During recent years the ratio of unfilled orders to shipments in the durable goods industries as a group has been roughly constant equal to a backlog of about months. In the two previous expansions the orders backlog was both substantially higher relative to sales and considerably less stable ( Chart ) The average backlog reached months in indicating the clear presence of excessive demand in some sectors Today there is only isolated evidence of undue buildups of orders. The absolute volume of unfilled orders has increased in almost every industry But the over-all increase in the backlog relative to shipments over the last months was moderate. Increases of up to month occurred last year in all durable goods industries except primary metals where the backlog declined by month reflecting the steel adjustment. In the expansion the backlog for the entire group of durable goods industries rose by as much as month in a 12-month period Chart Backlog of Manufacturers ' Unfilled Orders for Durable Goods in Three Postwar Expansions MONTHS OF BACKLOG I I I I !

BASED ON SEASONALLY ADJUSTED DATA ^ T R O U G H QUARTERS FOR GNP WERE I I I AND I SOURCES : DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS I I I In order backlogs are likely to increase somewhat further under the impetus of rising demand. But the rapid rise of capacity should generally permit shipments to respond to rising orders preventing the emergence of major price pressures from this source. However this indicator of demand pressures will need to be followed closely. Should order books lengthen substantially the efficient and moderate inventory policies that have kept orders at reasonable levels could be altered leading to imbalances in industrial markets SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE LABOR MARKETS Cost-price stability can not be achieved if the supply of labor is inadequate to allow production to respond freely to demand. When workers having the needed skills are readily available for employment industry is able to utilize its physical capacity fully and efficiently. When major labor shortages develop they may be translated into production bottlenecks that limit the supply of finished products and thereby result in demand pressure on prices. Alternatively or in addition tight labor markets put upward pressures on labor costs as unions press for excessive wage increases and employers bid against each other for the skills in short supply and as employers are forced to hire less qualified workers with resulting lower productivity The growth of the U.S. labor force has accelerated since From to the average annual increase was During the last years it averaged million and in the increase was million. This acceleration resulted mainly from the high birth rates following World War II and the increased participation of women in the labor force partly in response to more favorable job opportunities The employment gains of recent years have been large and widely distributed. Every labor force group has benefited from the sustained economic growth which has created an average of more than million additional jobs a year since During the past years especially large gains have been made by teenagers adult nonwhites the long-term unemployed and the unskilled. This pattern gives testimony not only to the power of high economic growth to bring benefits to inexperienced and disadvantaged workers but also to the ability of employers effectively to absorb such workers into productive employment. If this pattern can continue the supply of labor will be sufficient to meet manpower needs without serious bottlenecks The capacity of labor markets to adjust can be seen from a study of employment gains by occupation. In for example employment in professional and technical occupations rose by ; but in there had been only unemployed workers whose last employment was in these occupations. Since there was a reduction of unemployment of such workers of only between and a minimum of new professional and technical employees must have come from among new entrants into the labor force from upgrading or through hiring of unemployed whose last employment was in some other type of occupation. Similar comparisons can be made for other occupations Negroes and teenagers found better job opportunities as the labor market tightened ( Table ) When the job market was slack and output grew TABLE Changes in employment Type of change and period Total * Teenagers Nonwhites Adult whites Change in employment ( thousands of persons ) : Percentage change in employment : Percent of total employment change : Detail shown will not add to totals because of duplication ( nonwhites include some teenagers ) Data for are adjusted for comparability with data for NOTE. Teenagers include those years of age ; nonwhites years of age and over ; and white adults years and over Sources : Department of Labor and Council of Economic Advisers only enough to create jobs for the normal increase in the labor force adult whites secured the largest share of new jobs. But in when over-all employment increased by a very large percent nonwhite employment rose by percent and teenage employment increased by percent representing nearly one-third of the total additional employment These employment gains combined with the changes in the labor force resulted in an improvement in the pattern of unemployment. Unemployment rates for white teenagers fell despite the great influx of this group into the labor force and rates for nonwhite adults fell to percent by the end of Nonwhite teenagers were an exception ; their rates remained very high ( Table ) TABLE Unemployment rates for selected groups [ Percent ] Period Teenagers White Adults Nonwhite Women Men White Nonwhite Annual average : : IV i Based on seasonally adjusted data Sources : Department of Labor and Council of Economic Advisers OUTLOOK FOR LABOR MARKETS IN So far the ability of both workers and employers to adjust rapidly to changing economic conditions has permitted the economy to move toward full employment without experiencing significant labor shortages which could retard growth or endanger price stability As production has expanded and the hiring of certain skills has become more difficult managements have resorted to the normal procedures used in prosperity to economize on skilled labor : redesigning and subdividing of specific jobs ; upgrading of experienced employees to more skilled classifications ; intensifying on-the-job training for younger workers ; stepping up investment to modernize facilities ; wherever possible concentrating the increase of production in plants in areas of labor surplus ; hiring women for jobs usually filled by men ; recruiting workers abroad ; hiring students on a part-time basis ; and raising starting salaries According to data recently gathered by the Department of Labor noticeable shortages were reported only among engineers teachers technicians skilled metal workers and certain kinds of repairmen. Shortages of some of these types of workers have been common for some years but they have not interfered with rapid gains in production Some difficulties in recruiting labor have been reported by employers in medical services restaurants and laundries. Employment in household services actually declined between and These are generally the low-wage sectors of the economy. Hourly earnings in laundries for instance are more than percent lower than those in manufacturing and percent below the earnings in wholesale and retail trade. When unemployment was high these low-wage employers could count on an ample supply of labor. But it is inevitable that as unemployment is reduced they will encounter stronger competition for labor from higher paying employers If the past is any guide the low-paying establishments will solve their labor problems by more extensive hiring among the groups with relatively high unemployment rates nonwhites and youths by raising their wages more rapidly than other firms and by mechanization and more efficient use of their employees Job openings in interstate recruitment with the U.S. Employment Service rose sharply at the end of and were about percent higher than in the same period of but there were still active job applicants registered with public employment offices for every registered job openings. Pilot surveys of job vacancies in indicate that on an over-all basis available opportunities were still lagging behind the number unemployed. However the index of help-wanted advertising in cities compiled by the National Industrial Conference Board reached a record high at the end of last year. Our present information system on job vacancies is little more than fragmentary. A comprehensive set of vacancy statistics comparable to those collected in other countries would be a most useful tool of analysis The further reduction in unemployment expected this year seems likely to follow the pattern with perhaps even greater relative gains made by the long-term unemployed older workers unskilled workers and nonwhites. Employment of teenagers can be expected to increase sharply Additional women may be drawn into the labor force. And migration from agriculture and from depressed areas may accelerate. These are the principal remaining sources of labor for industrial expansion The enlistment or conscription of young men into the armed services reduces the supply of civilian labor. By the end of about percent of the male labor force in the year old category will be in the armed services. This represents only a small increase from the percent prevailing figure in before the current buildup. A relatively large part of the increase in the armed services in will be in the year age group. But with the substantial labor force growth the percentage of this age group in the armed services by December should be little different from the percent figure in The increase in military personnel is expected to total about in This is modest compared with the Korean war period when over a million men joined the armed services in months about million in years The current military increases are coming in sectors of the labor force where unemployment rates are high. In December unemployment among males years old was percent ( unadjusted for seasonality ) percentage points above the national average for the entire labor force and unemployment of males in the year group was percent. In short men removed from the civilian labor force to go into the armed services are coming from parts of the labor force where they should be more readily replaceable Our labor markets will be able to support a large further expansion of the economy. But as production rises and unemployment falls it will become more difficult for employers to find exactly the right man for each new job. The need for upgrading for on-the-job training and other changes in employment practices will become greater. Public and private manpower policies will face their greatest challenge As shortages of some skills have begun to develop programs to train highly skilled people have been intensified under the Manpower Development and Training Act. For example current activities include an on-thejob training contract with the Chrysler Corporation to train automobile mechanics and a contract with the National Tool Die and Precision Machine Association to double the number of tool and die trainees. Many contracts are presently under negotiation to provide skilled workers for such defense industries as aircraft ordnance and electronics. Also improvement in the Employment Service will help to fill job vacancies Active manpower policies are discussed in detail in Chapter They have already contributed importantly to making the labor force better suited for present job requirements Their importance will become even greater in EMPLOYMENT GOALS The Annual Report of the Council specified an interim unemployment target. It was stated that " in the existing economic circumstances an unemployment rate of about percent is a reasonable and prudent full employment target for stabilization policy. If we move firmly to reduce the impact of structural unemployment we will be able to move the unemployment target steadily from percent to successively lower rates circumstances may alter the responsiveness of the unemployment rate and the price level to the volume of aggregate demand. Current experience must therefore be the guide. " It was made clear that this goal " should be achievable by stabilization policy alone. Other policy measures will help to reduce the goal attainable in the future below the 4-percent figure. " The unemployment rate has now virtually reached the interim target and is projected to fall below percent in There is strong evidence that the conditions originally set for lowering the target are in fact being met and that the economy can operate efficiently at lower unemployment rates The quality of the American labor force has been improving steadily. In the last year in which unemployment was percent workers had an average of years of schooling ; by they had years. Whereas percent of all workers had no more than years of education in the figure had fallen to percent by The ease of attaining a given over-all unemployment rate is increased by this higher educational achievement. To be sure jobs may now require on the average more education than they did in Nevertheless it is highly significant that if the unemployment rate for every education group were the same now as it had been in March the over-all unemployment rate would be percentage point lower than it was in Partly offsetting the better educational preparation of today 's workers is the increasing number of young and relatively inexperienced men and women who now constitute a larger proportion of the labor force than they did in These workers normally have higher unemployment rates than older experienced workers. As a result if every age and sex group in had the same unemployment rate as in March the over-all unemployment rate would now be percentage point higher than it was in The training and manpower policies instituted since are beginning to reduce the attainable level of unemployment both by raising the cmployability of workers and by directly altering their labor force status. During an average of about youths will be engaged in special work and training programs. If most of these youths would otherwise have been unemployed the programs would be reducing the national unemployment rate by about to percentage point. The absorption of these workers does not appreciably reduce the supply of labor available for other jobs while they are in training ; it does increase their suitability for other employment when their training is completed The substantial increase in the number of young men entering military service will have a direct impact on the attainable unemployment rate of civilians. On the assumption that most of the added young men in the armed services in would otherwise have been in the civilian labor force but that most of the jobs they would have filled can readily be filled from among the unemployed the attainable unemployment rate would be lowered by about percentage point The improved ability of the economy to sustain lower unemployment without inflation arises not only from developments in the labor market Other factors which could not be taken into account when the interim target was first set are equally relevant : the fact that so fine a balance could be maintained between production and capacity both over-all and by sectors as the economy moved toward full employment ; the higher productivity gains ; the increasing keenness of international competition in our markets ; the more responsible attitudes displayed by business and labor in wage and price decisions ; and the dependability and prudence of consumer and business decisions Thus the economic circumstances which accompanied a percent unemployment rate in or which it was assumed in would accompany such a rate now correspond to a lower national unemployment rate. While we will find satisfaction in reaching the interim target it would be incorrect to identify this accomplishment with full attainment of the goal of an employment opportunity for every American willing and able to work Our target should be steady progress at a pace which permits the economy to adapt to decreasing unemployment rates and growing demand in the product markets. Private and public policies should be able to preserve the reasonable cost and price stability which is necessary for sustainable progress LABOR COST TRENDS Labor costs per unit of output are an important determinant of over-all cost and price changes. In the postwar period their widely varying movements have frequently been associated with similar changes in the price level ( Chart ) Labor costs per unit of output reflect both hourly compensation and output per man-hour or productivity. Increases in compensation raise unit labor costs ; increases in productivity lower it. Whether labor costs per unit of output rise during the particular period depends on the relative balance between increase of compensation and of productivity Chart Changes in Compensation Prices and Productivity in the Private Economy PERCENTAGE CHANGE FROM PRECEDING YEAR OUTPUT PER MAN-HOUR-2/ nnn n n PRIVATE GNP DEFLATOR n HI WflT TOTAL COMPENSATION DIVIDED BY ALL PERSONS MAN-HOURS WORKED i / P R I V A T E GNP DIVIDED BY ALL PERSONS MAN-HOURS WORKED 3/COMPENSATION PER MAN-HOUR DIVIDED BY OUTPUT PER MAN-HOUR SOURCES : DEPARTMENT OF LABOR DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS O 6'6 WAGES Wage movements of recent years must clearly be characterized as moderate During the first years of the expansion gross hourly earnings of manufacturing workers rose at an average annual rate of percent ; corrected for overtime the annual increase averaged percent. Outside of manufacturing the record is more varied. In mining gross hourly earnings increased at an average annual rate of only percent and in wholesale trade at a rate of percent ; but in construction the average yearly increase was percent and in retail trade percent. When account is taken of increases in fringe benefits the corresponding figures for total compensation per man-hour would in most cases undoubtedly be somewhat higher Nevertheless when combined with the strong yearly gains in productivity the average increase in total hourly compensation was consistent with relative stability of average unit labor costs throughout the economy During the past months wages have been rising at a pace little different from that of earlier years. Gross hourly earnings of manufacturing workers rose in by percent and the yearly increase of straight-time earnings was percent. In the nonmanufacturing sector most industries had somewhat larger increases than in the earlier expansion years. Between November and November hourly earnings increased by percent in mining and in wholesale trade percent in construction and percent in retailing The many collective bargaining contracts signed during were characterized by and large by a relative moderation of gains in wages and fringe benefits. In some industries aerospace for example the negotiated increases exceeded somewhat the Council 's guideposts for noninflationary wage behavior. But in other industries steel rubber maritime trades New York newspapers aluminum the results of the contracts either fell within or were close to the guidepost standards. The settlement in rubber provided an increase of percent that in aluminum percent and the important steel settlement also percent. The pay increase for Federal workers likewise fell within the guideposts. A special Labor Department analysis of the major contracts ( those covering workers or more ) that were concluded during the first months of indicates that the average yearly wage adjustment resulting from these contracts was percent ; for contracts covering a period longer than a year the adjustment was smaller only percent. This analysis considered only wage changes ; inclusion of fringe benefits might raise these figures by three-fourths of a percentage point In construction the contracts as in previous years generally resulted in higher wage advances than elsewhere. Between October and October union wage scales increased on the average by percent. Construction is clearly an industry that raises serious problems for wage-price stability The generally satisfactory record of wage contracts has important implications for wage trends in Many industries have negotiated long-term agreements. The only major industries which will negotiate new contracts in will be electrical machinery telephone and construction ; major reopenings could take place in railroads and coal mining. Because of the relatively light calendar of expiring contracts the basic pattern of wages for most key industries has already been set for It is likely however that compensation will rise more rapidly in the lowwage and largely nonunionized sectors of the trade and service industries Many workers at the bottom of the economy 's wage structure now face opportunities of moving into more advantageous jobs. Accordingly wage increases in the low-paid sectors are likely to exceed the average wage rise in the economy as a whole. As indicated by the percent increase of hourly earnings in retail trade between late and late this has already been occurring PRODUCTIVITY AND UNIT LABOR COSTS A key element in the impressive U.S. record of price stability has been the high rate of productivity advance. Based on tentative figures for productivity in the private economy ( real total private GNP divided by total private man-hours worked ) has grown at an average rate of percent a year since Because of these large productivity gains average annual increases of percent in compensation per man-hour have raised average unit labor costs in the private economy by only percent a year This record contrasts sharply with the experience in the short expansions of the mid-1950 's. In the period between the business cycle peaks of and unit labor costs increased by percent a year ; compensation per man-hour rose by percent a year while output per man-hour advanced only percent a year. In and an average annual increase of percent in unit labor costs exerted a strong upward push on prices. Between the and cyclical peaks average hourly compensation gains were more moderate percent a year but since productivity was rising at a rate of only percent labor costs were pushed up by percent a year Manufacturing productivity figures based upon the index of industrial production of the Federal Reserve Board show output per employee manhour rising by percent a year since Comparing this figure with the percent average advance in hourly manufacturing compensation implies that unit labor costs in manufacturing were lower in than in According to preliminary figures for productivity in the entire private economy increased by about percent below the average for the whole expansion and slightly below the historical average for the entire postwar period. Compensation per man-hour in the private sector rose by percent resulting in an increase of percent in unit labor costs. Productivity in manufacturing based upon the industrial production index rose by percent and hourly compensation increased by only percent Thus unit labor costs in manufacturing decreased by percent last year The good record of productivity during the past years was aided by the sustained expansion of output that has boosted operating rates. As operating rates improve capital and overhead labor are more effectively utilized. These oversized gains in productivity can not be expected to continue indefinitely. As preferred operating rates are reached and surpassed older less efficient standby equipment must be used and less-skilled labor must be hired and trained. Partly offsetting this new and more efficient plant and equipment will be continually coming into use. On balance therefore the rate of increase of productivity can be expected to gravitate toward its long-run trend and the more modest gain in undoubtedly reflects this The exact value of the trend rate of productivity growth that rate which technological advance the constantly improving quality of the labor force and the growing capital stock can sustain is difficult to ascertain. To isolate the " underlying " trend adjustments for all short-run factors would be required. But these adjustments can not be made perfectly. Nor is it likely that the " true " trend would remain precisely constant over time The factors determining productivity growth have not been and will not be historical constants A long-run historical average provides one estimate of the trend rate of productivity growth. The postwar average from to is percent. But this may reflect especially favorable factors in the immediate postwar years. On the other hand the much lower average of ^ percent for the longer period from to is subject to the suspicion that it seriously understates the higher trend in the depression-free postwar period The productivity trend can also be estimated from data for the shorter postwar period using sophisticated statistical techniques to adjust for the short-run factors. Several such techniques have been employed by the Council to obtain the best possible estimate of the postwar trend rate of growth of productivity. While these different methods do not yield identical estimates for the private sector they fall within the range of to percent a year In the increase of productivity is expected to continue close to its trend value though not likely to exceed it. The increase in employer payroll taxes which occurred on January will raise average employment costs this year by about two-thirds of percent. The expected rise in productivity however should hold the average increase in unit labor costs to about l / percent for the entire private economy. These costs should be approximately stable in manufacturing COSTS AND PRICES IN SELECTED PROBLEM AREAS Some sectors in the economy pose particular problems for the achievement of cost-price stability either because of especially unfavorable long- term cost trends or because of potential market imbalances. Five of these areas are examined here : agricultural and food products ; nonferrous metals ; machinery ; construction ; and medical services FOOD From to consumer food prices rose by only percent a year while all other consumer prices were rising by percent. But from December to December prices of food increased by percent while other consumer prices rose by percent. The same pattern is even more evident at the wholesale level. Between December and December prices of processed food rose by percent and of farm products by percent. These increases accounted for two-thirds of the total rise in the wholesale price index over this period About three-fourths of the rise in retail food prices in can be attributed to a percent advance in meat. There were smaller price increases in poultry fish dairy products and bakery products. On the other hand prices of fruits and vegetables declined by percent during the year after reaching a peak in the spring At the wholesale level meat prices rose by percent in in response to a percent rise in livestock prices. Particularly large increases were registered in hog prices but cattle prices were also up substantially These sharp increases were the result of a combination of rapidly growing demand for meat and an unfavorable supply situation. Rising personal incomes and a growing population increase the demand for meat. Supplies on the other hand are relatively inelastic in the short run because of the long time period required to expand livestock breeding stocks Hog production was reduced during the second half of and in as a result of depressed prices received by hog producers in and The resultant high pork prices led consumers to switch to poultry and other meats ; although beef production increased supplies were not sufficiently responsive to keep beef prices from rising. Because of the much shorter period required to produce poultry the supply of broilers responded rapidly to satisfy part of the substantial increases in demand. Thus poultry prices rose much less than beef or pork prices in by percent in at the wholesale level and percent at the farm In the past hog production has expanded when hog prices were favorable in relation to feed ( mostly corn ) costs. The hog-corn price ratio has been extremely favorable to producers in recent months. But the increasing importance of nonfeed costs ( labor overhead etc. ) in hog production has made the hog-corn ratio a less reliable indicator of future production Nevertheless the evidence indicates that hog producers are now responding to favorable prices ; farmers intend to raise percent more pigs during December 1965-May than they did one year earlier. Thus while hog prices will probably continue strong throughout the first half of this year they should begin to decline in the second half when the expanded 8l spring crop is marketed. Beef production will increase slightly in but beef prices will probably continue at their high levels through most of the year General prosperity was a contributing factor to the rise in food prices in but supply conditions certainly were the major element. This year should witness a less rapid increase in food prices than was experienced during Meat prices may rise further in the first half of the year but some relief is expected in the second half when expanded supplies reach the market. Citrus fruits and fresh vegetables should have lower average prices in than in if normal weather prevails Poultry is also expected to be cheaper The rise in farm and food prices has had some limited spillover into the industrial sector. Although the extent of automatic wage escalation with consumer prices is very much reduced from prior years the wages of about million workers have been raised by the faster rise of consumer prices in NONFERROUS METALS In the last years consumption of nonferrous metals by U.S. industry has risen substantially. The prices of these primary metals have advanced rapidly with aluminum ingot up percent from December to December copper ingot percent pig lead percent pig tin percent and slab zinc percent. These increases produced higher prices for fabricated products and were an important factor in the over-all increase of industrial prices Earlier in the postwar period the Government accumulated large stockpiles of a wide variety of materials including many of the nonferrous metals Consistent with long-range security objectives substantial supplies of materials can be made available to help to meet the requirements of the increased military effort and an expanding civilian economy. In the coming year the availability of the stockpiles should help to prevent a repetition of the imbalances in the markets of certain of these materials that occurred during the last years Copper was particularly affected when expanding world demand coupled with production setbacks resulting from strikes and political troubles in the Republic of the Congo Zambia and Chile caused wide price swings in the secondary markets The Government has repeatedly eased pressures by releasing surplus copper from its stockpile. In January tons and in April tons were released for sale to commercial users. The Mint obtained tons in December and tons last October from the stockpile for its coinage needs. After price increases in October by major foreign producers the President announced a 4-point program including the release of an additional tons of copper from the stockpile ; controls on the export of copper scrap ; removal of the cent tariff on imported copper ; and a request to the Commodity Exchange of New York to raise margin requirements to curb speculative trading in copper futures. In January of this year export controls were extended to virtually all copper and copper products The outlook for copper remains highly uncertain because of political factors abroad. Government policy will continue to strive to maintain supplies adequate for rising military and civilian demands Domestic production of lead and zinc has recently been insufficient to satisfy high demands and surplus metal was released from the stockpile at the request of the industry. Further the President on the recommendation of the Tariff Commission revoked the import quotas which had been instituted during a period of excess supply in No imbalances are expected in The demand for aluminum rose rapidly in and Defense requirements will continue to increase in to between and tons a year double the requirements before the increased military activities in Vietnam. The industry has been operating close to capacity but supplies have been augmented by a rising flow of imports. Ingot prices began to rise in late Announcements of further price increases were made by producers in October To help to restore balance in the market for primary aluminum the Federal Government intensified negotiations for the orderly release of the million ton stockpile of aluminum in excess of emergency needs. Agreement was reached with the industry calling for sale to the industry of a minimum of tons of aluminum a year for to years ; in the event that added defense requirements exceed this level additional releases can be made up to a maximum of tons a year. This release will assure continued availability of sufficient amounts of aluminum and should preserve balance between production and demand in the market at stable prices MACHINERY In the inflation of the mid-1950 's higher machinery prices played an important part in raising the wholesale price index. The index for electrical machinery increased by percent between and construction machinery by percent. This year will again see heavy investment spending and the possibility of similar machinery price increases must be examined In December the wholesale price index of nonelectrical machinery was percent above the average. In the last year prices rose by percent compared with an average annual increase of V/2 percent in the preceding years. Some of these increases probably reflect an improved product not fully adjusted for in the index. But prices have also reflected sharply rising demands expanding profit margins and some increases in costs Trends of wage rates and material costs for the industry have been moderate in the past few years. Gross average hourly earnings advanced at an average rate of percent a year from to In they were up percent partly reflecting the greater use of overtime. The Federal Reserve Board 's index of industrial materials prices rose by more than percent in after years of relative stability. The price of steel a major input rose little in sharp contrast to the 's Profits in were appreciably above Industry profits in nonelectrical machinery in the first quarters were percent higher than a year earlier to yield a percent after tax return on equity Avoiding bottlenecks in the machinery industry depends on the expansion of capacity to meet rising demands and on the availability of skilled labor The last years have seen a steady rise in the output of machinery. In production of nonelectrical machinery was at a rate equal to percent of industry capacity. Modest output increases in the next years raised operating rates to percent of capacity by the end of Output spurted by percent in reflecting the large rise in investment expenditures bringing the industry 's operating rate to percent by the end of the year. Another percent gain in output occurred in as business investment rose once more higher farm income raised sales of agricultural machinery and defense needs called for increasing amounts of construction machinery. During the year the nonelectrical machinery industry operated at about percent of capacity still percentage points below the preferred rate. The industry 's own anticipated spending on plant and equipment promises to raise its capacity about percent in Thus while utilization rates may rise no general pressure on productive capacity is currently foreseen. Some limited segments of the industry will be straining capacity however The backlog of unfilled orders for nonelectrical machinery has been relatively steady during the expansion rising gradually from months of shipments in to months in and months in November In the sensitive machine tools sector of metalworking machinery the backlog of unfilled orders was months in October for metal cutting tools up from months a year earlier. For metal forming tools however the backlog fell to months from 11.1a year earlier. Given current operating rates these backlogs are not unduly large In the industry expanded its employment by percent training many new workers to fill its enlarged requirements. This year another large employment increase will be necessary and even more new workers will have to be trained through private and public efforts In summary increased nonelectrical machinery production should be able to provide the equipment needed by an expanding economy. The industry may have some difficulty finding enough skilled labor. But given the expected trends in costs and the apparent availability of adequate physical capacity the large price increases which disturbed investment in the mid1950 's are not likely to recur this year The electrical segment of the machinery industry maintained stable prices in Prices were no higher than in and indeed were percent below the average. Capacity in this industry has been ample costs have been stable and competition including that from abroad has been keen. These factors will continue to support price stability in The wage negotiations this October will affect cost trends in the future CONSTRUCTION Construction is one of our largest industries. In it employed more than million workers. Construction prices and wages have been rising more rapidly than in most other sectors of the economy. Between and price indexes of finished construction rose by percent a year on the average. Over the same period both average hourly earnings and union wage rates of construction workers were rising at an annual rate of percent. Larger fringe benefits probably bring the increase in total hourly compensation a fraction of a percentage point higher Higher prices have reflected both substantial increases in employment costs and some possible widening of profit margins. Wholesale prices of construction materials have been relatively stable during most of the expansion. While estimates of labor productivity in construction are highly imperfect they nevertheless suggest that the annual increase in output per man-hour is below the economy-wide average and substantially below the annual increase in employee compensation During the past year the rise in construction prices has accelerated. The increase in the GNP deflator in was percent for total construction percent for nonresidential construction and percent for private residential construction. The rise for residential building is particularly disturbing in view of the fact that there has been no increase of activity in this sector for several years The rate of wage increase in construction has also accelerated. Between October and October the average increase in union rates of construction workers was percent ; and average hourly earnings increased during the year by percent. Moreover many of the construction contracts signed last year provided relatively large deferred compensation increases in and Again this year construction costs and prices are expected to rise more rapidly than the over-all GNP deflator The inflationary cost and price situations in the industry reflect to some extent its prosperity especially in its industrial and commercial sectors They also suggest the existence of more permanent structural problems which should be of vital concern for both the industry and the community at large. There have been many important technological changes in various sectors of the industry but the total technical progress is clearly insufficient Ways must also be found to expand more quickly the supply of skilled construction labor. Restrictions on entry not only retard the growth of the industry but also have adverse social effects since they tend to keep Negro youths out of attractive types of employment. To meet the needs of rapid growth and equality vocational programs for skilled craftsmen must be stepped up There is need for institutional arrangements that will increase the geographical mobility of skilled workers. Labor mobility in construction has been reduced by the spread of locally instituted welfare and pension plans whose benefits are not " portable " from one,area to another. Development of national pension and health and welfare programs as well as broader vesting and interarea portability of rights and benefits will contribute to greater mobility and more efficient utilization of the present supply of construction workers MEDICAL SERVICES Persistently and strongly rising fees and charges for medical services have exerted an upward influence on the consumer price index throughout the postwar period. As shown in Table medical care prices which account TABLE Changes in consumer prices for medical care Annual percentage change in consumer prices Medical care Period Medical services Total to _ to to to to to to to Prescriptions and drugs All other items _- Source : Department of Labor for about percent of consumer expenditures have risen twice as rapidly as the average of all other consumer prices for most of the postwar period and have contributed one-tenth to two-tenths of percent to the rise of the index in most years In the most recent years medical costs have risen less rapidly than during the 's. This has been due primarily to the fact that prices of prescriptions and drugs have been declining. Also the increase in charges for medical services including doctors ' and dentists ' fees eye examinations and eyeglasses and hospital rates has slowed down in comparison with the earlier period The higher hospital and doctor charges reflected in the consumer price index may overstate the true increase in the cost of medical care when account is taken of the rising effectiveness of the care received. With the dramatic improvements in medical technology that have taken place over the postwar period many patients get more real " services " from each day 's stay in the hospital or each visit to the doctor than before The basic sources of rising medical costs are the inadequate supply of personnel and facilities the sharply rising cost of hospital construction and of continually more complex medical equipment the rapid increase in salaries of medical personnel relative to productivity gains as presently measured and the expanding demand for medical services. Although some of these conditions may be relieved in the longer run they will not be in the immediate future. The advent of Medicare will add to the expanding demand for medical services and facilities. Thus the urgency of public policies to augment medical care resources and to improve their organization for efficient use will be even greater OUTLOOK FOR COST-PRICE STABILITY IN The above review shows that the economy is making a good adjustment to the altered economic environment. With the unemployment rate at percent and clearly moving downward there is strong evidence that the substantial inflation of industrial prices experienced in the mid-1950 's is not recurring The outlook for unit labor costs is good. Although a few individual settlements may be out of line the general advance of wages should not accelerate this year and productivity can be expected to remain close to the trend rate. So long as costs do not move up substantially price changes will remain limited Producers are generally able to meet rising orders out of growing capacity and to find the labor needed for expanding production. Competition remains keen and imports are limiting price advances in several key sectors There are occasional examples of shortsighted pricing policies on the part of a few firms and there will probably be more. But most industries have learned to fear the fool 's paradise of rising prices that produce unsustainable profits shrinking markets and permanently higher labor costs With the economy now approaching full utilization of its resources the risk of price increases becomes greater. Occasional disturbances to the supply of some key commodities are likely to occur although their specific form can not be foreseen. The ability of employers to redesign jobs and train additional skilled workers may not fully match the rising demands for skilled labor in all industries But so long as labor costs remain generally stable difficulties in obtaining materials remain isolated consumers and businesses retain moderate expectations and key decisionmakers continue to respect the public interest in setting wages and prices the prospects are excellent that the recent generally good record of costs and prices will continue GUIDEPOSTS FOR NONINFLATIONARY PRICE AND WAGE BEHAVIOR Most earlier periods of high employment since World War II have been accompanied by inflation. In some of those years the cause clearly was excessive demand. In other years no general excess of demand was evident yet prices continued to creep upward. The movement continued even during some periods in which on any reasonable criterion over-all demand was quite inadequate. The exact diagnosis remains a matter of some disagreement among economists. But almost all agree that an important part of the explanation lies in the fact that in many industries unions or managements or both possess considerable discretionary power to set wages and prices and that in too many instances they have used that power to raise wages and prices in ways not consistent with basic supply and demand forces in the market The apparent " inflationary bias " in our wage-making and price-making institutions has been of almost continuous concern for the Council of Economic Advisers for many years. Appeals for responsibility and moderation for taking the public interest into account in wage and price decisions have had a perennial place in successive Economic Reports. In its Annual Report of January the Council for the first time attempted to provide private decisionmakers with rather more specific standards for judging whether their decisions were responsible and took adequate account of the public interest. These standards or " guideposts " were also designed to permit the public to reach its own conclusions concerning the degree of responsibility exercised by leaders of business and labor INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF THE GUIDEPOSTS In the years since the guideposts have gained increasing significance. The slow and difficult progress in restoring equilibrium in our international balance of payments has underlined the necessity that American goods retain or improve their competitive position in export markets and in our own market. Our goal of balance of payments equilibrium in and thereafter will permit no retreat from cost-price stability During the recent years of still excessive unemployment and idle capacity strong competition for jobs and markets reinforced a growing sense of responsibility on the part of labor and management. The fuller use of resources achieved last year and be excellent prospects for may reduce that reinforcement. We now confront the task of reconciling full employment with stable prices The record reviewed in previous sections of this chapter makes it clear that the overwhelming majority of private wage and price decisions in recent years has been consistent with the guideposts whatever the extent to which the guideposts may have consciously entered into the decisions reached. It is clear however that in many instances the guideposts have consciously affected these decisions. On numerous occasions Government officials have specifically reminded unions or managements of the guidepost standards either publicly or privately either generally or with reference to specific situations. Several of the more important of these situations have attracted considerable public attention In January the President requested the Council of Economic Advisers to prepare an analysis of steel prices following certain increases in such prices and at a time when important wage negotiations were pending The Report made public in early May analyzed the position of the industry and the factors affecting it. It showed that wage and price decisions consistent with the guideposts would be in the interest of both labor and management and of the Nation. Later the Government helped the two parties to reach a peaceful settlement in the steel wage negotiations. A damaging strike was avoided and a settlement was achieved within the wage guideposts. According to the best estimates of its cost available to the Government the settlement averaged percent a year computed over the full 39-month period Following the labor settlement prices on tin plate were raised in October ; this was accompanied by a price reduction on a new black plate which is expected to substitute increasingly for tin plate in many uses. At the year 's end the Bethlehem Steel Company announced a $ a ton increase on structural steel and pilings. The Council pointed out that such an increase was not justified under the guideposts. In January the U.S. Steel Corporation announced a smaller increase accompanying it with price reductions on other steel products In October the Council prepared a guidepost analysis of price increases initiated by producers of primary aluminum ; the companies later rescinded these increases Also in October the President by threatening a veto persuaded the Congress to enact a pay increase for civil service and postal employees of the Federal Government which was within the guideposts These actions and many others clearly reaffirmed the Administration 's strong commitment to the guideposts as an essential pillar for price stability THE GUIDEPOSTS RESTATED The general guidepost for wages is that the annual rate of increase of total employee compensation { wages and fringe benefits ) per man-hour worked should equal the national trend rate of increase in output per manhour The general guidepost for prices is that prices should remain stable in those industries where the increase of productivity equals the national trend ; that prices can appropriately rise in those industries where the increase of productivity is smaller than the national trend ; and that prices should fall in those industries where the increase of productivity exceeds the national trend Within a given industry the guideposts allow for individual wage and price adjustments that do not affect the over-all wage or price level of the industry. Increases for some groups of workers or products can be balanced by reductions for others Observance of the guideposts would mean that unit labor costs would decline in the industries where productivity gains are above average and rise in industries where such gains are below the national average. Average unit labor cost in the economy would remain constant. Similarly the decrease of prices in industries with above-average increases in productivity would offset the price rises in industries with below-average productivity gains. The average level of prices would remain stable Adherence to the standards would mean that all the participants in the productive processes employees and owners of invested capital would share in the over-all gains in productivity created by the growth of capital equipment improved technology and a better educated healthier and more skilled labor force. This can readily be seen from a simple example. Suppose output in an industry is million units each selling at $ for total sales of $ million. Suppose labor compensation is $ If productivity and wages both rise percent and employment remains unchanged production will expand to units which at $ a unit would raise revenues to $ Labor compensation would rise to $ Labor would thus receive percent of the added value keeping unchanged the share of labor costs in total revenues. If prices of materials and other purchased inputs were unchanged and the quantities used were expanded in proportion to output then gross income of owners would rise in the same proportion as wage income. Thus the division of income between labor and capital would remain unchanged. And with capital requirements per unit of output unchanged ( as has been approximately true ) the return per unit of capital would remain unchanged as well The actual sharing of gross corporate income between labor and capital has remained virtually unchanged since World War II. There have been repeated short-run swings with labor 's share rising in recession and falling during expansion. Thus for example the share of nonwage income rose from percent in to percent in This recent figure is virtually identical with the division of income in and The inflationary wage-price spirals of the 's and 's did not in fact change the distribution of income Public policy is and should remain neutral with respect to wage and price decisions that attempt to change the distribution of industry 's income between labor and capital. But when such decisions lead to inflationary pressure they properly become a subject of public concern EXCEPTIONS TO THE GENERAL GUIDEPOSTS Some exceptions to the general guideposts are necessary to promote economic objectives. Wage increases above the general guideposts may be desirable where wage rates are inadequate for an industry to attract its share of the labor force necessary to meet the demands for its products ; where wages are particularly low that is near the bottom of the economy 's wage scales ; or where changes in work rules create large gains in productivity and substantial human costs requiring special adjustment of compensation Because the industries in which unions possess strong market power are largely high-wage industries in which job opportunities are relatively very attractive the first two of these exceptions are rarely applicable On the price side increases in price above the general guidepost standard may occasionally be appropriate to reflect increases in unit material costs to the extent that such increases are not offset by decreases in other costs and significantly impair gross profit margins on the relevant range of products or to correct an inability to attract needed capital The large firms to which guideposts are primarily addressed typically have ready access to sources of capital ; moreover the profits of virtually every industry have risen sharply and are at record levels as a byproduct of the general prosperity in the economy. The second exception is thus not widely applicable in the present environment SHORT-RUN AND TREND ELEMENTS IN PRODUCTIVITY AND THE GENERAL WAGE GUIDEPOSTS In the original discussion of the guideposts in the Council 's Annual Report of it was pointed out that " it is desirable to segregate the trend movements in productivity from those that reflect business-cycle forces. " During the last years the economy has been closing a substantial gap between actual and potential production. This has augmented the yearly productivity gain beyond the long-term sustainable trend. Now that the economy has little gap remaining to close the trend of productivity gains will be determined only by capital investment an improving labor force and technological progress. The temporarily high productivity gains that come from utilizing equipment and manpower more efficiently through higher operating rates are largely behind us To assure future stability of unit labor costs wages should increase no faster than the sustainable trend of productivity The original formulation of the guideposts did not specify any particular trend productivity figure but rather listed various historical averages covering different time spans and various segments of the economy. Since the economy was just recovering from the second of two recessions in a very short interval it was difficult to identify the trend productivity rate from the immediately preceding experience. This difficulty was compounded by speculation that the trend rate might be accelerating as a result of faster technological change particularly the spread of automation In the Report of no single figure for trend productivity was specified but in a related table the now well-known percent appeared as the latest figure in a column labelled " Trend productivity. " The figures in that column were described as the " annual average percentage change in output per man-hour during the latest years. " A 5-year period was chosen because at that time it was sufficiently long to include both the extraordinarily high productivity gains of a year of recovery ( ) and the extraordinarily low productivity gains of a year of recession ( ) Under the conditions of a 5-year average gave a good approximation of the trend productivity because in effect it averaged out the ups and downs of cyclical productivity swings. These same conditions prevailed in and the percent figure appeared for that year in a similar table in the Report Subsequent revisions of GNP data would have made the 5-year average percent in both and Now that the economy is at the end of its fifth year of uninterrupted expansion a 5-year average no longer gives a reasonable approximation of the true productivity trend. The last recession year drops out of the average yet the unsustainable productivity gains of a year of recovery and years of improving utilization are retained. If use of the 5-year average were continued this year and in coming years the figure yielded by the 5-year moving average would rise at this time to percent and would undoubtedly fall substantially thereafter An analysis of recent productivity movements was presented earlier in this chapter. It is clear from this analysis that percent would not be an accurate measure of the true trend of productivity. Rather it appears that the long-term trend independent of cyclical swings is slightly over percent For the Council specifically recommends that the general guidepost for wages of percent a year be continued. We make this recommendation in the light of the following additional considerations : ( ) With the economy approaching full employment and the crucial test of our ability to reconcile our employment and our cost-price goals at hand it would be inappropriate to raise the guidepost ( ) The actual productivity gain that can be expected over the next few years is not likely to be above the trend value ( ) The percent rate has been consistent with the approximate stability of industrial wholesale prices which has strengthened our competitive position in the world. Now is not the time to abandon that standard ( ) On January employer payroll taxes to finance social security and Medicare rose substantially raising labor costs per hour by an average of two-thirds of a percent. These taxes are not included in the definition of employee compensation for purposes of the guideposts since the rates and the benefits are determined by law rather than by collective bargaining. Nonetheless recognition has to be taken of the extraordinary increase in these taxes at this time which will both raise unit labor costs and yield future benefits to employees GUIDEPOST POLICY ON PRICES The guideposts must continue to aim at complete stability of average domestic prices. While individual prices will rise from time to time others must fall if upward pressure on the general price level is to be avoided. To achieve that goal in a fully employed economy will require that unions refrain from insistence on irresponsible wage settlements and an even greater willingness by management to take the public interest fully into account in its pricing decisions. Every management with some market power must ask itself : Is a price increase justified by increases in costs ? Or is it an attempt to take advantage of prosperity to widen profit margins ? Those companies that incur rising costs for materials or purchased services must see if these can not be absorbed from lowered costs elsewhere in their operations. And those companies with exceptionally favorable productivity gains must consider whether this is the time to seek to keep the gains in the form of still higher profits or whether to share them with consumers through lower prices. Unions which are in a favorable bargaining situation must remember that wage increases that force employers to raise prices will be paid for by the workers in other industries Both unions and managements should reflect on the fact that if their actions create an inflationary spiral the most likely outcome will be restrictive fiscal and monetary policies which will aim to stop further price increases but will in the process also reduce output cut back profits and reduce employment O Chapter Strengthening Human Resources T HE 89TH CONGRESS in its first session enacted a body of domestic legislation unparalleled in decades. The content and purpose of the Great Society programs are not purely economic. Yet their consequences for the economy are so profound that they must be viewed as an integral part of economic policy. Only a few of the new programs are discussed in this chapter ; Appendix A contains a more complete list of legislation of economic significance enacted last year The common goal of the programs discussed here is to strengthen our human resources : to improve the education health and productivity of our working force and to break down barriers which have prevented some citizens from the full development and use of their abilities and training Since these programs were undertaken the burdens on our national resources have expanded. Even our wealthy Nation can not realize all its goals at once. The programs begun in have already invested an additional $ billion in our human resources. The investment will rise further in but at a slower rate than initially planned. Over time economic growth and lessened defense demands should again permit resumption of a more rapid investment in human resources. The objectives and the instruments for such investment were importantly expanded in ; the foundation has been laid for great progress in the years ahead EDUCATION " Education will not cure all the problems of society but witho t it no cure for any problem is possible. It is high among my own c ncerns central to the purposes of this Administration and at the core of our hopes for a Great Society. " With these remarks to the White House Conference on Education last July President Johnson again affirmed education 's high priority Even when viewed in the narrow perspective of economic benefit alone the direct returns to individuals and society from investment in education have been shown by recent studies to be high and to compare favorably with the returns available from other forms of investment. Although much of the economic return from education accrues to individuals in the form of higher productivity and earnings education also enhances the well-being and supports the economic growth of the community that provides it Recognition of the economic and social benefits of a literate and efficient population and an informed electorate was responsible for the adoption many years ago and the subsequent extension and improvement of free compulsory education by State and local governments More recently the Federal Government 's interest and responsibility in the field of education have greatly expanded. In the late 's a keener awareness of the critical role of science and technology in determining the Nation 's economic and military strength as well as its esteem in the world prompted the Federal Government to undertake massive new support for scientific and technical education In the last two years Federal support for primary and secondary education has also greatly expanded. Two closely related premises underlie the decision that exclusive reliance on State and local support for primary and secondary education is no longer adequate from the standpoint of the national interest. The first is the recognition that every community suffers from inadequate education in other parts of the country. The second is the recognition that education must be a key element in the attack on poverty to which the Nation is now committed The resources devoted to schooling and the resultant quality of education vary widely among areas of the United States. In the mean current expenditure per pupil in average daily attendance in public elementary and secondary schools was $ ; it ranged from $ in Mississippi to $ in New York. Even the high average expenditure in New York did not provide a satisfactory education for many young people in that State States with low personal incomes often spend relatively more on education than their wealthier neighbors. Mississippi with the lowest absolute expenditure per pupil in average daily attendance devoted percent of personal income to education last year compared with the national average of percent. New Mexico spent percent the highest proportion of any State yet its per pupil expenditure still fell short of the national average When nearly million people move across State lines every year and far larger numbers move within States it is obvious that no community is immune to the effects of substandard education in other localities. Studies have shown that areas that are losing population particularly their young people spend less per student on education than those which are growing The communities gaining population typically our larger cities are crowded with migrants who are often inadequately prepared to assume their social responsibilities or to qualify for urban jobs Moreover the Nation has accepted the fundamental objective of eradicating poverty wherever it is found. Whether or not they migrate elsewhere inadequately educated children of poor parents are handicapped in escaping the poverty in which they were reared. Education is the most powerful tool we have for raising the productivity and motivation of the children of poor families and for breaking the cycle of poverty and dependency The tax base in communities with many poor families is often too weak to finance good schools. Even communities with more ample resources have frequently not provided schools which would encourage and assist children of the poor to make their own way out of poverty. Federal assistance clearly is required if every school district is to provide an education that is adequate for an economy of growing interdependence and for a society that is determined to eradicate poverty BUILDING THE LADDER OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY Programs adopted in will open new educational opportunities for millions of children and youths. These new programs will aid many disadvantaged children to get off to an equal start with others ; assure them school facilities comparable with those of others ; and remove some of the financial blocks which might prematurely halt their progress toward higher education. For persons no longer in school the new measures will provide useful skills and training or help to update skills outmoded by rapid technological change thus making them more productive and preparing them for better jobs Much of the direct return from these new measures will accrue to the disadvantaged in the form of increased incomes which will help to lift them and their children out of poverty. Indirectly all Americans will benefit through greater economic growth and reduced social tensions Project Head Start Each year close to a million children from poor families begin their formal schooling. Most of these children suffer from extreme cultural and social deprivation. They have lacked the chance to build a vocabulary and to develop the other tools of learning. When they begin school they are in a world that they do not understand In the summer of project Head Start under the auspices of the Community Action Program of the Office of Economic Opportunity was inaugurated to help these youngsters. To encourage widespread community involvement parents and volunteers also participated in the program which reached preschool children at Head Start Centers in urban and rural communities. The summer program will be continued and plans are being developed to extend Head Start on a yearround basis for children in Last summer thousands of children had books for their own use for the first time ; children whose diets typically consist of starches received fresh fruits and vegetables ; many whose world had been confined to crowded slums began to explore their communities and visited zoos or museums Project Head Start is also concerned with a child 's health. In examinations conducted as part of the program in Boston volunteer doctors discovered that percent of the children had one or more problems pediatric dental or emotional which required referral for further diagnosis and treatment. Without the Head Start program many serious defects would have remained undetected and uncorrected for many years perhaps to become uncorrectable This program will give millions of children a better chance to succeed in school. Unfortunately however many of these deprived youngsters will enter schools which rather than being the best are among the weakest in the country Elementary and Secondary Education After years of controversy over Federal aid to education the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of brought the Federal Government into a creative partnership with States and communities to improve the quality of all schools and particularly those serving disadvantaged children The Act authorizes more than $ billion annually in grants to school districts with heavy concentrations of children from low-income families. Each district is eligible for a Federal payment of up to one-half the average State expenditure per child multiplied by the number of its poor school-age children. These grants will finance special programs to meet the needs of million educationally deprived children from low-income families percent of the million school-age children The Act also provides funds for books maps and other educational materials which many schools currently lack. More than two-thirds of public elementary schools serving almost million children have no library Supplementary educational centers will be established throughout the country to bring more of the cultural resources of an area into the educational process. Regional laboratories connected with major universities will seek better ways of teaching and will seek to promote the transfer of new knowledge to the classroom. Funds are also provided to improve the operations of State educational agencies thus strengthening their capacity for planning and decision-making Higher Education Although setbacks to the educational progress of the disadvantaged occur most frequently prior to the completion of high school many talented students from poor families are unable to attend college for financial reasons. The Higher Education Act of established a broad program to make higher education available to all who may benefit from it. Its most important innovation is a program of educational opportunity grants of up to $ for high school graduates from low-income families In addition a guaranteed-loan program and an expanded Work-Study program will aid more than students The Act will also help institutions of higher education to become more responsive to the current problems. It will encourage them to undertake community service programs including extension continuing education and research programs designed to assist in the solution of community problems. It also sets up a new grant program to upgrade the academic quality of small developing colleges and establishes fellowships to encourage qualified persons to teach at these institutions The legislation authorizes the creation of a National Teachers Corps to augment the supply of qualified instructors in poor areas. Although the Congress did not appropriate funds to establish the Teacher Corps in the Administration continues to give this program high priority Most programs of direct financial aid to students have been directed toward the college-bound graduate and have failed to provide for many youths who wish to obtain training in business trade and technical schools This omission will be corrected by the establishment of a vocational student loan insurance program which when fully funded will help as many as students a year Out-of-School Programs The legislation also strengthened several programs which provide job training and work experience as well as basic education. These programs are designed to equip workers with the skills and productivity required to raise their potential earnings The Neighborhood Youth Corps program encourages persons aged to stay in or return to school by providing full-time and part-time work experience and training. It provides counseling and basic literacy training and it places young men and women in newly created positions to do work that would normally not be done in hospitals settlement houses schools libraries and other community agencies. Almost projects have been approved in communities throughout the Nation for the employment of young men and women in The Job Corps provides education and work experience in rural conservation centers and in urban training centers where enrollees live work and learn. About young people have expressed interest in joining this program. It is expected that about will be enrolled by June The Work Experience Program is designed to demonstrate the benefits of helping heads of families with dependent children to prepare for productive employment by providing them with work experience and job training along with basic literacy instruction. In the program aided participants with dependents The Adult Basic Education program is aimed at the million Americans age and over who have less than years of education It provides basic education when a lack of schooling stands in the way of successful training or employment. In fiscal about adults in States were enrolled. By June the program is expected to reach adults in all the States and the territories ACTIVE MANPOWER POLICIES Manpower policies have three principal objectives : to fit the unskilled for better jobs to augment the supply of scarce skills and to improve the efficiency of labor markets. These policies not only help individuals to achieve their full capabilities but also add to the national productive potential. They are a continuation of the educational opportunity programs and should serve to keep the quality of the labor force advancing in pace with the demands created by technological progress TRAINING PROGRAMS The Manpower Development and Training Act ( MDTA ) programs provide training and basic literacy instruction for unemployed ( and some underemployed ) persons who have had previous work experience in order to up-grade their job skills. Between passage of the law in and the end of enrollment had reached a cumulative total of with in institutional training and in on-the-job training. About percent have been trained for skilled occupations and another percent for clerical sales and service jobs Amendments to the MDTA in have made it possible to extend the scope and to increase the effectiveness of these training projects. The maximum period during which training allowances can be paid has been extended from to weeks making it possible to train persons for more highly skilled work. Eligibility for training allowances has been broadened ; and the previous limitation on the number of youths who can benefit has been liberalized It is appropriate that MDTA training programs have been strengthened during a period of rapidly rising employment and increasing demand for labor. Workers who are now being trained can count on finding jobs quickly and benefiting immediately from the training they receive. And the upgrading of skills for thousands of the unemployed will help to provide a more flexible and mobile labor force thus contributing to the stability of costs and prices in our expanding economy IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE LABOR MARKET Expansion of the economy is facilitated when labor markets operate efficiently. The Federal-State Employment Service is the principal agency of our manpower policy designed to help to match people with available jobs Most jobs are filled by direct hiring " at the gate " and through informal contacts with relatives and friends ; many others are filled with the assist- ance of advertisements unions private agencies college placement officers and other means. But through its more than local offices the Employment Service maintains an active placement service for all workers desiring assistance A major task of the Employment Service has been to provide job counseling and placement service to those in the labor force ( including new workers the handicapped and nonwhites ) who require special assistance to enable them to compete in the job market. The Service also provides a flow of information about changing manpower requirements in local labor markets. This information is useful in planning occupational training under the MDTA ; in reorientation of our vocational education programs ; and in helping individuals to make rational vocational choices and guiding them to areas of favorable employment opportunities A Special Task Force appointed by the Secretary of Labor has studied the operation of the Employment Service and recommended ways to make it achieve its goals more effectively RAISING LABOR PRODUCTIVITY By the labor force will total about million workers. On the assumption that present programs will be continued on the scale now projected about one-tenth of these workers will be more productive because they have benefited from an MDTA or other out-of-school training program Nearly one-half will be better educated as a result of one or more of the newly enacted programs. And these benefits will be concentrated among those individuals now least likely to climb the ladder of educational opportunity America has always invested heavily in education and training and our economic achievements show that it has paid off handsomely. But the investment was not made sufficiently in all Americans and perhaps as many as a third enter the work force ill-equipped to assume a fully productive role The programs that have been begun will extend a more adequate investment in education and training to that third of our people HEALTH America is a healthy nation and Americans take justifiable pride in the quantity and quality of available medical services. Yet such significant indicators of U.S. health as life expectancy infant mortality and the incidence of heart disease must cause concern when compared with rates prevailing abroad or when our recent progress is measured against that of other nations After declining steadily and dramatically throughout the first half of this century the U.S. death rate has remained close to per of the population since By contrast in a number of other industrial coun- IOO tries death rates have fallen sharply during the past decade and life expectancy at birth exceeds that in the United States by a significant margin as much as years among males. Infant mortality has declined little since and remains close to per live births whereas it is substantially lower and falling more rapidly in many other developed countries. Changes since in selected health indicators are shown in Table TABLE Health indicators selected years 'Indicator Years Life expectancy * At birth _ White Nonwhite Atage45 White Nonwhite.

Maternal mortality has been cut by nearly percent over the past half century and by percent during the last years. Since however death rates from heart disease and cancer have each increased by one-fourth ; the U.S. rate for heart disease is among the highest in the world. Mortality rates among males in the productive age bracket of to years are substantially and consistently higher in the United States than in other industrial countries and almost twice the rate in Sweden IOI Foodborne diseases are being increasingly recognized as a leading cause of acute sickness in this country and probably account for more illness than all other environmental elements combined. Salmonellosis the most serious such disease now is much more widespread than it was years ago because of inadequate controls in new methods of food production and processing. Further almost one-third of the U.S. population is drinking water which is not assured of meeting minimal standards COST OF ILLNESS The total cost to society of illness and premature death can not be accurately measured if for no other reason than our inability to quantify the value of human life or the cost of suffering pain and grief. It is impossible to say on the basis of economic criteria alone how much should be spent on health care research and facilities. Nevertheless at close to full employment of our resources particularly of scientific and technical manpower a decision to spend more for health implies spending less elsewhere. The issue facing the Nation is not whether better health is desirable but how best to allocate resources within the health area and between health and all other competing uses Outlays for health are important in building and maintaining a productive labor force as well as in improving the lives of people and the quality of our society. The productivity of American workers could not have reached its present height if in the past there had not been investment in medical knowledge in disease prevention and in treatment and rehabilitation. Yet the potential return from further health investment remains large The annual expenditure on all health and medical care services in this country increased from $ billion in and $ billion in to approximately $ billion last year. Such expenditures now amount to percent of the gross national product ( GNP ) Private spending for personal health care more than $ billion last year accounts for about percent of personal consumption expenditures In disease and mortality during the year cost society the potential product of million man-years of work. Direct public and private expenditures for personal health care associated with illnesses in that year amounted to about $ billion whereas the indirect costs from output lost totaled almost $ billion. These figures make no allowance for the much larger losses in that year that were due to deaths occurring in earlier years or the present value of economic losses in future years resulting from current illness or death. Recent estimates of the direct and indirect costs associated with certain specific illnesses in are summarized in Table TABLE Economic costs oj illness [ Millions of dollars ] Diagnostic category Economic cost of illness : Total Mental psychoneurotic and personality disorders Diseases of circulatory system ___ Diseases of digestive system Diseases of respiratory system Injuries ._ _ Diseases of nervous system and sense organs Neoplasms Other Total costs Direct expenditures l Indirect costs Mortality Morbidity Includes only hospital and nursing home care and services of physicians dentists nurses and other health professionals associated with major diagnostic categories ; excludes drugs medical research and facilities construction training expenditures and other nonpersonal health services Equivalent to the value of lost output Losses in due to deaths throughout that year ; no allowance made for present discounted value of future losses Source : Department of Health Education and Welfare PUBLIC POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS The rapid growth of demand for medical services is a consequence of a multitude of factors some of which are strongly influenced by public policy. Rising incomes better education urbanization expanding insurance coverage the changing age structure of the population and the increased availability and effectiveness of health services are all raising demand Supply has not kept pace with the expansion of demand and at present the supply of most health services falls short of the Nation 's needs as determined by reference to medical standards of adequacy. Deliberate public and private action including new and more efficient forms of organization are required to increase the supply and accessibility of these services. But to improve the health of our population it is not enough to graduate more doctors or build more clinics. Programs are also required to translate medical needs into effective demand for health services. At the same time there must be greater coordination between demand-creating policy measures and those aimed at improving the supply and distribution of medical services and facilities Average figures conceal large differences in the incidence of illness and the availability of medical services within the United States. The distribution of doctors for example continues to vary widely from region to region and between urban and rural communities. Some differences in the distribution of facilities and the utilization of health services are consistent with an efficient allocation of resources and varying personal consumption patterns. However existing disparities in both the supply and effective demand seriously affect the relative availability and accessibility of health care throughout the country and among different income groups Thus high morbidity and mortality rates resulting from causes that have been successfully controlled in other groups still exist for nonwhites and the poor. Mortality rates among nonwhite infants more than month old are almost three times as high as those for white infants. Poverty and its attendant circumstances are a major source of increased health hazards and despite a popular desire to believe otherwise low income is often a serious barrier to obtaining medical care. The National Health Survey found that the number of physician visits a year for children from families with annual incomes below $ was only percent of the number for children from high-income families The Administration 's basic health goal as stated by the President is " to assure the availability of and accessibility to the best health care for all Americans regardless of age or geography or economic status. " To meet this goal four types of effort are necessary : ( ) expanding medical knowledge through increased basic research in the life sciences ; ( ) faster dissemination of new information and techniques to health practitioners health policymakers and the public ; ( ) more and better organized health facilities and manpower including research laboratories and medical schools general hospitals and nursing homes highly trained specialists and nursing aides ; and ( ) improved financing of medical services The first session of the 89th Congress passed a dozen major bills in the health field designed to strengthen and improve health services in all four ways Medical Research Total medical and health-related research expenditures in amounted to almost $ billion nearly percent of the Nation 's outlay for all research and development. Expenditure on medical research was more than ten times that in representing an annual increase of almost percent Federal support rose from percent to percent of the total but the Government 's role in the direct conduct of such research declined slightly from percent to percent. Public investment in health research is channeled mainly through the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) whose budget for research research facilities and training has grown from less than $ million years ago to over $ billion today. NIH support now accounts for two-fifths of all medical research expenditures in the United States Dissemination of Medical Knowledge Our knowledge of life processes and of new methods of preventing and treating disease has rapidly moved ahead of our ability to apply this knowledge widely to the health needs of the Nation. Shortening the interval between the discovery and general application of medical advances is perhaps the single most important way to improve the productivity of the medical care industry Today one cancer patient in three is being saved but wider use of existing knowledge and techniques could save half the victims of this disease More extensive use of new detection and diagnostic procedures and improved means of reaching and treating patients could reduce deaths from cervical cancer by percent by and by percent a decade from now. Instrumentation now in existence or being perfected could forestall many of the strokes which occur each year To help close such gaps between knowledge and application the Congress took a number of important steps in The Heart Disease Cancer and Stroke Amendments authorize support for a network of regional medical complexes. ( The three diseases noted in the title of the Amendments account for percent of all deaths in the United States. ) The grants will assist hospitals universities and other institutions to establish cooperative programs for research training and demonstration. Such programs will bring new scientific advances more quickly to America 's practicing physicians and their patients Medical Facilities and Manpower A country 's health standards change as income grows knowledge accumulates and concepts of adequacy evolve. Our current requirements for medical facilities and manpower reflect not only changes in the size and composition of the population and shifting patterns of disease and disability but also a growing consensus that access to high-quality services is a right of all citizens Since passage of the Hill-Burton legislation in more than $ billion including a Federal share of $ billion has been invested through this program to provide additional hospital and nursing-home capacity of more than beds. New general-hospital capacity is now being made available nationally at the rate of about beds a year. Nevertheless it is estimated that about one-third of the general-hospital capacity in the country is obsolete ; a majority of the obsolete facilities are in metropolitan areas where two-thirds of the Nation 's population live. Facilities containing beds are in need of immediate modernization or replacement and those containing another beds will require modernization before In dollar terms current modernization needs of general hospitals have been estimated at more than $ billion compared with new general-hospital requirements of less than $ billion. New financing techniques must be found to facilitate the modernization of hospitals particularly in the large urban areas where deficiencies are now largest and where existing Federal programs have their smallest impact There are also large and rising needs for medical manpower. Part of this need is being met through organizational changes that raise the productivity of doctors dentists and nurses. For example the development of group practice arrangements the use of more elaborate ( and more expensive ) hospital and office equipment reductions in travel time and the employment of paramedical personnel to perform routine or less complicated procedures have made it possible for doctors to render more and better service to larger numbers of patients than ever before The ratio of physicians to the population of the United States has been approximately constant since before World War II. The proportion actually engaged in clinical practice as opposed to teaching and research has declined markedly however. Despite measures to economize on the use of physicians ' time a substantial decline in their availability would impose strains on the cost and quality of medical services. To maintain the existing ratio of doctors to population it would be necessary for admissions to medical schools to increase approximately percent during the next decade. The Health Professions Educational Assistance Act of authorized a program of grants and loans in support of medical schools and students. In for the first time Congress established a scholarship program for needy students in the health field and added a four-year grant program for the improvement of teaching programs in the health professions Too frequently today the administration and organization of public health services are badly fragmented. Measures to stimulate better coordination of Federal State and local efforts in planning for and providing these services and the gradual replacement of prevailing categorical programs with comprehensive community health services would be desirable Financing Medical Care Private health insurance has made a major contribution to the better financing of health costs. The proportion of Americans with some form of private health insurance has risen from percent in to percent today. But gross benefits from such insurance covered only percent of total expenditures for personal health needs in Furthermore those most in need of assistance in meeting medical payments are frequently unable to buy insurance. Only about one-third of persons in families with annual incomes under $ and about one-half of all elderly persons were covered by any type of private hospital insurance in Yet these groups spend a particularly large fraction of their low incomes for health In average medical expenses amounted to percent for families with annual incomes between $ and $ compared with percent for families with incomes between $ and $ Among the most important actions of the 89th Congress was the provision of health insurance for the aged under Social Security. Medicare will protect families against the economic risk of major medical expenses in old age. Benefits for million Social Security beneficiaries plus benefits from general revenues for almost million additional elderly persons not covered by Social Security will amount to about $ billion in and will cover at least percent of the total medical costs of the aged. The basic program consists of hospital insurance extended care and home health services for the aged financed through a separate trust fund supported by employee and employer payroll taxes. A voluntary supplementary program covers physicians ' fees and other services and is financed through monthly premiums ( currently $ ) by individuals over which are matched equally by a general revenue contribution The legislation also greatly improved the quality and expanded the coverage of State medical assistance programs. The Kerr-Mills program for the aged was expanded to cover a total of about million needy persons including for the first time the blind the disabled and dependent children The Child Health amendments will make more health services available to expectant mothers infants and children including crippled and retarded children. The progressive extension of crippled children 's and child health services to youngsters throughout each State is required by Previously these programs were aimed primarily at rural areas but in the future they will provide equal assistance for low-income families in urban centers. Family planning services will also be strengthened EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY Not all groups of Americans share equally in their country 's prosperity In the average income of nonwhite families was only percent of the average income of white families. This and similar figures provide telling indicators of the task that the Nation still faces in assuring equality of opportunity and achievement for all its citizens ( Table ) They also indicate an incredible waste of our human resources Three important and distinct types of discrimination help to explain the difference between white and nonwhite incomes Discrimination results in lower wages for Negroes ( who comprise percent of the nonwhite group ) even when they are doing the same kind of work as whites. Available data show that Negroes receive less income in every industry in every occupation and at every level of education Discrimination also excludes many Negroes from higher-paying jobs that would fully utilize their talents or training. Negroes are frequently forced to hold jobs that whites with the same experience and training would not ordinarily hold ; and Negroes suffer from higher unemployment rates within all skill categories Finally part of the income difference is explained by past discrimination which has lowered the potential productivity of Negroes by providing less investment in human resources for them than for their white contemporaries This type of discrimination is manifested by lower expenditures for schools and health facilities in Negro neighborhoods Low family incomes are a product of these factors ; but low incomes would tend to perpetuate these factors even if discrimination were eliminated Low incomes for poor whites also result in lesser educational achievement poorer health fewer skills and consequently higher unemployment. To promote real equality Negroes must break through the barrier of discrimination ; but this will not be sufficient. They must also break out of the cycle of poverty T A B L E Selected measures of discrimination and inequality of opportunity Selected measure Nonwhite Income ' Median income of families Percent of households in poverty * Percent of families with incomes of $ or more $ Education Median years of school completed males years of age and over Percent completed high school persons years of age Male Female Percent college graduates persons years of age and over Labor force participation rate ( percent of noninstitutional population ) " Male.- Female.

But prosperity is also an essential requirement because it creates and opens up jobs for the disadvantaged This has been effectively demonstrated by postwar experience During the period of slow economic growth in the middle and late 's the absolute gap between Negro and white incomes and employment widened. In the median income of nonwhite families was percent of the median income of white families and the unemployment rate for nonwhites was percent compared with a rate of percent for whites By the median income of nonwhite families had fallen to percent of that of white families and the unemployment rate of nonwhites had risen to percent compared with percent for whites In a high-growth year the median income of white families increased percent over and that of nonwhites percent ; the income gap narrowed in both percentage and absolute terms as income of nonwhites rose by $ and that of whites by $ As a result the median income of nonwhites rose from percent of the median income of whites in to percent in The gains in median incomes were representative of increases throughout the income scale. In the proportion of nonwhite families with incomes of more than $ rose from percent to percent but it was still far below the figure of percent for white families. The proportion with less than $ dropped from percent to percent. Final data for wTill not be available for several months but preliminary indications suggest that incomes of Negroes again rose substantially The progress of the last two years confirms a crucial lesson. A prosperous economy and the labor demand that it generates are potent forces for eliminating discrimination and income differentials even though they can not create equality. Improved Negro purchasing power will not fully overcome the effects of discrimination but it will have a beneficial influence CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS AND ECONOMIC DISCRIMINATION The Civil Rights Act contains several important provisions that alter those conditions which make discrimination possible. Its Title VII directly outlaws discrimination in hiring firing conditions of work apprenticeship or training. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was established to carry out these provisions. The Commission began operation in July and in its first days processed more than complaints Hiring attitudes will not change abruptly but the Civil Rights Act makes an important direct attack on this basic barrier to full equality Negroes are also at a disadvantage in the housing market. Many Negroes live in substandard housing because their incomes are low ; but others are forced to do so by direct discrimination. While percent of nonwhite households with annual incomes of less than $ live in substandard housing only percent of whites at these same income levels live in such housing. Among households with more than $ a year percent of the white families live in substandard housing compared with percent for nonwhite families. Discrimination in housing forces Negroes to pay higher rents and in many places to attend inferior schools. The President has announced that he will ask for legislation to prevent discrimination in private sales or rental of housing To help Negroes achieve equality of educational opportunity the Civil Rights Act authorizes the Attorney General to file suit for the desegregation of public schools and colleges upon receipt of written complaints from parents unable to bring their own actions. After years of slow progress following the Supreme Court decision outlawing segregated schools the pace of integration has now accelerated ; but segregated housing continues to retard this process. In addition to eliminating segregation the Government is trying to improve the quality of Negro education by its new programs O $ I0 for primary and secondary education. Project Head Start and other antipoverty programs. Also Title VI of the Civil Rights Act assures that access to schools hospitals and other federally aided facilities will not be denied to anyone on the basis of his race ECONOMIC COST OF DISCRIMINATION Although economic losses are not the major reason for eliminating discrimination they serve to emphasize its economic cost to all Americans When there is a surplus of labor of all types and skills eliminating discrimination results mainly in a redistribution of income. The economic cost of discrimination becomes most evident when there is near full employment of the white labor force If economic and social policies could be specifically designed to lower Negro unemployment to the current unemployment level of whites the resulting gain in GNP would be $ billion. Part of this gain would be in wages of the new Negro employees and part would accrue as other forms of income. A further gain would result if all Negroes were able to obtain jobs which would better utilize their abilities and training National output can be further expanded by improving the average level of productivity of each individual. Education and training are two of the most important means to this end. If the average productivity of the Negro and white labor force were equalized at the white level total production would expand by $ billion. If both unemployment rates and productivity levels were equalized the total output of the economy would rise by about $ billion percent of GNP. This is a measure of the annual economic loss as a result of discrimination. Of course to achieve this increase in output some resources would have to be devoted to investment in the human capital of America 's Negro citizens. But this would be an investment yielding important economic as well as social returns for the entire Nation REDUCTION OF POVERTY Investment in human resources is a means to an end not an end in itself. It is a means to rising living standards to greater opportunity for individual achievement and to the abolition of poverty. Thus the pursuit of an effective program of human resource development and the pursuit of successful antipoverty measures are closely related processes Five years of prosperity and continued economic expansion have contributed significantly to reducing the number of people who live in poverty Between and the number of persons defined as poor decreased from million to mililon ( Table ) As a result both of further economic growth and of the new antipoverty programs the data for will undoubtedly show a further drop in the number of poor A fully employed economy is and will continue to be a powerful weapon in the war against poverty. However full employment alone is not suf- TABLE Number of poor persons and incidence of poverty Poor persons Total persons * Year Number Incidence of poverty ( percent ) a Millions of persons Data relate to March of following year.

Poverty is defined by the Social Security Administration poverty-income standard ; it takes into account family size composition and place of residence. Poverty-income lines are adjusted to take account of price changes during the period Sources : Department of Commerce and Department of Health Education and Welfare ficient. The purpose of the Economic Opportunity Act of is to promote investment in the health education training and work experience of the poor which will enable them to contribute more effectively and thereby to earn incomes more comparable to those in the rest of society Many public and private programs exist to help to eradicate poverty and to aid the needy. The Office of Economic Opportunity ( OEO ) was established by the Act to coordinate these efforts and to develop new approaches to combat the multiple causes of poverty. Several of the Administration 's antipoverty programs are discussed in the section on education. In addition OEO 's Community Action Programs discussed in the Council 's Report are mobilizing local and Federal resources to aid the poor. This year important new data on the incidence of poverty are presented which illustrate the progress of the past years CHANGES IN POVERTY : In order to assess progress and to evaluate alternative approaches effectively it is necessary to have a clear-cut quantitative definition of poverty Last year the Social Security Administration developed the present definition which takes account of differing family size and composition and differences between living conditions in urban areas and on farms. This new poverty-income definition is based on a minimum nutritionally sound food plan designed by the Department of Agriculture for " temporary or emergency use when funds are low. " The food costs in this subsistence plan are used to determine the minimum total income requirements for different-sized families. Budget levels for farm families are reduced by percent to allow for lower cash expenditures required where home-grown food is available and to recognize the lower cost of farm housing. Computed in III this way the poverty-income line for nonfarm individuals was $ ; for farm individuals $ Four-person nonfarm families were defined as poor if their money income was below $ ; for farm families of this size the poverty-income line was $ Income standards for past years were adjusted to take account of price changes during the period Although no statistical definition of poverty is available which fully recognizes such factors as regional differences in the cost of living and which allows for differences in asset-holdings of families there can be little dispute that almost all people with incomes at or below these minima are indeed poor The new figures on the number of poor show clearly the relationship between over-all economic conditions and the incidence of poverty. In poor persons represented percent of the total noninstitutional population. By the number had dropped by million to percent of the population. For the period as a whole the incidence of poverty declined by of a percentage point a year. From to a period which included a recession the number of poor declined by an average of persons a year. During the subsequent two years of expansion the average decrease was a year TABLE Number of poor households and incidence of povetty by race and All Ids Item White Nonwhite Millions Number Unrelated individuals Under years of age years of age and over Families of or more With no children under years of age.

Poverty is denned by the Social Security Administration poverty-income standard ; it takes into account family size composition and place of residence Sources : Department of Commerce Department of Health Education and Welfare and Council of Economic Advisers A similar improvement can be seen in the number of poor households ( including unrelated individuals as one-person households ) Their number fell from million in to million in This represented a drop in the incidence of family poverty from percent to percent ( Table ) The encouraging record of progress is marred however by the figures for particular groups. The total number of poor unrelated individuals over years of age increased by during the period. This increase is explained by the fact that the total number of unrelated individuals over years of age increased by million during this period. The incidence of poverty among such individuals actually declined however The number of large families with or more children living in poverty also showed no decline remaining constant at about million. The total number of poor children in such families however decreased slightly during the 5-year period Progress in alleviating poverty has also been slow among families headed by females ( including women living alone ) In there were million such poor households ; in million The total number of poor nonwhite households declined by between and The largest declines were among childless nonwhite families and single persons under However in almost percent of all nonwhite families with children were still living in poverty Although the incidence of poverty is far higher among nonwhites the aged and white families headed by females than for the population generally ; however families headed by white males below age accounted for nearly one-fourth of all poor households in ( Table ) Encouraging progress has been made during the last years but the dimensions of poverty in America are still disturbing. Expanded investment in human resources and the eradication of racial discrimination are vital parts of the total antipoverty program. However for the aged and for families headed by females continued improvement of income-maintenance programs remains the major route out of poverty since most of them are not and can not be active members of the labor force INCOME MAINTENANCE Over the last years the United States has developed a set of public income maintenance programs for many families who need assistance in order to maintain adequate standards of living. In fiscal year an estimated $ billion of the $ billion total spent on these public transfer payment programs went to persons who were or would otherwise have been below the poverty-income line ; these payments helped to raise some million households out of poverty but about million units still received insufficient income to meet the minimal living levels now used to define poverty. People who remained poor received about $ billion of all public transfer payments. To eliminate completely the poverty-income gap the amount by which total money income falls short of meeting the poverty-income standard would require that almost $ billion be added to the income of the poor In of the million persons who failed to meet the Social Security Administration poverty-income standard million ( percent ) were children under years of age million ( percent ) were years old or over and million ( percent ) were neither aged nor children under Public assistance payments ( including those under State-local general assistance programs ) went to only million of these people just over onefifth of the noninstitutionalized needy. ( Some aid was also provided to additional persons in institutions and to almost aged persons who received help only in meeting their medical bills. ) About million poor persons were not receiving aid under public assistance programs in June : million poor children their million parents and about million aged. The remainder of the unaided poor were adults aged without dependent children Eight million poor persons were aided by other Federal income maintenance programs including an estimated million of the million beneficiaries under Social Security ( OASDI ) The remainder received payments under such programs as unemployment insurance veterans ' pensions and compensation Railroad Retirement and workmen 's compensation The highest proportion of needy persons aided by income-maintenance programs is found among those aged or over and those under While there are a large number of programs that help the poor in the age range large gaps in coverage exist under present arrangements. About half of the poor now receive no public transfer income In addition to the large gaps in coverage under existing public assistance programs the benefits paid to the eligible poor are often extremely low Most persons now receiving assistance do not receive enough to enable them to live at even a minimum subsistence level. For example the average annual total income of aged public assistance recipients is $ a person ; of blind recipients $ a person ; of disabled recipients $ a person ; and for families with dependent children $ a family ( four persons ) For a mother and three children this amounts to only $ a day for each person to cover the costs of food shelter clothing and all the other necessities of life Increasing concern about these problems is producing a variety of new income-maintenance proposals. One approach would make public assistance coverage more comprehensive and assure all recipients more adequate benefit levels. Another approach is the institution of uniformly determined payments to families based only on the amount by which their incomes fall short of minimum subsistence levels. Such a system could be integrated with the existing income tax system. This plan is now receiving intensive study by many scholars. It could be administered on a universal basis for all the poor and would be the most direct approach to reducing poverty In future years these and other proposals deserve further exploration Chapter Areas for Further Legislative Progress in I AST YEAR 'S legislative achievements mark a major milestone in the J social and economic progress of the American people. The President 's program for contains fewer items of economic legislation ; yet it includes major proposals relating to several key areas of the economy This chapter presents three areas of importance for the domestic economy in which there are new proposals and provides some of the relevant economic background. The economic background for other new proposals is developed in Chapters and THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT Every large metropolitan area is a cluster of communities usually consisting of a central core city plus surrounding suburbs. Almost without exception the central core cities which are the heart of the metropolitan area have experienced a gradual process of physical and economic deterioration. Partly as a result of people 's desire for more space and homeownership and made possible by the development of the automobile central cities have been losing middle- and upper-income families to the suburbs. This movement accelerated when cities became caught in a vicious spiral of spreading slums rising crime and worsening congestion. Once a neighborhood began to deteriorate it did not pay any individual landlord to attempt to stem the decline ; the private return on new investment fell since little extra rent could be charged for better apartments in slum areas. This deterioration was accentuated by housing shortages after World War II and by the artificial shortages created by racial discrimination in housing which preserves a captive market for dilapidated slum buildings in large cities all over the United States. As a result primarily two groups of people have tended to remain in core cities the very rich who can afford to live in luxury apartments and the poor especially minorities who have no choice but to live in the limited housing available to them This process has created an almost impossible financial situation for many cities. They have had to bear public assistance payments and other welfare costs for the low-income groups in the slums as well as to continue n6 to provide mass transportation fire and police protection and education ; but their tax base has failed to expand correspondingly as the highand middle-income groups and some industry and commerce have fled the city a departure speeded by rising tax rates Although housing deterioration is perhaps the most important single factor contributing to the decline of central cities it is but one of many handicaps facing downtown areas. Many families have moved to the suburbs but their jobs have not moved to the same extent. This means that an increasing number of individuals must commute to work in the central city. Compounding this problem has been the increase in urban land values which encourages taller buildings with dense occupancy. As the buildings become larger the number of people who have to be transported to a particular point expands putting an additional strain on the transportation system. Congestion with all of its ramifications is the result Since builders do not have to bear the costs of bringing workers from low density suburban areas to very high density central cities in rush hour peak periods these costs fall upon local governments which must make large investments in transportation facilities. From the point of view of efficiency these investments often should have been in facilities for mass transit. Instead for many reasons they have been primarily in automobile expressways which only increase the congestion in the center Many of the problems of central cities such as air pollution can be traced to the increasing size and density of America 's urban population. In small cities or rural areas automobile fumes are not a serious problem since the natural cleaning capacities of the air are enough to eliminate noxious fumes. As the number of automobiles increases the natural capacities of the air to purify itself are reached and surpassed. Similar factors are evident in water supplies. As population densities rise local wells and streams become inadequate. Water has to be brought from increasingly distant areas at rising cost In small cities extensive city parks and open areas are less necessary since individuals can easily reach natural recreation areas ; but in major metropolitan centers natural recreation areas may be many miles away. As a city grows parks playgrounds and other recreational resources become more necessary but they also become much more expensive because of high land values in the core. Although recreational areas and open spaces can be supplied privately the importance of outdoor areas for calm healthy living means that these goods should not be confined strictly to those able to pay the price These formidable problems have made it necessary for the Federal Government to attempt to stimulate the search for new and creative solutions IMPROVING OUR CITIES The Housing and Urban Development Act of the Cabinet Department created last year and legislation in the areas of mass transportation civil rights and economic opportunity constitute a major Federal effort to aid urban development The strategy for improving our urban environment embodied in this legislation has a double emphasis. First it focuses on the quality of residential neighborhoods including both the adequacy of housing and the suitability of the related community facilities. Second while retaining flexibility to meet the separate needs of central cities and suburbs it views them as an interrelated area and insists that public and private efforts follow consistent and coordinated plans comprehending the entire urban complex if they are to receive Federal support Federal mortgage insurance public and low-rent housing programs and urban renewal have long had influence upon the pattern of metropolitan development. The Housing and Urban Development Act contains additional tools for dealing with these problems. It provides assistance for community facilities ranging from neighborhood centers to city parks and playgrounds. The open space program will be expanded by grants for urban beautification. Grants to cover interest charges on loans for the acquisition of land for public facilities in advance of its development before speculative influences inflate prices should reduce future problems in this area as well as encourage long-range plans for efficient land use The Act also continues the urban renewal program and authorizes an additional $ billion in grants. It strengthens requirements for workable programs and emphasizes the importance of building codes zoning ordinances local tax policies and development standards. It provides grants to municipalities to help to defray the costs of enforcing codes and where necessary demolishing unsound structures A major innovation in the Act is the program for rent supplements Under this program more than units of new or rehabilitated housing are scheduled to be approved over the next years. The Federal Government will pay nonprofit cooperative and limited-dividend owners of private property the difference between fair market rents for their units and one-fourth of an occupant 's income. Like interest subsidy programs rent supplements can help to encourage construction and rehabilitation of adequate housing for low-income families The destruction of old neighborhoods as a result of urban renewal frequently involves high human costs. New public housing and rent supplement programs facilitate the purchase or rehabilitation of older housing and thus help to maintain and restore existing neighborhoods. Moreover newly authorized grants for projects of code enforcement in deteriorating areas may conserve older residential neighborhoods and prevent or retard the development of slums. Joint administrative action by the Urban Renewal Administration and the Federal Housing Administration since early has resulted in the rehabilitation of over units ; another are currently undergoing rehabilitation n8 Where substandard housing has blighted a whole area however the most economic approach often is to clear the entire area to provide space for new housing or other uses consistent with an over-all urban plan. Relocation payments to ease the hardships incurred by such clearing were liberalized in and the Act extended such payments to families displaced by the construction of mass transportation systems by community and neighborhood facilities programs or advance land acquisition as well as by urban renewal or public housing programs The President 's new proposals for legislation contemplate the planned rebuilding on a demonstration basis of large areas of a number of cities of all sizes enlisting local and private resources along with new measures of Federal assistance. The details of the program will be presented in a separate message The establishment last year of the Department of Housing and Urban Development did not itself add to the list of Federal policy instruments available to our cities. But it will make all these instruments and the new ones to be proposed more effective by providing an organizational focus for a unified Federal approach to metropolitan redevelopment change and growth. It will assure that all Federal programs that affect the city and its people will be brought to bear effectively to solve the city 's problems THE ABATEMENT OF POLLUTION Contamination of the environment is a problem of major national proportions. Polluted streams are found in all sections of the country. They increase the cost of obtaining fresh water supplies for municipalities and industry ; they impair the recreational and aesthetic values of our areas of greatest natural beauty ; and they destroy useful aquatic life. Air pollution is found in every major metropolitan area. Buildings and vegetation are damaged ; transportation and communication are delayed ; the attractiveness of our cities is reduced ; and chronic health damage may result Obsolete methods of solid waste disposal create problems in both urban and rural areas. The approaches to major cities are marred by unsightly accumulations of automobiles. The burning of rubbish in open dumps causes air pollution and the careless use of refuse for land fill causes extensive stream pollution. Pesticides in water and soil have been found harmful to all forms of life It is not difficult to understand why an industrial society produces excessive amounts of pollution. For most resources users are charged amounts which represent the value of these resources to others ; indeed this is a basic reason for the efficiency of a market economy. In the case of pollution however those who contaminate the environment are not charged in accordance with the damage they do. Thus the cost of a municipality 's discharge ot raw sewage into a stream is borne not by the local residents but by potential downstream users. And the cost of discharge of sulfurous fumes into the air by a thermal electric plant is not borne by the users of electricity but by the citizens who breathe the polluted air. Public policies must be designed to reduce the discharge of wastes in ways and amounts that more nearly reflect the full cost of environmental contamination Water pollution is primarily a product of organic wastes in the process of decomposing and of the phosphates nitrates and other minerals contained in discharges. The decomposition of organic wastes removes oxygen from the water limiting its capacity to support fish and wildlife and its desirability for recreation. The inorganic substances cause water hardness stream discoloration and odor and the growth of algae. Damage from pollution is suffered by municipalities industries agriculture and fisheries that can not use contaminated water and by individuals as a result of the aesthetic and recreational losses. Costs of treatment by municipalities and industries are a measure of the first type of damage ; lower property values in the vicinity of polluted waters indicate aesthetic losses. An exact value can not yet be placed on these losses. The capital cost of additional plants for municipal sewage treatment to the extent necessary to allow the use of streams for other than disposal of wastes is estimated at $ billion over the next years ; recreational losses alone are estimated to be in excess of $ billion a year Air pollution also has considerable impact on the health and welfare of the Nation. More than half is from automobiles and most of the remainder from industry electric power generation and refuse burning. The costs of property damage alone have been estimated as exceeding $ billion a year ; aesthetic and health damages substantially increase this cost Improper disposal of garbage rubbish and junk automobiles has imposed costs on neighboring residences and industries. Installed incinerator capacity would have to be increased percent at an estimated cost of $ million to bring disposal in all cities to the minimum Public Health Service standards for air pollution. Since the Korean war a stock of more than ^ million junk automobiles has been accumulated in farmers ' fields garage lots junkyards or along highways. These junk piles have become so offensive that a number of cities such as St. Paul and Oklahoma City have removed them to isolated locations PROGRAMS FOR POLLUTION ABATEMENT Governments have recognized the damages from pollution and have acted in several ways to prohibit or limit the dumping of untreated wastes. First both State and Federal statutes authorize the regulation of waste disposal to improve the quality of the environment. Second most municipalities provide public facilities for the collection and treatment of waterborne wastes ; in addition the Federal Government provides financial assistance to municipalities for the construction of such facilities and for devices to measure air pollution. It would be desirable wherever feasible to add as a third method a system of economic incentives to abate waste discharges Incentives might include fees or charges levied against a pollutor in accordance with the damages caused by his pollutants The existing programs have been partially successful. In many areas raw sewage and industrial wastes are no longer freely dumped into streams often as a direct result of Federal proceedings. Half of the total population now lives in cities and towns where municipal sewage at least receives treatment to remove solid matter. Reports on air quality based on new monitoring systems have increased community awareness of the pollution problem and have led to some programs of abatement. The extent and results of Federal concern however have been limited Enforcement of Water Quality Standards Federal agencies have been concerned with water pollution since passage of the Rivers and Harbors Act of prohibiting discharges that impeded navigation. This and succeeding legislation of the same kind had little effect on dumping of municipal and industrial wastes however. Not until the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of provided Federal authority to require the elimination of waste discharges in interstate waters were effective abatement policies inaugurated at the Federal level. The and Amendments strengthened and broadened the enforcement powers to deal with pollution problems within the confines of one State ( upon the invitation of the State government ) " Enforcement " begins with collecting evidence that the pollution endangers the health or welfare of specific persons continues with a conference of control agencies leading to a schedule of remedial measures and if necessary culminates in public hearings and court action to effect the remedial measures As a result of actions taken under this procedure there have been significant improvements in water quality. Between and completed Federal enforcement actions at specific locations resulted in the reduction of pollution to an acceptable level. For example in the Corney Creek drainage basin of Arkansas-Louisiana oil field brines were brought under control so as to reduce significantly chloride pollution destructive to agriculture and fishing. In the Animas River in Colorado and New Mexico radioactive uranium milling wastes that contaminated water supplies were brought under control. In the lower Columbia River significant progress has been made in cleaning up parts of the river fouled by pulp and paper wastes and municipal discharges The conference procedure however is cumbersome and time consuming Abatement has seldom taken place within years of public notice of Federal surveys and half of the actions begun as long ago as have not yet been completed The long delays in some cases result from the technological problems involved in achieving adequate treatment of particular wastes. But most of the delays follow from difficulties with organizational and financial arrangements among Federal State and local governments. Municipalities frequently refuse to band together to construct area-wide treatment systems so as to take advantage of economies in larger pipeline and plant operations Communities operating independently have experienced delays in getting voter authorizations for financing or have not constructed adequate plants because of local limitations on borrowing. Enforcement schedules have had to be set to take account of such local problems The enforcement action to curtail pollution in the Potomac River illustrates these problems of finance and organization. The first session of the conference of control agencies was held in Water quality has improved somewhat since then. But raw sewage continues to be dumped into the river because certain local treatment facilities were not constructed and arrangements for combining the facilities of a number of Virginia communities were not worked out. Not until the construction last year of the large Dulles Airport sewer were several Virginia communities finally integrated into the District of Columbia system More rapid progress is possible. The Water Quality Act established a program and a new agency the Water Pollution Control Administration in the Department of Health Education and Welfare ( HEW ) to consolidate and expand enforcement activities. States are required to set water quality standards on their portions of interstate waters and to establish enforcement procedures by July or else the new agency must do so. Water quality below these standards is subject to the Federal abatement proceedings without detailed proof of specific damages. As a consequence enforcement procedures can take place concurrently on all interstate waters and an accelerated approach to acceptable water quality can result Enforcement of Air Quality Standards The Clean Air Act of provides for cooperation between State and Federal agencies in dealing with air pollution and establishes an enforcement procedure similar in the first stages to that for water pollution. The program has not been in operation long enough to have had substantial effects on air quality. In the Act was amended to require that national standards be set for automobile exhaust emissions on model cars Federal Financial Assistance for Pollution Abatement Enforcement actions have been combined with financial incentives. The Water Pollution Control Act provides for technical assistance matching grants for the construction of waste treatment facilities and assistance on comprehensive or area-wide planning of treatment facilities. The extent of financial assistance is limited however. Because of restrictions on the dollar amount provided to any one city on average only percent of State and local authorities ' total expenditures on treatment and only about percent of large cities ' expenditures have been covered The combination of clumsy enforcement procedures and limited incentive grants has so far been insufficient to give promise of cleaning up water pollution within a reasonable period. Adequate treatment is now provided for the wastes in areas containing only percent of the population ; at the present rate of construction new facilities will little more than keep pace with the growth of population An extended program was authorized by the last session of Congress. Legislation increased the total authorization of Federal grants for treatment facilities and relaxed somewhat the dollar limits on individual grants. Additional Federal assistance was included in the Economic Development Act of and as part of the programs of the Department of Agriculture and of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Federal help is also available for monitoring and controlling air pollution for research activities on water and air pollution and for demonstration projects for the control of wastes from storm sewers. But grant limits are still restrictive and the research can not be expected to produce immediate results Rubbishy Garbage and Junk Automobiles Solid waste disposal has long been a service of local government ; recently some Federal aid has been provided for extending this service. The Department of Housing and Urban Development will help communities plan for solid waste disposal programs and for the construction of facilities. Research and equipment demonstrations have been organized in HEW and the Department of the Interior following last year 's Solid Waste Disposal Act Last year 's Highway Beautification Act calls for the screening or removal of junk yards from areas adjacent to federally assisted highways. This is essential as a beginning attack on the problem but much more can be done in the reuse of waste materials. The emphasis in this legislation is on screening the junk from view rather than moving it through the scrap utilization process. Unless it is moved more rapidly the increasing number of automobiles to be junked will engulf more and more of our countryside in the next few years. Research on new methods of melting and shredding junk automobiles for economical use by the steel industry shows long-term promise for keeping the junk automobile problem within manageable dimensions NEW FEDERAL LEADERSHIP IN POLLUTION ABATEMENT Leadership begins with setting the example : Federal facilities should demonstrate the nature and extent of practical pollution abatement. In an Executive Order of November the President required that water pollution from all Federal facilities be controlled. Despite budgetary stringency expenditures for waste treatment at Federal installations are being stepped up in the year ahead. A similar order on air pollution from Federal installations is forthcoming Federal leadership could be more effective if the recently required water quality standards for interstate waters could be extended to cover waters entirely within one State and if the existing enforcement procedures could be accelerated. If information on waste discharge could be obtained from all pollutors when necessary stream deterioration could more effectively be predicted and prevented Pollution control can be truly effective only if it covers all sources in a river basin and only if it is based on the relationships between stream quality at any one location and the discharges at all upstream locations. Methods must be devised to assure that upstream treatment is coordinated with downstream water use. The Government is taking the lead in experiments to achieve such coordination. For the Potomac River hopefully pollutionfree by the Government has proposed that the enforcement action be accelerated by bringing together the localities in four States to begin treating the pollution problem as a river basin problem. The President has announced that he will propose to extend the example of the Potomac in order to demonstrate how entire river basins can become scenic and recreational assets Although it must assist in eliminating the large backlog of capital requirements the Federal Government can not and should not finance local waste treatment indefinitely. In the long run localities should collect revenues from the pollutors adequate to sustain the system and to expand it in line with normal growth. Charges based on use of treatment facilities provide long-run incentives for the abatement of pollution. Effluent charges on pollutors in sections of the river where there is no municipal treatment could have a similar effect : when waste discharges cost the industrial firm a certain amount for every pound discharged the volume of wastes will be reduced and the revenue collected will help to pay for collective treatment Existing Federal programs for pollution abatement even when strengthened by the new measures to be proposed can not be expected by themselves to eliminate the pollution problem in this country. If unlike our fathers we are to leave a cleaner America to those who follow then pollution abatement has to become not only a more pressing concern of localities States and the Federal Government but also an urgent concern of corporate and individual policy EFFICIENCY IN TRANSPORTATION The national transportation system is a crucial element in our economy Personal mobility of Americans is unparalleled because of both public transportation and the private automobile. Freight transportation with which this discussion is primarily concerned created the first and biggest of the common markets thus permitting other industries to capitalize upon the economies of specialization and large-scale production Since World War II the productivity of our transportation industries has increased with Government support through an impressive number of innovations. The postwar development of long-haul trucking has added new flexibility in service time-in-transit and origins and destinations served The emergence of air travel has not only vastly increased the mobility of millions of Americans but also has permitted overnight coast-to-coast movement of mail and high-value freight. New high-pressure large-diameter pipelines have lowered the cost of moving oil and provided the benefits of natural gas to cities many hundreds of miles away from the gas fields. Improved barge equipment has substantially increased productivity of carriers on the inland waterways As a result of these innovations the different forms of transportation have experienced varying growth rates high for motor carriers and oil pipelines and low for railroads. As shown in Table railroad freight traffic did not participate at all in the growth of the total transportation market between and The railroad share of total ton-miles declined at an average rate of nearly percentage point a year from to Meanwhile the share of motor carriers rose steadily. Since however the market share of the railroads has been stabilized. This has followed in part from imaginative new services such as truck trailers on flat cars and three-decker automobile carriers and from concurrent reductions in rail rates TABLE Volume of intercity freight traffic selected years Transport agency Billions of ton miles Number of ton miles l Total Railways Motor vehicles Inland waterways. Oil pipelines Percent Percentage distribution * Total2 Railways Motor vehicles Inland waterways. Oil pipelines Estimates Total includes airways freight not shown separately in this table Preliminary * Percentage distribution based on unrounded data Source : Interstate Commerce Commission The emergence of new forms of transportation and the resulting changes in traffic patterns are only the more dramatic manifestations of technical change. Truck trailers have steadily increased in size ; freight cars have become bigger lighter and smoother riding ; and jets have replaced piston O aircraft. All of these innovations have provided more ton-miles of transport per unit of capital and labor Private initiative has been facilitated by public investment in transportation facilities such as in the Interstate Highway System and the Federal Airways System. Recently public investment has taken the form of direct aid to innovation ; for example for the development and demonstration of high-speed rail passenger trains in the Northeast corridor between Boston and Washington. The extent of Federal involvement is reflected in the more than $ billion expended during on domestic transportation programs such as highway construction river and harbors navigation aid and airways operations and construction While these dramatic changes have been taking place. Federal policy has also been evolving. Although the formal philosophy of regulatory policy has not been reshaped since many changes have been taking place through decisions in individual cases and legislative amendments. Four main directions of Federal policy appear to be emerging : ( ) the development of a rate structure more oriented toward costs ; ( ) the planning of transportation to provide comprehensive services ; ( ) promoting the adjustment of transport investment to meet changing demand requirements ; and ( ) speeding the response to new technical opportunities COST-ORIENTED RATES Rates charged by carriers are the signals that guide shippers to select that form of transportation which minimizes transportation costs for a particular shipment. Intelligent shippers always balance carrier rates against service advantages in terms of time-in-transit warehousing shipment size and possible freight damage. Shippers can be counted upon to make the most economical choices from their own standpoint. But these choices will not necessarily be the most economical from the standpoint of the national economy unless carrier rates truly reflect the cost to the economy of the service including provision for adequate carrier profits. Hence one condition for transportation efficiency is a cost-oriented rate structure Yet transportation rates still depend in part on so-called " value of service. " This is usually defined in terms of value of shipment rates are higher for diamonds than for coal shipments of the same size. Rates are also set sometimes by carriers and approved by the regulatory commissions to preserve historical divisions of traffic among modes of transport. Reductions in rates made possible by reductions in costs are often opposed and may be disallowed because they are not in line with value of service or because they are destructive of existing traffic shares In recent years competing carriers have increasingly sought to prevent rate reductions based on costs. For example in the Interstate Commerce Commission ( ICC ) handled protests on rate adjustments About percent ( protests ) involved rate reductions and three-fourths ( ) were from competing carriers rather than customers. Such a distribution of protests reflects an attempt to orient regulation to the settlement of disputes between competitors on tonnage shares. Although protests before the ICC Board of Suspension were involved in only about l/i percent of the rates filed with the ICC in the controversial rate reductions have been the important cases A major example of the attachment to rates based on existing divisions of tonnage rather than to rate reductions permitting the introduction of cost saving innovations is illustrated by the ICC case Coal to New York Harbor. Multiple carload service which allowed considerable cost savings was one alternative means of shipment for more than million tons of coal annually to East Coast electric generating stations. The alternative proposed by the railroads was to reduce rates on higher-cost single carload service but only on the million tons competitive with oil. The Commission approved the selective rate reductions on the carload service since multiple carload rates " would have application to all coal received by utilities only a part of which is vulnerable to displacement by oil " and thus would include more extensive rate reductions than necessitated by demand conditions. The historical pattern of rates was protected until competitive forces finally brought about across-the-board reductions and the lower-cost multiple carload service in For maximum economic efficiency rates should be related to costs but not to an arbitrary allocation of costs. Railroads and pipelines require large indivisible capital inputs such as rights-of-way and terminals. These indivisibilities result in relatively high fixed costs which if allocated over each traffic unit on an arbitrary basis result in average costs unrelated to the variable expenses of additional traffic. These average costs do not and can not serve as a rigid basis for rate making " Cost-oriented rates " in the true economic sense are related to the economist 's concept of marginal cost the increase in total expenses as a result of carrying additional ton-miles of traffic. In order to ensure efficiency marginal rather than average cost should be the principal regulatory criterion in applications for rate reductions. Some traffic on which rate reductions are not proposed will pay more than marginal cost and in this fashion fixed costs will be met. But where competition and new technology dictate rate reductions competitive rates could be lowered to the level of marginal cost. The gains for users from allowing rates to be appropriately geared to costs include lower rates on a larger volume of shipments. On railroad transportation alone according to an independent estimate savings from possible rate reductions would come to more than $ million a year At the same time costs should reflect the value of all resources required to provide the service. Federally provided transportation facilities have continually expanded. Users should pay their fair share of the cost and maintenance of the highways waterways and airways facilities. As it is there are uneven payments from different classes of users some making substantial payments and others none at all. Adequate user charges should be instituted in the interest of both equity and over-all transportation efficiency The President 's Budget Message again proposes new or increased transportation user charges COMPREHENSIVE POLICY PLANNING Because there is competition among types of carriers for substantial portions of the freight tonnage policies affecting one segment of the industry impinge upon other segments. A comprehensive approach to transportation recognizes the costs and services of each component part and develops rate and service policies that provide transportation at minimum costs to the Nation. This approach is now followed to some extent by the independent regulatory commissions and the Executive Branch of the Federal Government and is effected through considerable informal policy coordination. But it must be extended by organizational reform Each one of a number of executive agencies is now responsible for an aspect of transportation policy. An effective means for promoting transport development will be to combine all the major programs now within the Executive Branch in a single Department of Transportation as the President has proposed. This will include the transportation activities now under the Department of Commerce as well as the promotional and safety functions in aviation urban mass transit and maritime shipping. The new Department will be an effective instrument for the coordinated development of a national transportation system FLEXIBILITY IN TRANSPORT INVESTMENT Traditionally common carriers have a duty to serve. Regulation has institutionalized that obligation with controls over entry and abandonments. The rationale for such controls has been partially undermined however by technological changes particularly in intercity trucking. Trucks now can quickly bring service to shippers without the large fixed investment required in railroading or pipelines. Regulatory policy has not yet fully capitalized upon this flexibility of truck capital and operations While controls over entry and abandonment are surely desirable considerably more flexibility would seem to be appropriate in this period of promising technical developments particularly in railroads and trucks in order to free private initiative to perform its traditional function of economizing. More liberal standards for the modification of the scope of service offered by a carrier and particularly for the abandonment of unneeded railroad service could allow a competing service if available and more efficient to handle the traffic. Investment capital is scarce ; if capital can be withdrawn from little used service capacity can be expanded in the areas of profitable growth SPEED OF RESPONSE TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE Growing efficiency in transportation requires that new technological opportunities be seized promptly. With a constantly changing technology the lag between average practice and the best possible practice is critical and reducing this lag will increase productivity gains. Prompt adoption of new technical opportunities enhances the returns to the public and to the carrier from private initiative in innovation The nature of the problem is illustrated by the case of the " Big John " freight car service. The Southern Railway announced in June that shipments of grain would be made in new four-compartment aluminum cars each able to transport tons. The service was to consist of 450-ton shipments in groups of five " Big John " cars at rates approximately percent below the prevailing carload rates. This service was suspended and appealed through the courts to the Supreme Court twice once on the matter of continuing suspension beyond the maximum 7month period the second time on the reasonableness of rates. Rate reductions were permitted in on a provisional basis pending final action Only after the final court review in September were the rates found to be " just and reasonable. " Difficulties of this type will be mitigated as cost-oriented rates and flexibility in investment become more integral parts of regulatory policy. The benefits of the " Big John " for example extend beyond the carrier and the shipper to the economy of the region served. Consumer savings estimated at $ $ million annually on meat bread butter and milk have occurred in the Southern Railway region from the expansion of the livestock and grain industries. No economy can be fully efficient if it takes years to determine pricing for such new innovations Other innovations cut across carrier types as in the trailer-on-flat-car service. New technological opportunities could be fully exploited by removing obstacles to combinations of modes of transport and by more ready acceptance of shipper and carrier-owned equipment by railroads and motor carriers MARITIME POLICY A special relationship has long existed between the Government and the maritime industry. For reasons of defense the Federal Government provides extensive assistance to our merchant marine. In the past year an Interagency Task Force completed a comprehensive study of U.S. maritime policy. Its many recommendations were designed in part to improve the competitive position of the industry. Bulk ships of a new and specialized construction would be built and subsidized enabling their operators to compete for commercial bulk cargoes. In addition cargo preference would be modified and ultimately eliminated Operating subsidies would be restructured by adding incentives to reward efficiency. Operators of unprofitable subsidized passenger operations would be encouraged to phase out their operations. Greater operating freedom in route selection would be granted to U.S. operators and a reduction of detailed Government supervision would be instituted The subsidy for U.S. shipyard support would be related to national emergency need for shipyard capability. Beyond that need ships could be built either in the United States or abroad whichever was more economical for the ship operator In view of the major restructuring of maritime policy recommended in the report the maritime industry and maritime specialists both within and outside Government have been asked to study the proposals. Their reactions and suggestions will serve as a constructive basis for implementing new directions in this portion of transportation Chapter Progress and Problems in Agriculture AGRICULTURE is one of the most progressive segments of the ~ \ American economy. Productivity has grown faster there than in any other major economic sector. U.S. agricultural abundance is the envy of the world. Yet incomes of most farm families continue to fall short of those earned in other occupations. And agricultural employment is steadily declining. This paradox is a perennial source of confusion and protest For many years our commercial farms have had a total capacity to produce far in excess of the ability of our markets to absorb at reasonable prices The causes of this are not hard to understand. As incomes have expanded an ever smaller fraction of them has been used to buy the products of our farms. Over the past years disposable real income per capita in the American economy has nearly doubled ; per capita consumption of farm products has risen by only percent. As we become more affluent we eat better and dress better. But most of our additional income goes for other goods and services that require little or no input from farms. Because the " income elasticity " of demand for farm products is low the fraction of the labor force engaged in agriculture would be expected to decline as total incomes rise This relative decline in the need for farmers ' services has been greatly intensified by another essential fact : the productivity of farm workers has been increasing much more rapidly than productivity in the economy generally. Because of the slow growth of demand and the rapid increase in productivity there has been a persistent tendency for farm products to be overproduced depressing farm prices. But the " price elasticity " of demand is likewise low : lower market prices do not result in greatly increased consumption of most farm products in the U.S. market Exactly years ago the American farm population reached its peak million people percent of the total population. One American farm worker produced sufficient food and fiber to supply himself and other people. Today farm people total less than million and make up percent of the population. Each farm worker produces enough food and fiber to meet the needs of more than persons The steady and rapid decline in the demand for farm labor and the natural increase of the farm population have meant that agriculture is rapidly expelling a sizable fraction of its actual and potential workers Since million people on the average million a year have left the farm. Although the vast migration from farm to nonfarm occupations and from rural to urban areas proves that mobility is high the outward movement has never been fast enough to improve significantly the economic position of farm labor relative to labor in the nonfarm economy. Despite programs designed to minimize the income gap farm incomes historically have been depressed relative to incomes elsewhere Today incomes of many farm families are low particularly incomes of those who live on small inefficient farms and who have been unable to adapt to modern agricultural technology. However a substantial number of farmers who have successfully adapted and who produce the bulk of our food and fiber are realizing incomes nearly equal to what their resources could earn off the farm For many low-income persons a move to nonfarm occupations is not possible. Some farm residents are too old do not have or can not acquire the necessary skills or simply lack the resources needed to finance a change Consequently the least mobile portion of the farm labor force remains stranded in eddies of rural unemployment or underemployment on small farms or in barely remunerative rural nonfarm occupations. Poverty is one of rural life 's most urgent yet neglected problems. And some of those who do move to cities in hope for a better life often find themselves ill equipped for the jobs that are available and socially unable to adjust to the ways of urban life Farm people who are able to migrate successfully usually earn more than they could in farming. Those who remain are helped as well since the transfer of labor out of agriculture reduces the excess resources which hold down average farm incomes These few basic considerations oversimplify the complex factors at work in U.S. agriculture and the difficult issues involved in framing agricultural policy. Some of these issues and complexities are discussed in the sections which follow : the changing importance of labor land and purchased inputs in farming ; the potentially vast but uncertain world market for our farm products ; the increasingly separate problems of commercial agriculture and of rural poverty ; and the various public policy approaches for dealing with these problems COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE IN THE 'S Midway through the 's commercial agriculture is a highly efficient competitive industry adjusting to market forces and a rapidly changing technology. Labor and to a lesser extent land are being replaced by such other inputs as fertilizers insecticides machinery and equipment. Bigger and faster machines enable the individual farmer to operate on a larger scale Thus commercial farms are becoming fewer in number and larger in size Between and farm output increased by percent while the quantity of total inputs rose by only percent. Output would have risen more if there had not been production control programs. The production gains were achieved with percent less cropland and percent fewer man-hours than in But the use of fertilizer more than doubled and somewhat more mechanical power was employed. Today million acres of cropland are withheld from production through Government programs about one-sixth of the crop acreage in the United States Productivity per acre has grown rapidly. Crop production per acre in was percent greater than the average. Wheat yields rose by percent cotton percent and corn percent. Increases in yields will continue as farmers adopt the new technology constantly being devised by university and Department of Agriculture scientists agricultural chemical companies and machinery manufacturers STRUCTURAL CHANGES The economic development of U.S. agriculture is producing two distinct sectors one expanding and one contracting within the farm economy The contracting sector presently comprised of about million farms with gross annual sales of less than $ is characterized by a rapidly declining number of farms. It has been the source of much of the labor flow from agriculture. The decrease in the total number of farms between and is estimated at with most of this decline resulting from a decrease in the number of full-time farms with annual sales of less than $ Many of these small units disappeared through consolidation with other farms ; some grew in size and entered agriculture 's expanding sector This tx'end of declining numbers of small farms is expected to continue The expanding sector made up of farms with annual gross sales in excess of $ is growing rapidly. Many of the farmers in this sector are realizing returns nearly comparable with what their resources could earn in nonfarm occupations. During the number of farms in this sector increased by one-fifth to slightly more than million or percent of all farms ; the share of farm marketings provided by these farms rose from percent of the total to an estimated percent. Yet the farms in the expanding sector typically remain family enterprises : the percentage of family farms ( farms with families as risk-taking managers and using less than man-years of hired labor ) has not changed since Adjustments in agriculture 's expanding sector have required greatly increased amounts of financial capital. Total farm indebtedness has increased more than percent since largely in the form of higher farm real estate debt. Rapid farm consolidation has required additional real estate credit as well as shorter term credit for equipment and working capital Active bidding for available farm land has helped to raise agricultural land values by percent during the past year. The average value of real estate per farm now exceeds $ Increased land values permitted farm pro- prietors ' equities to grow to record levels in Although the increasing ratio of farm debt to total farm assets and incomes is evoking some concern foreclosure rates remain very low FARM INCOME Gross farm income including marketing receipts Government payments and nonmoney income from farms has risen steadily since Gross income in totaled $ billion an increase of more than percent from and percent from Total marketing receipts in rose sharply above those in largely as a result of higher prices for meat animals. Receipts from crops increased moderately reflecting higher prices and larger marketings of vegetables and oil crops. Direct Government payments to farmers are estimated to have been $ million more than the $ billion paid in Realized net farm income ( excluding net inventory change ) in is estimated at $ billion nearly percent above and the highest since On a per farm basis operators ' realized net income in reached a record $ a percent increase over and percent higher than in The prospect for commercial agriculture appears favorable owing in large part to continued prosperity in the nonfarm sector. Rising levels of income at home and abroad will strengthen the demand for many farm products. The Food and Agriculture Act of will provide some income gains to farmers. Net farm income is expected to rise moderately. Much of this gain will accrue to the million farms in agriculture 's expanding sector POVERTY IN AGRICULTURE Even in a prosperous economy many rural people are unable to earn a satisfactory living in agriculture. Estimates based on the Population Census indicate that million farm people in were living in poverty as defined by the Social Security Administration 's poverty-income standard Many of these were families living on low-production farms seriously undercapitalized in equipment and livestock. Today nearly all families operating full-time farms with gross sales of less than $ a year fall into this classification ; many of those with annual sales of between $ and $ are also poor. Families on most of these farms derive relatively little benefit from Government price and income support programs Underemployment is the common malady of the farm poor. Their hope for a more adequate income lies in their ability to obtain work off the farm For some this requires migration to localities where nonfarm jobs are available. For many it means occupational migration remaining on the land but earning a livelihood from some occupation other than farming But others for health age or financial reasons may find neither type of migration possible. These persons constitute the " hard core " of rural poverty. Their problems are the most intractable of all Both occupational and geographic migration have been occurring at a rapid pace in recent years. Net migration from farms during the early 's is estimated at people annually. Preliminary data from the Census of Agriculture indicate that much of this movement occurred in the Mississippi Delta and other areas of the South Included in this migration have been large numbers of Negro farm families a group with a particularly high incidence of poverty. Between and the numbers of nonwhites on farms decreased by percent whereas the white farm population fell by percent. Nonwhites account for one-third of the total decline in the farm population since Although the number of farm people in poverty has declined substantially in recent years this has resulted more from outmigration than from an improvement in the earnings of low-income farmers. Some of those who give up farming earn more adequate incomes in their new jobs and thus escape poverty. Those less fortunate in their search for other employment may drop out of farm poverty only to find themselves among the nonfarm poor Prosperous conditions in the nonfarm economy have aided many of the farm poor by facilitating their transfer to higher paying jobs outside of agriculture. Government programs emphasizing education and regional economic growth will also assist rural low-income people. The Manpower Development and Training programs are providing some persons with the skills necessary to compete effectively for nonfarm jobs. During the summer of rural children participated in Project Head Start. The Economic Opportunity Act of provides health facilities day camps and special education programs for children of migrant workers. Education in rural areas will be improved through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of which allocates Federal funds to school districts with heavy concentrations of children from low-income families. The Public Works and Economic Development Act of authorizes funds for regional economic development programs in low-income areas. The Department of Agriculture 's newly established Rural Community Development Service will facilitate the extension to rural areas of services provided by Government programs But the remaining tasks are great. In the incidence of poverty among farm households was percent compared with percent for nonfarm families. Money income that year for poor farm households averaged $ ; income for other farm households averaged $ Farm poverty exists in many rural areas of the United States but is particularly prevalent in the South and in Appalachia. Scattered but significant farm poverty persists in the Ozark region and some areas of the Southwest and Northwest. Migrant and other hired farm workers continue to be among the most disadvantaged people in America perity scarcely touches the lives of these individuals National pros- THE EXPORT MARKET The export market for U.S. farm products has grown rapidly in recent years. Strong foreign demand and measures to assist some exports have raised the value of total farm exports by more than percent since fiscal In fiscal agricultural exports accounted for percent of the cash receipts from farm marketings ; in recent years the foreign market has taken two-thirds of our total annual wheat production nearly twro-thirds of rice almost one-half of soybeans one-third of cotton and nearly onefourth of tobacco Between and feed grain exports rose by percent ; soybean exports increased by percent. Today the United States provides nearly half of all feed grains moving in world trade. In shipments of soybean meal a component in animal feeds were more than three times those in The large gains in these exports reflect the growing affluence of the developed world and the increased preference by consumers for the better foods derived from these products cooking and table fats poultry eggs dairy products and meats. If access to the markets of the developed countries can be maintained the United States will continue to be an important supplier of these products Exports of wheat and tobacco have grown much less rapidly than shipments of feed grains and soybeans ; and cotton exports have fluctuated sharply in recent years. Export competition in these products is likely to increase in the future. Greater competition in the world wheat market may come from traditional wheat exporters ; and larger supplies may be expected from Western Europe. Several developing countries view cotton and tobacco exports as important sources of foreign exchange and they may provide larger supplies to the world market. Increased competition from foreign producers of synthetic fibers may also restrict the growth of U.S. commercial cotton exports Most U.S. farm exports are sold commercially for dollars although sales through special export programs at noncommercial terms are also very large. Concessional exports in through the Food for Peace program accounted for two-thirds of wheat exports two-fifths of milled rice shipments and about one-fifth of cotton and edible vegetable oil exports. In fiscal the total value of farm exports was $ billion of which approximately percent constituted dollar sales. Since dollar sales have risen by percent and shipments through Food for Peace by percent The dollar excess of agricultural exports over imports contributed $ million to the U.S. trade balance in fiscal The local currencies generated by Food for Peace sales conserve dollars through their use in payment of some U.S. Government expenses abroad. Long-term dollar credit sales of Food for Peace shipments will generate exchange earnings in future years FARM COMMODITY STOCKS Because of large export demands and recent modifications of domestic commodity programs the size and composition of U.S. Government controlled stocks of farm products have undergone substantial change in recent years. The repository of these products accumulated under price support programs is the Commodity Credit Corporation ( CCC ) This agency acquires products during periods of excess supplies and adds to market supplies when demand warrants thereby contributing to price stability at the farm and retail levels. Reserves held by the CCC have proven valuable in times of national and international emergency. But excessive stocks are burdensome to taxpayers and cause concern among our international trading partners Between June and mid-1965 total CCC investment in farm products declined by approximately percent ( Table ) Total investment in wheat and wheat products rice feed grains ( corn barley grain sorghums and oats ) and peanuts declined by percent. By mid-1965 carryover stocks of wheat were the smallest since Strong foreign demand particularly from developing countries with food shortages should lead to further reductions in grain inventories TABLE Investment of Commodity Credit Corporation in commodities fiscal years [ Millions of dollars ] Fiscal year i960 Total Feed grains i Wheat and products Cotton Tobacco Other commodities Includes corn barley grain sorghums and oats Includes upland and long staple NOTE. Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding Source : Department of Agriculture Stocks of cotton and tobacco have continued to grow. By mid-1965 Government held stocks of upland cotton totaled million bales valued at $ billion a supply adequate to meet domestic mill requirements for more than months at consumption rates. A further increase of million bales is expected by August Government held stocks of tobacco have more than doubled since Clearly stocks of these commodities are excessive. The prospect for reducing them rests on the cotton and tobacco legislation which is designed to lower production and raise total consumption FARM POLICY IN THE 'S The dominant problem in agriculture as manifested by a long history of farm legislation is that average farm income is low relative to incomes in the rest of the economy. The income problem exists primarily because the capacity to produce has grown more rapidly than consumption. Under present demand conditions too many resources are committed to farm production in the United States One set of policies has approached this problem from the supply side by attempting to reduce the resources used in production through various controls and land retirement programs. Other measures have been designed to expand domestic and foreign demand for American farm products. Few of the programs of the past three decades have been unqualified successes Many have produced income benefits ; all have provided experience useful in improving old policy tools and forging new ones THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ACT OF The Food and Agriculture Act of is based upon experience gained from these policies of the past. It recognizes the national goals of a prosperous efficient agriculture and of abundant moderately priced food for consumers. It reflects the fact that agriculture must export to remain prosperous and therefore that American farm products must remain competitive on world markets. It recognizes the increasing productivity of American agriculture and the need to withdraw excess resources from production in order to balance supply and demand at reasonable prices. Yet it provides flexibility to meet present and future needs for food and fiber The legislation deals with the problem of excess supplies in agriculture and the need to divert some farmland from crop production. Through the Cropland Adjustment Program up to million acres of farmland can be shifted from crop production to other uses. The land adjustment contracts running for a period of up to years promise to move land out of production at less Government cost than would be required under annual diversion programs. The Program will also help to meet the rapidly growing demand for land for recreational and conservation uses The agricultural legislation continues the trend of American farm policy toward lower price supports and a modified system of direct payments to producers. Direct payments for several years a part of domestic wool and sugar programs have only recently been applied to major farm commodities. In a modified version of this principle together with low price supports and land diversion payments was implemented for feed grains. Later it was applied to wheat ; the legislation applies it to cotton This approach separates to a substantial degree the price mechanism from the income support operation. Price supports are set at low levels and pro- ducers5 incomes from the market are supplemented by direct Government payments. Consumers enjoy favorable food and fiber prices producers realize adequate incomes and exporters can compete more effectively in the world market The principle of direct payments is illustrated by the cotton provisions of the Food and Agriculture Act. For the crop the average cotton support price to producers will be set at cents a pound compared with cents in Producers who participate in the program and divert some land from cotton production to soil conserving uses will receive a direct payment of approximately 9J/2 cents a pound on that part of their production used domestically. This lower support rate will permit cotton to move abroad without the export subsidy required in previous years equal to cents a pound for the crop. Domestic mills will also be able to purchase cotton at lower prices. Larger total consumption of American cotton should result The Act gives the Secretary of Agriculture important new flexibility in the administration of commodity programs. This will assure that the programs can be adapted to changing production and market conditions NATIONAL COMMISSION ON FOOD AND FIBER Existing agricultural programs do not end the search for sound farm policy but provide a good base upon which to build. This search will be carried on aggressively within the Government and by the President 's newly established 30-member National Advisory Commission on Food and Fiber The Commission is to make a penetrating and comprehensive study of agricultural and related foreign trade policies of the United States. This review will consider consumer interests the welfare of agricultural suppliers producers and processors and the national interest. It is expected that the recommendations of this group will move American agricultural policy further toward the objectives of abundant farm products at reasonable prices parity of opportunity for farm people and efficient use of our agricultural resources Chapter The International Economy T HE WORLD ECONOMY has shown remarkable progress during the two decades since the end of World War II. In the developed countries economic expansion has been far more rapid and steady than ever before The less developed countries have also experienced unprecedented growth Yet in this latter group absolute levels of income remain disturbingly low and few countries show clear promise of attaining adequate self-sustaining economic growth in the near future. The world 's single most important and most intractable economic problem lies in the less developed countries of Africa Asia and Latin America In the period between the two World Wars the recognized common economic problems of the industrial countries were economic stagnation largescale unemployment and wide fluctuations in output and prices. Today these problems have essentially been mastered. But these countries are now confronted with the problems of determining how their economies can successfully adjust to the requirements of an increasingly integrated world economic system and how international monetary arrangements can best serve to assist and facilitate this adjustment The first major section of this chapter briefly considers some of the problems of the less developed countries and ways the industrial countries can help to solve them. Next the evolving integration of the world economy and the new problems associated with it are sketched. The chapter then discusses the changes in economic and financial policies needed to ease the mutual adjustment of countries to balance of payments disturbances and to provide for the adequate and dependable growth of international liquidity Finally it treats the U.S. balance of payments and the policies adopted to restore the international equilibrium of the U.S. economy THE LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES : PROGRESS PROBLEMS AND POLICIES Since the less developed countries of Africa Asia and Latin America as a group have increased their real production at an estimated average rate of 4/2 percent a year. However population growth in these countries has also been rapid between and percent a year. As a result the annual rise in real output per person has averaged roughly percent well below the rate in the developed countries. Moreover very few of the less developed countries could maintain even this pace of economic expansion without considerable assistance from abroad ; despite this aid there appears to have been some slowdown in their growth in recent years Aggregate figures conceal significant differences among the less developed countries. In a number of them for example Israel Jordan Taiwan and Thailand real output from to increased by percent a year or more. In others Indonesia Lebanon Morocco Paraguay output failed to keep pace with population increases FOREIGN ASSISTANCE Capital To achieve an adequate pace of economic growth most developing areas of the world require more capital than they can accumulate from domestic savings or can raise externally on commercial terms. Foreign aid can therefore contribute to economic development. But the way the recipient countries use their resources is much more important. Consequently as a condition for its bilateral development assistance the United States stipulates that the recipient country adopt policies which effectively utilize local resources The less developed countries are themselves financing the major part of their development needs. In recent years three-fourths of their gross investment has come from domestic savings. Table shows their sources TABLE Net flow of long-term financial resources to less developed countries [ Billions of dollars ] Source Net flow to less developed countries * Bilateral flow from countries : From DAC countries : Official- Total United States Private : Total United States _ ._ From other countries : Other industrial countries Communist countries _ Flow from multilateral organizations ( ) Excludes loans and credits of years maturity or less.

In addition to receipts shown in this table the less developed countries receive contributions from nonindustrial countries notably Kuwait The table does not net out private capital flow from less developed countries to developed countries Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding Source : Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 7'95-983 O of foreign capital. Although the total has increased somewhat official bilateral aid has been stable in recent years Estimates of the foreign exchange requirements of the less developed countries vary widely but they all indicate the need for a substantially increased inflow of foreign capital. The World Bank staff recently estimated that over the next five years the less developed countries could effectively use $ billion a year more than is currently available to them The need to finance existing foreign indebtedness is an important and growing claim on the foreign exchange resources of the less developed countries. About half of their gross capital inflow is offset by $ billion of payments for amortization and interest on loans and dividends on investments. In July the major countries extending aid agreed in principle that more grants and softer loans are required The International Development Association ( IDA ) an affiliate of the World Bank is one of the international organizations which meets the needs of developing countries for capital on soft terms interest-free loans a modest service charge and a repayment period of years. The IDA 's resources are derived from contributions by the economically advanced member countries and from the earnings of the World Bank. The Association must have additional funds from its members if it is to continue even its current level of operations In President Johnson announced U.S. support for an intensified program of economic and social development in Southeast Asia. The United States pledged $ million to the $ billion capital of a new multilateral lending institution the Asian Development Bank designed to foster the economic development of the region. In addition the United States has indicated its willingness to provide $ million for a special fund for soft loans and grants for Southeast Asian development if other countries will join in such a venture Private foreign investment also makes a crucial contribution to the less developed countries. It provides not only capital but associated technical and managerial skills. As economic growth begins private investors where they are welcome will respond to opportunities for investment. For example in three countries with successful growth records Greece Israel and Taiwan the inflow of private foreign capital rose from percent of gross national product ( GNP ) in to percent in Agricultural Production and Food Aid The recent slowdown in economic growth in some less developed countries can be ascribed to the failure of their agriculture to expand sufficiently Indeed in Latin America and in the Far East per capita food production is below levels reached prior to World War II America 's agricultural abundance has long been used to help to meet the food needs of the less developed world. Our food aid program Food for Peace is also important in the promotion of economic growth and has helped by freeing resources for industrial development. But food aid must not be allowed to impede the development of agriculture since in many countries agriculture may be the most rapid route to general economic growth. Moreover such progress in agriculture is essential to the long-run solution of foreign food shortages. If the gap between food needs and production in the less developed countries continues to widen at the rate of the past few years even the United States with its vast food-producing capacity will not be able to fill it This year in addition to the Food for Peace program the United States will institute a special assistance program to help foreign lands expand their agricultural output Human Resources The less developed countries are seriously handicapped by shortages of trained manpower indeed illiteracy is a major problem. Since the less developed countries have increased their investment in education by an average of percent a year. The United States is assisting educational development through some educational projects in developing countries and in the past years has financed the construction of approximately classrooms to accommodate million students. Substantial assistance has been given to develop teacher training colleges to modernize educational systems and curricula and to link educational programs to the manpower requirements of these countries The U.S. Government is now joining a new worldwide endeavor of educational cooperation and assistance emphasizing the educational needs of school-age children and encouraging more of our teachers and school administrators to serve abroad The United States has long been deeply committed to improving health conditions in the less developed countries. Major support is provided to the health programs of the United Nations its specialized agencies and five multilateral regional organizations. Total international health obligations of the U.S. Government will amount to approximately $ million in the current fiscal year and are scheduled to rise substantially next year. However our potential for technical assistance in this field is only now being fully mobilized by the Federal Government. New programs will give priority to the development of a cadre of U.S. international health workers and to helping the less developed countries train more health workers themselves. The United States will also increase substantially its support for the eradication of communicable diseases and for the provision of potable water supplies in many regions of the world Child malnutrition increases susceptibility to infectious diseases. In many countries ^ this combination kills half of all children before the age of five. Physical and mental retardation of the surviving malnourished youngsters frequently is permanent. To assist developing nations in their efforts to meet the nutritional needs of many additional millions of children U.S. programs will be substantially expanded this year Rapid population growth compounds economic and social problems in the less developed countries. As a result of deliberate efforts to limit the size of families population growth rates have leveled off or are falling in Hong Kong Singapore and Taiwan. Korea Pakistan Tunisia and Turkey also have initiated programs. But in the less developed world as a whole population growth is continuing at an increasing rate In the short run population control can limit the number of dependent children supported by each member of the labor force. But it will be some time before it can have an appreciable impact on total numbers. Over the longer run it can ease problems of unemployment and underemployment and raise individual productivity To help countries which request U.S. assistance with their population problems the United States will mobilize and make available technical and financial resources including the support of training programs for foreign personnel who can in turn train the thousands of individuals required to carry forward family planning programs IMPROVING TRADE PROSPECTS Both the advanced and the emerging nations must give greater attention to policies to accelerate the growth of the export earnings of the less developed countries. For these countries as a group export earnings yield four times as much foreign exchange as do all loans grants and direct investments from abroad. Yet these nations are not fully sharing in the tremendous growth of world trade. The reasons for this are to be found largely in the sluggish secular growth of demand for their traditional primary products Although exports of manufactured products from less developed countries doubled between and foodstuffs raw materials and petroleum nevertheless accounted for percent of their total shipments in Rising domestic demand inflation and overvalued exchange rates in some countries have also adversely affected sales abroad Most less developed countries are vulnerable to short-term export instability. For individual primary commodities and primary exporters a major source of instability has been the wide and erratic movement of prices. The less developed countries need greater assurance that development programs will not be vitiated by unpredictable declines in export earnings which are beyond their control. International agreements for some commodities such as coffee represent one technique for dealing with this problem Financial arrangements to help to offset shortfalls are another technique Three years ago the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) established a special drawing arrangement for compensatory financing of short-term fluctuations in members ' export earnings. Only three countries have thus far used the facility since price trends of primary commodities were generally favorable to producers throughout and much of In view of recent price declines more applications may be expected. The United States and other governments are now considering new ways to provide additional short- and long-term financing to offset export shortfalls Liberal commercial policies by the developed countries will contribute to world economic development. A successful Kennedy Round will benefit the less developed as well as the developed countries. However there will remain room for further tariff reductions and import liberalization of special significance for development. Many advanced countries could abolish or relax a number of import restrictions without causing economic dislocation. Recent studies indicate that general tariff reductions even on those manufactures which are protected by low duties might ultimately yield a significant increase in exports of less developed countries. The developed countries could also contribute to their own growth and that ot the less developed countries by reducing agricultural protectionism. Moreover nontariff barriers to imports such as quantitative restrictions and the high consumption taxes which some countries impose on tropical products ( coffee cocoa and bananas ) for purely fiscal reasons frequently place a serious burden on the less developed countries RECENT CHANGE IN THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES The main problem of the developed countries in the 's is not how to promote growth but how to avoid stunting growth in dealing with the balance of payments and domestic price stability The rapid postwar economic growth of the developed countries may be due to basic structural and technological changes which only future economic historians will be able to distinguish clearly. But there can be no question that growth has been spurred by two highly visible developments First and more important the governments of most countries have assumed an active responsibility to promote expansion and growth guided by a new understanding of how government policy affects economic activity. Second in many countries of Europe and in Japan a dynamic source of expansion and modernization has been the growth of export markets stimulated by the dramatic postwar movement toward economic integration. Rapid growth in each country has provided expanding export markets for the products of others in a chain of mutually supporting expansion A number of postwar institutions have contributed to integration : the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) Through their efforts import quotas on trade in manufactured products have been largely abandoned ; tariffs have been greatly reduced ; the principal currencies have become convertible Moreover great new free trade areas have been created especially the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and the European Free Trade Association ( EFTA ) By the beginning of internal tariffs within the EEC and EFTA had been reduced by percent THE GROWTH OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE As a result of all of these developments international commerce has flourished. In the decade from to exports of the advanced industrial economies grew by an extraordinary percent and exports of the less developed areas rose by percent To be sure uncertainties within Europe are now having their impact both on further integration within the EEC and on the external relations of the EEC including the current Kennedy Round of trade negotiations. The pace of integration and especially the movement toward more liberal world trade have been slowed. The Kennedy Round is at a virtual standstill The American commitment to the Kennedy Round the boldest and most significant effort to liberalize the world trading structure yet undertaken is as firm as ever. But the protracted internal crisis of the EEC has prevented any significant negotiations with that group of states since last summer. The longer this paralysis continues the more uncertain are the prospects. The negotiating authority provided by the Trade Expansion Act expires in less than months. If these important negotiations are to yield their full potential benefits meaningful deliberations must resume at the latest early this spring. Were the Kennedy Round to fail the world would have missed a unique opportunity for further reduction of trade barriers against both industrial and agricultural products and for a further widening of world markets to the benefit of both the developed and developing nations The United States is also giving increased attention to the lowering of barriers to trade with the countries of the Soviet bloc. For both political and economic reasons this country has not fully participated in the steady expansion of East-West trade during the past decade. U.S. trade with the Soviet bloc amounted to barely percent of total U.S. foreign commerce in Last year the President 's Special Committee on U.S. Trade Relations with East European Countries and the Soviet Union recommended an expansion of peaceful trade with the European Communist countries and urged that the President be given discretionary authority to remove trade restrictions against those countries The President has indicated that he will ask Congress for selective authority to grant most-favored-nation treatment to imports from the countries of Eastern Europe including the U.S.S.R. While no sudden expansion of trade is likely the opportunities for increased trade may prove significant for individual firms and products PROBLEMS OF RAPID GROWTH AND INTEGRATION The new economic dynamism of the developed countries of the free world has brought great gains but also problems. These problems have both domestic and international dimensions closely interrelated The main domestic problem in most countries today is that of reconciling prosperity with stability of costs and prices. This has been a problem for all the countries of Western Europe at one time or another in the past decades But even though wage rates and other money incomes rose at a rapid pace increases in labor costs were often restrained by extremely rapid improvements in productivity. In fact in Germany and Italy as well as in Japan they held stable or fell in the early 's as a result of the rapid gains in productivity that went with the development of new industries and processes the modernization of obsolete equipment and the great expansion of the size of domestic and international markets. Moreover there were labor resources to be drawn from domestic sectors of low productivity and often from such sectors in other countries which restrained upward pressures on wages. But now productivity gains are slowing down from phenomenal to merely exceptional ; sources of low-cost labor are harder to come by ; and the income demands of labor and other groups continue to increase. Rapid growth and full employment are more generally accompanied by upward pressure on costs and prices Internationally the problem of adjusting to rapid growth has taken complex forms. The closer integration of international markets and increased freedom of payments have been among the main sources of domestic growth in many countries. But they also have contributed to strains in the balance of international payments Growth rates while generally high have not been the same in all countries and internal price levels have not changed equally. Large structural changes accompanying and responsible for growth in some of the countries have altered their international competitive position. Tax systems have been adjusted with resulting effects on prices of imports and exports. The formation of EEC and EFTA has affected members and nonmembers differently. Profound changes associated with the termination of colonial status have affected the markets and obligations of several European nations The costs of defense and aid commitments vary significantly among countries All of these factors have considerably affected the external transactions of each of the industrial countries at times creating large surpluses or deficits in trade or government payments Reduction of government restrictions the convertibility of currencies increasing knowledge of opportunities abroad growing confidence in existing governments larger supplies of investible funds and rapid growth of markets have brought a spectacular expansion of international capital movements. The flow of capital has also been affected by national policies to restrain inflationary pressures by the differences in the development of national capital markets by country-to-country differences in profits and interest rates and on occasion by hopes or fears of currency revaluations Although international flows of capital have contributed to world economic growth they have at times created problems for both the importing and the exporting country Thus for the capital account as well as the current account the closer economic integration of the newly dynamic Western economies has been a source of severe balance of payments strains. And measures taken by Western European Governments to deal with deficits have been a major factor behind the occasional slowdowns in the pace of economic expansion In the past years many potential strains have been effectively masked by large U.S. deficits. They have allowed most other countries to maintain rapid expansion while still gaining reserves. Even so there have been serious deficits at various times in France Canada Italy Japan and the United Kingdom. Had the U.S. international payments been in equilibrium during this period many more potential strains would have become visible Once the umbrella of the U.S. deficit is removed the problems of adjusting to rapid growth and change in a world of relatively free trade and payments may become more evident and more difficult to resolve DEVELOPMENTS IN Many of the problems of mutual adjustment were brought into sharp focus during as payments positions of major countries underwent particularly large and rapid changes. For the United States there had been a sudden increase in the deficit in late and early Following President Johnson 's program of corrective measures in February however the balance of payments showed a major improvement The payments position of the United Kingdom remained precarious from the autumn of until the late summer of causing heavy speculative attacks on the pound. However as a result of forceful measures taken by the British Government to defend the value of its currency aided by large-scale financial assistance from the IMF and on a cooperative basis from major nations pressures on the pound subsided significantly by the autumn and the United Kingdom has continued to regain reserves The British Government moreover has given convincing evidence that it will take all steps needed to bring its payments position into balance by late Meanwhile the German surplus which had been of serious concern for several years was eliminated in However at the very time that the large deficits of the two major reserve currency countries were being reduced and the troublesome German surplus corrected new problems of payments imbalance emerged elsewhere. Italy in particular developed very sizable surpluses. A surplus also appeared in Japan. At the same time France had a surplus even larger than that of These divergent developments were in many cases closely related to the policies adopted by the various countries to affect domestic demand. In the United States to be sure the payments imbalance was reduced substantially without impeding domestic expansion. For the United Kingdom however restrictive domestic measures were part of its program to bring the payments deficit under control as well as to counter inflationary pressures at home. In Italy and Japan the brakes previously applied to their expanding economies to help counter payments deficits and domestic inflation had proved in some respects too effective. Such policy measures as were taken in to revive demand brought only relatively slow progress. In France also the larger surplus position was clearly associated with a low rate of economic expansion reflecting the Government 's hesitation to take more active stimulative measures because of the fear of possible inflation. On the other hand burgeoning domestic demands clearly contributed to the elimination of Germany 's surplus The policies adopted by various countries to deal with domestic and balance of payments problems had in turn significant implications for the growth prospects of other countries both developed and less developed. To the extent that such policies depressed export markets there was danger that world economic growth would be impeded The challenge to the developed nations as a group is to find mutual arrangements and institutions that can support healthy economic growth and at the same time maintain reasonable external equilibrium in a world community of increasing interdependence IMPROVING THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM Soundly functioning international financial arrangements should permit countries to make necessary adjustments to changes in their external payments positions with minimum impairment of the broader objectives shared by all nations : relatively full employment a satisfactory rate of economic growth an efficient allocation of international resources and reasonable price stability. These arrangements should provide for a satisfactory expansion of total international reserves and liquidity as an underpinning for a growing volume of trade and payments. And they should command such widespread confidence that international transactions will not be disrupted by excessive speculation or by sudden and unpredictable shifts from one form of international reserve asset into another Balance of payments adjustment reserve creation and maintenance of confidence are of course closely interrelated. Under the prevailing system of fixed exchange rates it usually requires time to correct payments imbalances in a way that is consistent with the achievement of basic objectives. This means that countries need sufficient reserves or credit to provide a reasonable margin of safety for dealing with actual or potential deficits. If reserves or credit facilities are inadequate even surplus countries may feel impelled to follow unduly restrictive policies. Moreover too small a margin of safety may encourage undesirable speculative flows adding further to the need for liquidity. Too large a volume of liquidity on the other hand could be inflationary. Improvements in the adjustment process which would reduce imbalances without sacrifice of broader objectives would cut back liquidity needs and strengthen confidence During the past year these closely related matters have received intensive consideration in discussions concerned with ways of improving the international monetary system by the IMF the OECD the leading industrial countries known as the Group of Ten and various bodies associated with the UN and the EEC The discussions within the Group of Ten and in Working Party of OECD have been of particular importance. A report examining the issues raised by various proposals to create new reserve assets was submitted to the Group of Ten last summer by a working group under the chairmanship of Rinaldo Ossola of Italy. With this study completed the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the Group of Ten at the time of the Annual Meeting of the IMF Governors last September requested their deputies to " determine and report to Ministers what basis of agreement can be reached on improvements needed in the international monetary system including arrangements for the future creation of reserve assets as and when needed. " The deputies are to report on their progress this spring. Meanwhile Working Party is to accelerate its study of ways to improve the adjustment process As soon as a basis for agreement has been reached among the Ten negotiations on means to improve the international monetary system would then proceed to a second stage in which all members of the IMF would have a more direct opportunity to voice their views. The following two sections present some of the issues involved in the study of the adjustment process and in the negotiations to improve international liquidity arrangements THE ADJUSTMENT PROCESS The Council 's Annual Report for described at some length the balance of payments adjustment process which operated or was supposed to have operated in a relatively automatic fashion under the 19th century gold standard. It pointed out that this method of adjustment relied on the maintenance of a rigid link between changes in countries ' gold holdings and internal monetary conditions in nations without active fiscal policies and could only work by subordinating domestic welfare to the requirements of external balance Such a system is neither possible nor acceptable in the modern world All nations today follow discretionary policies directed toward multiple objectives internal as well as external. Quite appropriately they are reluctant to resolve payments problems at the expense of economic growth high employment and price stability. But in today 's interdependent world the independent pursuit of individual countries ' objectives can often bring their policies into conflict and produce results against the interests of all A satisfactory balance of payments adjustment process requires a high degree of international cooperation At any given time some countries will be in deficit while others will be in surplus. For the world as a whole deficits and surpluses will be roughly equal. Under existing international liquidity arrangements the main exception reflects additions to the stock of monetary gold which allow some surpluses not offset by deficits elsewhere Some swings in country payments positions are bound to occur. And when the imbalance represents only a temporary departure from equilibrium or when appropriate corrective measures take time to become fully effective forcing an immediate restoration of balance may involve excessive economic and social costs. Moreover where the level of a country 's reserves is chronically excessive ( or deficient ) in relation to its needs that country may appropriately run a deficit ( or surplus ) over a longer period. Thus persistent U.S. deficits during the early 's were clearly in the interests of all countries Nevertheless if a deficit continues too long or becomes too large the strength of the country 's currency can be impaired. There is in fact an absolute limit of any country 's ability to continue in deficit ; eventually it must run out of reserves as well as borrowing capacity Built-in pressures to correct surpluses are less powerful. A country that continually runs a surplus deprives itself of the real resources that would have accrued to it had it exported less or imported more. As the surplus persists this cost becomes increasingly burdensome relative to the benefits derived from additional accumulations of reserves However strongly they may wish to all or most countries can not run surpluses simultaneously. If they try some are bound to find their actual balance of payments positions falling short of what they had desired Unrealistic payments targets can thus lead to destructive policy competition among countries. Countries must determine their adjustment policies in the light of balance of payments targets that are mutually compatible Alternative Means for Dealing with Imbalances What are the broad strategies a country can adopt when confronted with an imbalance in its international payments ? First it may simply let the imbalance persist at least for some time and rely on financing. For a deficit country this entails either a drawing down of reserves or borrowing ; for a surplus country a rise in reserves or deliberate lending Second a country can seek to correct the payments imbalance by fiscal and monetary measures that affect the total level of internal demand. For countries in deficit a restriction of demand would be designed to reduce imports and increase exports. If monetary policy is used to achieve restraint higher interest rates may-also deter monetary outflows or even induce net capital inflows Third countries can make varying use of selective measures specifically directed at external transactions for example import surcharges or quotas direct restrictions on capital movements or disincentive devices like the U.S. Interest Equalization Tax. On the other hand surplus countries may remove existing restrictions or use special incentives to induce net capital outflows Fourth a variety of other internal measures can be used. These include selective internal policies to improve a country 's productivity efficiency or financial structure ; changes in the " mix " of different kinds of policy instruments notably as between fiscal and monetary policy ; and wage-price policies Fifth countries can under the IMF Articles of Agreement resort in some instances to adjustments of their exchange rates None of these options represents an ideal or fully feasible solution under all circumstances. Reliance on financing may merely postpone needed corrective action. Measures to affect total internal demand may conflict with domestic objectives. Direct restrictions on international trade and payments may interfere with efficient resource allocation. Other selective measures may not be available in time or not be sufficiently powerful to bring about the desired correction. Finally various disadvantages are inherent in exchange rate adjustments and governments are properly reluctant to resort to them particularly reserve currency countries Criteria for Selection Despite these drawbacks any one of these options may prove the most desirable or least undesirable under particular circumstances ; and in many cases a combination of strategies may be called for. What then determines which policies are appropriate for a country in a given situation ? Major relevant considerations include the following : First the nature of the underlying ailment is important. If either deficient or excessive internal demand is a major cause of the imbalance then measures to affect such demand may provide the best solution. If part of the underlying difficulty is connected with a deterioration in a country 's competitive position various selective measures to improve productivity and resource mobility may be called for. If the difficulty stems from speculative or other unusual capital flows use of selective instruments might be far more efficient than resort to general measures. And to the extent that the payments imbalance stems from broad structural differences in capital markets such as those that exist between the United States and continental Europe the longer-term solution lies in improving the efficiency of the less fully developed capital markets Second any given strategy for achieving balance of payments equilibrium should as far as possible be consistent with the attainment of broader objectives. Often this presents no problem. For example if a country suffers from both internal inflation and a payments deficit policies to restrict overall demand may achieve internal and external objectives simultaneously Similarly a country seeking to reduce an external surplus and to expand internal demand can usually use general fiscal and monetary measures to meet both objectives Even in these cases however difficulties in the choice of instruments can sometimes arise. For example the United Kingdom in had both an external deficit and excess domestic demand. Nevertheless there were also indications that the country 's competitive performance was suffering from low productivity. The U.K. authorities therefore combined measures to restrain domestic demand with more specific steps to improve the country 's competitive position including measures to encourage productive investment over the long run. Or a surplus country with lagging internal demand may be suffering from upward cost and price pressures. In this case resort to incomes ( price-cost ) policies reductions in tariff barriers and other special devices may be required to avoid price increases that might inhibit vigorous use of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies More difficult situations arise where deficits are accompanied by domestic underemployment or surpluses by inflation. In recent years the first of these situations has been characteristic of the United States the second of Germany. The United States has leaned more heavily on fiscal policy to stimulate demand making it appropriate to use a somewhat less expansionary monetary policy than would otherwise have been desirable. This together with the Interest Equalization Tax and voluntary restraint on foreign lending and investment has helped to dampen capital outflows. Germany on the other hand has been advised by the OECD to combat its domestic inflation more actively through tighter fiscal policies and to pursue a relatively easier monetary policy in order not to attract funds from abroad Third there are differences in the effectiveness of given policy instruments in various countries. For example where international transactions constitute a relatively high proportion of total transactions and where both exports and imports tend to be highly responsive to variations in domestic incomes even relatively mild measures to influence total demand may rather quickly bring about the desired adjustment in the balance of payments. Thus in a country like the Netherlands where imports equal about percent of GNP primary reliance on instruments to affect over-all demand may frequently be entirely appropriate for payments adjustment and entail a relatively small economic cost. But in many other countries the foreign sector accounts for a much smaller proportion of total national transactions ; in the United States for example imports are only percent of GNP. If this country were to place sole reliance on general demand measures to achieve a given balance of payments result a relatively large change in total demand would be necessary exposing the economy to severe inflation or unemployment. Even where both domestic and external payments conditions call for either restrictive or expansionary measures the " dose " appropriate for the domestic economy may not be strong enough to correct the payments imbalance or it might be too strong Fourth the effects on other countries must be considered. For example the industrial countries as a group should clearly be concerned with the impact that their measures will have on the less developed countries. Moreover the effect of particular corrective measures taken by one industrial country could be cancelled if similar measures were taken by others or could be sharply reduced by other " rebound " effects The Division of Responsibilities for Adjustment Surplus countries tend to argue that the primary task of bringing about adjustment must necessarily lie with deficit countries since it would be unreasonable to expect the surplus countries to suffer such inflation as might be induced by expansionary actions on their part. Deficit countries on the other hand argue that if they bear a greater share of the responsibility for adjustment this imparts a deflationary bias to the world economy There is no a priori case for assigning a greater share of the responsibility to either deficit or surplus countries. Countries in either situation should be willing to use the instruments at their disposal in the most effective way There could be specific situations where a larger share of the responsibility should be assumed by either deficit or surplus countries but this should be subject to careful international consideration Possibilities for Improving the Adjustment Process The past few years have seen significant gains in international consultation and cooperation in balance of payments adjustments. Nevertheless the fact remains that balance of payments surpluses and deficits in recent years have often been very large and that the adjustment techniques currently used are far from perfect. There is need and wide scope for further improvement One obvious area of improvement involves the development of additional policy instruments as well as more efficient use of existing instruments. In particular there is a major need in many countries for making fiscal policy a more flexible tool of economic policy. Much more imaginative use could also be made of different techniques of monetary management. Furthermore surplus countries have considerably more scope for reducing trade barriers and broadening capital markets It may be possible to develop some general guidelines regarding appropriate balance of payments adjustment that could prove helpful in the context of international discussions. Such guidelines should be flexible and informal and sufficiently comprehensive to permit effective selection of policy tools in the light of all the considerations set forth above : the nature of imbalances ; the full range of economic objectives ; differences among countries ; and effects of each country 's policies on other nations In any case much can be done to improve further the existing mechanisms of international consultation and cooperation to help to assure that the measures used by individual countries are best suited to the interests of the international community as a whole INTERNATIONAL LIQUIDITY ARRANGEMENTS Improvements in the adjustment process alone can not assure that the international monetary system will work smoothly. In the words of Secretary of the Treasury Henry Fowler " a new and crucial challenge is presenting itself with growing urgency before the nations of the free world the challenge of assuring ample liquidity to support expanding world trade in the years ahead. " He stated that " there will be bilateral and multilateral talks at all levels as we move ahead toward exploring this most complex problem and toward reaching some kind of workable consensus There is no fixed timetable. But we are moving ahead and we will spare no effort to speed our progress toward a sensible and workable solution. " The Need for Adequate Growth in International Liquidity How large is the volume and growth of monetary reserves and other forms of liquidity needed to support a smoothly functioning system of international transactions ? There is no simple answer to this question. In approaching it however several key distinctions need to be kept in mind The great bulk of international transactions takes place among private traders bankers or other intermediaries. Predominantly these transactions involve the major trading or " vehicle " currencies the dollar and the pound sterling. Over the years the volume of private working balances in these currencies has tended to grow along with the volume of international transactions. A continuing net flow of dollars into foreign private hands sufficient to satisfy such legitimate private business needs is thus likely to be desirable A second need for international liquidity arises from the desire of monetary authorities to hold reserves and other forms of liquidity to enable them to settle payments deficits that might develop. Of course monetary authorities normally have the option of obtaining credit on conditional terms when the need arises. In recent years credit facilities have been greatly expanded notably through improvements in the medium-term lending operations of the International Monetary Fund and through cooperative arrangements among central banks ; and further improvements should prove possible in the future. But countries also want " unconditional liquidity " either in the form of gold or reserve currencies or of assured lines of credit ( such as the fully automatic drawing rights on the Fund ) Moreover as the absolute volume of international transactions rises the size of potential deficits also increases. This is why most countries seek to enlarge their reserve positions over the years at least modestly There are now three principal ways in which net additions to international reserves occur : ( ) through the flow of newly available gold into official national reserves ; ( ) through enlargement of countries ' automatic drawing rights at the Fund ; and ( ) through increases in the holdings of U.S. dollars by the monetary authorities of other countries Increases in the aggregate gold holdings of monetary authorities are the oldest way of creating reserves. And they are the only way that does not usually depend on the emergence of a balance of payments deficit for one or more countries. From through gold contributed about $ million annually to over-all reserve growth of the free world. Recognition that Fund automatic drawing rights constitute international reserves is very recent ; net additions in them averaged about $ million a year during The other major contribution to over-all reserve growth increases in foreign official claims on the United States averaged about $ billion a year over this period. There has been virtually no net expansion since the early 's in official holdings of sterling the second major reserve currency Expansion of world reserves through a growth of dollar holdings worked well in the earlier postwar years when official reserves outside the United States were low. However the United States can now no longer continue to run large-scale balance of payments deficits without endangering confidence in its own currency. Thus dollars can not contribute to growth of world reserves as they have in the past. Moreover to the extent that foreign monetary authorities convert existing dollar holdings into gold the net volume of international liquidity actually declines It was against this background that the United States acted with new determination last year to bring its payments into equilibrium. As it succeeds in this effort however the international monetary system is faced with a dilemma. Gold alone will not add sufficiently to official reserves to insure a smoothly functioning payments system. Prudent planning therefore calls for the development of additional kinds of reserve assets that could add to international liquidity independently of the balance of payments deficits of particular countries According to preliminary indications growth in the world 's total reserve assets slowed markedly in ( Chart ) There is little to suggest that the annual growth of about $ billion in the years prior to had been excessive. Moreover there is a strong presumption that over time the growth of international trade and the world economy will be hampered unless there is a continuing expansion in the total volume of reserve assets Hence the United States took the initiative in the summer of in urging an intensified exploration of the possibilities for agreement on the development of a new reserve asset Chart World Trade and Reserves BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ( ratio scale ) WORLD IMPORTS WORLD RESERVES \ WORLD RESERVES EXCLUDING OFFICIAL DOLLAR HOLDINGS I i i i I i i ^ /ESTIMATES BASED ON DATA FOR FIRST QUARTERS NOTE : WORLD EXCLUDES SINO-SOVIET BLOC SOURCE : INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND Ways of Creating Additional Reserve Assets At least two major and potentially complementary approaches to the creation of additional reserve assets are likely to receive serious attention in current world discussions. The first calls for the creation of a completely new reserve unit. Each participating country would be issued given amounts of the new units from time to time and rules would be set for their use The unit could be backed by a guarantee against depreciation in terms of gold and would be counted in " owned " reserves. Creation of the new unit would require formal international agreement and would thus offer clear evidence that the participating countries were joined in a major and deliberate effort to provide for an appropriate growth in international liquidity A second method would build on the procedures for reserve creation already available in the Fund. It would expand automatic drawing rights on the Fund. The additional drawing rights would be immediately usable as new reserve assets by member countries. This approach would not necessarily require revision of the Fund 's Articles of Agreement Under reserve unit schemes participating countries provide backing for the unit in terms of their national currencies and undertake to accept the units from one another. In the case of new Fund automatic drawing rights member countries might be asked to provide lines of credit to the 795-983< Fund to assure that the Fund itself could readily supply the amounts and types of currencies required by members exercising their drawing rights In either case however one basic principle holds : the acceptability of the new reserve asset will fundamentally depend on the willingness of participating countries to view it as a form of international money Each approach " reserve unit " and " drawing rights " has distinctive characteristics that can make it particularly useful for certain purposes. In many respects the two approaches need not differ greatly in effect. What is important in assessing the numerous specific versions and combinations of these two approaches that have been proposed is to see how they deal with certain key questions. These include the following : ( ) By whom and in what manner shall decisions regarding the new reserve assets be made ? As Secretary Fowler stated before the Annual Meeting of the Governors of the International Monetary Fund It is true that only a limited number of countries hold the bulk of the official reserves of the world. No doubt these countries including my own have deep interests and responsibilities of a unique kind in the system by which reserves are generated and regulated. But other countries which are not large reserve holders also have legitimate and vital interests in these matters. This is why all the countries of the free world have a fair and reasonable claim that their views must be heard and considered at an appropriate stage in the process of international monetary improvement There are various types of decisions regarding international monetary arrangements that need to be made. A basic " constitutional " decision has to be taken regarding the nature of the new arrangements. Thereafter decisions will be required from time to time on various operational matters such as the amounts of new assets to be created. The procedures for settling these various questions might differ Whatever the precise arrangement it seems highly desirable that the Fund play a central role in the decision-making process. As has been well stated in the Ossola Report " The Fund 's prestige and experience as a monetary institution make it the natural center for new functions involving deliberate creation of reserve assets and provide assurance of its capacity to conduct and keep distinct conditional lending and deliberate reserve creation. " ( ) To whom shall the reserve assets be distributed ? The distribution of new reserve assets poses difficult problems which will require further discussion and study. While there is no simple answer certain principles are clear. All countries need reserves and an effective system of reserve creation should give all an opportunity to add to their holdings. At the same time the large industrial countries other developed nations and the less developed countries have special needs and characteristics that must be reflected in any over-all arrangements. Furthermore such arrangements should be sufficiently flexible to permit an increasing degree of participation by countries as they meet certain relevant standards IMF quotas provide one benchmark which might be considered in the initial distribution of new reserve assets While no distribution can be set forth as ideal the nations of the world can be expected to develop an equitable plan which will meet the recognized need for growth of reserves. Every nation has a clear interest in its own share of new reserve assets but it has an even greater stake in the development of an effective system for reserve creation that will encourage the pursuit of economic growth and liberal trade policies ( ) What should be the relationship between new reserve assets and existing types of reserve assets and what techniques are required to achieve an appropriate relationship ? Any new type of reserve asset that might be created should clearly be attractive enough so that countries will wish to hold it. But it must not be so attractive as to displace existing forms of reserve holdings for it would then fail in its primary purpose of adding to over-all liquidity One proposal to enhance acceptability has been to link the creation of a new reserve unit in a rigid proportion to each country 's gold holdings. Such a rigid link to gold in the creation of the unit is clearly undesirable however It would be inequitable penalizing countries that now hold a low proportion of their total international reserves in gold. It would moreover provide incentives for all countries to increase the ratio of gold to total reserves. By thus affecting the willingness of countries to hold existing reserve currencies it could lead to an undesirable shrinkage in world liquidity Alternatively or additionally it has been suggested that the use of the new reserve unit in settlements should only be permitted in association with a specified quantity of gold. The same considerations that apply to a gold link in creation also raise doubts about the proposal for a link in use Moreover any rigid link with gold would tend to enhance the importance of gold in the monetary system and thereby to assign a new reserve unit second-class citizenship If there is no close link to gold what is required to make a new reserve unit readily acceptable ? One possibility might be an agreement that countries would accept such units as full legal tender to be considered " as good as gold. " Or an agreement might provide for specific limits on the obligation of creditor countries to accept the reserve units in settlement. Special procedures might also be adopted to prevent countries from using the new units to change the composition of existing reserves in a way that might lead to a reduction in total liquidity Creditor limits are automatically incorporated in the procedures for expansion of automatic drawing rights at the Fund. Moreover their relationship with gold and reserve currencies poses no problems ( ) Does the method used in creating a new reserve asset allow for the proper expansion in liquidity and for a flexible response to changing needs ? Both proposals cited would permit substantial additions to liquidity However a separate new reserve unit may be essential as part of a program to assure adequate increases in liquidity. Such a unit might also be more easily recognized as constituting " owned " reserves and might therefore make countries feel more " liquid " than would corresponding command over automatic drawing rights Expansion of drawing rights on the other hand might be arrangeable on a more flexible basis. Moreover to the extent that countries may be reluctant to allow their holdings of reserve units to decline but are willing to make active use of automatic drawing rights the latter might at times actually prove to be more " liquid " in the sense of providing resources when needed Concluding Comments While reserves in the form of units and drawing rights have much in common the characteristics that give each of the approaches special usefulness in particular situations suggest that both have a constructive role to play in reserve creation In any event it is essential that the negotiations provide for ( ) efficient as well as equitable rules for the creation distribution and use of new assets ; ( ) smooth integration of new assets within the existing framework ; and ( ) the appropriate degree of expansion in the over-all volume of international liquidity which will foster sound world economic growth U.S. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS The U.S. balance of payments moved significantly closer to equilibrium in In considerable part this reflected the effects of the President 's program announced in February. The improvement was primarily manifested in a substantially reduced outflow of private capital which more than offset a drop in the trade surplus ( Chart ) MEASURES OF DEFICIT OR SURPLUS In a fundamental sense a country 's external payments can not be in satisfactory equilibrium unless the domestic economy is in reasonable balance and its basic national and international economic objectives are being met. In a more immediate sense however equilibrium in external payments relates to a country 's international reserve position and to its ability to maintain the value of its currency in international transactions. Statistics on a country 's international transactions summarized in its balance of payments accounts bear only on the more immediate concept of equilibrium Balance of payments accounts summarize a system of double-entry bookkeeping. The total of debits equals the total of credits ; the net difference is zero. Thus any positive or negative balance a surplus or deficit includes only selected payments and receipts. A variety of such measures has been used in recent years including among others the " basic balance " the " balance on regular transactions " the " liquidity balance " and the " balance on official reserve transactions " ( " official settlements " ) No single concept Chart U.S. Balance of International Payments BILLIONS OF DOLLARS * EXPORTS AND IMPORTS OF GOODS AND SERVICES EXPORTS IMPORTS I I PRIVATE CAPITAL I I NET * -v ^ > i i I l l l l l l l l l i l BALANCE OFFICIAL RESERVE TRANSACTIONS BASIS V LIQUIDITY BASIS- ? / * I I I I I I SEASONALLY ADJUSTED ANNUAL RATES 1/EQUALS CHANGES IN LIQUID AND NONLIQUID LIABILITIES TO FOREIGN OFFICIAL HOLDERS AND CHANGES IN OFFICIAL RESERVE ASSETS CONSISTING OF GOLO CONVERTIBLE CURRENCIES AND THE U.S. GOLD TRANCHE POSITION IN THE IMF -/EQUALS CHANGES IN LIQUID LIABILITIES TO FOREIGN OFFICIAL HOLDERS OTHER FOREIGN HOLDERS AND CHANGES IN OFFICIAL RESERVE ASSETS CONSISTING OF GOLD CONVERTIBLE CURRENCIES AND THE U.S. GOLD TRANCHE POSITION IN THE IMF SOURCE : DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE is best for all analyses. The measure that is most appropriate for one country at one time may be less appropriate under other circumstances All definitions of the balance of payments surplus or deficit relate to changes in a country 's reserve assets. By any definition a contribution to surplus is recorded whenever the reserve holdings of our monetary authorities are increased by gains in gold claims on the IMF or liquid assets in convertible currencies. But the measures of balance also take into account changes in certain claims that could be exercised against our reserves Various types of assets differ in the extent and directness of their claim on U.S. reserves. Liquid claims on the United States held by foreign monetary authorities may at any time be presented for gold and thus directly expose us to the possibility of reserve losses. Privately held liquid U.S assets of foreigners can readily be turned into official claims. And nonliquid dollar assets held by foreigners can be sold and thus converted into liquid holdings. Indeed in a world of convertible currencies any marketable claim held abroad is to some degree a potential claim on our reserves Dollar holdings of Americans could even flow abroad in a crisis and flow back as a demand for gold. It is difficult to select the group of assets that should count as claims on our reserves ( with an increase contributing to a U.S. deficit ) It is mainly on this point that the alternative measures of the deficit or surplus divide In after a careful review of its present and foreseeable situation the U.S. Government decided to place primary stress on two measures of its general balance of payments performance the " liquidity balance " and the " balance on official reserve transactions " ( " official settlements " ) The liquidity balance spotlights the liquid claims of foreigners both private and official against the United States. The potential exposure of the United States is measured by the volume of such liquid claims and any increase in them ( not offset by a growth of reserve assets ) is recorded as a U.S. deficit. Thus the line is drawn between liquid and nonliquid foreign dollar holdings The official settlements balance however draws the line between the dollar holdings of foreign monetary authorities ( whether liquid or nonliquid ) and those of private foreign holders. If privately held foreign liquid claims on the United States increase ( and there are no other offsetting transactions ) this is treated as an inflow of private capital rather than as an addition to the deficit which it is under the liquidity definition The official settlements concept in other words concentrates on the dollar claims that foreign monetary authorities have acquired ( or relinquished ) usually in the process of maintaining the parity of their currencies After years of sizable deficits on liquidity balance averaging $ billion between and the U.S. deficit appears to have been reduced to about $ ^ billion in The deficit as measured by official settlements moved from an average of about $ billion in the early 's to $ billion in and remained at approximately that level in Gold purchases from the United States in bore little direct relationship to the U.S. deficit in that year. Net sales of U.S. gold jumped from $ billion in to nearly $ billion in About $ million represented a transfer to the IMF in connection with the enlargement of our quota. Primarily however these sales resulted from decisions on the part of a few countries to convert dollars accumulated in earlier years and a concentration of payments surpluses in countries that do not wish to increase their dollar holdings. More than half of the total could be attributed to the purchases of one country France although Spain and Austria also completed sizable purchase programs During the official settlements deficit was on the average nearly $ billion lower than the liquidity measure reflecting the growth in private foreign liquid claims on the United States. The two measures were very close in when private dollar holdings did not advance as rapidly. The behavior of private demands for dollars in the years ahead will provide additional evidence as to the relative significance that should be attached to the liquidity and official settlements measures in guiding the United States to a sustained external payments equilibrium DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES IN THE 'S When the Kennedy Administration took office in the United States had just recorded the largest payments deficit of any year in the postwar period. The country was losing gold rapidly and incurring a large buildup of liquid claims abroad that threatened further losses. Action was imperative. The result has been a series of measures of increasing severity and scope to meet a problem that proved more intractable than was believed earlier. The measures taken through were fully reviewed in earlier Reports of the Council. Further significant measures discussed below were taken in February and December of As a result of these measures and of other developments the U.S. payments position strengthened. The basic trading position and earnings on investments improved especially. Over this period the surplus on nonmilitary goods and services increased from $ billion in to $ billion in ( Table ) Despite rising prices and wages abroad drastic economies were achieved in military expenditures abroad and offsetting sales of military equipment were increased sharply ; these improvements were sufficient to offset the net increase in Government grants and capital outflows. Moreover such grants and capital outflows are now almost completely tied to the export of U.S. goods and services GROWTH OF PRIVATE CAPITAL OUTFLOWS The outflow of U.S. private capital rose from $ billion in to $ billion in Through this outflow the United States was acquiring a large volume of foreign assets and adding rapidly to its net international own- TABLE United States balance of payments> [ Billions of dollars ] Type of transaction Balance on goods and services : First quarters * Seasonally adjusted annual rates Government grants and capital n e t Government grants and capital._ Balance on nonmilitary goods and services Balance on t r a d e Balance on services Net travel Income on direct investments.

But the assets acquired through this investment were largely illiquid and were obtained by parting with liquid assets that added to both private and official claims against us. The U.S. reserve position declined continually The growth of U.S. private capital outflow is not difficult to explain. As market integration has progressed and as individuals and businesses have become increasingly familiar with international financial operations there has been a natural tendency for capital to become more mobile and more responsive to market forces U.S. corporations have shown an increasing interest in business operations overseas and have been sending a rising flow of funds abroad to build and equip new plants and distribution facilities. The extremely rapid growth of incomes particularly in Europe Canada and Japan has greatly expanded consumer demand especially for manufactured goods. Wage rates generally are lower abroad and when American management and technology are exported the productivity of foreign labor is frequently brought close to the U.S. level making American enterprises in other countries often extremely profitable. The virtual disappearance of internal tariffs in the EEC and EFTA while external tariffs are retained has created a large and expanding market which can be readily served by large-scale production in Europe. Of course direct investment abroad is also made for the purpose of developing or expanding sources of raw materials often for use in the firm 's operations in the United States or elsewhere With few exceptions U.S. money and capital markets are much better developed and freer from restrictions than those abroad and this attracts foreign borrowers. In part because of this better organization interest rates and flotation costs are considerably lower in this country. Consequently there is a tendency for foreigners seeking capital to look to U.S. markets and for interest-sensitive funds to move abroad in search of higher returns Long-standing interest rate differentials and the growing mobility of capital were important factors in the spurt of long-term portfolio lending that occurred in and New foreign security issues in the U.S market doubled from to and the acceleration continued in early This growth was arrested by the introduction in mid-1963 of the Interest Equalization Tax ( IET ) which raised the effective interest rate for most foreign borrowing here. Meanwhile other capital flows began to accelerate offsetting much or all of the gains from the IET. Bank loans rose sharply from $ billion in to $ billion in Direct U.S investment abroad also accelerated in and THE FEBRUARY PROGRAM At the beginning of it was evident that the rapid rise in capital outflows was creating growing problems for the U.S. balance of payments. Accordingly the program announced by the President on February applied the IET to most bank loans with a duration of a year or more to borrowers in developed countries asked for a 2-year extension of the IET and attempted in other ways to stem the outflow of private capital through the voluntary cooperation of American business U.S. banks and other financial institutions were asked to observe appropriate " guidelines " with respect to their foreign operations in Banks were asked by the Federal Reserve System to limit the increase in their claims on foreigners in to percent of the value of their outstanding foreign credits as of December Top priority was to be assigned to bona fide export credits and second priority to credits to less developed countries. A related program was applied to credits and investments abroad by nonbank financial institutions Under the part of the program administered by the Department of Commerce about large nonfinancial corporations were asked to make a maximum effort to expand the net balance of ( a ) their exports of goods and services plus ( b ) their repatriation of earnings from the developed countries less ( c ) their capital outflows to such countries. They were also asked to bring liquid funds back to the United States Although considerable skepticism was initially expressed particularly abroad regarding the effectiveness of a voluntary program it is now clear that the response was excellent. The net outflow of U.S. private capital declined from $ billion in ( and an annual rate of $ billion in the fourth quarter ) to an annual rate of $ billion in the first three quarters of Short-term capital both bank and nonbank accounted for a great part of this dramatic shift : the movement of such funds changed from a net outflow of $ billion in to a net inflow at an annual rate of $ billion in the first three quarters of The success of the voluntary program in shifting the movement of short-term funds was reinforced by the intensified demand for funds in the domestic market as a result both of sharply rising activity and some tightening of monetary policy The U.S. payments deficit in was adversely affected by certain unusual transactions of the United Kingdom. As a part of the U.K. program to protect the pound the British authorities converted certain holdings of U.S. securities. Together with the deferment of payments on intergovernmental debts these transactions reduced U.S. net receipts by well over $ J/2 billion on both the official settlements and the liquidity basis Despite good over-all results of the payments program the volume of U.S direct investment outflows were at a record high in In the first three quarters they reached an annual rate of $ billion compared with a total of $ billion. However they declined substantially during the course of Since such outflows are usually planned long in advance and businesses were not asked to interrupt projects already underway a lag in the response to the February program was expected. Nevertheless there was disquieting evidence that plans for direct investment in remained at a high level. With the sharp reversal in the trend of bank lending abroad direct investment became the primary area of concern PROGRAM FOR By the autumn of it was clear that the February program had been successful and that a substantial improvement in the balance of payments had been achieved. Nevertheless even further improvement was necessary if payments equilibrium was to be attained. Consequently decisions were announced in December to reinforce and renew the existing programs for Further attention was placed on encouraging U.S. exports on promoting foreign tourism and foreign investment in the United States and on minimizing the effect on the balance of payments of Government transactions. But the principal focus of the supplementary steps had to be on the further containment of direct investment outflows Consequently new guidelines for direct investment were developed for nonfinancial corporations. Each of about individual corporations was asked to hold its combined and direct investment outflows ( plus earnings retained abroad ) in specified advanced countries and mineral exporting nations to no more than percent of the total of these items in the years This will permit an increase of about percent in the average annual outflow of direct investments in over the average annual rate in the base period. A joint target was set for the years and in order not to penalize firms which had cut back in and in order to seek greater restraint by those which had invested more heavily last year. Direct investment in under the program would be lower than in though it would remain high relative to outflows of earlier years Financial institutions were given guidelines for that permitted about the same outflow as had been suggested for The guidelines provided for nonbank institutions were somewhat more detailed than those for New arrangements with the Canadian authorities were announced on the understanding that continued exemption from the IET would not threaten the goals of the U.S. program Efforts to reduce even further the impact of Government activities on the balance of payments will continue in Net overseas defense expenditures have been quite successfully reduced since Unfortunately expanding defense needs will prevent further reduction in The bulk of Government aid will continue either to be given " in kind " with no dollar flows or tied to procurement in the United States U.S. TRADE POSITION The outstanding performance of U.S. trade in the 's has been strongly supported by our excellent price record as well as by the rapid expansion of output and incomes abroad. However the slowdown of economic expansion in Europe and Japan contributed to a reduced trade surplus in The January-March dock strike not only redistributed the time pattern of sales ( somewhat inflating the level ) but also caused a sizable loss of export sales Imports showed an unusually large gain in ; both manufacturing goods and raw materials rose substantially. Only agricultural imports declined primarily because of lower prices for such commodities as coffee sugar and cocoa. Many U.S. firms fearing a possible steel strike turned in part to foreign suppliers in raising steel imports to about $ billion an all-time high. In addition the rapid expansion of the U.S economy in brought a larger rise in our imports than in previous years The boom in the home market may also in some cases have reduced the interest of American producers in finding or serving markets overseas particularly where their production made full use of existing capacity or labor The decline in the trade surplus was not the result of any basic deterioration in our competitive position. Our price performance in continued to match that of our major trading partners so that we retained the relative advantage achieved in earlier years CONCLUSION Over the longer run the policies required to assure equilibrium in the U.S. balance of payments will be influenced by many factors including among others the growth rates of our major trading partners throughout the world the extent to which European nations learn to rely actively on fiscal as well as monetary policy as a means of adjusting over-all demand the development of capital markets in Europe changes in the indispensable foreign exchange costs of national security our rate of technological innovation our record of productivity growth and price stability and the progress of improvements in international financial machinery If our current account surplus continues to expand a renewed growth of capital outflows could be compatible with over-all payments equilibrium For the present however the volume of capital outflows likely to occur in the absence of any measures to moderate them would clearly be inconsistent with equilibrium in our external payments. Given that private capital outflows must be contained the selective measures currently in use seem for the present an essential component of our policy. Compared with reliance solely on restrictive general monetary measures that might conceivably hold down capital flows to the same extent the selective credit techniques have the obvious advantage of allowing monetary policy to respond to the ' needs for domestic credit as well as to affect the percent of total credit that flows abroad The selective approach is consistent with an appropriate composition of the private capital outflow. The exemptions in the IET and the priorities established in the voluntary programs protect the access of less developed countries to U.S. capital. The Federal Reserve program moreover gives priority to export financing which could be squeezed under a highly restrictive monetary policy. By increasing the cost of borrowing in the United States the IET contains its own escape valve : countries in urgent need of new U.S. capital issues are still free to enter our markets ; the less urgent needs are screened out. The guideline approach of the voluntary programs tends to permit the business firms and banks themselves to select the most attractive investment opportunities ; the investments foregone would yield a smaller return than the average for all new U.S. foreign investments The voluntary program continues to permit growth in both the ownership of U.S. productive facilities abroad and of the U.S. loans outstanding abroad But it keeps that growth within the bounds permitted by the U.S. current surplus and the cost of essential defense and aid. The voluntary program remains the foundation of improvement in the U.S. balance of payments this year Our efforts to achieve full equilibrium in should also benefit from the improved situation for sterling ; in special transactions by the United Kingdom accounted for roughly half of our deficit. Prospects are also strengthened by recent understandings established with Canada on the handling of its capital needs from the United States. Strong domestic expansion will continue to increase imports this year and defense expenditures abroad will have to rise in Nevertheless the United States has the determination and the means to continue the sharp improvement effected last year in bringing its balance of payments into equilibrium Chapter The Employment Act : Twenty Years of Policy Experience n p ' H E R E WERE great expectations and not a few qualms when the JL Employment Act was signed into law on February following enactment by heavy bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress This year which marks the 20th anniversary of that enactment is a suitable occasion to review our experience under the Act to take stock of where we stand today and to consider the challenges ahead THE ACT AND ITS BACKGROUND The legislation of set forth the following declaration of policy : The Congress declares that it is the continuing policy and responsibility of the Federal Government to use all practicable means consistent with its needs and obligations and other essential considerations of national policy with the assistance and cooperation of industry agriculture labor and State and local governments to coordinate and utilize all its plans functions and resources for the purpose of creating and maintaining in a manner calculated to foster and promote free competitive enterprise and the general welfare conditions under which there will be afforded useful employment opportunities including self-employment for those able willing and seeking to work and to promote maximum employment production and purchasing power In making this declaration the Congress recognized that the billions of independent spending and saving decisions of a free economy could well result in levels of total demand either short of full employment or in excess of productive capacity. Furthermore it took the view that Government policies could play a constructive role in improving the stability and balance of the economy The Act was a product of the experiences of the Great Depression and World War II. The Depression shook but did not destroy the faith in an automatic tendency of the economy to find its proper level of operation. In the early 1930Js public works and other antidepression programs were justified as temporary " pump priming " to help the private economy get back on its track after an unusual and catastrophic derailment. And the departure from orthodox fiscal principles was made with regret and without complete consistency. The Government expenditures explicitly designed to combat depression necessarily increased budget deficits ; but this implication was veiled by financing these outlays through an " extraordinary " budget Meanwhile taxes were raised and salaries and housekeeping expenditures cut in the regular budget thereby reducing the over-all stimulation of Government measures The relapse of the economy in into a sharp decline from a level still far below full employment gave rise to conflicting interpretations. To some it proved that pump priming and Government deficits had undermined the confidence of the business community and thereby only worsened the situation. Others however concluded that it pointed to the need for larger and more sustained fiscal and monetary actions to revive the economy In drawing this conclusion economists were buttressed by the writings of J. M. Keynes who offered a theoretical explanation of the disastrous depression. The Keynesian conclusions received additional support during World War II because they offered a satisfactory explanation of why the high deficit-financed defense expenditures of that period not only wiped out unemployment but went beyond to create inflationary pressures Memories of the disastrous 's were very much in the public mind as World War II was drawing to an end. Many active proponents of " full employment " legislation in and feared a relapse into depressed levels of economic activity like those of the 's once military spending ended. They looked toward Federal public works spending as a peacetime replacement at least in part for the wartime defense outlays The opponents of " full employment " legislation had several reservations and objections. Some feared that it would mean a statutory blessing for perpetual budgetary deficits soaring public expenditures and massive redistribution of income from upper to lower income groups. There were doubts that Government actions could and would on balance raise employment ; and there were fears that these actions would lead to regimentation and would jeopardize the free enterprise system. The proponents of legislation on the other hand argued that the Act would merely provide a setting essential to the proper functioning of the free enterprise system because a depressed economy heightened social tensions discouraged innovation and initiative dulled competition and undermined confidence The legislation which finally emerged from this discussion wisely abstained from diagnosing depression as the disease and public works as the cure but instead concentrated on establishing the principle of continuing Government responsibility to review and appraise economic developments diagnose problems and prescribe appropriate remedies. And it placed major responsibility squarely upon the President who was asked to discuss his execution of that responsibility in an Economic Report to be transmitted to the Congress at the start of each year The Act also established two agencies the Council of Economic Advisers in the Executive Branch and the Joint Committee on the Economic Report ( later named the Joint Economic Committee ) of the Congress with inter- related but separate responsibilities. These institutions have each filled a vital and previously missing role in their respective branches of Government they have provided a coordinated overview of the economic impact of the entire spectrum of Government tax expenditure monetary and other activities. To maintain the emphasis on advice and coordination the Joint Economic Committee was not given any substantive legislative responsibility nor the Council any policy-executing duties. Both agencies have participated actively in the counsels of Government ; both have conscientiously striven for a thoroughly professional economic competence and approach in their respective reports and recommendations ; and both have contributed to the public understanding of economic issues Today 's economic policies reflect the continuing impact of the Employment Act in all the years since its inception. And our accumulating experience is certain to be reflected in the policies of the future. This chapter reviews the development of policy in the past years and outlines the present relationship between economic analysis and economic policy AVOIDING DEPRESSIONS AND BOOMS The Congress proved wise in its decisions to state goals broadly and to concentrate on continuing review analysis and proposals since the specific problems that actually arose were somewhat different from those which many supporters of the Employment Act had anticipated Although an important part of the impetus for the Employment Act derived from the prolonged depression of the 's and the resulting fear of stagnation in the American economy this problem did not prove to be the primary challenge to economic policymaking under the Act. Indeed immediately after World War II excess-demand inflation proved to be the key problem. Subsequently policy was focused on the age-old problem of limiting the size and duration of cyclical swings. Only much later and in a much different and milder form did stagnation arise as a live issue Thus much of our experience under the Act consisted of policy actions to combat recession lest it turn into depression and to contain excess demand pressure lest it generate inflationary boom COMBATING RECESSIONS A series of relatively short and mild recessions required Government attention * in the postwar period. The problem of cyclical declines was not unexpected by the framers of the Employment Act nor was it new to the American economy. In the period between ( the beginning of the business cycle annals of the National Bureau of Economic Research ) and World War II we had experienced periods of recession or depression Our postwar record is blemished by additional periods of contracting economic activity and Compared with the previous cyclical record the postwar recessions have been far shorter considerably milder and substantially less frequent. Postwar recessions ranged in duration from to months ; the average duration of previous declines had been months and only had been shorter than months in length Measured by the decline in industrial production from peak to trough postwar recessions ranged in magnitude from percent to percent. By comparison in the interwar period the declines ranged from to percent ; three of the five contractions exceeded percent and only one was less than the percent maximum of the postwar period During the past years the economy has spent a total of months or percent of the time in periods of recessions far less than the percent applicable to the era Discretionary Policies This improvement in the postwar record of the economy was aided by the deliberate discretionary steps taken by the Government to modify the impact of business downturns and thereby to prevent cumulating declines into depression. The speed and force of these actions in both the fiscal and monetary areas varied among the recessions. Thus in little new fiscal action was taken partly because inflation was viewed as a key problem even during the decline and partly because Government measures taken the previous year were expected to have a considerable impact on the economy : the tax reductions of were supplying large refunds and large expenditure increases were forthcoming under the recently enacted Marshall Plan. The Federal Reserve did act to reduce reserve requirements in a series of steps during the spring and summer of reversing a two-year rise in short-term interest rates In as military outlays declined and aggregate activity retreated the principal expansionary influence came from previously scheduled reductions of corporate and personal income taxes. But some new action was taken to reduce excise taxes and to speed up expenditures. All three major instruments of monetary policy reserve requirements the discount rate and open market operations were used to encourage the expansion of creditfinanced expenditures. Meanwhile the Administration planned larger fiscal steps that might be taken if the recession seemed likely to be prolonged. Significantly in the bipartisan character of expansionary fiscal policies was established for the first time as the Republican Administration of President Eisenhower adopted measures that had previously been linked to the New Deal and Keynesian economics In the recession was considerably deeper than its two postwar predecessors and both the Eisenhower Administration and the Congress were more vigorous in taking action. An important concern of earlier years that business confidence might be disturbed by Government recognition of a recession seemed insignificant since the sharp recession was obvious to all < Several important measures were taken. The benefit period for unemployment compensation was temporarily extended. Grants to States under the Federal highway program were enlarged and accelerated and other programs in the budget also were expanded or rescheduled to provide an earlier stimulative effect. The Government also acted to spur housing activity by financial operations in the mortgage market and by altering terms on Government-guaranteed home mortgages. The important measures were launched near or after the trough of the recession. Thus in retrospect policy helped most to strengthen the early recovery rather than to contain or shorten the recession. Nevertheless in view of the general recognition that the Government would be running a substantial deficit in any case these additions to Federal outlays were a significant reflection of changed attitudes toward the role of fiscal policy Monetary policy also played a constructive role in the recession once the monetary authorities moved to ease credit months after the peak in economic activity. Thereafter Federal Reserve actions contributed to a revival in housing and other investment by promoting a sharp reduction in interest rates both short- and long-term The first fiscal measures to deal with the recession were taken with the inauguration of President Kennedy in January when the recession had just about run its course. Nevertheless improvements in the social insurance system rescheduling of Federal expenditures and expanded programs ( including defense and space ) were an important stimulus to the recovery during In contrast to the delay in taking fiscal measures the Federal Reserve reversed a tight money policy early in prior to the downturn Not all discretionary changes in taxes or expenditures have contributed to economic stability. Indeed some steps taken to pursue national security or social goals had destabilizing economic impacts which were not always appropriately offset. Previously scheduled payroll tax increases took effect in and and drained off purchasing power in recession or in initial recovery. In defense outlays declined and triggered a recession before offsetting expansionary policies were adopted Structural Changes for Stability On the whole discretionary fiscal and monetary actions made a distinct positive contribution in limiting declines. Even more important in this respect was the strengthened inherent stability of the postwar economy In large measure this can be traced simply to the greater size of the Government relative to the total economy : that is the increased importance of Government expenditures both purchases of goods and services and transfer payments. Government outlays do not participate in the downward spiral of recession ; because of its borrowing capacity the Federal Government unlike businesses and households can maintain its spending in the face of declining income receipts. Although State and local governments do not have equal immunity from the need to tighten their belts they have been able to maintain their growing spending programs relatively unaffected during the mild postwar recessions The increased relative importance of Government outlays is shown in Chart Social insurance and national defense have added especially to the postwar totals of Federal outlays State and local outlays have been rising rapidly in an effort to catch up with neglected needs and to keep up with the desires of a wealthier society for improved public services The contribution to the stability of the economy resulting from a high level of Government expenditures insulated from revenue declines has been augmented by the cushions to private purchasing power provided by the built-in fiscal stabilizers When private incomes and employment decline purchasing power is automatically supported by both a decline of Federal revenues and an increase in unemployment compensation payments. Transmission of the virus of deflation is thus impeded. During postwar recessions the progressive Federal personal income tax has not had to demonstrate its full stabilizing effectiveness because of the mildness of dips in personal earnings. There have however been sharp declines in corporate incomes ; the Federal TreasChort Role of Federal and State and Local Governments in the Economy PERCENT OF G N P GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES V TRANSFERS- ? / PURCHASES OF GOODS AND SERVICES STATE & LOCAL " GOVERNMENT TRANSFERS- ^ / GOVERNMENT PURCHASES OF GOODS AND SERVICES AVERAGE AVERAGE AVERAGE J / N A T I O N A L INCOME ACCOUNTS BASIS ^ TRANSFER PAYMENTS NET INTEREST AND SUBSIDIES LESS CURRENT SURPLUS OF GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISES SOURCE : DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE ury has shared about half of the drop in profits thereby helping to bolster dividends and to cushion cash flow and hence investment outlays A number of improvements in our financial structure were developed in the 's to assure that financial collapse and declines in economic activity would not generate a vicious downward spiral as they did after These important financial mechanisms include Federal insurance of private deposits ; the separation of commercial and investment banking functions ; the Federal Reserve 's increased ability to provide banks with reserves in time of crisis ; and the joint work of the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission to reduce harmful speculation in the stock market The very existence of these structural changes has contributed to stability by improving confidence With the help of the more stable structure of the economy recessions in the postwar era have been limited to declines in investment spending ( and in Federal outlays ) Consumer incomes have not declined significantly and hence households have maintained their spending in recession. With the nearly two-thirds of GNP represented by consumer expenditures insulated from decline and with a solid foundation of public outlays declines in private investment have not cumulated. In contrast the Great Depression generated a decline of consumer outlays of percent from to and the shrinkage of consumer markets aggravated and reinforced the collapse in investment spending CONTAINING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES The desirability of price stability was clearly recognized in the legislative discussion of the Employment Act. But few considered the danger of postwar inflation nearly as great as the opposite danger of relapse into depression The legislation itself emphasized the objectives of using resources fully and attaining high employment. It did not explicitly label price stability an objective of policy although this was implicit in the Act and fully reflected in the policies of every Administration. Nevertheless concern has been expressed at times that policies for " maximum employment " might allow demand to press too hard on available resources thus biasing the American economy toward inflation In the wartime environment inflationary pressures of excess demand had been suppressed by direct controls on prices and by rationing. It turned out however during the years immediately following World War II that these measures had served partly to postpone rather than to eliminate significant demand pressures. Substantial backlogs of demand emerged in the period. Consumers and businesses possessed large accumulations of liquid assets to finance the rebuilding of their depleted stocks of household appliances machinery and equipment and their houses and plants Thus contrary to expectations the initial years of the postwar era were marked by excessive rather than inadequate demand. In this environment living standards of consumers the productivity of labor and the capacity of businesses rose rapidly. But so did the price level with a jump of percent in consumer prices from June to August Automatic fiscal stabilizers helped to contain the growth of private after-tax incomes and were reflected in budgetary surpluses during the period. The economic policymaking machinery set up under the Employment Act may have moderated pressures to cut taxes drastically. Meanwhile monetary policy was tied to a policy of supporting Government bond prices and was not free to combat inflation During the Korean war however the Government acted vigorously to counter inflationary tendencies close to their source. The March Federal Reserve-Treasury " accord " unleashed monetary policy. Selective controls on consumer instalment credit and on home mortgages were instituted. The enactment of three large increases in income and profits tax rates in and is one of the better examples of timely fiscal policy These actions reflected in part recommendations by the Council of Economic Advisers and hearings and reports of the Joint Economic Committee Right after jthe outbreak of hostilities prices had risen sharply in a flurry of consumer and business buying and as a result prices and wage ceilings had been imposed early in Once the restraining influence of over-all fiscal and monetary policies was fully felt there was little pressure on the ceilings and the economy was able to meet the peak defense demands of the emergency without inflationary strain The immediate postwar period and the early months of the Korean war are the two blemishes of clearly excessive demand on our postwar record. Apart from these two intervals wholesale prices have shown a net increase of only percent in the postwar era. In and the only other periods of marked price increases over-all demand was not generally excessive. That inflation raised new issues which are discussed below In view of the whole postwar record it can hardly be said that the Employment Act has biased policy toward inflation EVOLVING PROBLEMS AND POLICIES During the postwar era the American economy has remained free of the malignant diseases of depression and run-away inflation. And the rate of economic growth has considerably exceeded its long-term average. The objectives of the Employment Act however have not always been fully met. In particular experience has demonstrated that the avoidance of depression did not guarantee the achievement of " maximum employment " and the avoidance of excess-demand booms did not assure the maintenance of price stability INADEQUATE DEMAND IN EXPANSION The strength of private demand in the early postwar years and then again immediately after the Korean war led to a reassessment of the tasks of stabilization policy. After a decade of postwar experience suspicions arose that the typical problem would be to contain rather than to stimulate private demand Any such conclusion was soundly refuted by the facts of the ensuing years With the backlogs met and with a marked decline in the rate of family formation private demand weakened in the late 's. The economy 's performance weakened correspondingly because Government did not act to compensate. Thus while unemployment had averaged percent of the civilian labor force in the first postwar decade it remained above that level every month between late and October averaging percent The problem of inadequate demand in expansion which became the primary focus of fiscal action in the 's was a new challenge to policymaking under the Employment Act. In the first postwar decade each time the economy advanced or rebounded from a recession it reached the neighborhood of full employment. The policymakers had been ready in the early postwar years to deal with noncyclical problems of submerged prosperity or stagnating production. They had seen maximum employment as a moving target which could be maintained only through a substantial growth of output. Both the Council of Economic Advisers and the Joint Economic Committee had given these issues repeated attention in the late 's and early 's. But until the late 's no experience had been encountered to distinguish the problem of full employment from that of cyclical prosperity Then came a sequence of disturbing events : the recession followed a year of slow advance ; the recession began from a peak far below full employment ; and the expansion that began in seemed to be running out of steam after little more than a year During the initial years of this period Government policy maintained vigilance against excessive buoyancy of demand when that was no longer the problem. Restrictive fiscal and monetary actions choked off the recovery of The shift to an expansionary fiscal policy by the Kennedy Administration early in was designed primarily to initiate a thriving recovery. A determined policy strategy to assure complete recovery was first formulated when the economy faltered in The combination of fiscal stimuli to consumer demand and direct tax incentives to investment together with monetary actions permitting an ample rise in credit promoted a vigorous and sustained expansion after The inherent strength of both consumption and investment demand appeared in a new light once the Revenue Act of exerted its invigorating influence INFLATION AT LESS THAN FULL EMPLOYMENT Another problem encountered at times during the postwar era has been the tendency of prices to rise even in the absence of over-all excess demand pressures. This tendency reflects structural characteristics of the Ameri- can economy. The economy is not made up of fully competitive labor and product markets in which large numbers of buyers and sellers interact and respond passively to prices. On the contrary in many industries both unions and businesses exercise a considerable degree of market power. As a first result wages and prices are both somewhat rigid in a downward direction. To the extent that prices rise more readily in response to excess demand than they decline in the face of excess supply the price level is given an upward bias which can become particularly acute if there are sharp shifts in demand among various sectors of the economy. Secondly because of market power some firms augment increases in costs originating elsewhere and unions can escalate their wage demands if prices begin to rise. Third firms can use a strong market position to widen margins in a period of prosperity even if there are no upward pressures on their costs Fourth in the nature of the collective bargaining process key wage bargains in some industries may tend to establish a pattern applied elsewhere In particular ^ if the industries with key wage bargains happen to have excess demands and very strong profits the pattern will tend to pull wages upward more rapidly throughout the economy An important broadly oriented study by the Joint Economic Committee analyzed the workings of these important influences in the inflation. In that period excess demands that were present in machinery and equipment automobile and metals industries led to price increases that were not offset elsewhere. Large wage settlements in these industries with high demand and high profits had pattern-setting effects on many other contracts thus adding to costs on a broad front Rising prices that originate from such a process can affect expectations jeopardize the stability and balance of an expansion and create inequities and distortions just as readily as demand inflation. But measures to restrain these price increases by reducing over-all demand will enlarge unemployment and impair the productivity record so important to cost-price stability over the longer run. Policies to improve the operations of markets increase resource mobility and accelerate technical change can help to increase the economy 's resistance to rising prices. But in a world where large firms and large unions play an essential role the cost-price record will depend heavily upon the responsibility with which they exercise the market power that society entrusts to them The need for responsible private action was brought to public attention in the Economic Reports of President Eisenhower 's second Administration Through the major innovation of the guideposts in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations this need has since been focused and developed into a national policy to enlist the force of public opinion to maintain cost-price stability. The emergence of such a policy has been all the more important in recent years because of the balance of payments problem that has persisted alongside the domestic need for more expansion ECONOMIC POLICY TODAY Two decades of economic analysis and policy experience have shaped the development of a revised economic policy. By some current policy has been labeled the " new economics. " It draws heavily on the experience and lessons of the past and it combines both new and old elements. Current policy represents a coordinated and consistent effort to promote balance of over-all supply and aggregate demand to sustain steady balanced growth at high employment levels with essential price stability This approach to policy has several key aspects not entirely novel by any means. First it emphasizes a continuous rather than a cyclical framework for analyzing economic developments and formulating policies Stimulus to demand is not confined to avoiding or correcting recession but rather is applied whenever needed for the promotion of full-utilization and prosperity. Second in this way it emphasizes a preventive strategy against the onset of recession. Third in focusing on balance of the economy this policy strategy can not give top priority to balance in the budget. When private investment threatens to outrun saving at full employment a Government surplus is needed to increase total saving in the economy while restrictive monetary policy may also be called for to restrain investment outlays. When as in recent years private saving at full employment tends to outrun actual private investment the balance should be corrected by budget deficits and expansionary monetary policy. Fourth it considers the budget and monetary conditions in the framework of a growing economy recognizing that revenues expand and thereby exert a fiscal drag on demand unless expansionary actions are taken ; similarly it recognizes that money and credit must expand just to keep interest rates from rising Fifth this strategy emphasizes the use of a variety of tools to support expansion while simultaneously pursuing other objectives. Manpower policies selective approaches to control capital outflows as well as general fiscal and monetary measures are all part of the arsenal. Sixth it calls for responsible price-wage actions by labor and management to prevent costinflation from impeding the pursuit of full employment. Finally it makes greater demands on economic forecasting and analysis. The job of the economist is not merely to predict the upturn or the downturn but to judge continuously the prospects for demand in relation to a growing productive capacity THE NATURE OF CYCLICAL INSTABILITY An industrial economy is vulnerable to cumulative upward and downward movements in activity so evident in our long-term record. While they can have diverse specific causes these cyclical fluctuations can be explained as the result of imbalances between the rate of growth of productive capacity and the rate of growth of final demands that make use of productive capacity During periods of prosperity a considerable part of the Nation 's output is used to increase productive capacity through investment in plant and equipment and business inventories. If demand keeps pace sales expand and the new capacity turns out to be profitable. Businessmen find that their decisions to increase capacity have been validated and they continue to pursue expansionary investment policies. If on the other hand inventory stocks are built up far in advance of need on the basis of overly optimistic sales forecasts or as an inflation-hedge businessmen will subsequently wish to cut back their rate of accumulation. Similarly if outlays for business fixed investment add to productive capacity faster than demand expands overheads on new capital cut into profits inducing business firms to trim their capital outlays. Even if businessmen continue to add somewhat to their productive capacity the mere decline in the rate of expansion can mean an absolute reduction in the demand for capital goods and for output to go into inventories. Payrolls and purchasing power are thereby curtailed and a decline in total demand can result. Thus a slowdown in economic activity is converted into a definite downturn a recession or depression Imbalance can arise because businessmen in the aggregate invest too much and overbuild creating more capacity than the economy can even at best put to productive use. Or alternatively it can stem from " underbuying " a growth of final demand too slow to make use of even moderate additions to capacity. In principle cyclical movements can also be triggered by overbuilding of new homes and consumer durables Overbuilding of inventories partly encouraged by expectations of rising prices was probably the key factor in the first postwar downturn which occurred in That experience demonstrated that a situation of high total demand could deteriorate rapidly into recession without any change in the basic underlying factors in the private economy or any restraining shift in public policy. In the sharp decline in defense outlays reduced final demands and precipitated recession ; productive capacity became temporarily excessive and investment spending declined. In rapid growth of productive capacity was associated with an investment boom ; meanwhile final demands grew very slowly. It is not possible to deliver a clear verdict on whether more vigorous growth of final demand would have justified the high investment levels then obtaining. But with the slow growth of demand that actually occurred there was an abrupt decline in plant and equipment spending as well as inventory investment in In the rate of expansion of capacity ( including inventories ) was not excessive measured against the capabilities of the economy ; the failure of the economy to support that growth of capacity must be attributed to " underbuying " the inadequate expansion of final demand in an environment of restrictive fiscal and monetary policies In the future as in the past policies to avert recession can not wait until imbalances develop and the signs of a downturn are clear. The fact that economic activity is rising can not be an assurance of continued growth if the expansion is too slow to match the growth of productive capacity. Nor can a strong level of investment be relied on to sustain expansion if it threatens an excessive growth of productive capacity. Recognizing these tasks Government must apply its fiscal and monetary policies continuously to sustain and support a balanced expansion sometimes by moderating the strength of an excessive investment boom sometimes by adding to the strength of lagging final demand. The best defense against recession is a policy to sustain continued expansion. In a free economy fluctuations in private demand will inevitably occur and the Government will not always have the wisdom or the ability to counteract them. Continued expansion can not be guaranteed but recurrent recession need not be accepted as a necessary fact of economic life POLICY FOR A GROWING ECONOMY In order to achieve the goal of maximum employment the Government must coordinate all its policies to take account of the persistent growth of the economy 's potential output The Problem of Fiscal Drag One consequence of economic growth is that budgetary policies become more restrictive if they stand still. If tax rates are unchanged Federal revenues will grow continuously as the economy expands Meanwhile if Federal expenditures are held constant in the face of growing revenues the Federal budget will exert a continuing " fiscal drag " on private demand Either increased expenditures or reduced tax rates can offset this influence. A total of these two types of stimulative actions which exactly matched the dollar amount of normal revenue growth would provide a precise offset to fiscal drag ( and would leave unchanged the high-employment surplus discussed in Chapter ) A simple mechanical offset to fiscal drag is not however a satisfactory rule for fiscal policy. When aggregate demand threatens to exceed the supply capacity of the economy some fiscal drag should be allowed to operate. On the other hand waning strength in private demand points to fiscal action that would more than offset the drag effecting a desirable decline in the high-employment surplus Furthermore tightness or ease of monetary policy is important in determining appropriate fiscal actions. There is an analog to drag in the monetary area : A growing economy generates rising demands for liquid assets and increasing needs for borrowing. If monetary policies stand still in the sense of holding supplies unchanged continually tighter credit conditions and higher interest rates will be the result Accelerating Growth The growth of the economy is a major influence on policy ; the opposite side of the coin is the major role of policy in influencing potential economic growth. The larger the amount of current output invested in physical and human resources the more rapidly productivity and the productive capacity of the economy will increase A number of policy choices can speed growth by shifting resources into various types of investment. Public investment in human and physical resources can yield rich returns in more rapid economic growth. Some public investments such as those on research and development encourage complementary private investment. Outlays for manpower training improve labor skills and productivity. Throughout our history investment in education has been one of the key contributors to growth. Private investment in plant and equipment is a key determinant of our industrial capacity. It can be stimulated by easing monetary policies. It can also be encouraged by selective tax reductions such as the investment credit and depreciation reform of and the reductions in corporate tax rates in and When the economy is below full employment any stimulative measure is likely to add to private investment thereby contributing to the growth of potential as well as to actual output. But at full employment more resources can be devoted to capital formation only if current consumption is restrained. A policy strategy to accelerate growth may therefore point to higher personal income taxes or similar measures to hold consumption below what would otherwise be appropriate Choices of Tools Economic policy has many tools available in pursuing the goals of full employment rapid growth price stability and balance of international payments. The full range of economic objectives must be reflected in the selection of policies to meet particular circumstances Policy instruments differ in their impact. Sometimes policy tools can advance the economy toward more than one goal. For example manpower policies help to maintain price stability at high employment and to promote economic growth. Conflicts may occur however. For example high interest rates impinge particularly on investment both at home and abroad hence somewhat reducing foreign capital outflows but also reducing aggregate demand and slowing economic growth. In the case of potential conflicts instruments must be used more selectively ; for example moderate changes in interest rates can be supplemented by taxes on foreign investment like the Interest Equalization Tax The potential for timely results differs for various policy instruments Monetary policy can be altered readily although its full economic impact will not be immediate. While some restraint or speedup in Federal outlays can be applied by Executive authority alone tax rate changes must of course be approved by the Congress. The speed of congressional action on tax changes has varied. It acted rapidly to increase taxes in and to reduce excise taxes both in and On the other hand it took months to enact the comprehensive Revenue Act of Tax revision can help to avoid the necessity for abrupt changes in Federal expenditures which could require stopping a project before its conclusion or starting a new one with inadequate planning Given the possibility for achieving needed short-run stimulus or restraint through changes in taxes transfer payments or monetary policy decisions on expenditures for public services can rest on basic judgments of costs and benefits of public and private spending. The availability of this choice permits resources to be devoted to the highest priority uses PREREQUISITES OF SUCCESSFUL POLICY Choice of the right policy action demands full information about the state of the economy and understanding of its workings. And execution of stabilizing policy requires public understanding and acceptance INFORMATION An important requirement of economic policymaking is a firm and timely knowledge of where the economy stands. Spurred by the need for prompt and enlightened decisions the Federal statistics program has made rapid forward strides in the postwar period and now provides a much better gauge of current economic developments. Of the monthly series now carried in Economic Indicators the statistical summary prepared by the Council and issued by the Joint Economic Committee only percent would have been available by the monthly publication date at the time Economic Indicators was launched in the late 's In addition to the information on current developments a number of anticipatory surveys have been instituted which provide important information on the probable future course of the economy. Outstanding among these is the Commerce-Securities and Exchange Commission survey on plant and equipment ; additional important clues to future developments come from the Commerce inventory survey and the Census quarterly survey of consumer buying intentions. Important information also is obtained from private sources including the University of Michigan 's Survey Research Center the National Industrial Conference Board and McGraw-Hill Inc Yet our data are not completely satisfactory. The revisions of the national accounts last summer gave evidence of how much we learn later that could have been helpful on a current basis. There are any number of areas capital stock and capacity productivity employee fringe benefits job vacancies among them where there are important gaps and weaknesses in our quantitative information which can be remedied only by expansion of our statistical programs Not all the information useful to the Council comes from published sources or takes the form of numbers. The Council as enjoined by the Act finds it most useful to consult regularly with business and labor. These consultations provide valuable information and opinions and also allow the Council to explain and clarify Administration views PROFESSIONAL KNOWLEDGE Facts are the essential raw materials for analysis but they require intelligent processing to be useful in guiding policy. The ability of economists to diagnose and forecast on the basis of current facts and to evaluate the impact of alternative policy measures is a key determinant of what policy can do to maintain stable balanced growth Our economic knowledge has made great advances in the past generation but many important questions remain answers to which should be and can be improved through further research There are many quantitative uncertainties in forecasting the strength of private demands. Some of these were illustrated in when the improvement in profits and sales coupled with the shifting defense picture generated a more rapid and greater surge in investment demand than was foreseen initially. Furthermore the linkage between monetary policy actions and changes in ultimate spending also require more exploration. And even in areas that are more readily quantified such as the impact on GNP of changes in Government purchases and personal tax reductions there remains a considerable range of doubt about the timing of the impacts and the specific influences on consumption and investment Departing from the domain of aggregative output effects we need a better understanding of many more specialized problems such as the functioning of labor markets how job vacancies are filled how skill shortages are met and how excess supplies in one area are ultimately absorbed elsewhere Such knowledge can be a useful guide to the possibilities for expanding output and employment while avoiding bottlenecks But while much remains to be learned about our economy it would be a disservice to understate the power of economic analysis and to underrate the substantial contribution of the profession to the successful course of our economy in the postwar period. The Employment Act provided the framework in which this professional contribution could be rendered and be given its proper place in the framing of public policy PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING Not all of the needed improvements in knowledge and understanding are of a technical character. Even though viewed as correct by the professional analyst policies can not be applied effectively unless the Congress and the public at large understand how the proposed measures intend to further desirable objectives If policy proposals of the Administration are to be converted into legislation they must be convincing to the Congress. Twenty Annual Economic Reports have explained the rationale for the programs of four Presidents. And the Joint Economic Committee has rendered invaluable service in contributing to an understanding of general economic policy and specific proposals. The principles of fiscal policy and their implications for tax and expenditure legislation have been central to the Nation 's economic education in the past years. The great increase in understanding is best seen in the sophisticated current level of public discussion Proper understanding of policies by the public moreover contributes to the very success of the policy measures. In the absence of public understanding there can be perverse reactions. If people read policies to maintain price stability as an announcement that inflation has arrived rather than an exercise of determination to avoid it destabilized prices may be the result. If people see steps to combat recession as a sign of panic rather than a support to the economy this too can have adverse psychological effects In particular a firm appreciation by the American people of the rationale of wage-price guideposts is essential to make them effective and to limit the need for active participation by Government. It is the public that gets hurt by irresponsible wage-price decisions and public reaction can be the best reminder to those with market power of their social responsibility CONCLUSION As the primary objective set by the Employment Act is being reached new problems move to the fore and are receiving increasing attention in public policy. These include the efficient use of the Nation 's human and natural resources the conquest of poverty and suffering the reconstruction of our cities and the many other tasks set forth in the preceding pages of this Report. And undoubtedly in the pursuit of the goals of the Employment Act during the next years policymakers will encounter a new range of problems, no more completely foreseeable now than were the issues of today in While important problems remain we are nonetheless at an historic point of accomplishment and promise. Twenty years of experience have demonstrated our ability to avoid ruinous inflations and severe depressions. It is now within our capabilities to set more ambitious goals. We strive to avoid recurrent recessions to keep unemployment far below rates of the past decade to maintain essential price stability at full employment to move toward the Great Society and indeed to make full prosperity the normal state of the American economy. It is a tribute to our success under the Employment Act that we now have not only the economic understanding but also the will and determination to use economic policy as an effective tool for progress Appendix A MAJOR LEGISLATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS OF ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE IN Major Legislation and Administrative Actions of Economic Significance in February VOLUNTARY RESTRAINT PROGRAM FOR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS In a special message to the Congress the President asked bankers and businessmen to " exercise voluntary restraint in lending money or making investment in developed nations. " The President said that restraint should particularly apply to short-term loans and direct investment. This led to the issuance by the Federal Reserve Board of guidelines to be followed by banks and by nonbank financial institutions in their foreign lending and investment activities and to requests by the Department of Commerce for similar restraint by the business community March GOLD COVER P.L. Eliminates the requirement that each Federal Reserve Bank maintain gold certificate reserves valued at not less than percent of the amount of commercial bank deposits it holds APPALACHIAN PROGRAM P.L Authorized Federal aid for the development of the economically depressed 11-state Appalachian region.
