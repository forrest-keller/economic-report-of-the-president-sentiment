REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS DURING APPENDIX C. STATISTICAL TABLES RELATING TO INCOME EMPLOYMENT AND PRODUCTION VI ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT To the Congress of the United States : This is my first report to you under the Employment Act of As a member of the Congress at that time I was proud to vote for this historic Act As your President today I am proud to respond to its challenge to its mandate " to promote maximum employment production and purchasing power " within the framework of " free competitive enterprise. " Nothing less than the maximum will meet our needs Our gross national product ( GNP ) for the fourth quarter of rose to a $ billion annual rate But an unemployment rate of / percent continues to cast a long shadow over our pride in this achievement ; remind us that far too much of our precious human potential still lies idle As I stated in outlining my political philosophy six years ago : I regard achievement of the full potential of our resources physical human and otherwise to be the highest purpose of governmental policies next to the protection of those rights we regard as inalienable The road to that full potential is still a long one. But we have moved steadily and impressively forward in the past three years And the tax cut will speed our climb toward our goals of full employment faster growth equal opportunity balance in our external payments and price stability As the Employment Act requires I shall in this report assess our progress toward our economic goals review the current and foreseeable trends in the U.S. economy in relation to its potential and set forth my policy and program for achieving our national economic potential THE $ BILLION EXPANSION As we face the tasks ahead we have much to build on Economic Milestones Our record $ billion expansion since early has carried us past important milestones in the march toward a better life. In for the first time in history : GNP passed the $ billion mark by year-end Average earnings in manufacturing exceeded $ a week by year-end Personal income ( before taxes ) reached an average rate of some $ per capita by year-end After-tax income of individuals exceeded $ billion for the year Corporate profits exceeded $ billion before taxes and $ billion after taxes for the year Residential construction passed $ billion for the year Civilian employment exceeded million during the year Extent of the Advance These striking statistics tell us where we are. But they do not tell us how far and how fast we have come In the nearly three years of unbroken expansion since early : GNP is up percent measured in constant dollars Industrial production is up percent Civilian nonfarm jobs are up ^ million Personal income is up $ billion or percent Corporate profits before taxes are up $ billion or percent Net income per farm for is up almost $ or percent Total after-tax income of the American people is up $ billion or percent Real disposable income per family is up more than $ or percent Comparative Gains It is fair to ask how the expansion in output and incomes compares with earlier upswings in the American economy. Here is the answer : The $ billion rise in output in ^ years knows no parallel in our peacetime economic annals The advance of $ billion in labor income is also unparalleled Average real income of nonfarm workers has risen by $ a year a gain not exceeded in any previous comparable period The rise in corporate profits from a rate of $ / billion in early to roughly $ billion at the end of is notable for three reasons : a. The 14-percent annual rate of advance is high by previous standards b. The rise is not only large but prolonged at this stage in past expansions profits had already declined from their peaks c. The rise has occurred even as the liberalized depreciation guidelines of were transferring $ } billion of business receipts out of taxable profits into nontaxable depreciation Most heartening to me is that these gains to American labor and American business were not at the expense of the American consumer whose income is no longer being eroded by inflation as prices have held steadier in the United States than in any other major industrial country ; the competitive position of U.S. exports which has benefitted from several years of stable domestic wholesale prices our best record since the war and better than that of any other major industrial country Contributions of Business Labor and Government An expansion as long strong and free of excesses as the one we are now experiencing does not " just happen. " Business has generally held prices in check kept inventories on an even keel and avoided excesses in capital financing Labor has been constructive in its collective bargaining and in its contributions to rising productivity. Average wage rate increases over the period have been the most modest since World War II thereby helping to stabilize unit labor costs and improve our ability to compete with Europe and Japan Government has steadily pursued fiscal and monetary policies designed to promote recovery accelerate expansion and encourage business and consumer confidence : in when the Administration 's quick anti-recession program got recovery off to a flying start ; in when in sharp contrast to and rising Federal purchases new tax incentives to investment and continued credit ease lent a steadying hand to an economy whose advance was faltering ; in when prospects of a timely tax cut buoyed a reassured and resurgent economy Federal Purchases and Tax Cuts Rising Federal purchases have played an important role in sustaining the expansion. They accounted directly for percent of the growth in GNP quite apart from their substantial indirect effects in increasing business and consumer outlays Our fiscal program for will shift emphasis sharply from expanding Federal expenditure to boosting private consumer demand and business investment The $ billion tax cut will challenge American businessmen investors and consumers to put their enlarged incomes to work in the private economy to expand output investment and jobs I am confident that our private decision makers will rise to this challenge I am confident of their growing agreement that " new records " in output and employment are not enough ; that four million unemployed and percent idle factory capacity are intolerable ; that the acid test of economic policy is whether we can make full use of our growing labor force and our rising productivity our full potential THE JOB AHEAD OF U S We have not yet met this test. New high ground is not the summit That still lies ahead Our advance though impressive sustained and noninflationary has not gone far enough and fast enough to create the jobs needed by our unemployed to get our factories humming to desired capacity to lift our GNP to its reasonable potential to restore the growth rate of our productive potential to the pace we took for granted in the early postwar period to raise the incomes of farm families to a level more comparable to those of nonfarm families to expand investment and profits to levels that will hold more of our capital funds at home and thereby shrink our external payments deficit The size of the job that lies ahead of us is measured by Unemployment * percent of our labor force is still idle even after a year-to-year advance of $ billion in our GNP. Taking into account the added workers who seek employment as jobs become more plentiful we would need at least two million more jobs today just to get rid of stubborn excess unemployment Productivity advance we need about two million new jobs each year to offset the labor-saving effects of rising output per worker Labor force growth more than a million added jobseekers enter the labor market each year indeed we will soon need million jobs Unused capacity operating rates in manufacturing still average only percent of capacity against the 92-percent rate preferred by business managers Wasting potential men machines and materials that lie idle today could readily add about $ billion more to our $ billion GNP The balance-of-payments deficit although sharply reduced by the determined steps announced in July the deficit is still with us And gold outflows though only half as large in as in and less than half as large in the three years as in have not been eliminated EARLY TAX REDUCTION If we are to master these problems we must above all enact the tax bill ( H.R. ) not in one or two or three months but now ; not in diluted but in strengthened form with an immediate drop from an 18-percent to a 14-percent withholding rate Far too long our economy has labored under the handicap of Federal income tax rates born of war and inflation : Those rates were designed to curb demand in an economy bursting at the seams But now when demand and incentives are not strong enough to make full use of our manpower and machines the tax brake is set far too tight We need to release that brake quickly to put billions of dollars of new consuming and investing funds into the hands of the private economy Greatest Fiscal Stimulus Speedy passage of the tax cut at the 14-percent withholding rate will cut individual income tax collections by $ billion in over $ billion of which will come from lowering the withholding rate to percent instead of percent ; will cut corporate tax liabilities by $ 11/2 billion in ; will provide a net fiscal stimulus taking both expenditures and tax cut into account that will be three times as great in as in any of the years and ; will in fact provide a greater net stimulus to the economy in to jobs production income and profits than in any other peacetime year in history The economics of efficiency is in no way inconsistent with the economics of expansion. By combining efficiency with expansion frugality with compassion : we shall hold the fiscal budget below the fiscal budget and cut the deficit in half ; we shall get a dollar 's value for a dollar spent while not fearing to spend a dollar when and where the Nation will reap a full dollar or more in benefit ; we shall strengthen our programs to meet pressing human needs ; fully satisfy our defense requirements ; and respond to the demands of economic progress ; and we shall at the same time provide an unparalleled fiscal stimulus to the economy Sustained Expansion The tax cut will give a sustained lift year-in and year-out to the American economy When fully effective in it will send well over $ billion annually coursing through the arteries of the private economy The resulting stream of purchases by willing consumers and of investment by responsive businessmen will at full strength expand the tax cut 's initial impact several-fold The Nation will then year-after-year reap this benefit in the form of $ to $ billion more GNP $ to $ billion more consumption $ to $ billion more profits than we would attain without the tax cut These gains growing steadily will at long last lead to a balanced budget in a balanced economy at full potential Safeguard Against Recession For the near term the tax cut will give us the vital fiscal safeguard we need against recession. It will convert what is already a long and strong advance into the longest and strongest expansion in our peacetime history : By April it will have outdistanced all but the long and incomplete climb out of the Great Depression from to By mid-1965 it will have outlasted even that expansion I do not say that we can at one stroke wipe out recession or legislate the business cycle out of existence. But vigilant bold and flexible policy can prevent some recessions and nip others in the bud. And we have a great stake in doing so The American economy suffered two recessions in quick succession in and If a recession of the same average force were to hit us in or it would cost us a loss of $ billion or more of output ; a rise of two million in unemployment ; a drop of nearly percent in industrial production ; a sag of more than $ billion in after-tax profits Clearly by enabling us to avoid a recession the tax cut will pay us a handsome quick bonus quite apart from its basic long-run benefits THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK We enter with optimism riding the strong mount of an expansion that has already crossed the $ billion mark and responding to the expected spur of a quickly enacted $ billion tax cut With the tax cut promptly enacted our gross national product for should rise from $ billion for to a projected $ billion ( understood as the midpoint of a $ billion range ) But without the tax cut our sights would have to be set $ to $ billion lower and dashed expectations could turn expansion into recession With the tax cut the state of business confidence is strong : business forecasters today foresee a to 6-percent or even greater rise in GNP from to In contrast a year ago they foresaw only a to 4percent rise. Today 's business optimism is one of our strongest economic assets in With the tax cut unemployment will decline significantly in With the tax cut profits will continue to rise avoiding the decline that usually sets in after the first year or two of a business expansion With the tax cut our balance of payments will benefit from basic improvements in our ability to compete in world markets as costs are cut directly through lower taxes and indirectly through modernization ; and in our ability to retain and attract capital as returns on domestic investment rise with higher volume and lower unit costs With the tax cut consumer spending fueled by the extra $ billion of take-home pay will propel the economy forward in With the tax cut business fixed investment should rise more in than in and housing and automobile demand should remain strong With the tax cut in short will be a year of strong sustained economic advance But all this will not come about automatically. It requires and I confidently expect : that the Congress will act swiftly ; that taxpayers will respond by putting the released funds to work in the private economy ; that business will resist the temptation to exploit stronger markets by unneeded price boosts ; that labor will resist the temptation to exploit stronger job opportunities by excessive wage demands ; that Government will follow a balanced policy to maintain a favorable monetary climate while meeting the requirements of our balance-of-payments situation ; that both public and private action will be taken as needed to overcome those pockets of excessive unemployment that remain even in the face of the job-creating stimulus of the tax cut PRICE-WAGE POLICY IN Prospects are favorable for continuing in our good record of price stability and stable unit labor costs : First the price and wage record from which we start is excellent : a. The wholesale price index is still below the level of years ago b. The consumer price index has risen only percent a year mostly in services c. Average wage increases have stayed generally within the bounds of productivity increases Second because of wage moderation and rising productivity labor costs per unit of output have held steady while volume has risen Third the tax cut will further reduce costs increase take-home pay and keep sales and profits rising Fourth with ample supplies of labor and industrial capacity the force of expanding demand touched off by the tax cut can express itself in more output income jobs and profits rather than inflationary price or wage increases Nevertheless a series of specific price increases in recent months especially in manufactured goods gives me some cause for concern I do not anticipate a renewal of the price-wage spiral a spiral that would weaken our expansion and worsen our balance-of-payments position I count on the sense of responsibility of the Nation 's industrialists and labor leaders to extend the excellent price and cost records of recent years to maintain price and wage policies that accord with the noninflationary guideposts that I have asked the Council of Economic Advisers to reaffirm in its attached Report In the face of a percent increase in corporate profits in less than three years and the prospect of further increases to come with the tax cut I see no warrant for inflationary price rises On the heels of solid increases in real wages plus therisein take-home pay under the tax cut I see no warrant for inflationary wage increases Accordingly : I shall keep a close watch on price and wage developments with the aid of an early warning system which is being set up in the appropriate agencies I shall not hestitate to draw public attention to major actions by either business or labor that flout the public interest in noninflationary price and wage standards And I shall translate into action the view a. that antitrust policy must remain keenly alert to illegal price-fixing and other practices that impair competition ; b. that we must resist new steps to legalize price-fixing where competition should prevail OTHER POLICIES FOR Monetary " Policy and Balance-of-Payments Measures A strong upswing in the economy after the tax cut need not bring tight money or high interest rates especially when our balance of payments is improving so sharply in response to measures begun in and reinforced last July ; the budget for fiscal year will cut the Federal deficit in half and ease pressures on interest rates from Treasury borrowing It would be self-defeating to cancel the stimulus of tax reduction by tightening money. Monetary and debt policy should be directed toward maintaining interest rates and credit conditions that encourage private investment But monetary policy must remainflexible,so that : It can quickly shift to the defense if unexpectedly inflation threatens or the balance of payments worsens When monetary measures are not needed as defensive shock troops they can reinforce fiscal policy in promoting domestic expansion O-64-2 II Our balance of payments will continue to benefit from the special program launched last July. This requires early enactment of the interest equalization tax designed to raise the costs of foreign borrowing in our capital market without forcing up domestic interest rates further economies in dollar outflows from Government programs without compromising our efforts to maintain the strength of the free world continued price stability and export promotion to maintain or improve the competitive position of our exports Trade Expansion and Development Assistance The Kennedy Round. The United States ' 30-year campaign to reduce barriers to world trade and the intensified pursuit of that goal signalled by the passage of the Trade Expansion Act of will reach a climax in U.S. industry and agriculture are in excellent condition to seize the new opportunities offered by trade liberalization and to weather the adjustments that may be required Our goal is a more prosperous America in a more prosperous world The developing countries. Reduced trade barriers will expand exports and help an increasing number of developing countries to become self-supporting But for most poorer countries full self-support is still some distance off We must help them find a path to development through freedom and freedom through development Our development assistance effort must and will be more sharply focused and rigorously administered. We shall encourage others to share more of its burden and seek a larger role for private investment But a strong development assistance program continues to be vital to our pursuit of peace and stability in the free world Agriculture The contribution to our Nation 's economic growth made by rising agricultural productivity is too often overlooked We need only look at the restraints placed on national growth in Soviet Bloc countries to understand what a failure in the growth of agricultural productivity can mean to a nation and its people Looking forward in we face a number of challenges in agriculture : While net income per farm his grown percent in chronic problems of overproduction remain We need improved commodity legislation this year for many of our major commodities The highly successful Food For Peace program requires new legislative authority this year We must also provide the research and development support necessary to the continued strength adaptability and growth of American agriculture Labor and Manpower Policies No matter how mechanized it becomes our economy is still an organization of people working with tools. In we must redouble our efforts to meet these problems of our working people : Automation. Technological change is a prime mover of our economic growth but it can lead to painful job displacement A special high-level commission should be established to determine how we can best gain the benefits of automation while minimizing its human costs As a starting point I commend to it the analysis of this problem which the Council of Economic Advisers has made in Chapter of its accompanying report More efficient labor markets Displaced workers must be retrained and helped by improved Federal-State placement and counseling services to find their way back to fully productive lives And we must strengthen our education and training facilities at every level to give our youth the background and skills demanded by our rapidly developing economy. The Youth Employment Act remains high on our agenda Unemployment insurance. The burden of displacement on the individual must be eased by extending the coverage and increasing the benefits of our unemployment insurance programs The Fair Labor Standards Act. Coverage should be extended to over ^ million workers who lack overtime coverage or are not protected at all among them hotel motel restaurant laundry drycleaning and farm-processing workers Working hours. We should and will solve our present unemployment problem by expanding demand not by forcing the standard work week down to hours. This would only redistribute work not expand it At the same time the regular use of heavy overtime may be unreasonably curtailing job opportunities in some industries Accordingly I shall ask for legislation authorizing higher overtime penalty rates on an industry-by-industry basis where tripartite industry committees determine that such rates could create more jobs without unduly raising costs Transportation and Technology Our expanding economy and growing population place ever-rising demands on the Nation 's transportation system. It is particularly urgent that the Congress now enact legislation before it to assist our cities in modernizing their mass transportation facilities ; to revise and strengthen our national transportation policy and place more reliance on the creative force of competition The Federal Government provides major support for the research and development which underlie our striking technological advances In the past much of our research and development has been connected with national defense. Now as military outlays level off we face a challenge to apply the Nation 's growing scientific and engineering resources to new socially profitable uses ; an opportunity to accelerate the technological progress of our civilian industries The Federal Government should join with private business and our universities in speeding the development and spread of new technology I have directed the Department of Commerce to explore new ways to accomplish this Housing and Community " Development Americans generally are better housed than the citizens of any other nation. Much of this could not have been accomplished without the encouragement and help Government has given to our private financial institutions Authorizations expire this year for several of our major programs They need to be renewed and extended to renew the decaying areas of our cities while minimizing the burden of dislocation on families and small businesses ; to allow cities to acquire land for open-space urban use and to facilitate better urban planning ; to strengthen our program of low-rent public housing ; to provide for construction of more specialized housing for the elderly THE WAR ON POVERTY In the State of the Union Message I announced that this Administration was declaring unconditional war on poverty in America. I shall present the details of the attack including legislative proposals in a later special message to the Congress Americans today enjoy the highest standard of living in the history of mankind. But for nearly a fifth of our fellow citizens this is a hollow achievement. They often live without hope below minimum standards of decency The per capita money income of these million men women and children was only $ in against $ per capita for the Nation as a whole We can not and need not wait for the gradual growth of the economy to lift this forgotten fifth of our Nation above the poverty line We know what must be done and this Nation of abundance can surely afford to do it The Role of Prosperity and Faster Growth Today as in the past higher employment and speedier economic growth are the cornerstones of a concerted attack on poverty : In the Great Depression mass unemployment made poverty all too common an experience Since prosperity and progress have reduced the incidence of substandard incomes from one-third to one-fifth of the Nation But the erosion of poverty slowed measurably after The tax cut will once again generate jobs and income at a pace that will provide an escape from poverty for many of our least fortunate families But general prosperity and growth leave untouched many of the roots of human poverty. In the decade ahead the forgotten fifth must be given new opportunities for a better life There are two major prongs to our specific attack on poverty in America : First to enable every individual to build his earning power to full capacity Second to assure all citizens of decent living standards regardless of economic reverses or the vicissitudes of human life and health Building Individual Earning Power The first approach is the more fundamental Let us deny no one the chance to develop and use his native talents to the full Let us above all open wide the exits from poverty to the children of the poor These are the keys to earning power : Education. Poverty and ignorance go hand in hand : Of families headed by a person with only a grade school education percent are poor. Of those headed by high school graduates only percent are poor We must upgrade the education of all our youth both to advance human well-being and to speed the Nation 's economic growth But most vitally and with Federal support we must upgrade the education of the children of the poor so that they need not follow their parents in poverty Health. The poor and the children of the poor are handicapped by illness and disability that could be avoided : Largely as a result of the ill health that grows out of poverty we rank below many other countries in the conquest of infant and maternal mortality in average life expectancy and nutrition We must speed and intensify our efforts to make good health more accessible to the poor Skills and jobs. We need to help both young adults and older workers acquire marketable skills by the programs already indicated Community and area rehabilitation. Concerted community action with new Federal assistance can break the dismal and vicious cycle found in too many of our rural and urban areas : The cycle of poverty : inadequate schools drop-outs poor health unemployment creating delinquency slums crime disease and broken families thereby breeding more poverty The cycle of chronic depression : regions needing new economic uses for their idle or underutilized human and physical resources but too poor to provide them alone and therefore unable to break out of their depression The Area Redevelopment Act must be renewed and improved and rural communities must be helped to find new economic strength Furthermore in a forthcoming special message I shall propose a new program to deal with our Nation 's most distressed major region Appalachia Equal opportunity. Forty-four percent of nonwhite families are poor. Deficiencies of education and health and continuing job discrimination depress the earnings of Negroes and other nonwhites throughout their lives Only percent of nonwhites compared to percent of whites complete high school Infant mortality is nearly twice as high maternal mortality four times as high for nonwhites The life expectancy of a nonwhite man at age is nearly years shorter than for his white contemporary and shorter than the average life expectancy reported in some foreign countries Unemployment rates for nonwhites are generally double those of whites Even beyond civil rights legislation the fight to end discrimination requires constructive action by all governments and citizens to make sure in practice as well as in principle that all Americans have equal opportunities for education for good health for jobs and for decent housing Providing a Decent Living The second prong of the attack on poverty is to protect individuals and their families from poverty when their own earnings are insufficient because of age disability unemployment or other family circumstances Too many of the poor and disabled today fail to receive aid under the eligibility requirements of our Federal State and local network of programs of insurance and assistance For the aged enactment of the proposed program for hospital insurance under social security is the first order of business For the unemployed permanent legislation to strengthen unemployment insurance is urgently needed as indicated above A Versatile Attack The tactics of our attack on this ancient enemy must be versatile and adaptable. For the sources of poverty vary from family to family city to city region to region : A solution will not be found in any single new progam directed from Washington and applied indiscriminately everywhere Instead we urgently need to bring together the many existing programs Federal State local and private and focus them more effectively in a frontal assault on the sources of poverty Most important we shall encourage and assist communities and regions to develop their own plans of action ; to mobilize their own resources sis well as those available under Federal programs Only in this way can we assure that the Federal funds devoted to the war on poverty over $ billion of new funds in the first year will be invested wisely and well AMERICA 'S ECONOMIC CHALLENGE In and beyond we seek a free and growing economy which offers productive employment to all who are willing and able to work ; operates at the full potential of our human and material resources ; encourages free enterprise innovation and competition by citizens in all walks of life ; avoids setbacks from recession or inflation ; generates steady and rapid growth in productivity the ultimate source of higher living standards while providing the new skills and jobs needed for displaced workers ; meets ever more fully the needs and preferences of our citizens as freely expressed in the market place and in the halls of governments ; provides increasing leisure and satisfying ways to use the time to those who wish it ; safeguards the security of the Nation and the free world by assisting efficiently the economic development and political independence of the less developed countries ; promotes mutually advantageous trade with other countries and progressively reduces barriers to international competition ; earns enough in free international transactions to balance our external payments and yet meet our world responsibilities ; distributes fairly the fruits of economic growth among consumers and producers workers and employers ; moves steadily toward the American dream of equality of opportunity for all citizens regardless of race religion sex or residence regardless of social and economic status at birth ; permits every American to produce and to earn to the full measure of his basic capacities ; eliminates with the compassion and foresight of which a free and abundant economy is capable avoidable suffering and insecurity from the lives of our citizens These aspirations are not easy to fulfill but neither are they beyond our powers The policies public and private we must pursue are not waiting to be discovered. They are at hand and we must use them Our main reliance is on private ingenuity initiative and industry But it is the obligation of government to support the vibrant steady growth of the economy ; to expand the opportunities of free enterprise ; to guard against its excesses ; and to serve the economic interests of all the people The Federal Government working closely with labor business and agriculture yet respecting the economic and political freedoms of individuals ; working closely with State and local governments yet careful not to trespass on their domain faces the economic challenges of with confidence Strengthened by the programs I have outlined in this Report the Nation will move steadily toward the realization of its full potential THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS Washington D.C.

Gross national product was barely at the $ billion rate of a year earlier and many feared that it would go lower. Yet less than years later sustained economic expansion had carried GNP to an annual rate of $ billion for the fourth quarter of This unprecedented gain in gross national product was accompanied by a record of price stability unsurpassed in any expansionary period since World War II As Chart shows the economy has made a strong and sustained advance beyond the records of earlier years. The expansion has demonstrated the vitality of the private economy in an environment of progressive Federal policy. But the Nation 's performance must be measured against its potential levels of output and employment not simply against past records Compared with the past there is much to be proud of. Compared with the Nation 's potential there is much yet to do. This Report is in large part addressed to the goals that lie ahead and to the policies needed for advancing toward them By all odds the country 's number one economic problem is persistent unemployment. Indeed this would stand near the top of any list of ills afflicting our society. The unemployment problem has many dimensions and so it must be attacked on many fronts. It is clear however that more rapid growth in domestic and international markets for the Nation 's output is the central prerequisite for full employment. Tax reduction is urgently needed as the prime mover toward this target. Programs of education and retraining aid to depressed areas and disadvantaged groups and measures to improve labor mobility are also essential in this endeavor but they can have their full effects only if there is adequate over-all demand for the products of labor. Chapter of this Report appraises the gains of the past years and the prospects for and discusses the role of Federal fiscal and monetary policy in generating enough demand to use the economy 's full potential Solution of the unemployment problem and its associated waste of potential output is essential to a successful attack on many of our social evils But we can not expect a reduction in unemployment alone to eliminate the poverty that afflicts percent of American families. This degrading and self-perpetuating condition can be fully overcome only by programs that attack directly the many sources of impoverishment in our society.

The current stage of technological development promises a continued growth in productivity and a reduction in toil. But technological progress always creates problems of adjustment and many fear that today 's problems may be more severe than those of earlier periods. Chapter examines the process of innovation in production ways of speeding it up and ways of easing the painful human problems it creates The return to full employment will put to a test the ability of the American economy to make full use of its productive potential without a renewal of the price-wage spiral. Chapter evaluates the economy 's capacities for avoiding inflation in and beyond and emphasizes the need for responsible private price and wage making The importance of maintaining price stability is heightened by the need to eliminate the deficit in the United States ' balance of international payments which remains a problem in spite of substantial inroads that have been made in the past year. After reviewing recent developments in this area Chapter turns to a question that will inevitably be raised by the reduction in this country 's payments deficits namely the effectiveness of the free world 's present international monetary system Since the end of World War II the United States has become increasingly aware that its own interests are closely interwoven with those of the developing nations. Chapter re-examines this interplay of interests and explores its implications for American development assistance1 policies On October the Council of Economic Advisers testified before the Subcommittee on Employment and Manpower of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. The testimony dealt with the unemployment problem its relationship to changing production methods and the role of the pending tax legislation in attacking the problem. Because the testimony relates to matters discussed in Chapters and it is reproduced in this Report as Appendix A Chapter Economic Expansion and Federal Policy .HE AMERICAN ECONOMY has recorded nearly years of solid expansion since early But it urgently needs the tax cuts now pending to complete the climb back toward full employment and full production that began years ago. After reviewing the impressive record of these years and examining the role of Federal fiscal and monetary policy in achieving this record this chapter discusses the economic situation at the end of ; the prospects for ; and the broad outlines of policy that can complete the return to full employment REVIEW OF THE EXPANSION By April of this year the present expansion will have become the second longest peacetime expansion of this century exceeded only by the prolonged climb out of the depths of the Great Depression. As Chart shows the $ billion expansion since early has eclipsed the brief expansion in both extent and duration and has achieved in its first quarters a greater increase in total real output percent than was achieved in the quarters of the expansion. With early enactment of the pending tax bill it has every prospect of continuing throughout at an accelerated pace EXPANSION OF DEMAND While all major components of demand have contributed to the expansion of the past years much of the advance has come from rising Federal State and local purchases of goods and services. Federal purchases in constant dollars rose by percent from the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of and accounted for percent of the total increase in demand. As Table indicates this contrasts sharply with the two previous expansions when declining real Federal purchases detracted from the increase in gross national product. State and local purchases rose by percent in constant dollars over the recent period accounting for percent of the total demand increase A second major source of demand strength in the present expansion has been private nonfarm residential construction. In contrast to the experience of the two previous expansions housing expenditure has risen fairly steadily since the beginning of From the first quarter of that Chart Real Gross National Product in Three Postwar Expansions GNP TROUGH = Jj TOTAL GNP Tl QUARTERS AFTER GNP TROUGH / JJ BASED ON SEASONALLY ADJUSTED DATA PRICES EMPLOYED PERSONS INCLUDE ARMED FORCES 2l TROUGH QUARTERS FOR GNP WERE H AND SOURCES : DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS year to the fourth quarter of it rose percent in constant dollars accounting for percent of the total increase in GNP The unusually vigorous expansion in government expenditures and residential construction has been supplemented by a sustained increase of business investment in producers ' durable equipment and nonresidential construction. Measured in constant dollars it rose by percent from the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of Although this percentage rise is larger than that in total GNP it is disappointing by past standards. Business investment typically has risen faster than GNP in expansions just as it has fallen faster in recessions. During the period the rate of business fixed investment consistently exceeded percent of GNP in constant ( ) dollars ; in the current expansion the ratio has remained close to its recession low of percent The pace of inventory accumulation has been moderate by comparison with some periods in the past and has been unusually steady since mid-1962 After jumping from a $ billion annual rate of liquidation at the recession trough to an $ billion rate of accumulation in the first quarter of inventory investment has fluctuated moderately around an average value of $ billion for the last half of and the whole of Despite the notable strength of the demand for automobiles ( discussed below ) total personal consumption outlays have remained between and percent of after-tax personal income as they have in every year since The rise in consumption outlays from the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of amounted to percent in constant dollars and accounted for about half the over-all increase in GNP TABLE Changes in real gross national product in three postwar expansions Annual rate of change ( Percent ) Component Total gross national product Federal Government purchases State and local government purchases Residential construction Business fixed investment * Business inventory cbangc_I Personal consumption expenditures Net exports Distribution of total change1 ( Percent ) 1954II to I to to 1954II to I to I to II IV III II IV III ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( \ ( ) Based on data in prices Preliminary estimates oy Council of Economic Advisers for latest quarter in current expansion Includes producers ' durable equipment and nonresidential construction Inapplicable because inventory changes were negative in the trough quarters Not shown because of small numbers on which changes would be based NOTE. Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding Source : Department of Commerce ( except as noted ) MODERATION IN PRICE INCREASES This strong sustained advance in real output in the past years has been accompanied by an unusual degree of price stability. As in nearly all periods of expansion there has been some upward drift in the prices of final purchases. But the price rise of the past years has been well below that in other periods of comparable output gains. Of the percent increase in current-dollar GNP from the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of percent consisted of a rise in constant-dollar output and only percent of a rise in prices. Only in the short expansion of was the price rise comparably small The average annual rate of increase in the consumer price index over thefirst34 months of the current expansion amounted to a very moderate percent. Considering the availability of new products and quality changes not fully reflected in the index there has been little if any real erosion of the purchasing power of the consumer 's dollar. The wholesale price index which is a better measure of the international competitiveness of American products has not risen since the recession trough in early EXPANSION IN INCOMES In this environment of sustained increases in output and comparative price stability gains in real income have been significant and widely diffused. The moderation of money wage increases has served the Nation 's balance of payments well without serving labor ill. Money wages have not had to push ahead rapidly in order to keep pace with consumer prices Employee compensation per nonfarm worker adjusted for the mild rise in consumer prices increased by percent from the recession trough to the last quarter of The farming sector of the economy has also shared in the advance. Net income per farm adjusted for changes in prices paid by farmers for cost-ofliving items rose by percent from early to The rise in disposable personal income adjusted for price increases the best measure of the after-tax economic gains of individuals amounted to percent from the recession trough to the fourth quarter of On a per capita basis the rise was percent In previous business expansions corporate profits characteristically have risen rapidly in the early quarters of recovery and then levelled off or declined because of a sharp diminution in the rate of gain in productivity. In the current expansion the rate of increase in GNP per worker has been better maintained than in the past ( Chart ) As a consequence profits after taxes increased $ billion or percent from the recession trough to the fourth quarter of Because of the advantageous shift of corporate earnings from profits to depreciation allowances permitted by the liberalization of the Internal Revenue Service 's depreciation guidelines the sum of corporate profits after taxes and capital consumption allowances provides a more useful comparison over time for most companies. This total rose $ billion during the expansion as Chart indicates These continued gains in both labor and profit incomes could not have been consistent with price stability without the excellent productivity record during the past years. A high rate of productivity increase is the surest means of reconciling the aspirations of all for higher incomes with the maintenance of a stable price level and improvement in the balance of payments UNEMPLOYMENT AND UNUSED POTENTIAL OUTPUT Although the expansion brought rising levels of economic welfare to most Americans during the past years it was marred by continuing excessive unemployment. The 16-percent increase in demand from the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of brought about a 4-percent increase Chart Corporate Profits After Taxes and Capital Consumption Allowances BILLIONS OF DOLLARS II PROFITS AFTER TAXES PLUS CAPITAL CONSUMPTION ALLOWANCES / SEASONALLY ADJUSTED ANNUAL RATES NOTE : BEGINNING DATA REFLECT NEW DEPRECIATION GUIDELINES AND INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT SOURCES : DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS in civilian employment ; but even so in the last quarter of the year percent of the civilian labor force was unemployed. Moreover lack of job opportunities kept many potential workers out of the labor force while others held jobs well below their capabilities In the first year of recovery substantial progress was made in cutting unemployment. The over-all seasonally adjusted rate dropped from percent in to percent in Reductions were largest among those workers most affected by the recession ; the unemployment rate fell percentage points for nonwhites points for semiskilled and unskilled workers and points for manufacturing workers. However during no further progress was made. The monthly unemployment rate varied within narrow limits about an average of percent Excessive unemployment is the most obvious symptom and one of the worst consequences of a level of demand that falls short of the Nation 's potential output. During the Council of Economic Advisers carefully re-examined its measure of potential GNP. This concept fully discussed in the Council 's January Report defines " potential " as the output that would be produced if unemployment were at the interim-target level of percent. For the period to date the earlier conclusion still holds : the level of constant-dollar GNP needed to maintain the unemployment rate at percent has been growing at an average rate of about / percent a year since mid-1955 when the unemployment rate was close to percent As Chart shows the cumulative effect of actual output growth at a rate less than 3y2 percent after mid-1955 had produced a gap of $ billion ( prices ) between actual and potential output by the first quarter of The rapid recovery in the first year of expansion lowered this gap to $ billion by the first quarter of but since that time expansion in output has just about kept pace with the growth in potential. As a consequence unemployment has failed to decline to a tolerable level and a gap close to $ billion between actual and potential output remained in the fourth quarter of Merely avoiding recession or even maintaining a rate of expansion comparable to that of the last quarters will not close the gap or eliminate excessive unemployment. Only a significant acceleration of expansion can enable the Nation to make full use of its growing labor force and productive potential. The choice of appropriate fiscal and monetary policies to achieve this goal is one of the problems challenging the Federal Government in MAINTENANCE OF THE EXPANSION Two years ago many observers who noted that postwar expansions had become successively shorter wondered if this trend would continue. Although that anxiety has long since been allayed there is some fear now that simply because of its duration the current expansion must be approaching its end. If this were true we would face much higher un- Chart Gross National Product Actual and Potential and Unemployment Rate BILLIONS OF DOLLARS * ( RATIO SCALE ) GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT IN PRICES pxfj \ PERCENT D I t I PERCENT GNP GAP AS PERCENT OF POTENTIAL ( Left scale ) UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 1/ ( Right scale ) j * I I T955 I SEASONALLY ADJUSTED ANNUAL RATES /2V2 % TREND LINE THROUGH MIDDLE OF I/UNEMPLOYMENT AS PERCENT OF CIVILIAN LABOR FORCE ; SEASONALLY ADJUSTED SOURCES : DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS employment and greater wasted potential instead of a return to fuller use of our available resources The fact is that over-all business fluctuations have no fixed rhythms and recessions are not in any scientific sense inevitable. There are it is true certain systematic features of the economic process leading to the onset of recession. During periods of prosperity a larger part of the Nation 's output is used to increase productive capacity through investment in plant equipment and business inventories. If over-all demand rises rapidly enough to justify the added capacity incentives for further growth of capital are maintained and the expansion of economic activity continues. But when the growth of demand does not keep pace business firms curtail further additions to capacity by trimming their investment outlays. The reduction in investment in turn reduces employment and income thus converting the initial slowdown in the growth of demand into an actual decline in general economic activity a recession While individual recessions have their own features and their own proximate causes reversals from expansion can typically be traced to a failure of demand to keep pace with the expansion of capital facilities. There have been many occasions in the past when timely Federal policy actions could have maintained the balance between demand and capacity and thereby changed our economic history. It is vital that such opportunities be seized in the future FEDERAL POLICY AND FULL EMPLOYMENT To comply with the mandate of the Employment Act of " to promote maximum employment production and purchasing power " the Federal Government must adjust its programs to complement private demand Given the magnitude of its expenditure commitments its revenue collections its public debt management obligations and its money and credit responsibilities the Government inevitably exerts a powerful impact on demand. It is therefore a first principle of responsible Federal economic policy to try insofar as possible to adjust this impact in a way that promotes expansion and price stability The instruments of fiscal policy Federal taxes transfer payments subsidies grants-in-aid and purchases of goods and services are the Government 's most powerful tools for promoting expansion. Federal purchases of goods and services are themselves a component of demand and indirectly they affect the other components. Through their impact on employment and income they influence the level of consumption. By increasing sales and profits they encourage investment expenditures. Similarly taxes transfers and subsidies affect consumption and investment through their obvious effects on disposable incomes after-tax profits and incentives Federal grants-in-aid finance many State and local expenditure programs These fiscal policy tools while powerful can at present be used by the Executive with only limited flexibility. Major expenditure programs must be related to a variety of domestic and international objectives as well as to Chart Federal Budget NATIONAL INCOME ACCOUNTS BASIS BILLIONS O F DOLLARS EXPENDITURES RECEIPTS I SURPLUS lull ! DEFICIT J I J I J I CALENDAR YEARS * SEASONALLY ADJUSTED ANNUAL RATES SOURCES : DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE BUREAU OF THE BUDGET AND COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS the requirements of economic efficiency. They are therefore sometimes difficult to reconcile with income and employment goals in the annual budgetary process. Moreover under our constitutional system legislation needed to implement fiscal policies is the prerogative of the Congress. The Congress has demonstrated its ability to enact tax and expenditure legislation quickly in time of emergency and the Executive Branch does have some flexibility in the timing of expenditures. This limited flexibility was used to good advantage in But without legislation to establish in advance specific rules designed to facilitate flexible fiscal policy such as those requested by President Kennedy in tax and expenditure policies can not be adjusted with sufficient speed to cope with the swift changes in private demand that bring recession or inflation. Greater flexibility would be desirable. However the main function of fiscal policy must continue to be the provision of a good supporting framework for expansion THE FULL-EMPLOYMENT BUDGET The Federal budget on a national income and product accounts basis gives the most comprehensive picture available of the revenue and expenditure activities of the Government as these affect private demands and the level of economic activity. This budget includes the receipts and expenditures of the Federal trust fund accounts as well as those in the administrative budget but excludes credit transactions. Unlike the administrative budget it records corporate tax liabilities at the time they accrue rather than when collections are made. These and other differences between the administrative budget and the national income and product accounts budget are outlined in the January Report of the Council of Economic Advisers Federal policy decisions determine budgeted expenditures and a set of laws governing tax rates and transfer payments. The actual surplus or deficit position of the budget depends partly on the planned levels of expenditure and the rates incorporated in the tax structure and partly on the general strength of private income and demand. Since both receipts and expenditures are affected by the level of private demand the budget serves as an automatic stabilizer moving into deficit in a recession and toward a surplus in recovery. This pattern is evident in Chart The economic impact of a given budget program is best measured by its surplus or deficit at full-employment income levels. The surplus in the full-employment budget is too large when the Government demand contained in the budget and private investment and consumption demands forthcoming from after-tax incomes are insufficient to bring total output to the full-employment level. The actual budget will then show a smaller surplus or larger deficit than the full-employment budget If the fiscal structure is biased in this direction it can be corrected either by expanding Government purchases to employ idle resources in satisfying public needs ; or by expanding private business and personal after-tax incomes through reduced tax rates or increased transfer payments to employ idle resources in satisfying the demands of the private sector. When the budget is too expansionary the combination of public and private demands will eventually exceed productive capacity and excessive upward pressure on prices will develop. In this event sound fiscal policy calls for lowering expenditures or raising tax rates or both The appropriate size of the surplus or deficit in the full-employment budget depends on the strength of private demand and its responsiveness to fiscal policy. The budget must counterbalance private demand. The weaker the underlying determinants of private demand the more expansionary the budget should be ; the stronger these determinants the more restraining the budget should be Whether a given budget is too expansionary or restrictive depends also on other Government policies affecting private spending of which monetary policy is the most important. Other things being equal a strongly expansionary monetary policy permits a larger surplus by strengthening business investment residential construction and other expenditures that are sensitive to the cost and availability of credit FISCAL POLICY IN A GROWING ECONOMY In a growing economy periodic budget adjustments are required to maintain adequate expansion of total demand. The volume of tax revenues rises as incomes grow if tax rates remain unchanged. At present tax rates the revenues that the Federal Government would collect at full employment increase by more than $ billion a year. If program needs do not require expenditures to grow at the same rate tax rates must be reduced or a growing full-employment surplus will result with increasingly restrictive effects on the economy In the past this very process has been a major factor in slowing expansions and precipitating downturns. Thus the consequences of excessive potential surpluses have been large actual deficits unemployment and inability to achieve steady growth To avoid these consequences an appropriate expansion-promoting fiscal program would call for tax and expenditure policies that prevent a constrictive rise in the full-employment surplus. As Chart suggests the experience of the past years has illustrated the tendency of the full-employment surplus to build up to expansion-retarding levels as the economy grows The tax reductions of will be a giant step to remove a burdensome fiscal restraint before the economy levels off or goes into a recession and to provide a framework for continued vigorous growth THE ROLE OF MONETARY POLICY Establishing a suitable fiscal framework is not the only step the Government can take to promote full employment. The ability of the economy to maintain expansion in both its actual and its potential output is significantly affected by the monetary and debt management policies of the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury Department. Expenditures on Chart Federal Surplus or Deficit : Actual and Full-Employment Estimates NATIONAL INCOME ACCOUNTS BASIS BILLIONS O F DOLLARS SURPLUS FULL-EMPLOYMENT ESTIMATE ACTUAL r I DEFICIT CALENDAR YEARS SOURCES : DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE BUREAU OF THE BUDGET AND COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS long-lived assets such as residential and commercial buildings business plant and equipment and to a lesser extent consumer durables are particularly sensitive to cost and availability of credit which are heavily influenced by monetary and debt management policies The choice of monetary policies must be related to the character of private demand to the type of fiscal policy being pursued and to goals with respect to the balance of payments. In the light of these considerations various combinations of fiscal and monetary policies are appropriate to different conditions in the economy When aggregate demand is generally deficient and investment and consumption are expanding too slowly to provide jobs for all those seeking employment expansionary monetary policy normally can and should accompany expansionary fiscal policy. Likewise when excessive aggregate demand threatens to cause inflation a tight monetary policy may be called for in conjunction with a fiscal program that permits full-employment Federal revenues to rise relative to expenditures Under some circumstances however it may be appropriate to operate monetary policy at seeming cross purposes to fiscal policy in order to restrict O-64-4 or expand the share of output devoted to investment. In general an easier monetary policy will permit a higher sustainable rate of investment and capacity growth. Together with a slightly restrictive full-employment budget such a policy mix may raise the growth rate of potential output while keeping total demand within noninflationary bounds. Alternatively if investment is so large relative to consumption and Government purchases as to threaten a rapid buildup of excess capacity or serious bottlenecks in capital-goods industries the need may be for monetary restraints on investment and stimulus to consumption through a tax reduction A partially offsetting mix of fiscal and monetary policies also becomes appropriate when as now the Nation 's balance-of-payments deficit is excessive at the same time that domestic expansion needs to be stimulated. In this case however it is useful to differentiate among types of monetary policies. Efforts can be made as they have been in the current expansion to use the various tools of monetary and debt-management policy to keep the cost and availability of long-term credit favorable to domestic expansion while maintaining short-term interest rates at a level necessary to restrain short-term capital outflows. Meanwhile other more direct measures to deal with the balance-of-payments problem need to be pushed vigorously to correct the basic causes of the deficit and in the process provide more scope for monetary policy in promoting domestic expansion Against the background of these general considerations an understanding of the problems and possibilities of Federal policy in the maintenance of expansion can best be gained by examining the experience of the past three expansions FEDERAL POLICY IN T H E E X P A N S I O N S OF AND The recovery from the recession was aided by a substantial tax cut and by the fact that materials shortages and controls during the Korean conflict had limited the buildup of capacity to produce civilian goods. The result was a period of rapid expansion in late and early centering first in inventories automobiles and housing. This was followed by a remarkable boom in fixed investment from the third quarter of through the third quarter of The absence of price-wage restraint in the period contributed to a widespread inflation despite the lack of any general excess of demand over capacity output. Excess demand was confined to the durable goods manufacturing industry where orders strained capacity in many lines But sharp price and wage increases in this sector were imitated in other industries that did not share similar demand pressures Indeed the lack of real output increases in early prompted predictions of recession. Despite the capital goods boom total output levelled off at that time as automobiles residential construction and Federal purchases all declined. But defense outlays increased sharply from mid-1956 to mid1957 and capital goods purchases remained strong. By the time the investment boom had run its course total demand had not grown sufficiently to use fully the added capacity that had been created. Federal outlays levelled off early in and then declined just at a time when expansionary policy was needed to avoid a downturn. And the Federal Reserve which had been tightening money and credit conditions throughout most of the expansion raised the discount rate in August just as the downturn in production was beginning The entire expansion of was characterized by price stability ample productive capacity and excessive unemployment. Wholesale prices were virtually steady throughout the expansion. The capacity utilization rate in manufacturing had dropped to percent in the recession nearly points below its peak level in the fourth quarter of Except for brief periods of rapid inventory accumulation before and after the lengthy steel strike of the utilization rate never regained much more than half this loss. Consequently the recovery of investment expenditure was weak. The unemployment rate fell only to percent and that for only month. The average unemployment rate from January to May ( when the peak of the recovery was reached ) was percent Yet Federal policy was restrictive and wholly inappropriate to a period of insufficient demand. The full-employment surplus was allowed to rise drastically from a $ * billion level in to more than $ billion in The expenditure line was held firmly while the only tax-rate changes made were increases in social insurance and excise tax rates. The turnaround from actual deficit to actual surplus was even more striking Between the third quarter of and the first quarter of there was a swing of nearly $ billion ( annual rate ) from a $ billion deficit to an $ billion surplus. At a time when private investment demand was depressed by excess capacity this fiscal restraint was clearly inconsistent with continued expansion. If it had not been for a slow rise throughout the period in the share of disposable income consumed it is doubtful that this shortest of all recent recoveries would have lasted even as long as it did The restrictive fiscal policy of was accompanied early in the expansion by a shift toward monetary restraint that became progressively more severe and by late resulted in the tightest monetary and credit conditions of the postwar period. Treasury bill yields rose by * /2 percentage points from mid-1958 to the end of Long-term Government bond yields increased by a full percentage point during the same period The sector most adversely affected by this monetary tightness was housing Private housing starts which had risen strongly during the period of monetary ease immediately following the recession fell by one-fourth from the beginning of to the middle of This reduced the demand for building materials and through its effect on incomes earned in the construction industry the demand for consumer goods. The combination of fiscal and monetary tightness contributed to a halt in the expansion of business investment expenditures and led to a downturn after only months of expansion FISCAL POLICY IN THE PRESENT EXPANSION When the new Administration came to office in early the recession was near its trough. The unemployment rate was close to percent and the rate of capacity utilization in manufacturing had fallen to percent. The economic task of first priority was to end the unnecessary waste of resources The fiscal program adopted by Congress and the Administration lowered the $ billion full employment surplus of to $ billion by This reduction was accomplished through both tax reductions and expenditure increases The expenditure increases of the period undertaken to bolster our defense and space programs and to provide for unmet civilian needs were highly stimulating to the economy. Total Federal expenditures increased by $ billion ( annual rate ) between the first quarter of and the first quarter of making a major contribution to the percent rise in GNP during the first recovery year. Increases in Federal expenditures continued beyond the initial recovery year. From the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of Federal purchases of goods and services in current prices increased by $ ll } /2 billion at annual rates or percent Total Federal expenditures which include transfer payments subsidies interest and grants-in-aid as well as purchases of goods and services increased by $ * /2 billion or percent over the same period Two tax reduction measures the new depreciation guidelines announced by the Treasury in July and the investment tax credit enacted by the Congress in the Revenue Act of were adopted to stimulate lagging private investment. Their details are discussed in Appendix A of the January Report of the Council of Economic Advisers. Their net effect was to raise the annual cash flow to corporations by $ billion in and to increase the after-tax rate of return on new investment projects. These measures contributed to the rapid rise in plant and equipment outlays that occurred after the first quarter of Since there are substantial lags in the investment decision-making and spending process their full effects have not yet been realized In early the Administration proposed a program of tax reduction and revision designed to move the country toward full employment. Failure to enact this key part of the fiscal program by mid-1963 led to a rise in the full-employment surplus when a reduction was needed. By the fourth quarter of with output still about $ billion short of potential and an unemployment rate of percent the full-employment surplus was $ billion and the actual budget deficit on a national income and product basis fell close to zero. However early enactment of the tax bill and enactment of the President 's budget for fiscal will bring a sharp and needed reduction in the full-employment surplus. The tax and expenditure program will give a bigger fiscal stimulus in calendar than in any of the past years and will provide a strong fresh impetus to the expansion MONETARY POLICY IN THE PRESENT EXPANSION The fiscal policy of the years was complemented by a monetary policy designed to encourage an expanding economy while also defending the balance of payments. Actions were taken to raise short-term interest rates and to maintain them at levels that would reduce outflows of funds to money markets abroad. Within the limits established by this policy the Federal Reserve provided money and bank credit to support the expansion and generally avoided placing upward pressure on long-term rates In attempting to pursue both its domestic and its balance-of-payments objectives the Federal Reserve used its policy instruments flexibly. In February it began to supply a portion of new bank reserves through the purchase of longer-term securities. Meanwhile the Treasury concentrated its new offerings of securities largely in short maturities to exert upward pressure on short-term interest rates. In the autumn of the Federal Reserve reduced reserve requirements on time and savings deposits thereby releasing reserves for seasonal growth in money and credit without purchasing short-term securities in the open market A particularly important factor that exerted upward pressure on shortterm rates but held long-term rates down was the two-step change in Regulation Q in January and July which permitted banks to pay higher interest rates on time and savings deposits. These steps accelerated the flow of savings into commercial banks which in turn invested heavily in mortgages and State and local securities thereby putting downward pressure on mortgage and other long-term yields. At the same time commercial banks began to issue negotiable time certificates of deposit in substantial quantities which in effect added to the supply of short-term securities and helped to push up short-term interest rates In July the Federal Reserve increased the discount rate from to 31/2 percent largely to reinforce efforts to raise short-term interest rates for balance-of-payments reasons Analysis of the results of Federal Reserve actions on the growth of deposits and bank credit is especially difficult for this expansion period because of the changes in Regulation Q. The recorded growth in money supply at an average rate of percent a year during the expansion understates the degree to which monetary policy provided a stimulus to the economy since many business firms and individuals were induced to shift idle balances from demand to time deposits in order to take advantage of the higher interest rates On the other hand the increase in time deposits at an average rate of percent a year exaggerates the expansionary stimulus from monetary policy. The interest-rate increases on commercial bank time deposits raised their attractiveness relative to direct holdings of securities or deposits at other financial intermediaries. Thus while bank credit expansion was particularly rapid part of it reflected lending that otherwise would have occurred through nonbank financial institutions or directly through the securities markets THE CURRENT SITUATION AND OUTLOOK T H E ECONOMY IN The economic expansion in substantially outdistanced most expectations and even exceeded the forecast by the Council of Economic Advisers in its January Report which was one of the more optimistic of the period. That forecast projected a range from $ billion to $ billion. Preliminary estimates indicate an actual figure of $ billion Much of the strength in centered in residential construction and automobile buying. If the strength of those expenditures represented an unsustainable buildup of stocks or an excessive resort to credit it would amount to borrowing from the future. If however it reflected long-term forces it would be cause of optimism RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION Among the major demand components the most surprising performer in was housing. Many observers expected that private nonfarm residential construction expenditures would no more than hold their level. Instead because of the boom in construction of multifamily units such expenditures increased by $ l } /2 billion for the year as a whole and the fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter advance was even larger The increase in housing activity is attributable partly to the success of monetary policy and Federal housing credit policies in maintaining an adequate supply of mortgage funds at favorable interest rates. Mortgage yields continued to decline during the first half of and then levelled off. The average term to maturity of conventional mortgages extended on new home purchases increased from years in December to years in October and the average ratio of loan to value on such mortgages increased from percent to percent over the same period. Terms on FHA mortgages were also liberalized Liberalization of mortgage credit makes more potential home buyers eligible to enter the market. But it also reduces the equity protection of those homeowners who borrow up to the limit increasing their vulnerability to personal misfortune or general economic reversals. It is difficult to evaluate recent developments because of the lack of consensus on criteria of soundness in mortgages and because the safety of the credit structure depends basically on the general health of the economy. During the past year the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has issued or proposed a series of regulations that will help preserve sound credit practices of savings and loan associations the major source of home mortgage credit The future of residential building depends heavily on the sustainability of construction of multifamily units. Multifamily housing starts have risen to percent of total starts in compared to an average of percent during the 's. Rental vacancy rates have been rising in the last year and in some metropolitan areas are quite high. But in the aggregate they are still below the levels that prevailed in at the beginning of the current housing boom. While an attitude of caution and concern about rental housing in is certainly justified there are several favorable factors in the outlook. Part of the great expansion of multifamily housing in the past few years has come in response to demographic changes. The increased relative importance of households at the two extreme ends of the adult age spectrum has raised the demand for apartment units. This demand has not yet been fully met in many communities and builders of multifamily units can look forward to its acceleration in or years as the early postwar babies enter the housing market. Moreover there continue to be unmet needs for housing among lower-income and minority groups. The proposed tax cut will provide some support to multifamily construction by increasing the number of those able to afford better rental apartments However given the large volume of multifamily construction already in the pipeline there is little probability of a further sizable expansion in Housing demand could decline in the coming year if the availability and terms of mortgage credit are not maintained in the face of rising business demands for credit AUTOMOBILES While the share of their incomes that consumers devoted to auto purchases during was not far above the average for the past years ( as Table shows ) the stock of automobiles in use has nonetheless grown considerably both in quantity and in quality. In a static economy this would suggest a sizable decline in purchases in the following year. However two considerations are reassuring First the economy will not be static in The rate of cna,n5c of aftertax income next year will be extraordinarily large both because of the cut in taxes and because of a substantial increase in before-tax incomes. Moreover the number of licensed drivers should continue to grow by at least 2J/2 million a year Second the buildup of car stocks during offers significant contrasts with that in which was the one clear case of substantial borrowing of demand from the future. Both real disposable income and the number of licensed drivers are about percent greater now than they were in while the number of domestic and imported cars sold in was not appreciably greater than in the earlier year. Moreover a rising scrappage rate restrained the growth of the stock of cars. Hence relative to population and income the increase in automobile ownership in was not nearly so great as it was in TABLE Share of disposable personal income used for consumer durable expenditures [ Percent ] Consumer durable expenditures as percent of disposable personal income Year Constant prices l Current prices Total Automobiles and parts Other Total Automobiles and parts Other t average-- I960 _ _ * Based on data in prices Preliminary estimates by Council of Economic Advisers Source : Department of Commerce ( except as noted ) The strength of consumer durables sales in and especially in was stimulated by ready availability of credit. Maximum credit terms on new automobiles were not generally liberalized but more automobile buyers took advantage of these maximum terms. The ratio of outstanding instalment credit to disposable income ( at an annual rate ) which was percent at the end of increased to percent by the end of The proportion of disposable personal income committed to monthly payments has continued its upward drift and now approaches percent Rut there is no reason to think that this ratio is unsustainable. It has risen recently partly because the proportion of spending units using consumer credit has been rising. According to the Survey Research Center 's Survey of Consumer Finances this percentage rose from in to in early As the general level of per capita income rises more households become good credit risks. A rise in the ratio of aggregate consumer debt to income is far more sustainable when it comes from wider-spread use of debt than when it reflects only heavier indebtedness on the part of existing credit users The crucial factor in determining whether indebtedness imposes an excessive burden is the rate of expansion of disposable income. The rise in disposable income from the proposed tax cut will reduce appreciably the ratio of beginning-of-year debt to income. If a decline in consumer incomes were in the offing in the current level of consumer indebtedness might be a cause for concern. It poses no serious threat when income is expected to grow rapidly THE OUTLOOK FOR GNP IN The demands for automobiles and housing should continue at high levels in but they can not be expected to provide fresh impetus to expansion Nor is a substantial independent thrust likely to come from business investment or government purchases. Thus a favorable outlook for is heavily dependent upon the passage and timing of the proposed tax reductions The process by which tax reduction will stimulate consumption and investment demand is outlined in Appendix A of this Report. If the tax cuts were not forthcoming business and consumers not only would have to do without their direct effect but would have to adjust to sharp disappointment. With the tax cuts and taking into account the projected budget expenditures the economy will receive a powerful stimulus. Indeed it will be operating with little if any full-employment surplus for the first time since the Korean conflict. The elimination of the estimated $ billion full-employment surplus of calendar will mark an unprecedented use of fiscal policy for the maintenance and acceleration of expansion. It must be recognized that while the expansive effects of the projected tax cuts will be very sizable the month-to-month timing of their impacts upon expenditures is not precisely predictable. For this reason it is especially appropriate this year to attach a range of plus or minus $ billion to the forecast of the GNP for Administration forecasts are always in some degree projections because they rest on assumptions about the enactment of the President 's program The dependence of this year 's forecast on assumptions made about the nature and timing of the tax cuts is particularly heavy. The date of enactment and the initial withholding rate applied to wages and salaries are both critical The assumptions underlying the present projection are First that reduction of tax liabilities as recommended in the President 's Budget Message will be enacted by February ; Second that the withholding rate will be reduced from percent to percent by this legislation to take effect as soon as possible thereafter Under these assumptions it is estimated that GNP for calendar will fall within a $ billion range centering on $ billion. If events depart from the above assumptions prospects for the year will be significantly altered. For example if passage of the tax bill were delayed by month the projected GNP range would center on $ billion Prospects for the major components of demand appear to be the following : Government expenditures. State and local purchases of goods and services are expected to rise by at least $ billion the trend rate for the last few years. Although the President 's Budget will call for a decline in Adminis- trative Budget expenditures from fiscal to fiscal Federal purchases of goods and services are projected to increase by $ 2j/2 billion from calendar to calendar This will be a smaller increase than those of the past few years Residential construction. Outlays for residential construction are not likely to rise from their level at the end of but a small year-to-year increase seems probable Business fixed investment. The basic determinants of expenditures on fixed investment both real and financial are favorable to further expansion. According to the business plant and equipment survey made by the Department of Commerce and the Securities and Exchange Commission the annual rate of such expenditures ( which account for over threefourths of business fixed investment ) will be about $ billion higher in the first half of than in the latter half of The demand and profit stimulus provided by the tax cut should be sufficient to accelerate the rate of increase in the second half of giving a somewhat higher year-toyear increase than in Inventory investment. With inventory-sales ratios quite favorable inventory investment should respond fairly promptly to a step-up in the rate of increase in final demand and proceed at a rate well above the level particularly toward the end of the year Consumption. Under the stimulus of a cut of nearly $ billion in personal tax collections consumption expenditures will be a substantial force in economic expansion in providing more than two-thirds of the total demand increase. Substantial year-to-year gains should be realized in all major expenditure categpries. While the dollar volume of automobile outlays should rise with a tax cut their share of disposable personal income may fall slightly. A rise in the income share spent on other durables is quite probable In summary the outlook this year calls for a significant acceleration in the growth of output. At the midpoint of the forecast range current-dollar GNP for is estimated to increase 6/ percent above the level of and the real GNP about percent. Because last year 's gains in the labor force and productivity somewhat exceeded past trends the growth of percent in real output was not sufficient to reduce the unemployment rate. It seems likely that potential will continue in the year ahead to grow slightly faster than its 3J4 percent average annual rate since Nevertheless the more rapid expansion of production in should lower the unemployment rate. By the end of the year it is expected to fall to approximately percent. Thus the year promises progress in reducing unemployment but attainment of the interim goal of percent lies beyond BEYOND Demand will continue to benefit in the years ahead from the powerful stimulus of the current tax-reduction program. Prospects for are enormously improved by the impending tax legislation but even so the full effect will not be felt this year. It will take some time for consumer outlays to adjust fully to the rise in household incomes ; somewhat longer delays are likely in the response of capital expenditures. As these adjust to higher operating rates and higher after-tax profits the underlying strength of business demand for new capital should become evident for the first time in nearly a decade Private demand will get support from fiscal policy throughout the fiscal year. On January a second instalment of tax reduction will take effect. As a result the gradual leveling off of Federal outlays desired for and permitted by increasing efficiency in the government can be consistent with a continued movement toward full employment A return to full employment will yield many benefits as succeeding chapters make clear. It will reinforce programs to aid the disadvantaged and to promote smooth adjustment to technological change. It will increase the mobility of labor and capital. It will improve our productivity performance so important to the international competitiveness of our products. Once demand matches our productive potential efforts to accelerate the growth of potential will become more effective and merit a higher priority. In combination full employment and accelerated growth can produce a sharp improvement in U.S. economic performance for the rest of the 's On November the United States joined with the other member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in setting as a target the attainment of a percent ( percent a year ) increase in their combined real gross national products during the decade from to The average year-to-year rate of increase of this Nation 's GNP in the first years of the decade percent did not match the target rate for the OEGD countries as a whole. For the United States to raise its output by one-half during the decade it will need to grow at an average annual rate of percent in the next years That rate is within our grasp Any lessening in international tensions that permits significant arms reductions consistent with national security will increase our ability to raise our rate of economic growth. Resources no longer used in arms production can be used to upgrade the skills and equipment of the labor force as well as to raise the levels of private and public consumption. An economic policy ensuring that these resources are used for such purposes rather than left idle can raise the growth rate of potential output If we are to achieve the full benefits of our rising productive potential and to avoid excessive unemployment aggregate demand will have to con- tinue to expand more rapidly than it has in the past. With the major relaxation in fiscal restraint in we will get a new and more accurate assessment of the strength of private demand as we move toward full employment. This information will help to guide the monetary and budgetary programs for the years ahead. But the principles to guide policy are clear They were stated in the Employment Act ; they have been dramatized by the experience of recent years. If this Nation is to achieve and maintain " maximum employment production and purchasing power. " it will be the continuing task of fiscal and monetary policy to support a strong sustainable pace in the expansion of aggregate demand Chapter The Problem of Poverty in America I N HIS MESSAGE on the State of the Union President Johnson declared all-out war on poverty in America. This chapter is designed to provide some understanding of the enemy and to outline the main features of a strategy of attack ELIMINATING POVERTY A NATIONAL GOAL There will always be some Americans who are better off than others. But it need not follow that " the poor are always with us. " In the United States today we can see on the horizon a society of abundance free of much of the misery and degradation that have been the age-old fate of man. Steadily rising productivity together with an improving network of private and social insurance and assistance has been eroding mass poverty in America But the process is far too slow. It is high time to redouble and to concentrate our efforts to eliminate poverty Poverty is costly not only to the poor but to the whole society. Its ugly by-products include ignorance disease delinquency crime irresponsibility immorality indifference. None of these social evils and hazards will of course wholly disappear with the elimination of poverty. But their severity will be markedly reduced. Poverty is no purely private or local concern It is a social and national problem But the overriding objective is to improve the quality of life of individual human beings. For poverty deprives the individual not only of material comforts but of human dignity and fulfillment. Poverty is rarely a builder of character The poor inhabit a world scarcely recognizable and rarely recognized by the majority of their fellow Americans. It is a world apart whose inhabitants are isolated from the mainstream of American life and alienated from its values. It is a world where Americans are literally concerned with day-to-day survival a roof over their heads where the next meal is coming from. It is a world where a minor illness is a major tragedy where pride and privacy must be sacrificed to get help where honesty can become a luxury and ambition a myth. Worst of all the poverty of the fathers is visited upon the children Equality of opportunity is the American dream and universal education our noblest pledge to realize it. But for the children of the poor education is a handicap race ; many are too ill prepared and ill motivated at home to learn at school. And many communities lengthen the handicap by providing the worst schooling for those who need the best Although poverty remains a bitter reality for too many Americans its incidence has been steadily shrinking. The fruits of general economic growth have been widely shared ; individuals and families have responded to incentives and opportunities for improvement ; government and private programs have raised the educational attainments housing standards health and productivity of the population ; private and social insurance has increasingly protected families against loss of earnings due to death disability illness old age and unemployment. Future headway against poverty will likewise require attacks on many fronts : the active promotion of a full-employment rapid-growth economy ; a continuing assault on discrimination ; and a wide range of other measures to strike at specific roots of low income. As in the past progress will require the combined efforts of all levels of government and of private individuals and groups All Americans will benefit from this progress. Our Nation 's most precious resource is its people. We pay twice for poverty : once in the production lost in wasted human potential again in the resources diverted to coping with poverty 's social by-products. Humanity compels our action but it is sound economics as well This chapter considers first the changing numbers and composition of America 's poor. Second it presents a brief report on the factors that contribute to the continuation of poverty amidst plenty. Although the analysis is statistical the major concern is with the human problems that the numbers reflect. The concluding part concerns strategy against poverty in the 's and beyond. Supplementary tables at the end of the chapter provide further data on the dimensions of poverty in America The sections below will chart the topography of poverty. A few significant features of this bleak landscape deserve emphasis in advance Poverty occurs in many places and is endured by people in many situations ; but its occurrence is nonetheless highly concentrated among those with certain characteristics. The scars of discrimination lack of education and broken families show up clearly from almost any viewpoint. Here are some landmarks : One-fifth of our families and nearly one-fifth of our total population are poor Of the poor percent are nonwhite ; and nearly one-half of all nonwhites live in poverty The heads of over percent of all poor families have only grade school educations Even for those denied opportunity by discrimination education significantly raises the chance to escape from poverty. Of all non- white families headed by a person with years or less of schooling percent are poor. This percentage falls to for high school graduates and to percent for those with some college education But education does not remove the effects of discrimination : when nonwhites are compared with whites at the same level of education the nonwhites are poor about twice as often One-third of all poor families are headed by a person over and almost one-half of families headed by such a person are poor Of the poor percent live in cities percent on farms percent as rural nonfarm residents Over percent of all farm families are poor. More than percent of nonwhite farmers live in poverty Less than half of the poor are in the South ; yet a southerner 's chance of being poor is roughly twice that of a person living in the rest of the country One-quarter of poor families are headed by a woman ; but nearly one-half of all families headed by a woman are poor When a family and its head have several characteristics frequently associated with poverty the chances of being poor are particularly high : a family headed by a young woman who is nonwhite and has less than an eighth grade education is poor in out of cases Even if she is white the chances are out of that she and her children will be poor THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF POVERTY Measurement of poverty is not simple either conceptually or in practice By the poor we mean those who are not now maintaining a decent standard of living those whose basic needs exceed their means to satisfy them. A family 's needs depend on many factors including the size of the family the ages of its members the condition of their health and their place of residence. The ability to fulfill these needs depends on current income from whatever source past savings ownership of a home or other assets and ability to borrow NEEDS AND RESOURCES There is no precise way to measure the number of families who do not have the resources to provide minimum satisfaction of their own particular needs. Since needs differ from family to family an attempt to quantify the problem must begin with some concept of average need for an average or representative family. Even for such a family society does not have a clear and unvarying concept of an acceptable minimum. By the standards of contemporary American society most of the population of the world is poor ; and most Americans were poor a century ago. But for our society today a consensus on an approximate standard can be found. One such standard is suggested by a recent study described in a publication of the Social Security Administration which defines a " low-cost " budget for a nonfarm family of four and finds its cost in to have been $ The cost of what the study defined as an " economy-plan " budget was $ Other studies have used different market baskets many of them costing more. On balance they provide support for using as a boundary a family whose annual money income from all sources was $ ( before taxes and expressed in prices ) This is a weekly income of less than $ These budgets contemplate expenditures of one-third of the total on food i.e. for a $ annual budget for a 4-person family about $ per person per week. Of the remaining $ a conservative estimate for housing ( rent or mortgage payments utilities and heat ) would be another $ This would leave only $ less than $ a week for clothing transportation school supplies and books home furnishings and supplies medical care personal care recreation insurance and everything else Obviously it does not exaggerate the problem of poverty to regard $ as the boundary A family 's ability to meet its needs depends not only on its money income but also on its income in kind its savings its property and its ability to borrow. But the detailed data ( of the Bureau of the Census ) available for pinpointing the origins of current poverty in the United States refer to money income. Refined analysis would vary the income cut-off by family size age location and other indicators of needs and costs. This has not been possible. However a variable income cut-off was used in the sample study of poverty ; n conducted at the University of Michigan Survey Research Center. This study also estimates the over-all incidence of poverty at percent ; and its findings concerning the sources of poverty correspond closely with the results based on an analysis of Census data A case could be made of course for setting the over-all income limit either higher or lower than $ thereby changing the statistical measure of the size of the problem. But the analysis of the sources of poverty and of the programs needed to cope with it would remain substantially unchanged No measure of poverty as simple as the one used here would be suitable for determining eligibility for particular benefits or participation in particular programs. Nevertheless it provides a valid benchmark for assessing the dimensions of the task of eliminating poverty setting the broad goals of policy and measuring our past and future progress toward their achievement If it were possible to obtain estimates of total incomes including nonmoney elements for various types of families those data would be preferable for the analysis which follows. The Department of Commerce does estimate total nonmoney incomes in the entire economy in such forms as the rental value of owner-occupied dwellings and food raised and consumed on farms and allocates them to families with incomes of different size Because of statistical difficulties these allocations are necessarily somewhat arbitrary and are particularly subject to error for the lower income groups No attempt is made to allocate them by other characteristics that are meaningful for an analysis of poverty. Of course the total of money plus nonmoney income that would correspond to the limit used here would be somewhat higher than $ THE CHANGING EXTENT OF POVERTY There were million families in the United States in Fully million or one-fifth of these families comprising more than million persons had total money incomes below $ Over million of these family members were children one-sixth of our youth. More than million families are now raising or more children on such an income. Moreover million families containing more than million persons had total incomes below $ More than a million children were being raised in very large families ( or more children ) with incomes of less than $ Serious poverty also exists among persons living alone or living in nonfamily units such as boarding houses. In percent of such " unrelated individuals " million persons had incomes below $ and percent or more than million persons had incomes below $ ( Supplementary Table ) Thus by the measures used here to million Americans were living at or below the boundaries of poverty in nearly one-fifth of our Nation The substantial progress made since World War II in eliminating poverty is shown in Chart and Table In the decade when incomes TABLE Money income of families and Median money income of all families ( prices ) Percent of families with money income Index = Less than Less than $ ( $ ( prices ) prices ) Year Dollars I960 _ _ Sources : Department of Commerce and Council of Economic Advisers were growing relatively rapidly and unemployment was generally low the number of poor families ( with incomes below $ in terms of prices ) declined from million to million or from percent to http : //fraser.stlouisfed.org/ O-64-5 Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis percent of all families. But in the period from through when total growth was slower and unemployment substantially higher the number of families living in poverty fell less rapidly to million or percent of all families The progress made since World War I I has not involved any major change in the distribution of incomes. The one-fifth of families with the highest incomes received an estimated percent of total income in and percent in The one-fifth of families with the lowest incomes received percent of the total in and percent in Even if poverty should hereafter decline at the relatively more rapid rate of the period there would still be percent of the Nation 's families in poverty in And if the decline in poverty proceeded at the slower rate achieved from on percent of our families would still have incomes under $ in We can not leave the further wearing away of poverty solely to the general progress of the economy.

Are the poor concentrated in any single geographical area ? Are they confined to a few easily identifiable groups in society ? Conclusions drawn from personal observation are likely to be misleading. Some believe that most of the poor are found in the slums of the central city while TABLE Selected characteristics of all families and of poor families Number of families ( millions ) Percent of total Selected characteristic All families Poor families All families Poor families Age of head : years years.55-64 years years and over.

Data relate to families and exclude unrelated individuals Poor families are defined as all families with total money income of less than $ Sources : Department of Commerce and Council of Economic Advisers others believe that they are concentrated in areas of rural blight. Some have been impressed by poverty among the elderly while others are convinced that it is primarily a problem of minority racial and ethnic groups But objective evidence indicates that poverty is pervasive. To be sure the inadequately educated the aged and the nonwhite make up substantial portions of the poor population. But as Table shows the poor are found among all major groups in the population and in all parts of the country Further data on the composition of the poor population are found in Supplementary Tables and Using the income measure of poverty described above we find that percent of poor families are white. Although one-third of the poor families are headed by a person years old and over two-fifths are headed by persons in the to year range. Although it is true that a great deal of poverty is associated with lack of education almost million poor families ( percent ) are headed by a person with at least some education beyond grade school. The data show that less than half the poor live in the South And the urban poor are somewhat more numerous than the rural poor In Chart the poor and the non-poor are compared in terms of these and other characteristics Yet there are substantial concentrations of poverty among certain groups For example families headed by persons years of age and older represent percent of poor families. Moreover they appear among the poor 5/2 times as frequently as they appear among all families. The last columns of Table show additional major categories of families that appear more than twice as often among the poor as among the total population : nonwhite families families'headed by women families headed by individuals not in the civilian labor force families with no wage earners and rural farm families. Of course some of these groups overlap considerably ; but the data help to identify prospective targets for an antipoverty attack. The next section pinpoints these targets further THE ROOTS OF POVERTY Poverty is the inability to satisfy minimum needs. The poor are those whose resources their income from all sources together with their asset holdings are inadequate. This section considers why those in poverty lack the earned income property income and savings and transfer payments to meet their minimum needs EARNED INCOME Why do some families have low earned incomes ? Some are unemployed or partially unemployed. High over-all employment is a remedy of first importance. It would provide earned income for those unemployed who are able to accept jobs and greater earnings for many presently working part-time. Yet it is clear that this is only a partial answer. Even for those able and willing to work earnings are all too frequently inadequate and a Chart Characteristics of Poor Families COMPARED WITH ALL FAMILIES PERCENT OR FAMILIES l / I CHARACTERISTICS OF FAMILY HEAD : A L L FAMILIES YEARS OF AGE AND OVER POOR FAMILIES / EDUCATION OF YEARS OR LESS FEMALE FAMILY CHARACTERISTICS : NONWHITE NO EARNERS FOUR OR MORE CHILDREN RURAL FARM / URBAN BASED ON DATA ( EXCEPT AS NOTED ) F A M I L I E S WITH INCOME OF $ OR LESS Xl BASED ON DATA SOURCE : DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE large number of the poor are unable to work.

An incidence for a particular group higher than percent or higher than the rates for other similar groups suggests that some characteristics of that group are causally related to poverty. The basic cause may not be the particular characteristic used to classify the group. But an examination of groups with high incidence should throw light on the roots of poverty. Incidence of poverty in and is shown for several major types of families in Chart Table shows that the incidence of poverty is percent for families with no earners. From other data it appears that the incidence rate is percent for families headed by persons who work part-time.

Other reasons include discrimination low bargaining power exclusion from minimum wage coverage or lack of mobility resulting from inadequate knowledge of other opportunities or unwillingness or inability to move away from familiar surroundings The importance of education as a factor in poverty is suggested by the fact that families headed by persons with no more than years of education have an incidence rate of percent ( Table ) Nonwhite and rural families show an even higher incidence of poverty ( Table and Supplementary Table ) The heads of these families are typically less well educated than average. For example nonwhite family heads have completed a median of TABLE Incidence of poverty by education color and residence Selected characteristic Incidence of poverty ( percent ) All families Education of head : ye years or less.. years years More than years.

Poverty is denned to include all families with total money income of less than $ ; these are also referred to as poor families. The incidence of poverty is measured by the percent that poor families with a given characteristic are of all families having the same characteristic Sources : Department of Commerce and Council of Economic Advisers years of school compared to for whites. In the median education of all males over with incomes below $ and living on a farm was slightly above years in school ; those with incomes above $ had completed over years in school Supplementary Table presents additional detail from the census on the incidence of poverty among families classified by educational attainment color age and family type. The severely handicapping influence of lack of education is clear. The incidence of poverty drops as educational attainments rise for nonwhite as well as white families at all ages. The high frequency of poverty for nonwhites is not however fully explained by their educational deficit. As Supplementary Table shows the incidence of poverty among nonwhites is almost invariably higher than among whites regardless of age family type or level of educational attainment. Supplementary Table shows that nonwhites earn less than whites with the same education even when they practice the same occupation Some families are forced into poverty by society 's own standards. Their potential earners otherwise able to hold a job can not free themselves from the family responsibilities which they must fulfill. Such is the case for example with families headed by women with small children Customary or mandatory retirement at a specified age also limits earnings by some healthy able-bodied persons. However retirement is often associated with deteriorating health and poverty among the aged is greatest at ages over or and for aged widows persons for whom employment is not a realistic alternative PROPERTY INCOME AND USE OF SAVINGS Some families with inadequate current earnings from work can avoid poverty thanks to past savings which provide an income and if necessary can be used to support consumption. Savings are particularly important for the elderly. More than half of those over have money incomes above $ and many also own homes. Others although their money incomes are below $ have adequate savings that can be drawn upon to support a decent standard of consumption But most families with low earnings are not so fortunate. If avoiding poverty required an income supplement of $ a year for a retired man and his wife they would need a capital sum at age of about $ to provide such an annuity. Few families have that sum. The median net worth for all spending units ( roughly equivalent to the total of families and unrelated individuals ) was only $ in For all spending units whose head was years or more the median net worth was $ Meeting contingencies caused by illnesses is often a crucial problem for older people. About half of the aged and about three-fourths of the aged poor have no hospital insurance although their medical care costs are 2J4 times as high as those of younger persons. Their resources are typically inadequate to cover the costs of a serious illness The median net worth of the fifth of all spending units having the lowest incomes was only $ Much of what property they have is in the form of dwellings. ( About percent of all poor families have some equity in a house. ) Although this means that their housing costs are reduced property in this form does not provide money income that can be used for other current expenses Most families including the aged whose incomes are low in any one year lack significant savings or property because their incomes have always been at poverty levels. This is clear in the results of the Michigan study already cited. Among the reporting families classified in that study as poor in percent had never earned disposable income as high as $ and nearly percent had never reached $ The comparable figures for all families were percent and percent respectively. Among the aged poor reporting percent had never reached $ and fully onehalf had never earned $ While nearly percent of all families have enjoyed peak incomes above $ among all poor families only percent had ever reached that level ; and a mere percent of the aged poor had ever exceeded $ The persistence of poverty is reflected in the large number who have been unable to accumulate savings. The Survey Research Center study found that more than one-half of the aged poor in had less than $ in liquid savings ( bank deposits and readily marketable securities ) and they had not had savings above that figure during the previous years. Less than one-fifth of all poor families reported accumulated savings in excess of $ The mean amount of savings used by poor families in was $ ; and only percent of the poor drew on savings at all It is clear that for most families property income and savings do not provide a buffer against poverty. Some data on liquid savings are contained in Supplementary Table TRANSFER PAYMENTS AND PRIVATE PENSIONS Poverty would be more prevalent and more serious if many families and individuals did not receive transfer payments. In these payments ( those which are not received in exchange for current services ) constituted only percent of total family income but they comprised percent of the total income of low-income spending units. At the same time however only about half of the present poor receive any transfer payments at all And of course many persons who receive transfers through social insurance programs are not poor often as a result of these benefits Transfer programs may be either public or private in nature and may or may not have involved past contributions by the recipient. Public transfer programs include social insurance such as Unemployment Compensation Workmen 's Compensation and Old-Age Survivors ' and Disability Insurance ( OASDI ) ; veterans ' benefits ; and public assistance programs such as Old Age Assistance ( OAA ) and Aid to Families with Dependent Children ( AFDC ) Private transfer programs include organized systems such as private pension plans and supplementary unemployment benefits organized private charities and private transfers within and among families It is important to distinguish between insurance-type programs and assistance programs whether public or private. Assistance programs are ordinarily aimed specifically at the poor or the handicapped. Eligibility for their benefits may or may not be based upon current income ; but neither eligibility nor the size of benefits typically bears any direct relationship to past income. Eligibility for insurance-type programs on the other hand is based on past employment and benefits on past earnings The Federal-State unemployment insurance system covers only about percent of all paid employment and is intended to protect workers with a regular attachment to the labor force against temporary loss of income Benefits of course are related to previous earnings While the largest transfer-payment program OASDI now covers approximately percent of all paid employment there are still several million aged persons who retired or whose husbands retired or died before acquiring coverage. Benefits are related to previous earnings and the average benefit for a retired worker under this program at the end of was only $ a month or $ a year. The average benefit for a retired worker and his wife if she is eligible for a wife 's benefit is $ a year Public insurance-type transfer programs have made notable contributions to sustaining the incomes of those whose past earnings have been adequate and to avoiding their slipping into poverty as their earnings are interrupted or terminated. These programs are of least help to those whose earnings have never been adequate Public assistance programs are also an important support to low-income and handicapped persons. Money payments under OAA average about $ a month for the country as a whole with State averages ranging from $ to about $ a month. In the AFDG program the national average payment per family ( typically of persons ) is about $ a month including services rendered directly. State averages range from $ a month to about $ a month Private transfers within and between families are included in the total money income figures used in this chapter only to the extent that they are regular in nature e.g. alimony or family support payments and are excluded when they take the form of casual or irregular gifts or bequests While data are lacking on the value of such gifts they are clearly not a major source of income for the poor Private pensions providing an annuity are additional resources for some persons and families. In the beneficiaries of such plans numbered about million ( as against about million receiving OASDI benefits ) and total benefits paid were about $ billion. While the combination of OASDI and private pensions serves to protect some from poverty most persons receiving OASDI receive no private pension supplement. In any case benefits under private pension plans range widely and since they are typically related to the individual 's previous earnings they are low when earnings have been low Thus although many families do indeed receive supplements to earnings in the form of pensions social insurance benefits and incomes from past saving those families with a history of low earnings are also likely to have little of such supplementary income. And since most poor families have small amounts of property they can not long meet even minimum needs by depleting their assets THE VICIOUS CIRCLE Poverty breeds poverty. A poor individual or family has a high probability of staying poor. Low incomes carry with them high risks of illness ; limitations on mobility ; limited access to education information and train- ing. Poor parents can not give their children the opportunities for better health and education needed to improve their lot. Lack of motivation hope and incentive is a more subtle but no less powerful barrier than lack of financial means. Thus the cruel legacy of poverty is passed from parents to children Escape from poverty is not easy for American children raised in families accustomed to living on relief. A recent sample study of AFDG recipients found that more than percent of the parents were themselves raised in homes where public assistance had been received. It is difficult for children to find and follow avenues leading out of poverty in environments where education is deprecated and hope is smothered. This is particularly true when discrimination appears as an insurmountable barrier. Education may be seen as a waste of time if even the well-trained are forced to accept menial labor because of their color or nationality The Michigan study shows how inadequate education is perpetuated from generation to generation. Of the families identified as poor in that study percent were headed by a person who had had less than an eighth grade education. Of these in turn percent had fathers who had also gone no further than eighth grade in school. Among the children of these poor families who had finished school percent had not gone beyond the eighth grade ; this figure compares with percent for all families. Fewer than in children of poor families had graduated from high school compared to almost out of for all families Of million high school seniors in October covered by a Census study percent did not graduate in Of these drop-outs percent had IQ 's above and percent were above Most of them had the intellectual capabilities necessary to graduate. The drop-out rate for nonwhite male students and likewise for children from households with a nonworking head was twice the over-all rate. And it was twice as high for children of families with incomes below $ as for children of families with incomes above $ Moreover many of the children of the poor had dropped out before reaching the senior year A study of drop-outs in New Haven Connecticut showed that percent of children from lower-class neighborhoods do not complete high school The comparable figure for better neighborhoods was percent Other studies indicate that unemployment rates are almost twice as high for drop-outs as for high school graduates aged Moreover average incomes of male high school graduates are percent higher than those of high school drop-outs and nearly percent higher than those of men who completed less than years of schooling There is a well-established association between school status and juvenile delinquency. For example in the New Haven study cited above percent of the drop-outs but only percent of the high school graduates had one or more arrests or referrals to juvenile court Low-income families lose more time from work school and other activities than their more fortunate fellow citizens. Persons in families with incomes under $ lost an average of days of work in the year compared to for all employed persons. They were restricted in activity for an average of days ( compared to for the whole population ) and badly disabled for days ( compared to for the whole population ) TABLE Number of families and incidence of poverty by selected family characteristics and Incidence of poverty ( percent ) Number of families Selected characteristic Percentage change to number of poor families to Percentage Millions All families Earners in family : None One Two Three or more. _ Q O Labor force status of head : * Not in civilian labor force Unemployed Employed Age of head : years years years _ _ years and over Color of family : White Nonwhite Children under years of age in family : None One Two _ Three or more Regional location of family : ' Northeast North Central South West Sex of head : Male Female Residence of family : Farm * Nonfann _ __ The incidence of poverty is measured by the percent that poor families with a given characteristic are of all families having the same characteristic Labor force status is for April survey week of and March survey week of Income data ( prices ) are for and Income data for and Since regional location data are from and Censuses they are not strictly comparable with other data shown in this table which are derived from Current Population Reports * The Census change in definition of a farm resulted in a decline of slightly over million in the total number of farm families.

But at least since World War II the speed of progress has not been equal for all types of families as is shown in Table The incidence of poverty has declined substantially for most categories shown in the table. But there are some notable exceptions families ( ) with no earner ( ) with head not in the civilian labor force ( ) with head years of age or older ( ) headed by a woman and ( ) on farms It is also striking that in these classes poverty is high as well as stubborn Poverty continues high also among nonwhites although there has been a large and welcome decline in this incidence With the sole exception of the farm group the total number of all families in each of these categories has remained roughly the same or has increased Hence the high-incidence groups including the nonwhites have come to constitute a larger proportion of the poor ( Table ) TABLE Selected characteristics of poor families and Percent of poor families with characteristic Selected characteristic Family head : Rural farm families.. l No earners in family years of age and over Female * Data are from Current Population Reports and are for based on income in prices. See Table footnote for comparability problem NOTE Data relate to families and exclude unrelated individuals. Poor families are defined as all families with total money income of less than $ ( prices ) Sources : Department of Commerce and Council of Economic Advisers This tabulation shows that certain handicapping characteristics notably old age or absence of an earner or of a male family head have become increasingly prominent in the poor population. This is both a measure of past success in reducing poverty and of the tenacity of the poverty still existing Rising productivity and earnings improved education and the structure of social security have permitted many families or their children to escape ; but they have left behind many families who have one or more special handicaps. These facts suggest that in the future economic growth alone will provide relatively fewer escapes from poverty. Policy will have to be more sharply focused on the handicaps that deny the poor fair access to the expanding incomes of a growing economy But the significance of these shifts in composition should not be exaggerated. About half of the poor families are still headed neither by an aged person nor by a woman and percent include at least one earner High employment and vigorous economic growth are still of major importance for this group. And it is essential to remember that one-third of the present poor are children. For them improvements in the availability and quality of education offer the greatest single hope of escaping poverty as adults STRATEGY AGAINST POVERTY Public concern for the poor is not new. Measures to prevent and particularly to relieve poverty have an ancient origin in every civilization Each generation in America has forged new weapons in the public and private fight against this perennial enemy. Until recent decades the focus was primarily on the alleviation of distress rather than on prevention or rehabilitation. Yet all the while the sources of poverty have been eroded as a by-product of a general advance in economic well-being and of measures designed to achieve other social goals. Universal education has been perhaps the greatest single force contributing both to social mobility and to general economic growth The social legislation of the New Deal strengthened and expanded in every subsequent national administration marked a turning point by recognizing a national interest in the economic well-being and security of individuals and families. The social insurance programs established in the 's were designed principally to alleviate poverty in old age and to shield families from the loss of all income during periods of unemployment The tasks for our generation are to focus and coordinate our older programs and some new ones into a comprehensive long-range attack on the poverty that remains. A new federally led effort is needed with special emphasis on prevention and rehabilitation A forthcoming special Presidential message will describe the new attack and propose specific programs. The purpose of this section is not to present those measures but rather to outline some leading elements of an over-all attack on poverty recognizing the wide array of existing antipoverty programs pointing to ways in which they might be reinforced and focused in the years ahead and taking account of programs proposed in the past three years and awaiting consideration MAINTAINING HIGH EMPLOYMENT The maintenance of high employment a labor market in which the demand for workers is strong relative to the supply is a powerful force for the reduction of poverty. In a strong labor market there are new and better opportunities for the unemployed the partially employed and the low paid. Employers have greater incentive to seek and to train workers when their own markets are large and growing. For these reasons tax reduction is the first requisite in of a concerted attack on poverty. To fight poverty in a slack economy with excess unemployment is to tie one hand behind our backs. We need not do so Accelerating economic growth. In the longer run the advance of standards of living depends on the rate of growth of productivity per capita and this in turn depends on science and technology capital accumulation and investments in human resources as Chapter has indicated. Growth also expands the resources available to governments and private organizations to finance specific programs against poverty Fighting discrimination. A program to end racial discrimination in America will open additional exits from poverty and for a group with an incidence of poverty at least twice that for the Nation as a whole. Discrimination against Negroes Indians Spanish-Americans Puerto Ricans and other minorities reduces their employment opportunities wastes their talents inhibits their motivation limits their educational achievement and restricts their choice of residence and neighborhood. Almost half of nonwhite Americans are poor. For nonwhites infant mortality is twice as high as for whites ; maternal deaths are four times as frequent ; expectation of life for males at age is almost five years less Discriminatory barriers have been erected and maintained by many groups. Business and labor other private organizations and individuals and all levels of government must share in their removal The economic costs of discrimination to the total society are also large By discrimination in employment the Nation denies itself the output of which the talents and training of the nonwhite population are already capable. By discrimination in education and environment the Nation denies itself the potential talents of one-ninth of its citizens. But the basic case against discrimination is not economic. It is that discrimination affronts human dignity The Executive Branch is vigorously pursuing nondiscriminatory policies and practices. It has proposed comprehensive Civil Rights legislation that would help make it possible for all Americans to develop and use their capabilities. But it will have its full effect only when all Americans join in dedicating themselves to the justice of this cause Improving regional economies. In a dynamic economy whole regions lose their economic base when their natural resources are depleted or changes in taste and technology pass them by. Appalachia and the cutover areas of the Northern Lakes States are contemporary examples. State and regional programs assisted by the Federal Government through the Area Redevelopment Administration seek to restore in such regions a viable economic base suitable to their physical and human resources Rehabilitating urban and rural communities. Overcrowded unsanitary and unsafe neighborhoods are a drag on the economic progress of a whole city. Eradication of slums can provide improved opportunities for their residents and enable them to contribute more to the community. Improved relocation programs are essential to avoid pushing the poor from an old slum to a new one. Improved community facilities and services including day care centers for children of working mothers are needed in low-income urban areas. ( Nine million children under have mothers who work outside the home. Of these fully are now expected to care for themselves while their mothers work full time. ) Among facilities that are critically needed for slum families are adequate housing hospitals parks libraries schools and community centers. Improvement of the physical environment however is not enough. Especially when newcomers to urban areas are involved there need to be programs to facilitate adaptation to the new environments. The Administration 's proposed National Service Corps could aid and supplement local efforts to provide these and other urgently needed services Parallel programs for rehabilitation are needed in depressed rural areas In some rural communities even in whole counties almost every family is at the poverty level. In such situations local resources can not possibly provide adequate schools libraries and health and community centers A healthy farm economy is basic to the strength of farm communities ; and the Rural Area Development program and the ARA are also of assistance in improving income and employment opportunities on and off the farm. Particular attention must be paid to the special problems of depressed nonfarm rural areas such as the Ozarks or the larger part of rural Appalachia ; of Indians on reservations ; and of migrant workers Improving labor markets. Improved employment information can help potential workers learn about and take advantage of new job opportunities sometimes in different industries occupations and locations. A strengthened Federal-State Employment Service better guidance and counseling services development of a system for early warning of labor displacement resulting from technological change assistance in worker relocation ( as provided by the Trade Expansion Act and in the recent amendments to the Manpower Development and Training Act ) increased amounts and duration of unemployment insurance benefits and extension of its coverage all these will enable more persons to maintain or increase their earnings Expanding educational opportunities. If children of poor families can be given skills and motivation they will not become poor adults. Too many young people are today condemned to grossly inadequate schools and instruction. Many communities lack resources for developing adequate schools or attracting teachers of high quality. Other communities concentrate their resources in the higher income areas providing inadequate educational opportunities to those at the bottom of the economic ladder Effective education for children of poor families must be tailored to their special needs ; and such education is more costly and surely more difficult than for children from homes that are economically and socially more secure The school must play a larger role in the development of poor youngsters if they are to have in fact " equal opportunity. " This often means that O-64-6 schooling must start on a pre-school basis and include a broad range of more intensive services. The President 's program against poverty will propose project grants to strengthen educational services to children of the poor Where such special efforts have been made it has become clear that few children are unable to benefit from good education. Only a small percentage of those born each year are incapable of acquiring the skills motivation and attitudes necessary for productive lives. The idea that the bulk of the poor are condemned to that condition because of innate deficiencies of character or intelligence has not withstood intensive analysis Enlarging job opportunities for youth. Recent legislation for Vocational Education will help to improve the preparation of teen-agers for productive employment. Improved counseling and employment services are needed for those leaving school. The Administration 's proposed Youth Employment Act will strengthen on-the-job training and public service employment programs and will establish a Youth Conservation Corps Improving the Nation 's health. The poor receive inadequate medical care from before birth to old age. And poverty is perpetuated by poor health malnutrition and chronic disabilities. New and expanded school health and school lunch programs will improve both health and education The recent Report of the President 's Task Force on Manpower Conservation based on a survey of Selective Service rejectees lends particular emphasis to the importance of improving our health programs especially those aimed at children and young people. That Report also underlines the need to cope with educational deficiencies by expanded vocational and literacy training and improved counseling Legislation has recently been enacted to increase the supply of physicians and dentists and to expand mental health services. The poor have a special stake in our ongoing programs of medical research. Many aged persons are confronted by medical needs beyond their financial means Passage of the program to provide hospital insurance for the aged under the social security system is an urgent immediate step Promoting adult education and training. In an economy characterized by continual technological advance many adults will not be able to earn incomes above the poverty line without new skills and training. The Manpower Training and Development Act and the training programs under the Area Redevelopment Act represent public recognition of this need. These and other programs to train and retrain workers must be expanded and strengthened placing more emphasis on those with the greatest educational deficiencies. In particular our relatively modest efforts to provide basic literacy have proved the value of such training. Many who have been regarded ( and have often regarded themselves ) as uneducable can and do learn the basic skills and these in turn equip them for training programs supplying the specific skills sought by employers Such basic education is now being made available to many more adults Assisting the aged and disabled. Continued long-run improvement of social insurance benefits along with expanded programs to cover hospital- related costs for the aged and augmented construction of housing to meet the particular needs of the aged are necessary steps in a continuing campaign against poverty ORGANIZING THE ATTACK ON POVERTY In this latest phase of the Nation 's effort to conquer poverty we must marshal already developed resources focus already expressed concerns and back them with the full strength of an aroused public conscience Poverty as has been shown has many faces. It is found in the North and in the South ; in the East and in the West ; on the farm and in the city It is found among the young and among the old among the employed and the unemployed. Its roots are many and its causes complex. To defeat it requires a coordinated and comprehensive attack. No single program can embrace all who are poor and no single program can strike at all the sources of today 's and tomorrow 's poverty Diverse attacks are needed but we must not lose sight of their common target poverty. Many programs are directed against social problems which the poor share with the non-poor insecurity of income depressed regional economies inefficient and unattractive rural and urban environments disabilities of health and age inadequate educational opportunities racial discrimination. These are all to the good. But we must not let poor individuals and families get lost between these programs. Programs must be sufficiently coordinated that whatever else they individually accomplish they act together to lift the economic and social status of America 's poor. And soon. For war has now been declared on poverty as such This coordinated attack must be adapted to local circumstances. The needs of the poor are not the same in East Kentucky and in West Harlem Coordinated programs of community action will play a critical role in the assault on poverty. Communities will be encouraged and helped to develop individual programs aimed at the special problems of their own poor families Individual communities thus can participate in a nationwide action research and demonstration program backed by the interest and resources of State and local governments and private organizations and the coordinated efforts of Federal agencies working in such fields as education health housing welfare and agriculture Conquest of poverty is well within our power. About $ billion a year would bring all poor families up to the $ income level we have taken to be the minimum for a decent life. The majority of the Nation could simply tax themselves enough to provide the necessary income supplements to their less fortunate citizens. The burden one-fifth of the annual defense budget less than percent of GNP would certainly not be intolerable. But this " solution " would leave untouched most of the roots of poverty. Americans want to earn the American standard of living by their own efforts and contributions. It will be far better even if more difficult to equip and to permit the poor of the Nation to produce and to earn the additional $ billion and more. We can surely afford greater generosity in relief of distress. But the major thrust of our campaign must be against causes rather than symptoms. We can afford the cost of that campaign too The Nation 's attack on poverty must be based on a change in national attitude. We must open our eyes and minds to the poverty in our midst Poverty is not the inevitable fate of any man. The condition can be eradicated ; and since it can be it must be. It is time to renew our faith in the worth and capacity of all human beings ; to recognize that whatever their past history or present condition all kinds of Americans can contribute to their country ; and to allow Government to assume its responsibility for action and leadership in promoting the general welfare Supplementary Tables Relating to Poverty TABLE Number and money income of unrelated individuals by selected characteristics Percent with income Number ( millions ) Selected characteristic All individuals Less than $ ( prices ) Less than $ ( prices ) Age : years years years years and over Sex : Male...

From the wheel to the electronic computer new discoveries have been put to work for man 's benefit benefit that has taken the form of shorter hours of work the elimination of backbreaking toil a continuing stream of new goods and services and a total output per capita that has risen 5-fold in the United States since the Civil War While technological change is as old as man its character and pace and therefore its impact have changed in recent centuries. The modern economic history of the industrial nations constitutes a decisive break with all of prior history. For thousands of years a man followed the path of his father and grandfather before him doing the same things in essentially the same way. Major technological changes came infrequently and their adoption was spread over many centuries. The whole structure of modern society however is geared to innovations those who initiate or adapt to change are rewarded those who do not or can not are penalized. The businessman who refuses to adopt new technology will not merely see his profits stand still ; they will surely dwindle and turn into losses as his more adventuresome competitor adopts newer and more efficient production techniques Moreover in a modern society technological change is self-reinforcing and almost self-generating. Major new breakthroughs in technology soon pave the way for a multitude of other changes. The production of cheap electricity for example not only replaced gaslights but made possible the assembly line modern communications and the computer Even if we wished to we could not eliminate pervasive and continuous technological and economic change without remaking on a much inferior basis the whole fabric of our social and economic institutions And we would not wish to. Its benefits are essential for continued economic growth higher standards of living and the elimination of poverty. Our objective should be to foster and encourage it But recognition of the many benefits of technological change must not obscure the human toll often exacted in this process of job transition the un- O employed coal miners of West Virginia the rural migrants who crowd urban slums the older workers forced into unwanted retirement and the middleaged workers whose earnings power and entitlement to fringe benefits have been eroded by the obsolescence of their skills and the loss of their seniority We can and should reduce that toll by appropriate public and private policies This chapter will explore some issues and policies related to technological change in this country 's economy. Some of these issues have recently been the subject of considerable public attention. There has been dispute whether the newest and most dramatic form of technical change " automation " is a monster that threatens to destroy our whole economic order or an economic and social boon. Others debate whether automation must share the blame for the persistence for six years of an unacceptably high rate of unemployment. President Kennedy proposed and President Johnson has repeated the proposal that a highlevel Commission on Automation be created to explore carefully these and other questions This chapter first points to the benefits of technological change both those easily measurable and others less so but perhaps equally important. It then turns to a brief review of the sources of such change It analyzes the extent to which rapid technological change may threaten the maintenance of high over-all employment and the way in which our system adjusts to the unequal impacts of technological change on regions industries and skills. Finally it reviews the policies that Government can use to foster rapid technological change while at the same time helping workers to adapt to the resulting dislocations THE FRUITS OF ADVANCING TECHNOLOGY The state of technological knowledge determines what man can do with his labor his capital and the natural resources he finds what can be produced and how it can be produced. Increases in our standard of living " economic progress " come about in considerable part from the application of new technical knowledge to production THE NATURE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE By technological change we mean the introduction of new arrangements in the process of production and distribution which enable us either to produce new products or to produce existing products more efficiently and cheaply employing fewer real resources. The basic characteristic of technological change is that it permits us to use a given set of resources in a way that better satisfies human wants. It includes not only narrowly technical changes but also the application of new organizational and managerial concepts It is useful if imprecise to distinguish between technological changes that reduce the cost of turning out already existing private and public consumption goods and those that create completely new or substantially improved products which enlarge the menu of final goods. Television penicillin nylon and the airplane are examples of technological change that produced goods not previously available. Color television the electric typewriter and the automobile with automatic transmission represent substantial quality improvements. The Bessemer process for making steel the catalytic refining of oil the mechanical picking of cotton and the automation of bookkeeping are examples of advances enabling industries to produce more cheaply goods or services that were already produced. Yet each of the examples of new products might also be said to be merely better or cheaper ways of producing already existing services television as a substitute for the radio or motion picture in communication penicillin for sulfa drugs and hospital care in the treatment of pneumonia nylon for cotton in tires or for silk in blouses the airplane for the automobile or the ship in transporting persons or goods Technological change is only one of several major elements that contribute to economic growth. Others include : Increases in the available quantity of the basic resources used in production growth of the labor force and accumulation of capital Improvements in the quality of labor as a result of the better health education training or motivation of members of the labor force Reductions in cost resulting from expansion in the size of markets described by economists as economies of scale An increased stock of physical capital embodied in buildings machinery and equipment land improvements mines stocks in trade and so on is one of the more important of these sources. And since the stock of capital has increased considerably faster than the number of workers each worker now commands a larger complement of inanimate productive resources. But it has been possible to employ this rising amount of capital per worker primarily through the progress of technology. Equipping a worker with a sturdier or larger shovel does not necessarily raise his output very much But the invention of a ditch-digging machine or bulldozer allows each worker to use a great deal more capital and thereby to increase his output enormously. Because the added output is the joint product of technological change and an added use of capital it is impossible fully to separate their contributions The same close interrelationship with technological change exists in connection with other sources of expanded output. The improved education and skill of workers often require technical rearrangements of production to make them effective. The availability of a larger supply of trained mathematicians will not significantly improve the productivity of an accounting department based on pencil and paper technology. But a mathematician developing programs for a computer may cut the cost of accounting in half. Many of the economies of mass production associated with wider markets have been possible only because technological innovations for example the assembly line opened up new possibilities for organizing the production process on a larger scale A fixed quantity of available land together with a continually depleted stock of fuel and mineral resources might well have inhibited economic growth and rising living standards for an exploding population. Yet in the West at least technological change has fully overcome " diminishing returns " as proved by the fact that prices of food and minerals are in general no higher relative to other prices today than they were years ago THE GROWTH OF OUTPUT AND INCOMES The most inclusive measure of the gains from technological improvement is the enlargement of total incomes. Technological advance is a major source of higher output ; and in the broadest sense higher output and higher incomes are synonomous Since the turn of the century the Nation 's real total output measured as GNP in prices has risen by percent from $ billion in to $ billion in This represents an annual growth rate averaging / percent for the whole period. With the population rising from million to million over this period real output per person climbed from $ at the start of the century to $ last year. Although many benefits are not captured in GNP measurements this is perhaps the single best summary index of the increased material well-being of the American people An alternative measure of our gains is private consumption per capita which reflects rising living standards. But it is an incomplete measure even of living standards because it omits the growing public services provided by all levels of government. Since the earliest date for which this measure is available real private consumption per capita has risen by percent while total output per capita has risen by percent Rising total output as noted earlier is the joint product of : a rising input of labor ; a larger input of physical capital ; and the increased productive efficiency of these inputs as a combined result of improvements in the quality of labor advances in technology and economies of scale A simpler approach divides the total output gain into two parts : a rising input of labor measured in total man-hours worked ; and an increased average output per hour of work which reflects both the rise in capital input and the increase in productive efficiency. Output in the private economy in was percent of This is the product of : ( ) total man-hours worked in equal to percent of ; times ( ) an output per man-hour in equal to percent of EFFECTS ON LABOR INCOME Every technological advance is an opportunity to raise the average standard of living of the whole community. But we are not concerned with the average standard of living alone. Rather we are interested as well in how the fruits of technological progress are shared by the various sectors of the economy. In particular it is sometimes feared that technological progress may benefit property incomes proportionately more than the incomes of labor It is a matter of arithmetic that labor 's share in total income will remain unchanged if total hourly labor compensation rises in the same proportion as labor productivity when prices are constant. Although there is no immutable law either of economics or of equity that requires this result historically the rise in the real earnings of workers has been closely linked with the advance in labor productivity Since real hourly compensation of production workers in manufacturing ( average hourly earnings plus fringe benefits deflated by the change in consumer prices ) has risen at approximately the same average rate as the average hourly productivity of manufacturing labor as Chart clearly demonstrates. Despite year-to-year variations and certain limited periods of apparently nonproportional growth both productivity and earnings have Chart Real Hourly Compensation and Productivity in Manufacturing INDEX = ( RATIO SCALE ) DC DOLLARS _ PRODUCTIVITY 1/ ( Left Scale ) ^ " # ^ f ^ % t ^ 'OJ % ? f S S ^ _ r-J \ ^ T : REAL HOURLY COMPENSATION ( Right Scale ) 1/ I/OUTPUT PER MAN-HOUR FOR ALL EMPLOYEES I/HOURLY COMPENSATION FOR PRODUCTION WORKERS DEFLATED BY THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX = SOURCE : COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS ( BASED ON DATA FROM VARIOUS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SOURCES ) risen strongly and consistently and their movement has been essentially parallel THE OPPORTUNITY FOR LEISURE One of the most important choices that technological improvement permits is that between increased output incomes and consumption on the one hand and increased leisure on the other. The growth in output per capita cited earlier underestimates the improvement in the well-being of the population to the extent that workers have voluntarily chosen to take some of the potential rise in their incomes in the form of shorter hours longer vacations or later entry into or earlier retirement from the labor force When workers voluntarily choose to reduce their working time preferring an extra hour of leisure to its equivalent in income these extra hours of leisure might properly be given a monetary value equal to the incomes foregone It is estimated that average annual hours per employee were reduced by about percent between and In manufacturing where measures are best the average workweek of production workers fell from hours in to hours last year. Moreover the average number of days worked in a year has declined substantially through longer vacations and more frequent holidays. Between and male life expectancy at birth rose by years. But the expected number of male working years rose by only primarily because of typically earlier retirement from and later entry into the work force Not only average annual hours per worker but also average annual hours worked per member of the total population have declined appreciably since As a result output per capita rose by percent a considerably smaller increase than the percent rise in output per man-hour On the whole the discipline of modern production permits neither the individual worker nor except very crudely workers as a group to weigh and to choose freely the precise combination of income and leisure that best suits their preferences. Nevertheless we may expect that over the longer run some further reduction is likely to occur in hours worked and that this will in a general way reflect an increasing preference for leisure over income as further increases in potential income occur at the existing level of hours SOME NONMEASURABLE GAINS Even if we adjust for potential gains taken in the form of leisure the increase in measured output per capita fails to account for a wide range of real but unmeasurable benefits of technical progress. We have no satisfactory way of measuring the additional output value incorporated in completely new products and our methods of measurement probably often undervalue the contribution to real incomes of improvements in the quality of existing products For example can anyone measure how much better off people are as a result of telephone communication ? The benefit is surely not measured by comparing the cost of messages delivered by mail and messages spoken along a wire. Nylon is not only cheaper than silk it is more durable easier to care for more resistant to stains. The benefit of transoceanic air travel is not measured solely by the reduction of cost relative to sea travel the saving of travel time permits many persons to visit Europe or the Far East who would never otherwise be able to do so. Examples abound in the area of medical care. How do we measure the benefit of a vaccine that practically eliminates smallpox or polio a medicine that conquers tuberculosis or pneumonia scientific discoveries that permit us to attack mental retardation ? Technological change has permitted everyone to share experiences previously by their very nature limited to a few to attend a World Series game a class taught by a great teacher a recital by Pablo Casals Moreover no measure of gross national product attempts to take account of the reduced human costs of producing it. A job on an assembly line may be dull ; but it is a vast improvement over the backbreaking drudgery of many jobs a century earlier. And if one complains that our output measures fail to take account of the pollution of urban air and water it must be noted that they also fail to take account of the fact that inexpensive automobile transportation permits city dwellers to escape to the ocean beaches the mountains the areas of forest wilderness Thus technological advance and the rising productivity associated with it have many human payoffs : higher incomes and consumption longer life reduced suffering and illness reduced drudgery greater leisure and an improved quality of life that can not be measured in income statistics Philosophers may debate whether all this contributes to human happiness or the edification of the soul. Ordinary men those who have not yet enjoyed the fruits of technological advance those who have tasted them and those grown accustomed to the diet all pursue them with fervor undiminished by the philosophers5 doubts AMERICA 'S ROLE IN THE WORLD America 's position of free world leadership carries heavy responsibilities for our own defense and that of our allies and for assistance to the newly awakened nations of Latin America Africa and Asia. These burdens are not easy. But continued rapid technological advance can permit them to be borne with minimum strain The burden of maintaining our defense and aid programs is not only that of producing the value of output that we wish to devote to these purposes. In a world of fixed exchange rates and free convertibility of currencies into each other and of the dollar into gold it is also a problem of our balance of payments Continued rapid technological advance can help in three ways. First by contributing to a rise in productivity it can permit us to hold our price level steady in the face of rising wage rates. Combined with some tendency O-64-7 for prices to rise in other industrial countries this will permit us to compete more effectively in world trade. Second the higher rates of profit that arise from investments exploiting new technological advances will reduce the outflow of capital and attract it from abroad. Third and perhaps most important the continued development of new products is one of the surest roads to export expansion. Within a few years after the introduction of almost any new product in today 's world a dozen nations will be able to compete with us in its production. To maintain or expand our share of world exports we must continually be in the vanguard of product development. This requires continuous innovation increasing technological development and the most rapid possible exploitation of the new opportunities that emerge from scientific advance Thus rapid technological change needs to be fostered not alone for its effects on the growth of our internal comfort and well-being. It is also an urgent necessity for the solution of our international economic problems. It is the answer to those who say that America must choose between two sets of irreconcilable objectives domestic prosperity and international payments equilibrium. Combined with the responsible price and wage making discussed in Chapter of this Report rapid technological gains can permit us to reconcile policies for high employment and growing incomes domestically with our objective of achieving equilibrium in our international payments. It is truly the " great reconciler. " SOURCES OF TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS Technical change occurs in several ways. In its most distinctive and easily identified form it is a process that begins with an advance in basic scientific knowledge. Such an advance may then lead often after years or even decades to the application of the new scientific knowledge to a " practical " problem : the " invention " of a way to produce an existing good or service in a more efficient ( i.e. less costly ) way or the production of a new good or service INVENTION AND INNOVATION Today the process of invention has been increasingly organized and systematized and we now identify " R&D " ( research and development ) as a major activity in our economy. Nonetheless it must be recognized that significant inventions are often still the product of the individual working alone sometimes with little formal scientific training. And some of the principal breakthroughs in pure science particularly the development of new theoretical concepts are often still the product of individual scholars The final step in the process of technological advance comes after the application has been proved technically feasible and seems to promise economic gain when it is actually introduced and used. It is at this point that technological change really occurs a step identified as " innovation. " It is important to emphasize that new knowledge and even its application in a technically successful way has by itself no direct economic significance. Innovation is the key element in the process of technical change from the standpoint of economic progress. The innovator whether the inventor himself a small entrepreneur the manager of a giant firm or a government official must make the decision to take the risks of introducing a new and untried process good or service. The costs of using a new process or the acceptability of a new product are uncertain until tested on the production line or in the market place. And as cost and demand conditions change inventions that previously had no chance of successful application may become economically feasible Technological change can also come about without any conscious decision to " innovate " but through the many minor changes that occur from day to day as existing processes are used. It may also come about with little or no change in the physical circumstances of production. For example the discovery that a furnace performs more effectively at a higher or lower temperature than previously supposed may be applied through only the adjustment of a valve INVESTMENT AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE But much technological change requires an alteration of the physical apparatus of production. And where the innovation is of any significance such an alteration will ordinarly require an act of investment the modification of existing apparatus the installation of new machines or equipment even the construction of new buildings. This fact has several important consequences One such consequence is that the rate at which technological progress can be incorporated in production is closely tied to the rate of gross investment. Stepping up the rate of growth of the stock of plant and equipment accelerates the improvement in its quality and productivity A second consequence of the tie between technology and physical investment is that normally new technology is not introduced all at once. Particularly where the change represents a new process for accomplishing some : productive task it will often pay business firms to introduce it only as theii existing facilities become less efficient with age thus permitting the differential efficiency of the new equipment to compensate for its additional capital cost. But even if the new equipment is so superior in its productivity that it would pay to scrap the previous equipment immediately production of new equipment takes time. It would have been impossible to convert all railroads from steam to diesel in one year simply because the makers of diesel engines could not economically expand their production fast enough The physical investment lag and a perhaps equally important information lag mean that it often takes years sometimes decades for new technology to spread throughout an industry or an economy. The in- troduction of automation is a case in point. In many applications automated facilities which control productive processes through servomechanical ( " feed-back " ) devices accomplish dramatic savings in direct labor. As with previous major technological changes one can expect this innovation to be applied to an increasing number of activities. But merely because automation is technically feasible in many applications it is not necessarily economically feasible even though it may greatly reduce direct labor costs. Higher capital costs lack of flexibility and the necessity for large runs make automation noneconomic in thousands of applications where it is technically feasible. Moreover even where it is economically advantageous eventually to substitute automated for nonautomated equipment its introduction may well be delayed until the relative cost of operating the older equipment increases substantially. In a previous generation electric power did not displace the steam engine overnight nor did the steam engine in its time take over from the waterwheel overnight Only a small fraction of the ultimate benefits of automation have yet been realized TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND AGGREGATE DEMAND Like all previous technological change automation creates the necessity for many workers to change jobs during their lifetimes and for sons to find different work from that of their fathers. The problem created by these labor market adjustments is discussed in a later part of this chapter together with the policies that can lubricate such adjustments and ease their human toll THE EXPANSION OF DEMAND Quite apart from these adjustment problems many are convinced that recent and current technological change is somehow different in its employment effects from all previous changes. This conviction rests upon one or both of the following propositions : ( ) that our productive powers are now outstripping our wants and needs and ability to buy our own output and thus our economy 's ability to create new jobs ; and ( ) that technological change is now destroying jobs at a much faster rate than ever before If the Nation 's ability and eagerness to buy output can and does keep pace with its ability to produce a speeded-up pace of technological advance means that standards of living and economic security can rise more rapidly than ever. In this case faster progress of productivity is to be sought and welcomed. Only if demand can not keep pace ( or if the required adjustments can not readily be accommodated ) is there a basis for fearing more rapid technological change Historically there is surely no evidence of any inability of demand to rise along with productive capacity or of any permanent inadequacy of total job opportunities. Rather our technologically progressive economy has brought higher output and incomes and more and better consumption and investment along with the voluntary decision to take some of the fruits of progress in the form of leisure. Since for instance output per worker has almost doubled. If total demand had not grown since and if we were still producing the level of output using present methods of production and the present shorter workweek it would take just million workers to do it. This would leave two-thirds of our present labor force unemployed. Instead the demand for output is almost three times as high and employment is percent higher than in If total demand had grown since only as fast as population percent of our labor force would now be unemployed as a result of the higher productivity Clearly the increase in total demand for our potential output is the factor that has reconciled advancing technology with rising employment And it should continue to do so far into the future. Despite dramatic increases in average family income American consumers have continued to spend a remarkably constant proportion of their disposable income on consumer goods and services. And a very large proportion of our families still earn very modest incomes. Millions of families live in actual poverty as the preceding chapter has shown and half of American families in had incomes below $ If median family income increased at the same rate in the next years as it has since half of American families in would still have incomes below $ in today 's prices. Today even families at twice that level have no trouble finding ways to spend extra income. There is surely no reason to believe that any plausible rate of technical progress could lead to consumer satiation in the lifetimes of persons now on earth Technological change permits any given level of output to be produced with less labor and in that sense destroys jobs. But it also provides a significant spur to investment and consumption and thus creates jobs. Technological change makes existing capital equipment obsolete. New processes and products increase the profitability of investment and stimulate business demand for new machines new equipment and new buildings. Technological change both generates high levels of investment and gives consumers new purchasing incentives. Historically periods of rapid technological change have generally been periods of high and rising employment There is of course no automatic mechanism which guarantees that actual demand will grow each year at exactly the same rate as potential full-employment output. An economy characterized by technological change and growth always faces the challenge of maintaining a growth in demand sufficient for full employment but not so high as to lead to inflation Fortunately growing sophistication in the uses of economic policy particularly fiscal and monetary policy make this goal more nearly attainable than ever before These tools of economic policy are capable of righting the balance whenever the job-destroying effects of technological progress outweigh its job-creating effects. They will succeed in this task however only if they are adjusted to take account of changes in the rate of productivity gains whether from an altered pace of technological advance or from other sources THE TREND OF LABOR PRODUCTIVITY Some recent developments have been cited frequently to support the belief that technological change is accelerating. In certain instances automation has greatly lifted output per man-hour and has revolutionized the productive process. These instances are highly dramatic but they are insufficient for evaluating the over-all impact of technological progress Such an evaluation must be based on a study of the trend in over-all productivity output per man-hour for the private economy The main difficulty in assessing the trend of productivity is that current output per man-hour is also affected by numerous transitory factors most significantly by fluctuations in output and changes in the average age of the machinery in use. For example during recessions employment falls proportionately less than output as a result of lags in employer reaction uncertainty about the future the need to retain the same supervisory and maintenance personnel over wide ranges of output and hiring and firing costs. Employed manpower is not fully utilized and the level of output per man-hour is depressed. This is usually followed by rapid rates of increase in labor productivity during the early phases of cyclical expansions ( Chart ) Moreover our statistical measures of productivity are far from exact Productivity is a ratio of recorded output to recorded labor input and relatively small errors in measuring either the numerator or denominator can distort the pattern of change in productivity. Particularly in measuring productivity for individual sectors of the economy there are statistical problems associated with the measurement of output change ; and measures of labor input are also a source of difficulty. ( Currently there are two separate official series on employment and man-hours one based primarily on payroll data reported by business establishments and the other based on a monthly survey of households. ) The Department of Commerce is now engaged in major revisions of output data and the Bureau of Labor Statistics is planning to.publish revised productivity indexes during based on the revised output data. Recorded changes in productivity for individual years and sectors must be viewed as a broad gauge rather than a precise reading of economic performance With these qualifications productivity measurements for recent years are presented in Table accompanied by some comparisons with longerrun trends. Labor input data are based on information collected primarily from establishments. The table shows that productivity gains have been healthy but not unprecedentedly large during the past years. While improvement has varied among sectors the average gain in each case has been greater during the past years than in the preceding decade but less than the average of T A B L E Changes in output per man-hour in the private economy Percentage change per year Period Total private Agriculture Nonagriculture Total Manufacturing i Nonmanufacturing * ( ) to to * to to to to to to Department of Labor estimates for are in the course of revision and are not available ( see note to Table C-32 ) Therefore estimates for all years beginning with have been made by the Council of Economic Advisers on a consistent basis using Department of Commerce net output estimates Based on data from private sources s Not available NOTE. Man-hours are based primarily on establishment data Sources : Department of Commerce Department of Labor and Council of Economic Advisers To determine whether these relatively larger gains of the past years exceed past trends it is necessary to sort out the cyclical and transitory factors affecting productivity. For this purpose several alternative statistical analyses were undertaken on the noinfarm productivity gains of to determine the separate influences on productivity of the average age of equipment stocks variations in the growth of output and changes in the degree of capacity utilization. These findings were then used to estimate the productivity gains that might have been expected in the years through if the past relationships and trends still held Depending on which statistical analysis is used ( and there is no clear basis for preferring one to another ) the recent gains are either about in line with the expectation or exceed it by amounts ranging up to percentage point. These differences are sufficiently tentative that further experience is needed to confirm a positive conclusion Recent large gains could reflect no more than a possibly unusually cautious hiring policy on the part of business in the current expansion. Experience with the slack labor market of recent years may have deterred the anticipatory hiring of overhead and skilled personnel which appears typically to take place during a business expansion as insurance against the possibility of future labor shortages. If so the recent higher rates of productivity increase may prove to be transitory. Yet optimism may still be warranted. If objective analysis does not support a firm conclusion that the trend of productivity has accelerated neither can that possibility be dismissed. Technological progress may indeed have accelerated but its impact on productivity may be only gradually becoming visible because of the time that must elapse before innovations become embodied in new capital equipment and expressed in new organizational forms ADJUSTMENT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE The benefits to society from technological change are not costless. For some individual workers businesses and communities technological change brings new opportunity : better jobs higher profits greater prosperity. For others it imposes burdens and even hardships. For technical change may reduce the value of or even make obsolete particular labor skills plant and equipment or natural resources By and large our enterprise system works well in producing the shifts of capital and managerial resources from one activity to another that changed circumstances including technical progress dictate. But unless the individual worker who is displaced from his job by technological change finds other employment soon both he and society lose Even when over-all employment opportunities are adequate job security for the individual worker is never certain. Technological change has perhaps been the most perennially disruptive influence on job security ; but changes in consumer tastes and business organization increased competition and decisions of public policy also frequently and unpredictably disrupt existing job patterns. And even in a strong labor market it almost always takes time for displaced workers to find new jobs The development of new processes directly alters the labor requirements of particular firms and industries and of the whole economy. More indirectly by raising real incomes and changing relative prices technological advance induces shifts in the industrial composition of output and employment. A faster-than-average pace of technological change reduces costs of production in the industry where it occurs and is ordinarily reflected either in a decline in the relative price or in an improvement in the relative quality of the products of that industry Sometimes the technologically induced lowering of price or raising of quality leads to enough expansion of demand actually to increase employment in the industry where the change occurs. Where technological change gives birth to an entire new industry this is of course true. Automobiles in the 's and more recently airlines office machinery and electronic and communications equipment are clear cases of this sort. In other activities of which farming and coal mining are good examples spectacular productivity advances have not led to equivalent increases in sales and employment has declined sharply If rates of technological advance were not too unequal among industries and over-all growth is rapid employment might still expand in some industries without requiring layoffs in others. Normally however transitional problems arise as the number of jobs in specific firms industries occupations or geographic areas declines more rapidly than the number of workers seeking to fill them even after account is taken of retirements and voluntary job changes THE CHANGING DISTRIBUTION OF JOB REQUIREMENTS In the past decade jobs have been destroyed and created at very unequal rates in various regions occupations and industries Changing regional requirements are illustrated by the fact that nonagricultural employment actually declined between and in Rhode Island Pennsylvania Michigan and West Virginia remained essentially unchanged in Maine and Ohio and rose by million ( almost percent ) in California percent in Florida percent in Arizona and percent in Nevada. Even more striking disparities can be found among metropolitan areas Shifts in the occupational distribution of jobs have been equally dramatic The number of farmers and farm workers declined by million or percent between and In more narrowly defined occupations there were employment declines of percent among locomotive engineers and firemen percent among textile weavers and spinners percent among telegraph operators and percent among fishermen. During this same period employment rose by percent among professional nurses percent among teachers and percent among engineers and draftsmen Changes in the industrial composition of jobs were highlighted by the continued decline in the importance of goods-producing industries as sources of employment. Total employment in manufacturing mining and construction declined by percent between and In contrast employment increased by percent in State and local government percent in services percent in finance and J6 percent in trade Automation is often regarded as having a qualitatively different effect on worker displacement than did earlier forms of technological change Specifically it is suggested that automation requires a higher average level of education or skills than did earlier forms of technology and that this complicates the adjustment process for displaced blue-collar workers whose old skills have been rendered obsolete while lack of adequate educational background disqualifies them from filling the new jobs created by automation However the current changes in skill requirements appear to continue a long evolutionary process. Professional and technical workers and craftsmen for instance accounted for about percent of the work force in percent in and percent in In contrast unskilled farm and nonfarm workers accounted for percent of the labor force in percent in and only percent in It is not clear whether automation has caused any acceleration in these trends. Further studies are needed to which the proposed Commission on Automation should contribute Whatever the exact pace and cause it is clear that the proportion of jobs calling for the exercise of considerable responsibility and for a substantial educational background is rising THE ADJ USTMENT PROCESS With the dramatic changes we have experienced in recent decades in the distribution of available job openings and in the nature of job requirements it is remarkable that labor market adjustment takes place as efficiently as it does. But American workers are highly mobile Although many workers particularly older ones are reluctant to sever local ties even when they become unemployed there is nevertheless an impressive degree of geographical mobility. On the average during each year of the past decade over percent of the civilian population moved its residence across county lines and percent across State lines. During prosperous periods the rates of mobility out of labor surplus areas are considerably higher. Today only percent of all persons aged and over still live in the State of their birth. Rapidly growing areas have managed to attract large numbers of workers from sections of the country where the natural population increase has exceeded the expansion of job opportunities The net in-migration rate between and was over percent in Florida and Nevada and between and percent in Arizona Alaska California and Delaware. In contrast the net out-migration rate was percent or higher from such States as Arkansas West Virginia and Mississippi During some million workers changed jobs including about million who changed voluntarily in order to improve their economic status. Mobility declines rapidly with age ; still almost percent of men years old changed jobs in Fifty-six percent of all job changes involved a shift between major industry groups and percent between major occupation groups The extensive training and retraining programs conducted by many though not by enough private employers contribute significantly to the occupational flexibility of the work force. In establishments accounting for almost percent of private nonfarm employment had some type of training program and were providing training for percent of their employees. The natural turnover in the labor force also contributes to this flexibility. An average of older persons will die or retire during each year of the current decade while an average of women will leave for family reasons. At the same time an average of million young persons will enter the labor market each year so that by percent of the labor force will consist of persons who were not in the job market in This substantial inflow of new workers can provide a supply of relatively well educated and mobile labor for expanding activities Indeed improved education has been the primary factor permitting the rapid adjustment of the labor supply to the demands of changing technology. The average educational attainment of new workers currently entering the labor force is about percent higher than that of those currently retiring. Just since the beginning of World War II the median level of education among the entire adult male labor force aged has risen by more than percent. The proportion of the labor force with an 8th grade education or less declined from percent in to percent in In contrast the proportion who were college graduates rose from to percent. And this educational upgrading will certainly continue. More than million persons are expected to graduate from college in and and an additional persons will receive advanced degrees. The total number of degree recipients will be percent greater than a decade earlier. Unsatisfied as we are and rightfully so with our educational accomplishments it is clear that rising levels of education have been the major force permitting the rapid and on the whole successful adjustment of the work force to changing occupational requirements DEFECTS OF THE ADJUSTMENT PROCESS Displaced workers rarely find new jobs instantaneously. Time is required for the flow of job information and for matching the location education skill wage working conditions and other preferences of job hunters with the requirements of employers. Personal contacts employment services and help-wanted advertisements provide important channels of communication between employers hunting for workers and workers hunting for jobs Nonetheless the flow of labor market information is unnecessarily slow and circumscribed. Because of insufficient staff and in some instances because of the failure of employers to provide information local offices of the Federal-State Employment Service can not provide complete information on local job opportunities to say nothing of a full exchange of information among different localities. In the absence of adequate vocational guidance many young workers are not properly prepared for the activities in which employment is expanding most rapidly. Geographic movement is often restrained by lack of information and by the inability of workers to finance transportation job search and change of residence. Occupational mobility is often inhibited by the absence of adequate educational background and the inability to acquire needed skills The average displaced worker spends far too long between jobs even in periods of adequate demand. The average duration of unemployment was weeks during the period when the over-all unemployment rate averaged percent. And during the boom years of when the unemployment rate averaged percent and the number of unfilled jobs very probably exceeded the number of unemployed workers the average duration of unemployment was still weeks. These statistics do not refer specifically to the average period of joblessness for workers displaced by technological change but they do indicate the time-consuming nature of the job-hunting process. They also suggest that reduction of the human cost of technological change will require policies both private and public for improving and speeding the matching of available jobs and workers Such policies can never be completely adequate. The burdens of transitional unemployment may be harsh but they sometimes represent only part IOI of the cost of change to the displaced worker. The worker made permanently unemployable by technological change is relatively rare but it is frequent for a displaced worker to find himself required to accept a less challenging and lower paying job. The specialized skill experience and seniority which contributed to earning power in the original job frequently do not have transferable market value Moreover the burden of technological displacement often falls most heavily on those least able to bear it. As noted already the general drift of technological change has tended to be toward increased rather than reduced skill and education requirements and thus in favor of groups already higher up on the income ladder. To be sure some of the elite of the labor force have suffered printers and flight engineers to take two recent examples. But overwhelmingly the groups displaced have been the lessskilled less-educated and therefore poorer members of the labor force But even if the incidence of technological change were entirely random the wealthier community the more prosperous business the more highly trained and better paid workers have greater adaptability and greater resources to help them through the period of adaptation When technological change displaces considerable numbers of workers in a particular region or occupation and these workers lack the skills or mobility necessary to find other jobs quickly their continuing unemployment can well be called " structural. " Pockets of such structural unemployment are never absent and the problems they present for public policy are intensified ( and partly .concealed ) in a generally slack economy with excessive over-all unemployment In its testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Employment and Manpower on October the Council considered at some length the interrelationships between slack labor markets resulting from insufficient total demand for goods and services and problems of structural unemployment. It dealt in particular with the question whether recent technological change may have increased the incidence of structural unemployment in the American economy and the possible relevance of this for policies to raise demand. The Council explained in detail its reasons for doubting that structural unemployment has increased but emphasized that such unemployment is both an economic and a human problem of serious proportions and that Government has a responsibility for taking appropriate measures to reduce it. The bulk of this testimony is reprinted as Appendix A to this Report PRIVATE POLICIES FACILITATING ADJUSTMENT Recognition of the human toll that can result from technological change and labor displacement has led to a wide range of private efforts to reduce transitional costs. Human adjustment problems are minimized when needed work force reductions can be accomplished by normal attrition and reassignment. This goal toward which firms with enlightened personnel policies strive is often made economically feasible by the limited scope of many innovations or by a sufficiently high rate of voluntary employee turnover. But it requires careful planning. The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently surveyed the work history of persons employed in offices doing data processing work which was to be transferred to electronic computers. The firms tried to ensure employment security for their current work force by advance planning and curtailment of hiring. Twelve months after the new installation more than half of the workers were still in their original positions and more than percent had been transferred to other positions in the firm. Thirteen percent had quit or retired and less than percent were laid off Collective bargaining agreements have been concerned increasingly with problems of accommodating change while protecting worker security In recent agreements increasing stress has been placed on interplant seniority pools relocation allowances early retirement provisions and severance pay plans that provide a lump sum payment or its equivalent as reimbursement for the income losses associated with displacement. The recent Kaiser Steel-United Steelworkers and West Coast Longshoremen 's agreements provided employment guarantees or income assurances for workers displaced by technological change. The Railroad Arbitration Board decreed the eventual elimination of percent of diesel locomotive firemen 's jobs in freight and yard service but it provided income guarantees for those with to years of seniority and lifetime employment protection for those with greater seniority Private programs to minimize displacement or to reimburse displaced workers are desirable because the burden of adjustment is prevented from falling exclusively on the displaced worker. Such programs serve a doubly useful purpose when they facilitate the rapid introduction and economical use of new processes. However they can often be only partial remedies In many instances of major technological change private programs either are impracticable ( for example if the displacement occurs in industry A as a result of technological change in industry B ) or else can not provide complete worker protection without unduly slowing the pace of technical advance and preventing the flexible and efficient utilization of the labor force PUBLIC POLICY AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE Two central points emerge from the preceding discussion. First technological advance is a key element in economic progress ; achieving the goals of rapid growth and higher living standards and better international balance depends on maintaining and even increasing its pace. Second technological change like other kinds of change demands adaptations on the part of labor business and the community at large ; and these adaptations impose real burdens on adversely affected individuals Each of these points has significant implications for public policy. They suggest that Government should stimulate and facilitate rapid technological change in order to enlarge its benefits at the same time attempting to strengthen processes of adaptation and to lighten the burdens of change on affected individuals The single most important support the Government can provide for accomplishing each of these purposes is to help the economy achieve and sustain high employment. Without strong markets for their products businessmen will have inadequate incentives to undertake the risks inherent in innovation. Likewise the economy 's adaptation to technical change and particularly its ability to transfer the resources released by technical change to other industries and activities become immeasurably weakened in the absence of strong demand TAX STIMULUS FOR INVESTMENT Enactment of the pending tax bill is thus crucial to the achievement of our dual objectives. First it helps insure the increase in demand necessary to provide markets for our growing productive potential. But the tax program of the Administration carries a further impact of great importance for the encouragement of rapid technological innovation. This is the specific emphasis on encouraging investment. The investment tax credit and the revised depreciation guidelines of were designed particularly to reward firms which raised their rate of investment in new plant and equipment. And the pending bill carries this emphasis further with a large reduction in corporate taxes a cutback of risk-inhibiting top bracket individual tax rates and a further broadening of the investment credit The stimulus that tax reduction will give to investment both through its effects on markets generally and through its specific improvement in investment incentives is one of the most powerful ways available to encourage the rapid introduction of new and better technology GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE A healthy rate of innovation is encouraged by preserving freedom of entry into markets by new competitors and by a patent system which provides positive incentives to both invention and innovation The Government has also provided more direct encouragement of technological advance and it can and should do more. Federal support is clearly warranted and appropriate when it encourages innovations that will be used directly to improve performance of a service recognized as a direct responsibility of the Federal Government. National defense is the most important current example of such an activity. But there are many other activities in which government Federal State or local plays a major role : providing public highways airways inland waterways weather services and postal services ; maintaining an atmosphere free from dangerous pollution and an adequate supply of pure water ; and a long list covering such diverse fields as criminology recreation and education. In such activities Government has a special responsibility to undertake or to support research and development which promise improvements in public services better quality greater safety and reliability and lower cost. In none of these fields can private incentives be expected to provide an adequate research effort But there are other situations that justify Federal support of invention and innovation even in areas that are and should remain the province of private enterprise. This is surely true where the benefits to the community extend far beyond the gains to the individual buyers of the new product or service The benefits to these buyers may be quite insufficient to cover the private costs and risks of developing the new good or service ; yet the benefits to society at large may pay a handsome return to the innovational activity Medical research is clearly an example of this kind of activity. Improvements in medical technology are certainly in the public interest ; yet the costs of many such improvements could not and perhaps should not be borne by the immediate beneficiaries of the new knowledge. Through a political process society has determined that a larger effort should be made and Government funds primarily support it REASONS FOR UNDERINVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND INNOVATION Aside from medicine the other principal field in which significant Federal support has been given to technological change in an essentially private civilian industry is agriculture. This type of support has a long history going back at least to when the Hatch Act established the national system of agricultural experiment stations and to when the Agricultural Extension Service was founded. The basic justification for supporting agricultural research differs from that applicable to national defense or medicine. And it is a justification which would seem to extend to other industries as well. In a number of industries the amount of organized private research undertaken is insignificant and the technology of many of these low-research industries has notably failed to keep pace with advances elsewhere in the economy Several factors can be identified to account for the underinvestment in research and development on the part of private firms in such industries The primary one is an inability of the individual firm to recover the costs of research in its prices even though the additional value to the direct consumers of the product would greatly exceed those costs. Particularly in the case of basic research the " product " is new knowledge ; but scientific knowledge can not be appropriated by an individual firm. Other firms and even other industries which have not incurred the research costs share the benefits. As a new development moves further along the research and development spectrum toward actual production an individual firm may be able through the patent system to appropriate to itself rewards sufficient to justify the costs and risks of developing and introducing the new process or new product. The clearest case for public support thus applies to the more basic forms of research. This case is reinforced by greater riskiness at this early end of the R&D spectrum. Ordinarily at least uncertainty decreases as a new process or product approaches specific economic application. Indeed the research cycle can usefully be viewed as a process of progressive reduction of uncertainty as more knowledge is acquired Another reason for the virtual absence of organized research in many industries is the high cost of research in the relevant technologies in relation to the typical size of firms in those industries. Research plant and equipment costs are very high in nuclear physics for example. In other cases effective research may require large staffs of scientists and engineers since advances may depend on contributions from many scientific specialties Furthermore the small establishment is unable to take advantage of the spreading of risks among a number of R&D projects under way at the same time. The larger firm able to support a number of projects can safely take the risk of many " failures " ( i.e. projects that do not produce economically applicable results ) since a few successes will ordinarily more than compensate for the entire investment. The large firm has the additional advantage of being in a better position to market successfully the new products of its research laboratory because of its broader market coverage. For example in the chemicals industry which is relatively active in research many firms typically participate in a broad range of product markets. In this field at least where new R&D results are often profitably applicable in more than one market the large firm is better able to recognize and take advantage of possible payoffs in several applications However some industries characterized by large firms undertake relatively little R&D. Part of the explanation seems to lie in the age of the industry. Industries which were already mature before sophisticated scientific and engineering techniques began to be applied to industry lack a research tradition. Many important newer industries such as electronics grew directly out of modern organized research and development and their managements find it natural and profitable to continue this emphasis on R&D as they mature The fact that some industries spend little on research does not in itself prove that there would be high payoffs to additional research. It may be that research effort is slight because it is clear that it would not pay. Nor does it automatically follow that productivity gains in these fields are low They may and often do show rapid gains based on innovations by the capital goods industries which supply their equipment Nevertheless the above analysis has suggested some reasons quite unrelated to the potential gains from accelerated R&D that account for an underinvestment in research in many fields particularly where firms are small. The data at the bottom of Table clearly show that manufacturing firms with R&D programs and with or more employees did on the average more than twice as much research as a percentage of sales as did smaller firms TABLE Research and development performed by industry Millions of dollars Industry and size Total Company financed Percent of sales i Total Company financed By industry : Motor vehicles and other transportation equipment Professional and scientific instruments Petroleum refining and extraction Primary metals _ ___ Rubber products Fabricated metal products Food and kindred products Stone clay and glass products- Total Aircraft and missiles Electrical equipment and communication Chemicals and allied products Machinery __ ___ Paper and allied products Textiles and apparel Lumber wood products and furnitureOther industries ( ) By size of company : Less than employees. to employees-.. employees or more ( ) Data for manufacturing companies with R&D programs Not separately available but included in total Includes dollar amounts for other manufacturing and nonmanufacturing companies not elsewhere classified NOTE.

These fields account for percent of the total. Together with machinery and motor vehicles and other transportation equipment they account for percent. Professional and scientific instruments is a smaller industry in which research and development expenditures are high relative to sales. Federal support for research is important in several of these cases. Yet it is striking that these highresearch industries all show an important volume of company-financed R&D The data in Table show that the Federal Government is already a heavy contributor to research and development in America although its support is now heavily concentrated in areas related to defense and space exploration. Its contribution grew from $ billion in to an estimated $ billion in and expanded from a little over half of the total R&D spending in to more than two-thirds in What is now at issue is whether a relatively small fraction of that support O should be directed in the future to civilian fields in which technological development has been lagging TABLE Research and development expenditures to [ Billions of dollars ] By performance By sources of funds * Year * Total expenditures Federal Government Industry Universities and other nonprofit institutions Federal Government Industry Universities and other nonprofit institutions 1962-63< Federal Government performance on fiscal year basis ; datafor industry are calendar year basis and other data are primarily on fiscal year basis.

Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding Source : National Science Foundation A FEDERAL CIVILIAN TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM Primary responsibility for Federal programs fostering industrial technology is assigned to the Department of Commerce which has embarked on several broad programs to stimulate technological advance in all sectors of the economy. The fundamental role of government is to help industry help itself by catalyzing and supporting the efforts of firms and communities to promote economic progress through technical change In order to disseminate the results of federally sponsored research and development more efficiently the Departments of Commerce and Defense have agreed to assign to the Office of Technical Services in Commerce the handling of all unclassified and unlimited Department of Defense documents The National Bureau of Standards is administering contracts for research useful to the textile industry under a new Civilian Technology program approved by Congress in The objective of this program is to sponsor technical investigations of problems faced by the industry at large problems that no single firm could afford to solve on its own behalf but that are especially suited to combined investigation Industry associations can be an important vehicle for undertaking research of broad significance to an entire industry. The Commerce Department is accordingly considering a legislative proposal authorizing government assistance to such groups in order to stimulate their sponsorship of non-proprietary technical investigations A further legislative proposal is under consideration to provide for Federal cooperation with States universities and industry groups to aid in the development and dissemination of new technological information The purpose of this program would be to bring the reservoir of technical information available at scientific centers to bear on the problems of firms that are not able to support large research organizations. Such a technical service program should be tailored to the needs of the local area and conducted under local direction FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR BASIC RESEARCH " Basic research " has sometimes been defined as research undertaken with no specific practical goal in mind beyond a general conviction that extending man 's knowledge of his environment and of himself is bound to serve the purposes of human life and human society. Most basic research is conducted in universities sometimes supported by the Federal Government. A relatively small number of large business organizations support basic research in areas of their general interests Merely to agree that basic research is a " good thing " does not necessarily justify Federal support for it and in particular gives no basis for determining how much support should be provided for what kinds of basic research It is inevitable that primary support should be given to those fields of natural science where potential payoff 's in national security health and economic growth are obviously high even if uncertain in location and character. The fact that many of our most dramatically " practical " technological achievements have grown quite directly and often quite promptly from new discoveries in these fields builds a solid case for their support Recognizing this relationship between basic research in the natural sciences and practical achievements benefiting society in many diverse ways the Congress has provided generous support for research in the natural sciences particularly through the Department of Defense the Atomic Energy Commission the National Aeronautics and Space Administration the Department of Health Education and Welfare and the National Science Foundation. The breadth of Federal support of basic research is reflected in the work of the NSF which supports and encourages research over a spectrum including atmospheric sciences high energy physics oceanography and metabolic biology in each of which research costs are often high and the potential payoff to society may be very great Yet basic research in other fields may also have " practical " payoffs even if not in industrial technology or national security. Thus Federal support is given to investigations in psychology where potential payoffs in more efficient organizations or better mental health can be large. The social sciences where expanding knowledge of economic and social relationships may im- prove the efficiency and effectiveness of government and private organizations also merit support even on " practical " grounds and some modest beginnings in these fields are now being undertaken A strong system of university and technical education must underlie progress in basic research. Institutions of higher education not only conduct much of our national research effort but they also train most of the scientific research workers on whom future progress depends. The National Science Foundation 's program simultaneously supports both university research and higher education reflecting their close interrelationship. Higher education is also supported through programs under the National Defense Education Act and the new Higher Education Facilities Act GOVERNMENT 'S ROLE IN AIDING ADJUSTMENT Federal responsibility for fostering more rapid technical advance clearly could not be successfully or even appropriately undertaken in an economy in which total demand perennially failed to rise enough to reemploy the workers initially displaced as well as new additions to the labor force. But maintaining high demand and satisfactory over-all employment is not enough. There are other important policies which the Federal Government must pursue if adjustments to change are to be successful and if the effects on labor business and local communities are to be acceptable. Many of the programs needed for this purpose also form one cornerstone of the attack on poverty The labor market programs of the Federal Government have made striking progress in recent years and this progress must continue. Since the Federal-State Employment Service has increased its nonfarm job placements by almost percent. But its guidance and placement facilities must be further strengthened in order to improve the matching of workers and jobs. The vocational retraining program of the Department of Labor and the Area Redevelopment Administration has reduced transition costs and improved future earning potential for a significant number of displaced workers. Some workers will be in training or retraining during fiscal year in skills as diverse as drafting stenography nursing auto repairing and metalworking ; and the program will be expanded to provide training and retraining for workers in fiscal year The recent broadening of the Manpower Development and Training Act will increase its effectiveness in coping with unemployment among low-skilled workers and youths. An important element included as part of this program will be the provision of adult education courses in fiscal year for persons who are unable to acquire industrial skills because of a lack of basic literacy and vocational training will be provided for unemployed youths In this connection the recent passage by the Congress of a broad new program of aid to vocational education is of great significance. It should lead not only to a large expansion of existing programs but also to a considerable broadening and redirection including new emphasis on busi- IIO ness and office occupations. The work-study program and provision in the new legislation for residential vocational schools will greatly improve opportunities for young people previously unable to acquire vocational training. In addition passage of the Youth Employment Act will provide work and training through conservation work camps and work projects in local communities for youths during and over the following year. The prevalence of discriminatory hiring practices has been significantly reduced by the vigorous efforts of the President 's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunities The unemployment insurance system first line of defense against the costs of unemployment must be modernized in order to deal better with the unemployment that results from shifts of jobs from one occupation industry or area to another. The additional labor market programs that are being recommended will be discussed at greater length in the forthcoming Manpower Report of the President In our concern with the problems of today 's unemployed it should not be forgotten that a strengthened system of basic education will be the best guarantee against significant problems of displacement and dislocation in tomorrow 's full-employment economy Technical education and vocational guidance programs can be kept more current by the creation of any early warning system on new technological advances. But the possibility of accurately predicting occupational requirements even years into the future is highly limited. And the average male 's working life now extends over years. We can best prepare for the occupational requirements of the labor market of through an educational system that produces well-educated and technically versatile graduates able rapidly to acquire new skills. Such versatility will accelerate the process of matching jobs and workers and greatly reduce the loss of potential earning power resulting from the obsolescence of specific skills CONCLUSION Fears of technological advance are understandable on the part of those who feel its threat to their livelihoods. In the absence of wise and effective private and public action such fears are justified. But any comprehensive appraisal can lead only to the conclusion that the benefits of technical change in the future as in the past are such that public policy should foster rather than shun it. To yield to apprehension that the machine will become our master that we are unable to absorb and adjust to rapid change that we must deny ourselves the continued rise in material well-being that ever-growing knowledge and understanding place within our grasp and the increased freedom it brings to pursue higher goals such a defeatist view is both unworthy of our heritage and unjustified. For as scientific and technical knowledge has grown over the years so too has understanding of our social and economic system and institutions including the proper role of government in a free society. Applying this knowledge all citizens can enjoy the fruits of rapid change Ill Chapter Price and Wage Policy for High Employment XNFLATION need be no more of a threat in than it was in or or and the threat was well contained in each of those years But the good record of price stability in the expansion to date provides no basis for relaxing our vigilance in and beyond. At stake are not only important domestic economic objectives but also our long-term balance-ofpayments position The decisions that can make or break this country 's price stability record rest in private hands and they should remain there. Yet it is the responsibility and the determined purpose of the Administration to do all it properly can to promote the right outcome THE PRICE-WAGE SITUATION AND THE PROSPECTS The impressive noninflationary record of this expansion thus far the stability of wholesale prices and the slow upward movement of over-all consumer prices has been reviewed in Chapter and is portrayed in Chart At the same time as Tables and show the price stability has not been " paid for " either by a failure of wages to keep up with the trend change in productivity in the economy as a whole or by a corporate profits squeeze. ( In the tables " trend change in productivity " for any given year is defined as the 5-year moving average of the annual percentage changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics index of output per man-hour in the total private economy. These estimates use labor input data collected primarily by establishments. ) While money wages have not risen as fast as in some earlier expansions the gain in purchasing power has been eroded very little by price increases. And while over-all profits have continued to rise this has been achieved without substantial price increases. In terms of the balance among wages prices and profits the economy is in a good position as it enters to avoid inflationary price and wage decisions The price stability of has resulted in part from persistent slack in the economy. But another major factor has been the responsible action of most union and business leaders in making noninflationary wage and price decisions. Although shifting patterns of demand and supply are the major factors ruling prices wages and output in our market economy there Chart Prices in Three Postwar Expansions GNP TROUGH = GNP PRICE DEFLATOR / / > * * " ' y l ^ S ^ I | CONSUMER PRICES * S i t i I s e S e S G ^ I I ^ * ^ * ~ ~ i I WHOLESALE PRICES S * MB I I t i i I i i ^ I i I QUARTERS AFTER GNP T R O U G H ! / J / BASED ON SEASONALLY ADJUSTED DATA PRICES I / T R O U G H QUARTERS FOR GNP WERE I I AND SOURCES : DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS TABLE Prices wages profits and productivity in the private economy Produc- tivity i Year Trend productivity Total compensation per employee man-hour Percentage change _-_ Percent of corporate sales I960 Profits plu s Corporate Capital con- capital conPrices profits after sumption sumption allowances allowances taxes _ i Output per man-hour for all persons ; labor input based primarily on establishment data * Annual average percentage change in output per man-hour during latest years G N P deflator for private economy Excludes profits for " rest of world.

The effect of the guidelines was to shift the proportion between profits and capital consumption allowances in favor of the latter NOTE. Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding Sources : Department of Commerce Department of Labor and Council of Economic Advisers is considerable room for discretionary decision making in most major industries. In the past wage and other cost increases together with price decisions based on fixed markups or target-profit policies have combined to push up prices. And price increases often have led to wage increases The postwar record shown in Tables and indicates how the complex interaction of wage increases to catch up with prices and price increases to preserve profit ratios worked in ratchet fashion. The net result has been that prices have risen roughly in proportion to the difference between increases in labor compensation per man-hour and national trend productivity gains. In particular the experience of the years shows that sharp price advances can occur in periods of increasing unused capacity and rising unemployment. The data do not establish causality. But clearly the collective bargaining power of unions and the market power of large firms can interact to inject an inflationary bias into our price-wage performance It is encouraging that there has been so little inflationary exercise of such power in the past years. In that period increases in compensation to labor have been close to economy-wide productivity gains and prices on the whole have not been raised to widen profit margins. The ability of private decision makers to extend this record through will be powerfully reinforced by the effects of tax reduction.

Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding Sources : Department of Commerce Department of Labor and Council of Economic Advisers increase the opportunity and the temptation to raise prices and wages contrary to the public interest. But they also will reduce management 's and labor 's need to pursue such a course. The tax cuts will add to workers ' take-home pay. They will add directly to aftertax profit margins. And by stimulating a larger volume of sales they will tend to reduce firms ' unit costs by raising their operating rates which now typically are well below desired levels The view that need not be marked by renewed inflationary pressures is further reinforced by the prospect that even with the strong expansion forecast in Chapter the economy will be operating throughout the year with sizable balances of unused capacity and idle manpower However some recent omens are disquieting. A widely scattered minority of the larger industrial corporations in recent months has been testing the market 's readiness to accept price increases. And more and more firms that do not face strong competition may try to improve their short-run profit positions by raising prices as the expansion continues Such action could trigger intensified worker demands for much steeper wage increases. Many workers are restive especially in industries that have been making above-average gains in productivity and profits. Thus despite the present strong foundation for continued price stability either " management or labor by unrestrained pursuit of its own near-term advantage could reactivate the price-wage spiral that has remained quiescent for several years ANTI-INFLATIONARY POLICIES FOR HIGH EMPLOYMENT It is the business of responsible government to try to achieve the best possible balance among such major economic objectives as full employment economic growth reasonable price stability and the promotion of economic freedom and opportunity. The importance of price stability as compared with the other goals is sometimes minimized. But there are compelling reasons why we can ill afford to neglect prices THE NEED FOR STABILITY First inflation redistributes real incomes and wealth arbitrarily. When prices rise those groups that are able to expand profits and wages most rapidly improve their situation at the expense of those whose incomes respond slowly. Inflation erodes the real value of public assistance and makes it difficult for local governments to maintain adequate standards of education and other essential services. It also reduces the purchasing power of retirement pensions and other fixed incomes in effect subjecting them to a discriminatory tax. Fixed-income assets lose value while the prices of equity securities and other properties rise A second cost of inflation that we can not afford is its adverse impact on our balance of trade and on our balance of payments. During most of the 's the pricing of American industrial products caused some loss of competitive ground to the * products of other industrial countries. From to the over-all wholesale price index rose only moderately more than the comparable indexes in most Western European countries and Japan. But the prices of certain goods important among U.S. exports rose substantially faster in the United States than in most of the countries with which we compete.

It would be foolishly complacent however to believe that these recent gains can be extended or even retained without special effort The European countries have been striving to establish rigorous " incomes policies " to restrain wages and prices. Despite recent setbacks they will continue to press these efforts. In doing so some European nations are willing to accept substantial interventions into private decision making The United States is not. If we would compete with them successfully over the long pull we shall need to achieve a high degree of price stability by means that are consistent with our traditions and values A third cost of inflation that we can ill afford is the compromise it could impose on our pursuit of full production and full employment. If cost and price pressures should arise through the exercise of market power while the economy is still climbing toward high output and employment levels we would be forced once more into the dreary calculus of the appropriate trade-off between " acceptable " additional unemployment and " acceptable5 * inflation. This could result in a serious setback to attainment of our national goals The choice for key private decision makers is clear. It is a particularly critical choice as the economy after years of excessive slack and unemployment progresses toward full employment after enactment of the tax cut For several years now many observers including many leaders of the business and labor communities have been saying that we have solved the cost-push inflation problem that appeared in the mid-fifties to have become endemic This hopeful appraisal could not be demonstrated conclusively in a period when unemployment averaged percent. But given a combination of private and public efforts we will have the opportunity to prove it in and later years GOVERNMENT ACTIONS For its part the Government will be striving energetically to reinforce one of the most significant comparative advantages that the American economy has over nearly all other industrialized nations namely a tradition and an institutional structure that nurture vigorous internal competition In the period ahead the Administration plans actively to enforce the Nation 's antitrust laws in part choosing its cases and concentrating its enforcement energies so as to curb price-fixing and those proposed mergers and other business practices and structures that tend to make for anticompetitive enhancement of prices. Likewise it will resist proposals such as the revival of resale price maintenance now before the Congress in the so-called Quality Stabilization Bill that would inhibit price competition and reduce the competitive vitality of our marketing system. In its efforts to promote freer international trade the Government typically is not unmindful of the effects that import competition has on domestic American pricing practices And it will continue to promote and encourage vigorous price competition by United States exporters At the same time existing expanding and new labor market programs already enacted by the Congress or proposed by the Administration will help firms meet their labor needs without raising costs and prices. These programs will increase labor mobility provide opportunities for training and retraining and improve education at all levels The Government also will be making a determined and continuing effort as was pointed out in Chapter to promote what are by all odds the best anti-inflationary measures of all large and sustainable productivity improvements which allow both wages and profits to increase with stable prices. The pending tax bill will have a major effect of this kind through its lasting stimulus to investment Finally as the economy 's single largest buyer of goods and services the Federal Government will redouble its efforts in to get full value for each dollar it spends PRIVATE DECISIONS AND THE PRICE-WAGE GUIDEPOSTS Government policies can only provide an environment conducive to responsible private price and wage decision making. By choice our Government can advise inform and bring to bear the pressure of public opinion but it can not direct With so much at stake however the Government 's opportunity to advise and inform the public is one it must seize. In the Kennedy Administration general advice as to the pattern of private price-wage decision making that would take account of the public 's interest in avoiding market-power inflation was first formally set forth in the Economic Report of January The " guideposts " therein described and repeated in the Report offered standards by which union and business leaders themselves along with the general public could appraise particular wage and price decisions. They are restated here The guideposts contain two key propositions. The first the general guidepost for wages says that in a particular firm or industry the appropriate noninflationary standard for annual percentage increases in total employee compensation per man-hour ( not just in straight-time hourly rates ) is the annual increase in national trend output per man-hour. The standard is not the productivity trend in the particular firm or industry in question. Nor is it the particular year 's productivity change which can be influenced by short-run transitory factors The general guidepost for prices specifies that when an industry 's trend productivity is growing less rapidly than the national trend prices n8 can appropriately rise enough to accommodate the labor cost increases indicated by the general wage guidepost. Similarly in an industry whose trend productivity is growing more rapidly than the national average product prices should be lowered enough to distribute to the industry 's customers the labor-cost savings it would make under the general wage guidepost It should be emphasized that the general price guidepost does not counsel against price changes per se in a particular firm or industry. On the contrary it contemplates changes in specific prices downward in industries with high rates of productivity gain as well as upward in industries with lower-than-average productivity gains Adherence to these general guideposts not only would make for over-all price stability but would be generally consistent with the tendencies of competitive labor and product markets. The principles established by the guideposts do not imply that the entire gains from productivity improvement should go either to labor or to capital. Rather they suggest a proportionate sharing of average national productivity gains among labor capital and the other related factors of production throughout the economy The general guideposts can cover the vast majority of wage and price decisions but can not provide for all of the adjustments the economy requires especially over an extended period. Hence the guideposts as originally expounded in appropriately included a set of exceptions that reflected certain considerations of equity and resource allocation On the wage side it was suggested that exceptions might be made to adjust for labor supply conditions and for wages that are exceptionally high or low compared with the average for comparable work. Price exceptions took into consideration capital requirements nonlabor costs and profits based on excessive market power The original formulation of the guideposts in the January Report of the Council of Economic Advisers also noted that " Although output per man-hour rises mainly in response to improvements in the quantity and quality of capital goods with which employees are equipped employees are often able to improve their performance by means within their own control. It is obviously in the public interest that incentives be preserved which would reward employees for such efforts. " These modifications of the general guideposts still apply but it must be emphasized that they are intended to apply to only a relatively few cases Particularly at a time when our national capabilities for responsible price and wage making may undergo a more serious test than in recent years the most constructive private policy in the great majority of situations would be to arrive at price decisions and wage bargains consistent with the general guideposts Two other comments on the guideposts seem appropriate this year First it is not the purpose of these advisory policies permanently to freeze the labor and nonlabor shares of total industrial income as would a rigorous unrelieved application of the general guideposts. The Report noted lip that " The proportions in which labor and nonlabor income shares the product of industry have not been immutable throughout history " It went on to point out that bargaining over the shares is consistent with the guideposts if it is conducted " within the bounds of noninflationary price behavior. " Specifically this means that it is consistent with the guideposts for wage and profit shares to be bid up or down in a particular industry so long as price behavior in that industry remains consistent with the general price guidepost indicated above Second it is appropriate to focus special attention this year on price reductions. The guideposts call for reductions in those industries whose trend productivity gains exceed the national trend. It is fair to say that large industrial enterprises thus far have not widely heeded this advice. And yet as noted earlier there will be ample room for such price reductions in If they are not forthcoming over-all price stability will be rendered more difficult since price increases are likely in industries that are progressing at a less-than-average rate. Moreover in industries whose trend of productivity rises faster than the national average if wages conform more nearly to national than to industry productivity trends ( as the guideposts would have them do ) failure to follow the general price guide will cause profits to pile up. Such profits become highly visible to the public and constitute a lure for strongly intensified wage demands Such circumstances pose a most unattractive dilemma from the viewpoint of the public interest. On the one hand extra increases in wages or fringe benefits might tend to spread to other industries creating a general cost-push from the wage side. On the other hand there is no justification on either economic or equity grounds for distributing above-average gains in productivity exclusively through the profits channel. The real way out of this dilemma is for the firms involved to remove its cause by reducing prices CONCLUSION In a year of still ample unused resources and a year in which both after-tax profits and labor incomes promise to rise substantially there is no occasion for actions that result in substantial price increases. The public quite properly will be intolerant of any major businesses or unions whose short-sighted actions tend to set inflation in motion. To discharge its own responsibility the Administration is taking steps to follow emerging price and wage developments with great care and to assemble data that will illuminate the price- and wage-making situations in particular industries It will not hesitate to call public attention to major private decisions by either business or labor that seriously overstep noninflationary price and wage standards Certainly it is reasonable to hope however that such instances will be rare and that will be recorded as another year when American private price and wage makers demonstrated their capacity for responsible action Chapter The Balance of Payments and the International Monetary System A HE UNITED STATES occupies a unique position in the world economy. It provides the largest national source of exports the largest market for imports and the largest source of savings for investment abroad. It undertakes substantial military expenditures abroad and has a large foreign aid program. Its currency the dollar is widely used as a means of exchange in transactions among foreign countries as well as with the United States and as a store of value in foreign private balances and official monetary reserves. As a consequence U.S. economic policy at home and abroad has special importance to the rest of the world The diverse international transactions of the United States as trader as investor and as banker are summarized in the U.S. balance-of-payments accounts. In recent years the U.S. accounts have shown an undesirably large deficit while other countries especially in Continental Western Europe have had undesirably large surpluses. The first part of this chapter reviews recent developments in the U.S. balance of payments and discusses the policies notably those included in President Kennedy 's July message that have been adopted and have begun to improve our international financial position A declining U.S. payments deficit will affect the functioning of the international monetary system since this deficit has been a major source of growth in world monetary reserves. Moreover the large volume of outstanding short-term liabilities to foreigners if combined with continued large U.S. deficits could raise questions about the effective working and continued stability of the system. To examine this and related long-term questions the leading industrial countries have undertaken a study of the international monetary system. The problems with which that study is concerned are discussed in the second part of this chapter THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS : DEVELOPMENTS POLICIES AND OUTLOOK Between and the United States sold $ 2/ billion of gold and incurred $ * /2 billion in liquid liabilities to foreigners. These transfers of gold and dollars through payments deficits averaging $ billion a year made a welcome contribution to replenishing the international monetary reserves of other countries. Since however the annual deficits before taking into account special governmental transactions have been in the range of $ to $ billion and the additions to the dollar reserves of some surplus countries in Western Europe have tended to exceed the amounts that those countries regard as necessary or desirable In the years since U.S. gold sales have amounted to about $ * /2 billion of which $ billion occurred during the years and liquid dollar liabilities to foreigners have increased about $ ^ billion In these circumstances the United States has adopted policies designed to bring its external accounts into equilibrium to minimize its loss of gold and to protect the dollar from possible speculative attack. At the same time domestic policies designed to achieve high employment and more rapid economic growth have been framed with a view to reinforcing the specific balance-of-payments measures THE NATURE OF THE BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS PROBLEM The U.S. balance-of-payments problem does not reflect any over-all tendency for the United States to " live beyond its means. " Americans collectively do not spend more than their real incomes permit and therefore do not absorb goods and services on balance from the rest of the world On the contrary the United States earns a large surplus on commercial account that is its exports of goods and services exceed its imports. The deficit in its external accounts arises from the fact that the United States transfers abroad through military expenditures foreign assistance and private capital movements a sum of dollars larger than the surplus on goods and services. This excess of dollar payments measures the " deficit on regular transactions. " In recent years as discussed below the transfer of gold and liquid dollar balances abroad has been less than the deficit on regular transactions as the result of a number of special transactions undertaken in cooperation with European surplus countries The United States deficit does not reflect a reduction in net worth in relation to the rest of the world. In fact U.S. assets abroad in the form of private equity investment short- and long-term credits and government loans have in general been increasing faster than U.S. liabilities. The U.S deficit does reflect a loss of liquidity in the form of a reduction in gold reserves and a build-up of liquid liabilities to foreigners. This way of characterizing the imbalance in the U.S. payments position does not lessen the urgency of correcting it As it takes steps to restore equilibrium in its external accounts the United States must perforce be conscious of these major considerations : Its actions to correct the balance-of-payments problem need to be consistent with its domestic objectives ; a healthy domestic economy is important not only to Americans but also to the rest of the world The United States carries heavy responsibilities for the military security and the economic development of the countries of the free world. These responsibilities should not be compromised by measures taken to improve our payments position In adopting measures to cope with the balance of payments the United States should avoid any lapse in the effort in which other free world countries join to reduce barriers to international transactions Finally in formulating policies it must recognize that the several components of its balance of payments are interrelated. For example a reduction in capital outflows or foreign aid would reduce the deficit only to the extent that it did not also cause a fall in exports. Similarly a reduction ( or slower increase ) in imports would improve our payments position only to the extent that it did not cause other countries to buy less from us RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS Trade services and Government items. In recent years the surplus on commercial goods and services ( Table lines ) has shown a gradual upward trend if allowance is made for the temporary bulge in this surplus in when cyclical factors dampened the U.S. demand for imports. Commercial exports have risen at a moderate but fairly steady pace as rapid economic growth in Western Europe and Japan has provided expanding markets and our prices have remained relatively stable. At the same time dividends and interest on our investments and loans abroad1 have been a large and growing element in our surplus on goods and services Net U.S. military expenditures abroad although large have steadily declined ( line ) The Department of Defense has increased its procurement in the United States of supplies for use abroad despite the frequently higher cost of such procurement. In addition some U.S. allies have agreed to purchase military supplies from the United States offsetting all or part of U.S. dollar defense outlays within their borders The gross amount of U.S. Government economic aid programs has continued to be sizable but the dollar payments to foreigners and international institutions ( line ) resulting from these programs have been maintained at a much lower level. More than two-thirds of current outlays under the aid program of the Agency for International Development ( AID ) directly finance U.S. exports and thus result in no direct dollar outflows This proportion is over percent on new commitments. Export programs administered by the Department of Agriculture and loans by the ExportImport Bank involve no direct dollar outflow abroad O-64-9 TABLE United States balance of payments l [ Billions of dollars ] Line Type of transaction average II III Seasonally adjusted annual rates Regular transactions : Balance on commercial goods and services K Balance on commercial goods Commercial exports of goods Commercial imports of goods Investment income net Other commercial services net * Remittances and pensions Government items net Private long-term capital net U.S. direct investment Foreign long-term capital net New issues of foreign securities Transactions in outstanding securities net Other * Military expenditures net * Dollar payments to foreign countries and international institutions arising from Government grants and capital * __ Government grants and capital net Exports of goods and services financed by Government grants and capital Scheduled repayments on U.S. Government loans Unrecorded transactions Short-term private capital net- Balance on regular transactions Special government transactions Nonscheduled repayments of debt and advances on military exports Sale of special nonmarketable nonconvertible securities Sale of special nonmarketable convertible securities Balance after special Government transactions except convertible securities_ Balance after all special Government transactions- Balance after all special Government transactions ( not seasonally adjusted ) o Gold and convertible currencies Liquid liabilities to official and international holders Liquid liabilities to others US i Excludes military transfers under grants * Excludes exportsfinancedby Government grants and capital shown in line Military expenditures abroad less military sales The total includes lines and and a few other small balancing items Redemptions and other long-term items Less than $ million NOTE.

A large outflow of private long-term capital has been an important element in the balance-of-payments deficit ( line ) In the earlier postwar years through these long-term outflows fluctuated below $ billion a year. Between and they ranged above $ billion but exceeded $ billion only in In the first half of however the long-term capital flow swelled to an annual rate of nearly $ billion The upward shift in capital outflows in the mid-fifties was accounted for primarily by U.S. direct investment in countries producing raw materials More recently about half of U.S. direct investment has been in Western Europe in part because American firms have acquired production and trading facilities in the Common Market countries Portfolio investment abroad which had also increased after the mid1950 's began to surge higher in late As Table shows net purchases of new foreign securities by Americans increased from $ million in to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ billion in the first half of New issues of Canadian securities in the U.S. market accounted for much of the increased long-term capital outflow in the first half of But evidence was accumulating that a striking acceleration of European and Japanese borrowing was under way TABLE United States private portfolio investment abroad [ Millions of dollars ] Type and country of purchase I in II Seasonally adjusted annual rates Outstanding securities net ___ New securities Purchases of foreign securities Unadjusted annual rates Purchases of foreign securities Western Europe Japan Canada _ Other ( l ) > ) i Not available Source : Department of Commerce An increasing number of foreign borrowers had been taking advantage of the relatively low long-term interest rates the efficient flotation facilities and the ready availability of capital in our markets. At the same time American underwriters and investors had become increasingly willing to lend abroad. Canadian borrowers have used the U.S. market for a long time but European and Japanese borrowers have recently found more ready acceptance. In many instances these borrowings were not related to any financing of imports from the United States nor even to any particular need for foreign exchange. For example the proceeds of some substantial dollar bond issues have been used to finance the purchase of already existing domestic facilities in the borrowing countries Private short-term capital flows ( Table line ) have been more erratic in their effect on the payments balance. They increased abruptly in the latter half of I960 and though the flow decreased thereafter it remained large in and rose again in the second quarter of A substantial part of the recorded outflow in was a movement of funds into higher-yielding short-term investments abroad. Since that time monetary policy and debt management actions have been used to influence the level of short-term rates in the United States in order to bring yields on short-term assets here into closer alignment with those abroad U.S. bank loans and acceptance credits to foreigners appear to explain a greater proportion of changes in total recorded short-term flows than do movements of funds into and out of liquid assets abroad. In particular acceptance credits to Japan were large in and After the first quarter of short-term credits to foreigners by U.S. banks remained at a moderate level until the spring of when Japan again borrowed heavily At that time there was also a renewal of the flow of U.S. funds into money market assets and bank deposits abroad Unrecorded transactions ( line ) thought to contain a large element of Short-term capital also contributed to a sizable outflow in and but moved in opposite directions to the recorded short-term flows in The deficit before and after special transactions. The net outcome of the flows of funds related to exports imports Government outlays and private capital movements was a deficit on regular transactions ranging between $ and $ billion in recent years. This deficit contracted temporarily in owing to cyclical factors and increased again in late In the first half of as the result mainly of private capital outflows the deficit increased sharply to $ billion in the first quarter and $ billion in the second quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates The " balance on regular transactions " measures the outcome of our external transactions before taking account of special governmental transactions with some of the surplus countries. These special transactions have included prepayments on Marshall Plan and Export-Import Bank loans and advance payments by our allies for future delivery of military items Beginning in the fourth quarter of the Treasury arranged to sell special nonmarketable medium-term securities to foreign monetary authorities Some of these securities are denominated in dollars but most of them are denominated in the currency of the purchasing country. More recently a convertibility feature was added so that the foreign monetary authority may redeem them for short-term claims prior to their stated maturity. This pro- vision was intended to satisfy legal and traditional requirements governing the liquidity of the instruments that certain foreign central banks may hold as a component of their monetary reserves. The official balance-ofpayments statistics of the United States now present the balance-ofpayments position before and after inclusion of these special transactions ( lines ) POLICIES TO IMPROVE THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS President Kennedy 's balance-of-payments message in July announced certain new policies together with an intensification of other policies that had constituted the earlier balance-of-payments program of the United States The program before The Federal Government has given first priority to reducing its own direct contribution to the deficit. Thus efforts have been made to reduce and offset military outlays abroad to minimize the dollar drain associated with aid programs and in general to scrutinize all Federal transactions affecting the balance of payments The effort to improve the commercial balance on goods and services has included export promotion measures and a new program of export credit insurance and guarantees. The wage-price policies described in the previous chapter desirable in any event for domestic reasons have taken on additional urgency because of the necessity to maintain and improve the U.S. competitive position both at home and in other markets The Revenue Act of removed artificial tax inducements to investment in developed countries by effectively neutralizing the so-called " tax haven " form of operation The Federal Reserve and the Treasury have for some time been working to maintain a level of short-term interest rates high enough to discourage outflows of short-term capital while at the same time encouraging domestic credit availability and a level of long-term interest rates conducive to economic expansion These measures to reduce the deficit were complemented by a series of other arrangements designed to prevent or correct temporary disturbances in foreign exchange markets as described in the second part of this chapter These arrangements have been extremely helpful in stopping or smoothing the effects of sudden and presumably reversible flows of funds and in cushioning the impact of such potentially unsettling developments as the Berlin crisis the revaluation of the mark and guilder in the stockmarket break of the Cuban crisis and the assassination of President Kennedy Special government transactions and intergovernmental cooperation in stabilizing foreign exchange and gold markets have in addition to their other benefits provided major assistance in reducing incentives for the conversion of foreign-held dollar liabilities into gold. The gold outflow during the past three years has been cut to somewhat less than half of its total in the preceding three years Progress made in reducing the U.S. deficit during and the first half of aroused hopes that the U.S. payments problem was on its way toward solution. But the worsening of the deficit at the end of and the subsequent further deterioration during the first half of mainly as a result of enlarged short- and long-term capital outflows interrupted this progress and indicated that further actions were necessary The President 's July balance-of-payments program. After intensive discussion within the Government a series of new and expanded measures was taken in July to deal with the balance-of-payments problem On July the Federal Reserve announced an increase in the discount rate from to Zl/2 percent. The Federal Reserve also raised interest rate ceilings on time deposits payable in days to year as did the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation thus enabling U.S. commercial banks to compete more effectively with foreign banks for funds that might otherwise be placed abroad On July President Kennedy sent to the Congress a special message that announced a program of companion measures. These included : A proposal for the enactment of an Interest Equalization Tax ( IET ) to be made generally effective as of the day following the message. This measure an excise tax on American purchases of new or outstanding foreign stocks and bonds was designed to impose on foreign sellers the equivalent of percentage point of additional interest cost Further " tying " of foreign aid to U.S. exports to reduce the dollar outflow directly attributable to the program of the AID to $ million by fiscal year ( from $ billion in fiscal ) Important further reductions in overseas military expenditures to reduce the dollar drain on this account by approximately $ million A further reduction of $ million in purchases of strategic materials abroad and another $ million in other Government programs An intensified effort to expand exports a " See America Now " program to encourage both Americans and foreigners to travel in this country and a new effort to encourage foreigners to buy U.S. private securities An additional measure designed not to reduce the deficit but to lessen foreign purchases of gold and to strengthen the dollar in foreign exchange markets was a $ million U.S. stand-by drawing or line of credit from the International Monetary Fund ( I M F ) This became desirable because under its rules the IMF could no longer accept additional dollars from countries other than the United States. Thus other countries that wished to use some of their current dollar holdings for making repayments to the Fund were about to be forced instead either to buy gold from the United States or to sell dollars for other currencies in the foreign exchange markets in order to get means of repayment acceptable to the Fund. With the stand-by arrangement the United States is in a position to draw other currencies which it can sell for dollars to the countries needing them for repayment. This stand-by arrangement also has broader significance as X28 a visible indication that the United States is prepared to make appropriate use of the resources of the Fund The President emphasized in his message that this series of immediate and specialized efforts which would reduce the deficit by about $ billion when fully effective would provide the time needed for achievement of the basic long-term program of improving the U.S. competitive position and increasing the attractiveness of investment in the United States. The tax reduction bill and continuation of price-cost stability were essential aspects of the long-term program Meanwhile the immediate steps taken in July were designed to be consistent with acceleration of domestic economic expansion. Thus increases in interest rates were to be confined largely to the short-term sector of the market while the proposed IET would raise the cost of capital to foreign borrowers without increasing the domestic cost of long-term funds Achievement of equilibrum through expanding exports and increasing incentives for capital to remain at home will permit the United States gradually to remove the temporary measures it has been forced to apply in the past few years. The goal of the United States is to be able to untie its aid program just as it now urges other countries with payments surpluses to untie theirs. The IET was proposed to retard temporarily not permanently the outflow of U.S. capital. The stiffer " Buy American " policies for U.S. procurement adopted for balance-of-payments reasons can be relaxed when equilibrium is restored Developments subsequent to the July program. The balance-of-payments deficit on regular transactions dropped from a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ billion in the second quarter to $ billion in the third quarter a reduction of about two-thirds while the balance after special government transactions was even lower as a result mainly of advance debt repayments by France and the Netherlands It is of course too early to be able to evaluate the full effects of the July measures but they clearly played a major role in this marked improvement. There was a substantial reduction in the third quarter in the outflow of U.S. portfolio capital mainly in purchases of new issues of foreign securities. Virtually the only new foreign securities sold in the United States in the third quarter were those arranged for prior to July and hence not affected by the tax proposal The proposed IET legislation would not apply to borrowers in less developed countries and would allow limited or full exemption of new issues of particular countries if necessary to avoid imperiling the stability of the international monetary system. The Administration has announced its intention of allowing a new-issue exemption for Canada and believes that this can be done without adverse effects on the United States. In connection with this exemption Canadian authorities have agreed that it is not the intention of Canada to increase foreign exchange reserves through the proceeds of borrowing in the United States with the implication that borrowing would be restored to the more normal levels of earlier years Following passage of the proposed IET some portfolio capital will continue to flow abroad both to exempt nations and to borrowers willing to bear the tax. But total outflows are likely to continue to be sharply curtailed. The President 's message anticipated that this tax would remain in effect only through when improvement in the U.S. balance of payments and a strengthening and freeing of the capital markets of other major countries are expected to permit its abandonment A reversal in recorded short-term capital flows also contributed to the substantial reduction in the payments deficit in the third quarter. In part the shift reflected a cessation of the heavy lending in the form of bank loans and acceptance credits that had occurred in the preceding quarter. But following the increase in short-term interest rates rates on 3-month Treasury bills rose from percent on the average in June to percent in September there was a net movement of short-term funds back to the United States as reported by both banks and nonfinancial concerns At the same time the balance on commercial goods and services also continued to improve and contributed to the reduction in the deficit on regular transactions Preliminary information concerning the fourth quarter indicates that the deficit on regular transactions may have turned out to be of about the same order of magnitude as in the third quarter THE OUTLOOK FOR THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS The U.S. payments position can be expected to benefit from the proposed general reduction of individual and corporate income taxes as from the effects of the investment tax credit in the Revenue Act of and the depreciation changes of that year. Although accelerated economic expansion in the United States will bring a faster rise of imports an offsetting beneficial effect on capital flows and favorable effects on productivity and the competitiveness of U.S. exports may also be expected. Improved profit opportunities resulting from a more vigorous economy and fuller use of capacity should reduce the net outflow of capital by encouraging domestic investment by Americans and by attracting more foreign capital to the United States. While corporations will have an enlarged volume of retained earnings they will be confronted with an even greater increase in profitable domestic uses for funds Success in bringing U.S. external payments into equilibrium will also depend however on developments and policies abroad. Not only will sustained economic expansion in the leading industrial countries benefit their own citizens and the economies of the less developed countries but also it is important for the continuing expansion of U.S. exports The Brookings report. In the spring of a group of economists at the Brookings Institution undertook a comprehensive study The U.S Balance of Payments in at the request of the Council of Economic Ad- visers the Treasury and the Bureau of the Budget. The authors were asked to assess the effects on the U.S. balance of payments of a sustained expansion of the U.S. economy which after the unemployment rate was reduced to percent would proceed at an annual rate of percent and later accelerate to % percent a year. The Council provided the Brookings group with a set of initial assumptions regarding growth and prices in the United States and with guidance concerning the assumptions about Western Europe The group also calculated projections based on alternative assumptions of its own The Brookings group analyzed the relationships of changes in imports and exports to expansion in GNP given assumptions about costs and prices From these analyses projections were derived of the U.S. " basic balance " i.e. the balance on goods and services government items and long-term capital ( and exclusive of short-term capital flows unrecorded transactions and special government transactions ) in These projections indicated that the United States in would have a " basic " surplus ( $ billion ) on the initial assumptions or a modest deficit ( $ million ) on the alternative assumptions compared with the basic deficit of $ billion in A principal factor in the projected improvement in the U.S. payments balance was the assumption that the United States would be better able to maintain internal cost and price stability than the countries of Europe where slower growth of a fully employed labor force was expected to result in greater upward pressure on money wage rates As the previous chapter has indicated the recent cost and price record of the United States is quite good : wholesale prices have not increased since and this has undoubtedly helped to maintain our export surplus during the current expansion period despite a cyclical increase in imports. However the United States must continue to maintain price stability and to pursue other measures directed at improving the balance of payments Prices and costs in the United States and abroad. The international competitive position of any country is determined by many factors besides the movement of its prices relative to prices in other countries. But relative prices are of course an important influence. Chart presents the movements of prices and unit labor costs for a number of industrial countries after allowing for adjustments in exchange rates. The first panel shows that while the average of U.S. wholesale prices remained stable between and French and Canadian prices expressed in U.S. dollars were lower in than in ( both countries having undertaken exchange rate depreciations in the period ) But prices in all the other countries were higher ( in the case of Germany reflecting in part the exchange rate appreciation of ) The picture presented by relative changes in wholesale prices is supplemented in the lower panel by a comparison of movements in labor costs per unit of output in manufacturing ( again adjusted for exchange rate varia- Chart Comparative Prices and Unit Labor Costs SEVEN INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES ^ INDEX = GERMANY WHOLESALE PRICES / UNITED KINGDOM ITALY JAPAN UNITED STATES CANADA FRANCE I I GERMANY UNIT LABOR COSTS / UNITED KINGDOM JAPAN UNITED STATES ITALY CANADA FRANCE _L i/ADJUSTED FOR EXCHANGE RATE VARIATIONS : FRANCE ( ) GERMANY ( ) AND CANADA I/PRODUCER PRICES FOR INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS IN UNITED KINGDOM i / R A T I O OF WAGES SALARIES AND SUPPLEMENTS TO PRODUCTION.

Not all goods enter into foreign trade and prices and costs of those important for trade may move quite differently from the over-all average ( as shown in Table Chapter ) Yet prices and costs of domestically produced import-competing commodities are likely to be closely related to the general indexes and the competitive position of exports is unlikely to resist for very long the basic economic forces at work in any economy Policies to curb inflation abroad. As was pointed out in Chapter European policies are being adapted to counteract upward price pressures. The United States has no reason to expect surplus countries to accept inflation just as they have no reason to expect the United States to accept unemployment and unused capacity because of its payments deficit In dealing with these domestic problems the countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) have been striving to develop general principles of cooperative behavior for surplus and deficit countries as described in the second part of this chapter. All countries should be aware of the undesirability of initiating a chain of competitive upward movements in interest rates such as would occur if surplus countries in their efforts to stop advancing prices took monetary actions that attracted large amounts of capital from deficit countries Trade policies. Relative costs and prices will play an even more significant role in the pattern of world commerce if negotiations under the Trade Expansion Act of now about to enter the formal stage are successful in reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade. This is a major objective of U.S. policy for a host of reasons both political and economic. One significant outcome of successful negotiations would be to prevent an increase in discrimination against both agricultural and nonagricultural imports by the European Economic Community as intra-Community trade barriers continue to come down More broadly there is much to be gained by both industrial and developing countries from a progressive reduction not only in tariffs but in other barriers to international trade. The United States has a strong interest in a lowering of such barriers quite apart from balance-of-payments considerations THE FUTURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM The leading industrial countries known as the " Group of Ten " agreed in October to undertake a study of the international monetary system the set of mutual understandings commitments and institutional arrangements under which international trade and payments are now conducted. A communique was issued on October by the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the countries : Belgium Canada France Germany Italy Japan the Netherlands Sweden the United Kingdom and the United States. It stated in part : In reviewing the longer-run prospects the Ministers and Governors agreed that the underlying structure of the present monetary system based on fixed exchange rates and the established price of gold has proven its value as the foundation for present and future arrangements. It appeared to them however to be useful to undertake a thorough examination of the outlook for the functioning of the international monetary system and of its probable future needs for liquidity. This examination should be made with particular emphasis on the possible magnitude and nature of the future needs for reserves and for supplementary credit facilities which may arise within the framework of national economic policies effectively aiming at the objectives of [ high levels of economic activity with a sustainable rate of economic growth and in a climate of price stability ] The studies should also appraise and evaluate various possibilities for covering such needs This examination and a similar study by the International Monetary Fund necessarily involves a careful appraisal of how well the existing system advances the basic economic objectives shared by the participating countries. How and how effectively do present arrangements operate to minimize imbalances in international payments and to finance those that inevitably arise ? How resistant is the system to shocks arising from unexpected political or economic events ? Can it support a steady increase in world trade and production ? The Group of Ten and the IMF will attempt to answer questions like these and review various proposals for modifying the international monetary system It would be neither appropriate nor fruitful to try to anticipate here the outcome of the studies now under way. But this section of the Report does provide a background to these studies by ( ) suggesting the basic economic objectives to be served by the international monetary system ( ) describing briefly the international monetary system as it evolved at Bretton Woods and has been strengthened more recently ( ) discussing some of the actual or potential shortcomings of the existing system and ( ) summarizing some of the proposals for its modification ranging from a further strengthening of existing arrangements to a major overhaul These discussions in the Group of Ten will focus on relationships among the leading industrial countries. These are the countries that hold most of the world 's reserves and whose payments problems can be serious enough to have a significant impact on the functioning of the whole international monetary machinery. But this does not mean that the rest of the world is unaffected by these monetary arrangements. On the contrary the less developed countries have a vital stake in a monetary system that fosters steady growth in world trade and payments OBJECTIVES TO BE SERVED A properly functioning international payments system like any monetary or financial arrangement must be judged by its contribution to the basic economic objectives shared by all countries. These include : ( ) full employment ( ) a satisfactory rate of economic growth ( ) mutually beneficial trade that reflects and contributes to efficient international allocation of resources through freedom of international transactions and ( ) reasonable stability of prices In a world economy where technology is advancing living standards are rising and tastes are subject to change and from which the business cycle has not been banished it is inevitable that the external accounts of individual countries will from time to time develop surpluses and deficits of varying size and duration. If the monetary reserves available to finance these imbalances are too small or the credit facilities too limited deficit countries may have to adopt monetary fiscal and. trade policies that depress economic activity both in their own economies and elsewhere. On the other hand if the funds available to finance imbalances are too large deficit countries may make excessive claims on and may even impose inflationary pressures on their trading partners when instead they should be adopting policies to restore equilibrium in their payments balances Along with the inevitable swings in payments positions there are occasional economic and political shocks to which the international system is subject. Unless it is able to adjust smoothly to such disturbances the resulting instability in foreign exchange markets is likely to disrupt the normal flow of trade and payments What is sought ideally is an international monetary system that facilitates attainment of all the economic objectives listed above imposing neither inflation nor deflation encouraging freedom of international transactions and not giving way to disruptive instability when subjected to shock Discipline to correct imbalances whether surpluses or deficits is necessary ; but that discipline should exert its influence toward adoption of policies that expand rather than restrict real income emancipate rather than shackle international trade encourage rather than impede the flow of productive capital THE PRESENT SYSTEM Present international monetary arrangements have resulted partly from design and partly from the unplanned evolution of private and official practices in international trade and payments. The basic principles governing the existing international monetary system laid down some years ago at the Bretton Woods Conference call for the elimination of direct controls over foreign exchange transactions and consequently free convertibility of one currency into another at exchange rates that fluctuate not more than percent in either direction from declared parities. These exchange-rate parities are subject to adjustment only at times of " fundamental disequilibrium " in the international payments positions of individual countries International reserves. Countries need international monetary reserves to support the market value of their currencies within percent of parity More broadly they need reserves to meet possible shortfalls between receipts and payments that may arise for a variety of reasons and may persist over periods ranging from one season to several years. These reserves are held in the form of gold and foreign exchange ( other national currencies ) Actually only two national currencies the dollar and the pound sterling serve to an important extent as monetary reserves for other countries. And of these two in recent years the dollar has been the principal reserve currency A reserve currency country acts in effect as a banker to other countries Foreign-held short-term claims denominated in dollars liabilities of the United States Government or U.S. financial institutions constitute international money. Dollars and sterling are used as an international medium of exchange much of world trade is transacted in these currencies and as a store of value for balances of foreign monetary authorities and foreign private institutions businesses and individuals In addition the dollar plays a unique role as the currency unifying foreign exchange markets. Other countries including the United Kingdom maintain their exchange rates within percent of their declared par values as required by the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund by buying or selling dollars in exchange for their own currencies. The United States while it also chooses on occasion to buy and sell foreign currencies for this purpose meets its basic commitment to maintain the value of the dollar in world markets by undertaking to buy gold from or sell it to foreign monetary authorities at a fixed price $ an ounce The reserve currency system linked to gold through the dollar was not created by a specific agreement. Rather it evolved from the use first of sterling then of the dollar as important trading currencies ; as currencies in which short- and long-term loans could be arranged ; and as universally acceptable currencies in which reserves could be safely conveniently and profitably invested by both private and official holders Its pre-eminence as an industrial country and the strength of its financial structure make the United States attractive to other countries as a place in which to hold liquid balances and hence account for its role as banker to the rest of the world. But this countiy also engages in wide-ranging activities as a trader and investor and is responsible for much of the free world 's economic and military assistance programs. Its transactions with the rest of the world represent a commingling of its trading investing and foreign assistance activities with its banking activities Just as the successful operation of a bank depends on the continuing confidence of depositors that their claims on the bank will be freely usable and will not lose their value the viability of the present reserve currency system depends on the confidence of foreign holders both official and private that their dollar claims will not lose value for any type of use Everyone agrees that a bank must be subject to special limitations and disciplines for the protection of its depositors and indeed of the whole community. Similarly the system that makes the United States an interna- tional bank imposes special responsibilities. Unless this country pursues policies that encourage confidence in the continued stability of the dollar the entire international monetary system will become vulnerable to instability or even breakdown. This responsibility imposes limits on the policies both domestic and international that the United States as a reserve currency country may pursue. It is equally clear however that other countries in. their own self-interest share this responsibility for maintaining a viable international payments system When the United States has a deficit in its balance of payments the corresponding surpluses of other countries accrue largely in their official holdings of dollars usually in the form of deposits in United States banks or holdings of United States Government securities. To the extent that other countries continue to hold these liquid dollar assets instead of using them to purchase gold from the United States total world reserves are larger. If instead they buy gold U.S. reserves go down by the amount that the reserves of others rise Just as a deficit in the United States balance of payments may expand world reserves a surplus in its balance of payments may reduce them. This would happen to the extent that countries with deficits ( corresponding to the U.S. surplus ) financed them by drawing down their holdings of dollar assets. This would reduce their reserves without expanding those of the United States. If on the other hand deficit countries sold gold to the U.S. total world reserves would not be diminished although there would of course be a shift of reserves from the rest of the world to this country And if we were to accumulate the currencies of deficit countries as part of our reserves a U.S. surplus would not contract total world reserves but rather would expand them. Such a development would in effect convert other currencies into a limited form of reserve currency It should also be noted that under the existing system the volume of world reserves can be affected by shifts in surpluses and deficits among other countries even though the U.S. balance-of-payments position remains unchanged. Other countries hold differing proportions of gold and dollars in their official monetary reserves. If a country that holds a relatively high proportion of its reserves in dollars has a deficit and transfers dollars to a surplus country whose practice is to hold relatively fewer dollars and more gold the second country is likely to use a good part of its dollar accruals to buy gold from the United States. The result is a reduction in world monetary reserves for the United States loses gold without gaining other reserves and the total reserves of the rest of the world remain unchanged Role of the IMF. The International Monetary Fund stands at the center of the present international system as a source of financing for temporary balance-of-payments deficits and as an influence toward freer international transactions The Fund 's resources are derived from subscriptions equal in each case to the " quota " assigned to the member country. These subscriptions were paid in most cases one-fourth in gold and three-fourths in the member country 's own currency. The total resources of the Fund amount to $ billion including $ billion in gold $ billion in dollars and $ billion in the currencies of other members of the Group of Ten The amount that each member can borrow from the IMF is related to its quota the first percent of which ( the so-called " gold tranche " ) can be used virtually on demand. Under present Fund policies further borrowing is increasingly conditional upon adoption by the member country of policies to eliminate the causes of the deficit. The total amount of Fund drawings that can be outstanding at any one time is considerably less than the total of its resources. This is so because if the IMF is to make a net contribution to financing imbalances the funds it makes available must ordinarily be in the currencies of surplus countries. As a supplement to the Fund 's regular resources there is a special arrangement under which the Group of Ten countries including the United States have agreed to lend up to $ billion of added resources to the Fund in case of need Additional bulwarks. The reserve currency system has been buttressed in other ways in recent years. These arrangements like the special IMF borrowing agreement represent cooperative action by governments and central banks to make the system less vulnerable to instability resulting from speculative activity in foreign exchange and gold markets Central banks of many of the leading industrial countries ^ have cooperated with the Federal Reserve System in the past years in developing currency " swap arrangements " which provide for reciprocal deposit balances to be drawn as needed to help stabilize foreign exchange markets. The U.S Treasury also in cooperation with foreign monetary authorities has engaged in both spot and forward exchange operations for the same purposes. An informal pooling arrangement has succeeded in reducing the destabilizing effect of speculative activity in the London gold market. A number of the central banks that are membrs of the Bank for International Settlements have entered into special ad hoc lending arrangements to help each other at times of special need As was mentioned earlier cooperation has likewise been strongly evident in the willingness of various European surplus countries to prepay debts to the United States to purchase and make advance payments for military supplies and to buy special nonmarketable medium-term securities from the U.S. Treasury ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SHORTCOMINGS OF THE SYSTEM Within the framework described above the world economy has enjoyed impressive growth in the postwar era and international trade has flourished Nevertheless private and official observers of the international mone- tary system have raised questions concerning : ( ) the weaknesses in the existing adjustment process for restoring balance-of-payments equilibrium ( ) the potential instability associated with the large and growing volume of short-term claims against the United States and ( ) the means of providing for long-term growth of world reserves Weaknesses in the adjustment process * Under the textbook version of the 19th century gold standard a country in deficit would lose gold to a surplus country and an automatic process of adjustment would begin. The gold-losing country would experience contraction of its domestic money supply rising interest rates and falling money incomes and prices ( coupled possibly with falling output and employment ) The gold-gaining country would experience the opposite changes. The result would be a correction of the balance-of-payments disequilibrium through a change in relative prices of and in demands for the two countries ' imports. This automatic adjustment in trade might be abetted and quickened by movements of capital in response largely to interest rate differentials from the surplus to the deficit country In this idealized and perhaps partly imagined system involving a smooth and quick correction of imbalances the flow of gold from deficit to surplus country served two functions : ( ) it set in motion the process of adjustment and meanwhile ( ) it financed the imbalance The present international system resembles the textbook gold standard in one important respect : exchange rates are fixed within a narrow margin But other conditions are very different. Domestic credit conditions in most countries today are to some degree independent of the volume of international monetary reserves. Prices and wages tend to resist downward movement. And most countries pursue domestic policies aimed at full employment and price stability This means that internal deflation in deficit countries is not an acceptable means of reducing imports and making exports more competitive. By the same token surplus countries are understandably unwilling to accept inflation as a means of restoring balance in their external accounts While the Articles of Agreement of the IMF permit exchange-rate adjustment in case of a " fundamental disequilibrium " an imbalance that is chronic and intractable at the existing exchange rate most countries are reluctant to take this step. For a reserve currency country this alternative is not available. For other major industrial countries even occasional recourse to such adjustments would induce serious speculative capital movements thereby accentuating imbalances What then is the adjustment mechanism under modern conditions ? Policies called for by a country 's domestic situation frequently may also help to correct an imbalance in its external accounts. If a country is suffering from excessive total demand for its domestic output and also has a deficit in its balance of payments a combination of ills that has frequently been encountered restrictive fiscal and monetary policies * O-64-10 are appropriate. If successfully applied they serve to reduce excessive domestic demand and this effect in itself tends to reduce imports and encourage exports. In addition stopping domestic inflation will at least prevent the country 's competitive position from worsening further. Moreover restrictive monetary policy and higher interest rates tend to attract interest-sensitive capital from other countries and to discourage domestic capital from moving abroad Similarly there is no conflict between internal and external objectives in the case of a country experiencing deficient demand at home but a surplus in its balance of payments. Here the application of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies helps to restore full use of domestic resources and tends to increase imports relative to exports. This mix of policies also encourages interest-sensitive capital to move abroad It is not these combinations of internal and external problems that raise questions about the adequacy of the adjustment process in today 's world. Rather it is the less tractable combinations such as a deficiency of demand at home and a deficit in the balance of payments which the United States has faced in recent years or excess demand internally along with a surplus in the external accounts which some European countries have been experiencing Conventional notions as to policies for adjustment contain a clear bias toward imposing greater pressure on deficit countries to adopt restrictive fiscal and monetary policies than on surplus countries to adopt expansionary policies. This bias results in part from the simple fact that the lower limit to which a deficit country 's reserves can ultimately fall ( zero ) is more definite and compelling than the upper limit to which a surplus country 's reserves can rise. To be sure the availability of IMF and other credit may extend the period during which a deficit can be sustained but such borrowing brings with it added pressures for correction of the deficit Related to this asymmetry is the fact that a balance-of-payments deficit is often regarded as an indication of " profligacy " in view of the traditional association of deficits with domestic inflation which requires the imposition of discipline on deficit countries. There is no disciplinary counterpart for surplus countries. To some extent this conventional view is institutionalized in the IMF whose long-standing policies require increasingly vigorous corrective measures by deficit countries as their drawings from the Fund increase beyond the first ( gold ) tranche. Fund policies do not place a corresponding emphasis on the need for adjustment by surplus countries The stability of liquid dollar claims. As was indicated at the beginning oi this chapter the United States has had payments deficits since Until the late 's however most countries were anxious to enlarge their dollar holdings and welcomed our modest deficits. But after U.S. deficits were larger ; and with a smaller appetite for dollar holdings many foreign countries converted a higher proportion of their dollar accruals into gold. Even so foreign dollar balances have increased by about $ billion since Foreign central banks and governments held $ billion of short-term dollar claims at the end of and $ 12J4 billion in late ; foreign banks businesses and individuals held $ billion in December and $ billion in late Over the same period the U.S. gold reserve fell by $ / billion from $ billion to $ 15/ billion The expanding total of liquid dollar claims set against a declining gold stock is sometimes viewed as a potential source of instability for the reserve currency system. This is based on the possibility of a convergence of demands by foreign monetary authorities for conversion of dollar balances into gold. The more intractable the U.S. balance-of-payments deficit appeared to be the less remote such a threat might be considered. Conversely evidence of U.S. progress toward balance-of-payments equilibrium mitigates such destabilizing fears Potential instability is regarded by some observers as inherent in a reserve currency system or indeed in any fractional reserve system in which credit claims convertible into gold are an important element. It is characteristic of such a system that growing needs for international monetary reserves can not be met solely from gold becoming available for monetary use. In fact many observers believe that the currency or credit component of reserves must rise relative to gold holdings. In these circumstances the system will always be subject to the possibility of instability when for one reason or another private or official holders of a reserve asset become uneasy As was described earlier international cooperation has led to the development in recent years of a series of measures designed to reduce these dangers But the risks of instability have not been wholly eliminated Provision for growth of reserves. The total of official reserves held by the industrial countries is generally regarded as adequate at the present time. The question is whether the present system for creating reserves will be able to function so as to meet future requirements It is clearly impossible to devise an exact criterion for determining the world 's needs for reserves in the years ahead. This need will depend on at least three factors : ( a ) the strength of the forces creating potential imbalances ( b ) the effectiveness of the adjustment process which tends to limit and correct these imbalances and ( c ) the availability of credit supplements to official reserves It is an objective of the nations of the free world that trade and capital movements should be increasingly freed from restrictions. Yet for a number of reasons increased freedom of international transactions is likely to make each country 's balance of payments more sensitive than before to changes in economic conditions within its own borders and outside The extent to which tendencies toward imbalance actually create large or prolonged deficits depends of course on the speed and effectiveness of the processes of adjustment. If the existing adjustment mechanisms are slow-acting larger reserves will be needed ; if they can be made quick and effective while consistent with the basic objectives of growth stability and unrestricted trade smaller reserves will suffice. Of course there is an interaction among the supply of reserves the adjustment process and the size of swings in payments balances. For example if reserves are too large countries may not have to pay much attention to current changes in their payments balances and they may avoid or delay the adjustments needed to restore equilibrium Similarly the availability and dependability of credit sources to supplement " owned " reserves influence countries ' views as to the volume of reserves they need as well as the extent to which they feel compelled to take prompt action against forces tending to disturb payments equilibrium Given the existing adjustment mechanisms and the priorities of economic policy in most countries the supply of reserves and credit facilities will have to be prepared to cope with substantial future imbalances In the years since World War II the growth of world reserves has had two major sources : ( ) a growth of monetary gold stocks and ( ) deficits in the U.S. balance of payments. In the future gold can be expected to provide for only a part of the needed growth in world reserves as it has in the past. In the decade from through monetary gold reserves of all countries increased by about $ 5/2 billion or by less than percent of total monetary reserves at the end of whereas over the same period world trade as measured by total imports increased by nearly percent During this decade the total gold and foreign exchange reserves of the rest of the world increased by about $ billion or nearly percent. But about two-fifths of this growth represented a transfer abroad of U.S. gold a process which can not continue indefinitely to provide a source of reserve growth for the rest of the world The net outflow of dollars from the United States has been a major source of growth in world reserves over the past decade. But reliance on this method of increasing reserves creates a dilemma. U.S. deficits are accompanied by a growth of dollar liabilities relative to the gold stock increasing the dangers of instability referred to earlier ; yet when the U.S deficit is eliminated or gives way to a surplus world reserves will probably rise too slowly ( or even contract ) under existing monetary arrangements For these reasons a range of proposals has been put forward for modifying the existing method of generating monetary reserves PROPOSALS FOR STRENGTHENING OR CHANGING EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS Recognition of the problems discussed in the previous sections of this chapter has stimulated a wide range of suggestions for change. They vary from a careful building on the existing system through a series of innovations and supplements to a rather complete revision of the whole system The proposals which have stimulated discussion on both sides of the Atlantic differ in many respects. The differences arise in part from varying diagnoses of the nature of present problems in part from differing degrees of preoccupation with the current U.S. situation as against a future situation in which our deficits will have disappeared. They also reflect divergences in relative values placed on the several objectives of policy Most of the suggestions brought forward for strengthening or revising the international payments system are aimed at one or more of the following purposes : improving the balance-of-payments adjustment process reducing the dangers of instability in the system and providing a satisfactory means for increasing international liquidity. This section first indicates some of the possibilities for correcting payments imbalances more effectively by supplementing those built-in adjustment tendencies that now exist. It then describes a range of proposals from a strengthening of the existing system to a major overhaul that deal with potential instability and future growth of reserves Improvements in the adjustment process. Recent experience and discussion indicate that it is possible to devise combinations of policies that simultaneously promote domestic and international objectives without imposing undue pressures toward contraction in the world economy Two major approaches merit attention : ( ) changes in the mix of fiscal and monetary policies and ( ) acceleration by surplus countries of movements to relax barriers to international trade and payments As was pointed out above there is no conflict between internal and external objectives if a country is subject to inflationary pressures at home and has a balance-of-payments deficit or if it has unemployed resources at home and a payments surplus. It is the other combinations that pose particularly difficult policy problems In a world of relatively free capital movements flexible changes in the mix of fiscal and monetary policies can serve to reconcile internal and external policy goals. In using this approach a deficit country with unemployment and idle capacity would be advised to emphasize expansionary fiscal policy to deal with its domestic demand problem while pursuing a relatively restrictive monetary policy to deal with its balance-of-payments problem particularly by affecting capital movements. This it will be recognized is similar to the policy prescription that the United States has been trying to apply a large tax reduction program to spur domestic expansion and a monetary policy in the past two or three years that calls for interest rates in some sectors of the market that are relatively high for a period of inadequate domestic investment. The United States has also used its monetary and debt management policies to influence the maturity structure of interest rates so as to raise short-term rates while moderating the upward pressure on long-term rates For the surplus country with excess demand at home the opposite policy mix is called for : restrictive fiscal policy and relatively easy monetary policy Here the fiscal policy would tend to reduce internal inflationary pressures while the monetary policy would discourage capital inflow and encourage capital outflow It is clear that if changes in the mix of fiscal and monetary policies are to serve in this way to facilitate both correction of payments disequilibrium and pursuit of domestic goals of full employment and price stability fiscal policies must become more flexible. But this is desirable in any case for dealing with problems of internal stabilization A second although self-limiting means of adjustment involves the relaxation of restrictions on trade and capital movements by surplus countries. The removal of quantitative restrictions reductions of tariffs and freeing of capital flows is a continuing objective of the countries of the free world. Constant efforts in these directions can be seen in the activities of the IMF the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) A country prepared to relax a trade or payments restriction should not postpone that action. On the other hand countries with persistent balanceof-payments surpluses might well be encouraged to accelerate removal of barriers to both current and capital transactions including unilateral ( even if temporary ) tariff reductions. This would contribute both to a reduction in the external surplus and to an amelioration in the pressure of excess demand at home. While a permanent relaxation of restrictions is preferable even a temporary suspension of trade or capital account impediments may be helpful as a means of adjustment. A recent example is the inclusion of selected temporary tariff reductions in the French stabilization program There is not a corresponding acceptable prescription for deficit countries that are suffering from deficient demand at home. Clearly it would be undesirable for a tightening of trade restrictions or an increase in tariffs to become part of the accepted means of adjustment. When a choice must be made among undesirable alternatives measures to retard the rate of capital flow from deficit countries are preferable in terms of effects on resource allocation to moves away from freedom of current account transactions. The proposed temporary interest equalization tax in the United States is an example of such a step It may be that still other adjustment policies can be found for reconciling international and domestic goals. In this regard the OECD and its various committees and working parties will no doubt continue to play an important role. The success of these bodies in working to harmonize policies and prevent a deflationary bias in the adjustment process stands out as a significant achievement of the past few years Strengthening the existing reserve currency system. Most proposals for improvement of international monetary arrangements whatever their form and whether moderate or drastic deal both with the problem of stability and with the adequacy of the means for providing reserves. One approach emphasizing the evolution that has been taking place in the present system in the past few years seeks to build on and strengthen this system through further gradual changes As for the problem of stability of the reserve currencies this approach points to the success that has been achieved in stopping and reversing destabilizing speculative activity through the use of " swap " and other cooperative arrangements among central banks. With the special borrowing arrangement the IMF can now provide up to $ billion of additional financing to meet any speculative run on the dollar. These arrangements could presumably be further strengthened and enlarged if the need should arise in the future This approach also includes the possible further development of sales by the United States of special nonmarketable securities to surplus countries These sales initiated recently provide a way of consolidating short-term dollar holdings that may be considered excessive. When denominated in the currency of the country that purchases them ( if this is mutually desired ) these securities provide an exchange guarantee. Such securities can also provide the holder with easily available resources when its surplus turns into a deficit Another element in this approach involves the recognition that there is already a mechanism whereby U.S. surpluses need not reduce the reserves of other countries. The United States can acquire the currencies of industrial countries that have deficits thus preventing a decline in the reserves of other countries as U.S. reserves increase. This practice has been initiated on a small and exploratory scale over the past few months The United States has acquired Italian lire in effect reciprocating in part an earlier Italian purchase of medium-term U.S. securities that was made when Italy was in surplus. In fact regardless of whether the United States has a deficit a balance or a surplus it could acquire the currencies of other industrial countries with their agreement thus providing additional liquid dollar balances to those countries and to the system as a whole Such amendments to the present reserve currency system begin to break the automatic link between changes in the balance of payments of a reserve currency country and changes in the liquid monetary reserves of the rest of the world This general approach recognizes that the ratio of gold to currency holdings in world monetary reserves will continue to decline but does not view this as involving increasing instability. Rather it rests on the belief that so long as excessive and prolonged U.S. deficits are avoided increasingly close cooperation among the leading countries and the growing availability of reciprocal credit facilities both within or outside the IMF can maintain confidence in the currency element of monetary reserves and permit their expansion as needed Overhauling the existing system. Some proposals for more drastic changes in monetary arrangements are aimed mainly at reducing the potential for instability and others are aimed mainly at improving the mechanism for generating reserves. But most of them contain elements that would achieve both purposes. The plans are here sketched only very briefly and no effort is made to deal with the problems that their implementation might involve The plans that focus largely on lessening potential instability propose to eliminate the possibility of disruptive and self-defeating efforts to convert non-gold reserve assets into gold by establishing a fixed ratio of gold in each country 's total reserves ( a ratio subject to change by general agreement ) Some of these plans would also create a new type of reserve unit that would partly or wholly replace national currencies in reserves A proposal put forward by Professor S. Posthuma of the Netherlands Bank would require that each member country of the Group of Ten agree to hold a fixed proportion of its monetary reserves in the form of gold. The remainder would be in the currencies of the other members and these official holdings would receive reciprocal exchange guarantees. Once the proposal had been put into effect countries would finance deficits by reducing gold and foreign exchange holdings proportionately so as to maintain the agreed ratio with similar provisions for countries gaining reserves This proposal would after a period of time effectively increase the number of reserve currencies since each country including the United States and the United Kingdom would hold the currencies of the others. Thus the system would permit growth in reserves independently of individual deficits and surpluses so long as gold reserves were increasing. This system could be further adapted to the need for additional growth of reserves through agreed reductions in the fixed ratio between gold and foreign exchange holdings A somewhat similar approach suggested by Dr. E. M. Bernstein is also designed to enhance international monetary stability. This proposal would establish a " reserve unit " as a generalized liability of the IMF. The major industrial countries would pay over to the IMF a quantity of their own currencies in exchange for such reserve units and would undertake to hold reserve units in an agreed proportion ultimately one-half of their gold reserves. This composite reserve unit would in time come to replace the reserve currencies. This plan too could be adapted to growth needs by adjusting from time to time the fixed relationship between reserve units and gold A number of proposals would increase international reserves and credit availability by making IMF resources more readily usable by member countries. Any such change in Fund practices would increase international credit availability. To the extent that member countries came to regard a larger proportion of their maximum potential drawing rights at the Fund as freely available the effect would be equivalent to an increase in " owned " reserves Such proposals for greater and perhaps less conditional use of Fund resources are usually accompanied by a plea for a change in member country attitudes toward reliance on the IMF. Instead of regarding the Fund as a lender of last resort member countries especially industrial countries holding substantial amounts of reserves would be encouraged to draw regularly on the Fund as a complement to the use of their owned reserves in financing a part of any deficits While these proposals aim at using the IMF more intensively they are frequently accompanied by suggestions for regular increases in Fund quotas to provide for needed expansion in liquidity over time. Such increases could be negotiated periodically or agreement might be reached on a regular automatic expansion of quotas Another approach to increasing the volume of reserves is the proposal for a " mutual currency account " to be administered by the IMF. This proposal provides that the industrial countries form an arrangement under which a surplus country could deposit the currency of a deficit country in the mutual currency account. This facility would encourage the provision of financing to the deficit country though definite limits would be established and would give the surplus country a claim against the mutual currency account which would receive the usual IMF gold-value guarantee against exchange risks. Once established such claims would become a new form of reserve usable under certain conditions by their holders when they in turn find themselves in deficit Perhaps the most far-reaching of the many plans that have been widely discussed that of Professor Robert Triffin of Yale aims to replace the present system so that reserve creation will no longer depend on additions to the stock of monetary gold and to claims on reserve currency countries Instead it proposes to place in the hands of an international institution ( a reconstituted IMF ) the power to regulate the creation of international monetary reserves. Under this proposal reserve currencies would be replaced by new claims on the expanded IMF and these claims would be transferred from deficit to surplus countries in settlement of imbalances The new institution would be empowered to make loans to members by creating additional claims on itself as does a bank. And as in the case of bank loans the member 's policies would be scrutinized by the lending institution. In addition the new IMF could expand reserves at its own volition or on some predetermined basis by purchasing government securities of its members with their agreement paying for these securities by creating deposits ( claims against itself ) Such loans and " open market operations " would be used to expand world reserves at an appropriate rate This proposal like others related to it takes inspiration from the historical development of central banking within individual countries. Recognizing that " money does not manage itself " individual countries have established centralized instititions that now regulate the aggregate creation of new money regardless of the size of deficits of individual borrowers. Whether such a development would also be desirable practicable and acceptable internationally and if so when is understandably the subject of considerable controversy CONCLUDING COMMENTS Without trying to anticipate the outcome of the studies now in process it is possible to state some general propositions that follow from the preceding discussion : International monetary arrangements are not an end in themselves but a means of fostering a steadily growing world economy in which freedom of international transactions contributes to rising living standards and price stability helps to assure equitable distribution of the fruits of economic growth If it is to serve these purposes the international monetary system should provide both leeway and discipline : ( a ) It should encourage adjustment of imbalances by both deficit and surplus countries in ways that avoid imparting either a deflationary or an inflationary bias to the world economy and it should encourage greater rather than less freedom of international transactions ( b ) It should reduce or eliminate the potential for disruptive and speculative conversions of foreign exchange reserves into gold. And ( c ) it should make financial resources available in a volume and under conditions adequate to finance imbalances consistently with these objectives In evaluating specific plans that are put forward for modification or reform of the existing system it is important not to confuse form with substance. Any plan regardless of its outward trappings can be adapted so as to become too restrictive or too inflationary. Whatever the outcome of the present studies it must be recognized that for any monetary arrangement to function successfully it is essential that there be an increasing degree of mutual understanding cooperation and responsibility among the countries whose reserve holdings and reserve needs account for the bulk of the problem of international liquidity Chapter U.S. Assistance of Economic Development Overseas UCH OF THE WORLD in which the United States conducts its economic affairs consists of poor countries now urgently striving to modernize and develop their economic systems. Our economic relations with these countries constitute a major aspect of U.S. foreign policy and they interact with our domestic economic performance and programs Because of the sharp debate over the U.S. foreign aid program that was mounted during the past year and still goes on this is a particularly appropriate time for reviewing our economic relationships with these less developed countries Even if there were no other reasons the sheer size of the United States would give our economic performance and policies a particular significance for the developing nations. These nations depend heavily on American savings as a major source of capital ; on American science technology and management as a major source of productive and organizational technique ; and on American markets as a major source of demand. Rapid growth and prosperity in the United States make an important contribution to establishing favorable conditions for economic development abroad A great variety of American activities by U.S. businesses consumers tourists and private nonprofit institutions as well as Government significantly affect the developing countries and these activities reflect a variety of purposes. The focus of this chapter however is on the economic policies of the U. S. Government toward the developing countries M EVOLUTION AND RATIONALE In common usage " foreign aid " refers to transfers on concessionary terms of goods services or purchasing power from one government to another either directly or through the medium of international organizations. ( Frequently although the relations between sovereign nations require that it be agreeable to the recipient government aid is destined for specific private uses. Also the term " foreign aid " sometimes is extended to foreign transfers by private nonprofit institutions. ) While all such governmental transfers are intended to serve the general foreign policy inter- ests of the donor country the aid mechanism is a vehicle that can be adapted and has been adapted by the United States to many specific uses that vary over time and from place to place. For example arms shipments coupled with military training have been supplied to nations directly threatened by a foreign power hostile to our interests but such programs may not be appropriate in other situations " Development assistance " is only one type of foreign aid. But it is a type that while .guided by the basic criterion of our foreign policy interests is properly based on economic analysis and evaluated in concrete economic terms. This chapter will deal primarily with this type of foreign aid rather than with programs that are of necessity dominated by political or military considerations of a tactical nature. All the same it is well to recognize that assistance can evolve from one form to another within the same administrative framework as the cases of Greece and Taiwan for example well illustrate. Since our early aid efforts in these nations were responses to military crises internal and external longer-run economic development considerations properly took a subsidiary position Both countries soon gained a measure of internal security and political stability. Our interests as well as theirs then dictated embarking on a program of long-run economic development SHIFTING POLICY GOALS American aid commitments during the early postwar period had short time horizons. The Marshall Plan and its various instrumentalities were a response to the postwar economic chaos and were designed to tide highly industrialized nations over a reconstruction period. The Marshall Plan succeeded handsomely and ended ahead of schedule Meanwhile the social political and economic revolution sweeping the underdeveloped world was beginning to give our aid program a new focus Throughout much of Asia Africa and Latin America rising economic expectations coincided with the disintegration of traditional colonial empires and the emergence of independent but inexperienced and vulnerable nations. Their desire for the benefits of the Industrial Revolution was not matched by the skills the social and political traditions and the capital required for an industrial economy Our initial response was President Truman 's Point IV Program of technical assistance. Barely had his proposal been acted upon however when the Communists in mid-1950 invaded the Republic of Korea highlighting the vulnerability of the emerging nations to military attack and their need for more than technical assistance or capital for development projects. For the next few years reinforcement of the military strength of the free world received primary attention from American policymakers As the decade of the 's proceeded however military and technical assistance was supplemented increasingly by economic aid designed to help emerging nations cope with particular short-run problems or to galvanize longer-run development potentialities. The Foreign Assistance Act of marked the major reorientation of American foreign economic policy in the direction of development assistance. This reorientation was based partly on the recognition that the threat to the internal security of the developing countries from subversive elements within had become more pronounced than the threat to their external security THE CASE FOR DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE Development assistance the transfer of resources on concessionary terms in order to raise rates of output and living standards in less developed countries is thus a major aspect of our present foreign aid program. While the rational case for it rests on political security and economic grounds much of the American impulse in this direction comes from the heart as well as the head. We have a development assistance program because we believe in the dignity of human beings. Although simple humanitarianism may not have a high place in diplomatic confrontations it speaks with a powerful voice between peoples in the language of common wants fears and aspirations for themselves and for each other In addition to humane considerations the prime case for development assistance rests on the Nation 's international political and security interests Over the long run the United States has a large stake in keeping the alternative of orderly nontotalitarian paths to development open to the nonaligned nations as well as to those who are allies. Even in the short run moreover instability unrest and subversion in the less developed areas constitute an ever-present threat to our security. Since the end of World War II a high proportion of the crises that have jeopardized the peace have been located in the underdeveloped world. As tensions in such areas mount and incidents occur the growing circle of parties to the conflict renders the dispute ever more incendiary. It is far healthier for us and for the world as a whole if stability can be fostered by evolving economic growth and constructive social change Development assistance also serves our own economic interests. Poor countries make poor markets ; we need good markets for our exports. We also need dependable sources of supply for a wide variety of imports. Insecure undiversified inefficient economies make weak partners in the network of international economic and financial institutions and we need strong partners. Developing countries have become better trading partners as their incomes have grown. During the past decade the total value of imports into the developing countries has increased at a rate of about percent a year or somewhat more rapidly than their total income. By creating expanding markets abroad for U.S. products agricultural and industrial we realize economic returns from our foreign economic development investments Nevertheless it is well for us to be frank in admitting both to ourselves and to others that our development assistance strategy rests primarily on what are in the broadest sense national security grounds. It is well to be realistic about the uncertainties that run through our development assistance strategy about the fact for example that economic development will not necessarily insure democratic governments or peaceful international behavior. But it is also wise to rest our policy on the probabilities and these seem to be the following : that free progressing open societies typically make better safer and friendlier neighbors and members of the international community ; that in nations imbued with surging expectations vigorous economic development is a necessary although not a sufficient condition for the maintenance of orderly political processes ; and that for most such nations substantial external public assistance for a limited period is a necessary although not a sufficient condition for economic development In short the premise of our development assistance effort has been and remains that while the risks and uncertainties inherent in making the effort are substantial the risks of not making it are even greater ROLE OF DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE In those countries where development assistance is effective the requirements curve for foreign capital is likely to be bell-shaped rising at first leveling off then falling. As less developed countries succeed in promoting more rapid rates of sustained economic growth their very success typically entails a period of severe foreign exchange shortage In many of the new nations the ability to use development assistance effectively is still very limited in terms of dollar volume. These are the traditional societies that have yet to break themselves loose from economic stagnation whose production and consumption are largely those of selfsufficient households and whose ability to absorb capital awaits the extension of the market economy. The prime need in such cases is for technical assistance for teachers and technicians to build skills and institutions basic to economic growth As a country acquires the skills and institutions needed to help itself and adopts public policies that adroitly apply both the rein and the spur its capacity to carry out new investment activity is likely to grow more rapidly than its ability to save. Moreover since at least for some time it must obtain from abroad the great bulk of the manufactured and semimanufactured goods it uses in establishing new industries and raising incomes its requirements for imports rise swiftly. Such a country having generated a momentum of growth and typically having encountered balance-of-payments problems as a result can absorb substantial government-to-government capital assistance. Such assistance by speeding the expension of the country 's imports can accelerate the expansion of output Estimates for the 's indicate that in the less developed countries a 1-percent change in GNP was associated with changes of percent in chemical imports percent in imports of agricultural raw materials and ores and percent in imported foodstuffs. Similarly a 1-percent change in gross domestic fixed investment has been found to be associated on the average with a 1.15-percent change in imports of capital equipment. These relationships moreover reflect the level of imports actually achieved during the 's in the face of acute financing problems and may thus understate the responsiveness of imports to income change under less stringent financial conditions The rapid growth of import requirements however typically is not accompanied by a parallel automatic rise in the developing country 's exports. Indeed the growth process makes a parallel rise unlikely for the foreign markets for the developing country 's traditional exports are in most cases relatively unresponsive to income changes in the advanced countries ( Table ) TABLE World exports : Current value by regions [ Billions of dollars ; f.o.b. ] World Year _ _- __ Free world Developed Less devel- Sino-Soviet areas l oped areas bloc Includes United States Canada Western Europe Japan Australia New Zealand and South Africa Regions other than developed areas and Communist bloc countries Adjusted by Department of Commerce to make data comparable with subsequent years * Estimated Sources : United Nations and Department of Commerce Since for example while imports into the developing countries were expanding by percent their exports increased by percent. Without the foreign exchange necessary to support the higher level of imports not only would growth have been impeded but the momentum of growth actually achieved in certain countries would have been lost In the broadest sense therefore the economic programs of the developing countries must address two problems first to break out of traditional stagnation and establish sustained growth ; and second to -make the sustained growth self-supporting in the international market STRATEGIES FOR ACHIEVING SELF-SUPPORT In order to become able themselves to finance the imports that they need for growth developing countries can resort to two strategies and in fact they tend to adopt mixtures of the two. First they can design development programs that provide for the replacement of some imports through domestic production. During the past decade import substitution received prime emphasis in the development policies of most less developed countries. But its feasibility depends upon the developing country 's resource endowment the general levels of education and skills and the size of its market The second strategy open to developing countries for achieving selfsupport is that of export expansion. At present the developing countries are producers mainly of primary products ; more than percent of their current exports are food and raw materials for which the demand in the advanced countries has grown only slowly during the past decade ( Table ) While there are of course great differences in the positions of individual countries realistic possibilities for a sizable expansion of export earnings tend generally to depend on a diversification of their exports and this is in process. One of the most rapidly rising components of the developing countries ' exports in recent years has been manufactured goods. Although this category still accounts for less than percent of their total commodity exports it rose at an average rate of more than percent a year from to while total exports rose only percent a year during the same period TABLE World trade : Volume and unit value indexes of exports by regions [ = ] Volume indexes Year World Unit value indexes Developed areas Less developed areas World Developed areas Less developed areas 1958__ I960 l Preliminary estimates : January-June average for volume indexes and January-September average for unit values indexes Source : United Nations and Department of Commerce While both of the strategies for self-support are aimed at balancing the imports and exports required for sustained growth both imply increased imports for an interim period. For the expansion of the processing and manufacturing industries required by either strategy needs the creation of new productive facilities the enlargement of existing capacity and additional materials and supplies that can still be obtained only from advanced countries. Thus as the developing countries establish the basis for shifting from sustained to self-supporting growth success in their development effort intensifies their aid needs and their requirements for foreign capital will reach a maximum the top of the bell-shaped curve IMPLEMENTING SELF-SUPPORT The financing problems that accompany growth will decrease in intensity and the need for foreign aid diminish as self-supplying capabilities of the developing countries increase and the composition and volume of their exports more and more reflect the expanding size and diversity of their internal economies. Success however requires and will continue to require a variety of adjustments. If the advanced countries are prosperous and expanding their demand for all products including the exports of the developing countries will be buoyant and the developing countries ' foreign financing problem will be smaller. Vigorous economic expansion at home is therefore one of the greatest contributions that the advanced countries can make to the growth of the developing countries. Beyond this the commercial policies of the advanced countries can maintain a congenial environment for the poorer countries ' exports. For example the " Kennedy Round " of tariff negotiations which will begin in the spring of can make a major contribution to the welfare of the developing countries. In addition two steps taken in are worthy of note. The International Coffee Agreement was completed and legislation to permit U.S. participation in it has reached an advanced stage in the Congress. And the International Monetary Fund in March created a new facility to make funds available to member countries that experience temporary declines in export earnings due to circumstances beyond their control However the greater part of the responsibility for making adjustments that will accomplish a progressive narrowing of their foreign exchange deficiency lies with the developing countries themselves. They must orient their own development planning and administration as well as the flow of development assistance away from overexpanded industries or those with declining demand toward industries in which they are or are likely to become most efficient. The concentration of production in areas of comparative advantage will provide the basis for a sustainable expansion of exports. At the same time they must exploit any good import substitution possibilities they have thus far overlooked for example some of the less developed countries possess the climate and soil that would permit them economically to grow the basic foods they now import. The developing countries need to manage their monetary fiscal and foreign exchange policies so that resources are not diverted from export markets to uneconomic domestic use. They need in some instances and in certain quarters further to encourage thrift and saving and a mobilization of domestic capital re- 715-1X3 O-64-11 sources. And they need to undertake far more determined imaginative and better organized efforts to adapt their products to foreign demands and to market them aggressively A major corollary of these efforts can be success in attracting private foreign capital at reasonable terms and under constructive arrangements It is easy to exaggerate the portion of the problem that private foreign capital can solve in the near future. Nevertheless the more successfully the developing countries pursue stable sustained growth the more they will induce foreign private investors to participate widely in their expansion Foreign development assistance can contribute significantly if marginally to the attainment of sustained self-supporting growth by a number of less developed countries. On the other hand carelessly provided it can be used by a less developed country to postpone economic self-discipline. Such perversions of assistance should be resisted. For example a developing country that yields to the temptation to spend its scarce resources on sophisticated military equipment for prestige reasons should not expect foreign assistance to take care of its development needs. The managers of a development assistance effort should retain sufficient discretion occasionally to risk using economic aid as an inducement to constructive political and social change. But in general development assistance particularly capital assistance should be directed only to those countries that give convincing promise of effectively combining it with their own resources to promote growth In recent years the U.S. aid program has been tending toward a greater concentration of its development credits. This is the effect of its insistence that to qualify for substantial development assistance recipients make adequate showings of " self-help " and adopt economic programs and policies that promise effective use of the assistance. Further such emphasis is warranted Because of its prominence in the U.S. development assistance program special mention should be made of aid that under Public Law takes the form of surplus farm commodities conveyed mainly through the device of selling them for local currencies. Because the proceeds of such sales are inconvertible and because their disbursement within the host countries is subject to joint U.S.-host government determination th- farm commodities provided constitute net contributions to the developing countries ' resources and entail practically no claim on their foreign exchange While in the abstract there is no assurance that the particular physical surpluses the United States happens to have consist of goods the developing countries need in practice there is a happy convergence of interests in the case of surplus foods. For wisely channelled the provision of such American foods over and above what the developing countries can afford to buy in the international market can meet much more than relief needs It can supply the increments to local food supplies that allow host gov- ernments for example to mobilize large amounts of idle manpower especially in rural areas into labor-intensive investment projects without running serious inflationary dangers Trade and capital flows both public and private are interdependent The necessity for aid depends on the level of domestic production and the volume and direction of trade ; but the volume and direction of trade and the level of domestic production are themselves a function of the form and amount of public and private international capital flows. Because trade and aid are interdependent ways of coping with the foreign exchange shortages that development efforts typically engender the two should be more systematically related within the same comprehensive development programs. The combinations that can make the greatest contribution to growth will vary not only among recipient countries but for the same country with the progress of its development effort THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER DONORS All of the principal Western industrialized countries have now initiated or substantially expanded their own development assistance programs. At the same time they have stepped up their contributions to multilaterally supported programs. Despite the fact that the Communist countries are themselves in many ways underdeveloped nations they also have chosen to divert some of their scarce resources to a foreign aid program. The United States which was at one time the only important source of aid to noncolonial areas now accounts for about percent of the world total If " aid " is defined as government grants public loans of more than years ' duration and contributions from official sources to multilateral agencies for use on behalf of the less developed countries then disbursements of all donor countries ( net of repayments ) are estimated at approximately $ 6/ billion in and may have increased by $ 2OO- $ 5OO million in About percent of this assistance in was provided by the members of the Development Assistance Committee ( DAC ) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) Receipts by the less developed countries have run somewhat behind the global assistance figures about $ million less in because disbursements by multilateral agencies have been lower than the sums made available to them by capital subscriptions grants and bond purchases The domestic resources of the developing countries are also augmented by the inflow of foreign private capital that is invested either directly or by the purchase of securities. The problems of measuring these private capital flows are particularly severe. Probably however the total net flow of private capital from the developed to the developing countries in exceeded $ billion. This brought total long-term receipts of developing countries from public and private bilateral and multilateral sources to the neighborhood of $ 8J4 billion an increase of about percent over the level Donor countries differ widely in affluence in the relative burden that military expenditures and domestic needs place on available resources and in their internal budgetary and balance-of-payments problems. Table which offers certain standards for assessing the bilateral aid commitments of DAG countries gross national product defense expenditures and trade with the less developed countries illustrates the fact that there is no single measure of the capability or interest of a donor to sustain a foreign assistance program.

Nevertheless without specific efforts at coordination the multiplication of sources of finance and technical assistance can result in an inequitable sharing of responsibility and a haphazard allocation of resources Of special importance is coordination among donors with respect to the financing of aid. Several DAC members provide relatively more of their development assistance in the form of grant aid than does the United States. Most DAG members however provide credits to developing countries at considerably higher interest cost than does the United States ( Table ) Since the credits from non-U.S. sources are also of shorter duration their annual service charges are much more burdensome on average than those on U.S. credits. The loan commitments of the other DAG countries for example will require interest payments of above $ million on a principal of about $ billion compared with interest of $ million on a principal of $ billion in the American case. Clearly other donor countries can do more to liberalize the terms of their aid by lowering interest rates extending the maturity of their loans or making more of their development assistance available in the form of grants TABLE Terms of official bilateral economic aid commitments of Development Assistance Committee ^ Grants Total aid ( millions of Amount dollars ) ( millions Percent of of total dollars ) aid Development Assistance Committee ( DAC ) Total DAC United States.

Still worse the charges are mounting much more rapidly than are the export earnings required for servicing the total debt. Between and debt service rose from percent to percent of the value of the developing countries ' exports of goods and services Members of the DAG are becoming increasingly aware of the need for coordinated action in this field. They have adopted a resolution recommending that the terms of their aid be liberalized be made more comparable and be related to the specific debt-servicing capacities of recipient countries. In keeping with this resolution both the British and Canadian governments have recently announced new and considerably liberalized credit policies. In addition various DAC countries have worked together in the framework of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and OECD consortia to ensure that their individual aid contributions to specific countries are properly integrated and that the technical assistance necessary to the use of the aid is available ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND NEEDS THE INCOMPLETE RECORD The statistical evidence such as it is of the impact of development assistance on the economic performance of the poorer countries is encouraging Economic statistics are much less reliable and complete for the developing countries than for the advanced countries. Nevertheless United Nations data for the 's provide some indication of progress.

Per capita data may not check exactly with data shown in this table because of use of unrounded data Source : Agency for International Development countries. Individual countries showed wide differences in achievement Average annual rates of growth in real GNP since among countries that have received significant amounts of U.S. economic assistance and where economic development has been a principal objective of such assistance varied from percent for Israel and percent for Taiwan to percent for Argentina. Growth rates in per capita income which in many cases are greatly depressed by high rates of population increase have varied from percent for Israel and percent for Grece to percent for Paraguay. Table illustrates the diversity of experience There is no one universally appropriate rate of growth. Still it is encouraging that of the countries that were the principal recipients of U.S. aid have sustained during the years an annual rate of growth of percent or more in per capita income. In of these countries the per capita rate of growth of GNP has met or exceeded an average of percent The phenomenon of population growth intervenes of course between rates of growth in total output and the per capita data just cited. Comparisons of the two highlight two points. First in many of the developing countries it is clear that a moderation of population growth could ease the task of accelerating per capita economic gains. It is for this reason that the United Nations and many of the developing countries themselves are showing great interest in appropriate population policies and that the U.S Congress in its most recent appropriations for the aid program authorized the support of research into the problems of population growth The second point however is that current rates of population growth in the developing countries are not in fact outdistancing current average rates of growth in output. Nor do they mean that it is useless to assist development until the " population explosion " has been " brought under control. " The logic of the matter runs just the other way : until population growth has slowed down the need for productive expansion is doubly urgent The economic accomplishments of development assistance could be better gauged by the kind of detailed examination of concrete cases for which there is not space here. Such a review for example would include the case of Taiwan where an enviably rapid economic growth ( estimated at over percent a year between and ) has been achieved with U.S. assistance. Its total imports rose from $ million in to an estimated $ million in its exports from $ million in to an approximate balance with imports in The private sector of Taiwan 's economy is growing rapidly and Taiwan may soon be on its own Less need for external assistance is also now foreseen for other successful countries including the Philippines Greece Mexico Israel and Iran It would be appropriate to examine other examples also. The cases of six other countries Korea Vietnam India Pakistan Turkey and Brazil which along with Taiwan the Philippines Greece and Israel have received about three-fifths of all U.S. economic assistance to developing nations merit attention. India and Pakistan for example are among the poorest and most populous of the major recipients of U.S. aid. The relatively large amounts of economic assistance that India has received from the United States in recent years ( averaging about $ million during the period ) have amounted to only a little more than $ per person per year and self-support for India is still at least a decade away. But the progress made since provides grounds for cautious optimism National income increased by percent between and per capita income by percent agricultural production by percent industrial production by percent and school enrollment by percent Even with a full set of such economic case studies however the record of the accomplishments of development assistance would be incomplete in three senses : First harking back to the United States ' underlying rationale for development assistance the record is incomplete until one can trace the internal political consequences of economic growth in the developing countries and the effects on the aided countries ' international behavior. While the Council of Economic Advisers has no special competence for making such judgments it seems to be the view of specialists that the balance of events in this regard has already been favorable. Fewer situations have deteriorated and more have improved than would have been the case in the absence of development and of the development-assistance contribution to it Second the accomplishment record is incomplete in the sense that many of the results of our past and present efforts to promote economic development in Asia Africa and Latin America have yet to appear. The Alliance for Progress for example is not yet years old. The flow of development assistance has been substantial since but before that year development per se was hardly more than an incidental feature of foreign aid programs. The process of economic development today is arduous and long because the less developed countries have so far to go. The transformation of agricultural nations poor in capital and in trained manpower into modern industrial states can not be accomplished without time and travail. Industrialization inevitably involves drastic adaptations of social and economic institutions and the evolution of new attitudes and methods of work. We have only to remind ourselves of the time it has taken to achieve sustained economic development in our own Southeast or in the more recently industrialized countries of Western Europe to appreciate the lags that inevitably intervene between inputs and results Finally development assistance 's record of accomplishments is incomplete because the needed effort itself still is in midstream. The job is not yet done. It is now finally well started. Sufficient growth momentum has been established in many countries so that the emphases of their development programs can begin to shift from getting things started to keep- ing them going and to expanding export capabilities and private foreign investment opportunities enough so that gradually the need for government-to-government aid will be eliminated Moreover as has been emphasized there is room for increasing the effectiveness of specific aspects of our development assistance for improving its allocation for improving its coordination with the efforts of other donors and for increasing the share of the total that others provide. Continuation of our effort at this time will maintain momentum avoid disruption of growth processes that have been arduously established and avoid waste of much of the substance we already have committed WHY ARE WE " SUDDENLY SO FATIGUED " ? At his last press conference on November President Kennedy referring to the mood of the Congress toward authorizing foreign aid funds for the current fiscal year remarked " I do n't understand why we are suddenly so fatigued. " Probably the explanation of the fatigue lies partly in the fact that broad public understanding of the purposes of development assistance is still incomplete. It lies partly also in a difficult administrative history partly in the inherently protracted character of the problems and partly in the fact that the income gulf between the United States and the nations we have been assisting is so large. As a result Americans have trouble perceiving improvements that in the aided countries ' own terms are very significant Most of all however our recent sense of fatigue is traceable to excessive expectations. Misled by the false analogy of our experience with the Marshall Plan whose goal was reconstruction not construction we have underestimated the time it takes for development assistance to work its effects. We have had exaggerated notions of how large a contribution an aid program can make to a country 's internal development. And we have overestimated the orderliness with which economic and social revolution typically can be conducted Especially have our expectations about success and failure been unreasonable. History and experience offer no precedents for this program. It involves an attempt to influence the forces determining the historical evolution of nation-States about which even the wisest among us has little insight. Yet we have expected the program to have a nearly perfect record of success. Such standards of accomplishment would appear too rigorous to any director of industrial research and development. We have made mistakes of course. But we have also learned much both from the mistakes and from the experience of working with people in the developing countries. While we can expect that the period of greatest mistakes is behind us we can never expect a record of percent success until the definitive philosophy of history has been written Judged by our own interests and capabilities the fatigue is inappropriate It is inappropriate especially now that the program as Chapter pointed out has been stripped of most of its adverse near-term balance-of-payments effects. Moreover there is certainly no doubt at present of our domestic economic ability to continue the development assistance effort. Indeed the program is generating several hundred thousand jobs and many hundred million dollars worth of business that American workers and American exporters would be loathe to lose In terms of the basic purpose of the development assistance program however the central point is that fatigue is inconsistent with the solid achievements beginning to emerge. It is out of step with the needs and prospects of the developing countries and with our strategic stake in them In fact the time has come for us to catch our second wind and move ahead Appendix A TESTIMONY OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON EMPLOYMENT AND MANPOWER OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND PUBLIC WELFARE OCTOBER STATEMENT OF WALTER W. HELLER CHAIRMAN ACCOMPANIED BY GARDNER ACKLEY AND JOHN P LEWIS MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON EMPLOYMENT AND MANPOWER OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND PUBLIC WELFARE OCTOBER * Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee we are pleased to have an opportunity to participate in these hearings on Employment and Manpower. The employment problem is not only of the greatest importance to the country and at the center of government economic policy but is of particular interest to an agency operating as the Council does under the mandate of the Employment Act of Recent discussions may have generated an impression of greater disagreement among the Nation 's economists about the origins and solutions of the employment problem than actually exists. For in fact the great majority of those who have studied the matter carefully would agree with the Administration 's view that our excessive unemployment today can not be traced to a single cause nor eliminated by a single cure. Rather it has a mixture of causes which must be dealt with by a mixture an amalgam of cures One problem and a central one is that total expenditures in the economy total demand for goods and services are not sufficient to generate an adequate total number of jobs. We can for convenience call this kind of unemployment " demand-shortage " unemployment. In our view demand-shortage unemployment can and must be attacked by vigorous policies principally tax reduction to raise the total demand for goods and services Another problem is that the characteristics of our available workers their locations skills education training race sex age and so on do not fully match the characteristics employers are seeking in filling the jobs that are available ( or that would be available at full employment ) In a dynamic changing economy there is always some of this mismatching and we call the unemployment that results from it " frictional. " But when Several passages and one entire section of the original have been deleted in reprinting this Statement primarily where the same material is covered in the text of the Report either more fully or using more recent information. Footnotes added to the original are indicated with asterisks the pockets of such unemployment become large and stubborn especially when they impose chronic burdens on particular disadvantaged groups and regions we speak of the unemployment problem as " structural. " This type of unemployment is also a serious problem which requires major policy actions to overcome its corrosive effects. Structural problems are not new. And the available evidence does not show that the proportion of our total unemployment problem that we label " structural " has increased significantly nor that its character has materially changed. But this in no way diminishes the need for attacking these structural problems with vigorous policies principally education training and retraining and special regional programs to match the supply of labor skills more closely to the changing demand for labor skills Along with demand-shortage and structural unemployment one also hears a great deal about the problem of " technological unemployment " of men being put out of work by machines and more particularly by the process which has come to be called " automation. " This is indeed a serious and continuing problem. But two points should be emphasized at the outset First " technological unemployment " is not a third form of unemployment separate from the other two. Rather it expresses itself through these other forms. Technological change causes obsolescence of skills and therefore produces some of the mismatching between available workers and jobs that we call " structural " unemployment. Moreover by raising output per worker technological change is one of the principal sources of growth in our potential total output or GNP which if not matched by corresponding growth in actual GNP opens a gap in demand and thereby causes demandshortage unemployment Second those who maintain that the economy now faces a problem of " technological unemployment " that is somehow new and more formidable than in the past implicitly assert that the rate of technological change has recently speeded up. Unless this is the case the problem is not new it has always been with us and has not proved to be a long-run problem for the economy as a whole. The continuing process of rapid technological change which has constituted the very core of the American economy 's strength and progressiveness for at least years has always put particular workers and businesses out of jobs and required particular adjustments that have been difficult and sometimes painful. It poses a new general problem for the economy only if technological change becomes so rapid that the demand adjustments and labor market adjustments it requires can not be accomplished by the economic processes of the past. Whether technological change indeed has accelerated or is in process of accelerating is a factual question that we consider at some length in this statement. * * Treatment of this question has been deleted from the latter part of the Testimony as reprinted here because it is considered in the text of the Report ( Chapter subsection headed " The Trend of Labor Productivity " ) These then demand-shortage elements structural elements and a possible aggravation of both by accelerated technological change are the principal ingredients of the unemployment problem your Committee is examining. It would be unwise and imprudent to ignore any of these ingredients either in diagnosing the problem or in prescribing remedies The primary attack on high unemployment must be through fiscal measures to speed the growth of total demand and thereby to create new job opportunities. But this need not indeed must not impede a simultaneous attack on our stubborn structural problems. The two approaches are not merely complementary ; they are mutually reinforcing. On the one hand training and other programs to facilitate labor mobility can ease and speed the process by which demand-stimulated increases in output are translated into increases in employment. On the other since structural maladjustments tend to flourish in slack markets a vigorous expansion in demand helps cut structural problems down to size This statement deals first with the over-all dimensions of our unemployment problem and the central role of tax reduction in eliminating excessive unemployment. Second we turn to several issues which have figured prominently in the Committee 's hearings to date : the nature extent and recent pattern of structural unemployment ; the current rate of growth in productivity and the labor force ; and the fears of automation and consumer satiation. In considering these issues we are addressing ourselves to three underlying questions : Are the structural elements of the unemployment problem an important barrier to the achievement of the objectives of the tax cut ? Are we likely to experience speedier increases in productivity and in the labor force which while serving our objectives of faster economic growth and balance-of-payment equilibrium would intensify our problems of re-employing displaced workers and generating enough total demand to achieve full employment ? * What is the nature of the labor market policies that must go hand-in-hand with the use of over-all fiscal and monetary policies for expansion if we are to achieve our multiple economic goals ? A final section will summarize our observations on these questions I. UNEMPLOYMENT AND TAX REDUCTION The American economy has been plagued with persistently excessive unemployment for years. The unemployment rate has been percent or more for consecutive months. Since it has averaged percent Even in the face of annual advances of about $ billion in GNP ( annual * Treatment of this question has been deleted from the latter part of the Testimony as reprinted here because it is considered in the text of the Report ( Chapter subsection headed " The Trend of Labor Productivity " ) rate ) unemployment has not been diminishing. Thus although GNP rose from $ billion in the third quarter of to $ billion in the third quarter of the unemployment rate remained the same in both quarters. And even with a prospective increase of $ billion in the GNP rate from early to early ( a rise of percent in current dollars and about percent in constant dollars ) the unemployment rate will have come down only about l/<x percentage points in that 3-year period The persistence of this high level of unemployment is sometimes cited as evidence of structural difficulties which will blunt the effect of the proposed $ billion tax cut now being considered by the Senate Finance Committee and make it difficult to reach the interim full-employment goal of 4-percent unemployment let alone our ultimate goals beyond the 4percent level. The structural problem will be examined in some detail later in this statement. But here several points should be noted to indicate why the road to 4-percent unemployment is clearly open to demand-powered measures : The pre-1957 postwar performance of the U.S. economy gives ample evidence of its ability to achieve percent and even lower levels of unemployment without excessive strain The availability of million excess unemployed workers ( even by the modest 4-percent criterion and not counting the labor force drop-outs resulting from slack job opportunities ) and of substantial excess capacity ( even after large gains the average operating rate in manufacturing is running at only percent of capacity ) demonstrates that we are still suffering from a serious shortage of consumer and investment demand There are virtually no signs of economic tension of the barriers that would divert the force of demand stimulus away from higher output more jobs and higher incomes into higher prices there are no visible bottlenecks in the economy wage rate increases have been the most moderate in the postwar period and the record of price stability in recent years has been outstanding In reference to the first point the unemployment rates in the first postwar decade deserve a further word. In the period of vigorous business activity in and unemployment averaged percent of the labor force. After the recession of and the recovery of the rate was relatively stable from early to late averaging percent. Since that time the rate has drifted upward. In the period of stable unemployment from mid-1955 to late unemployment averaged percent an increase of more than one-third above the period. In the first half of unemployment averaged percent nearly one-fourth above the level. Following the recession and recovery of the rate fluctuated within a narrow range averaging percent in and to date a little higher than early Looking at the period the average unemployment rate was below percent in each of the following years : and and below / percent in and When one looks behind these figures to get a grasp of the economic conditions that produced them the most notable difference between the pre1957 and post-1957 periods is found in the strength of market demand In the first postwar decade markets were strong. Backlogs of consumer demand had to be worked off. The demands of the Korean conflict had to be met. Outmoded plants and equipment had to be replaced or modernized and capacity had to be enlarged. Deficiencies in housing office facilities and public works had to be made up But marked a watershed. In the ensuing period demand has slackened at a time when our labor force growth has been accelerating in response to the postwar jump in the birth rate. Business fixed investment dropped off from percent of the GNP to only percent indeed the level of such investment in barely struggled back to its level in while GNP was rising by nearly one-fifth ( both in constant prices ) Thus the clearest and most striking change since is the weakening of demand. So the clearest and most urgent need today is to remove the overburden of taxation which is retarding the growth in demand to full employment levels. Income tax rates enacted to finance war and fight inflation though reduced in are still so high that they would yield a large surplus of revenues over expenditures if we were at full employment today. They are in short repressing demand and incentives in an economy operating well short of its capacity To avoid misunderstanding it is important to stress that any employment program would be unbalanced and incomplete without determined measures ( a ) to upgrade and adapt the skills and education of the labor force to the more exacting demands of our advancing technology and ( b ) to facilitate the flow of workers from job to job industry to industry and place to place. Nevertheless our principal reliance for a return to the 4percent-or-better levels of unemployment we took for granted in the early postwar period must be on measures to boost demand for the products of American industry and agriculture The amount of the increase in total demand which would be necessary to reduce unemployment to the 4-percent interim-target level can be approximated in several ways. We have made direct estimates of the relationship between unemployment rates and output levels ; and we have independently estimated the potential GNP that the economy could produce at 4-percent unemployment. Both of these approaches yield consistent estimates of the output and demand requirements associated with 4-percent unemployment at a given time. Except for small differences reflecting cyclical variations in productivity and erratic fluctuations in labor force participation rates these estimates of potential output ( in constant prices ) are very closely approximated by a } 4-percent trend line passing through actual GNP in mid-1955. The several methods of computing potential GNP were reviewed in some detail in our Annual Reports both for and and are analyzed more fully in a recent paper by one of the Council 's consultants.1 Although estimates of this kind can not be precise and efforts to improve and update them as new data come in must continue the careful cross-checking by different methods provides confidence in their general order of magnitude These estimates show that the gap between actual GNP and the potential GNP at 4-percent unemployment has been substantial in every year since In both and it has approximated $ billion Our analysis thus suggests that total demand for goods and services would have had to average some $ billion higher than it was in each of these past years for unemployment to average percent. The basic purpose of the tax cut is to close that $ billion gap and to realize the benefits to employment growth and our international competitive position that will flow from this advance To be sure by the time the full effects of the proposed two-stage tax cut will be reflected in demand and output the economy 's potential will have grown considerably and total demand growth will therefore have to be considerably more than $ billion. But when the tax cut lifts the expanding level of private demand in the U.S. economy by the extra $ billion ( in terms of GNP and price levels ) that can confidently be expected it will have achieved its basic purpose. Had this increase been effective during the past years it would have eliminated our persistent slack and allowed our unemployment rate to average percent The process by which an $ billion tax cut can add as much as $ billion to total demand has been frequently described and needs only to be summarized briefly here If the new proposed personal income tax rates were in full effect today disposable after-tax incomes of consumers would be approximately $ billion higher than they are at present levels of pretax incomes. In addition if the lower corporate tax rates were now in effect after-tax profits would be about $ billion higher. Based on past dividend practice one can assume that corporate dividends received by individuals ( after deducting personal income taxes on such dividends ) would then be more than $ billion higher giving a total increment of consumer after-tax incomes at present levels of production of about $ billion Since consumer spending on current output has remained close to percent of disposable income in each of the past dozen years one can safely project that consumer spending would rise by about percent of the rise in disposable incomes or by over $ billion Arthur M. Okun " Potential GNP : Its,.Measurement and Significance " Cowles Foundation paper No. reprinted from the Proceedings of the Business and Economic Statistics Section of the American Statistical Association 715-11J O-64-12 But this is far from the end of the matter. The higher production of consumer goods to meet this extra spending would mean extra employment higher payrolls higher profits and higher farm and professional and service incomes. This added purchasing power would generate still further increases in spending and incomes in an endless but rapidly diminishing chain. The initial rise of $ billion plus this extra consumption spending and extra output of consumer goods would add over $ billion to our annual GNP not just once but year-in and year-out since this is a permanent not a one-shot tax cut. We can summarize this continuing process by saying that a " multiplier " of approximately has been applied to the direct increment of consumption spending But that is not the end of the matter either. For the higher volume of sales the higher productivity associated with fuller use of existing capacity and the lower tax rates on corporate profits also provided by the tax bill would increase after-tax profits and especially the rate of expected aftertax profit on investment in new facilities. Adding to this the financial incentives embodied in last year 's tax changes which are yet to have their full effect one can expect a substantial induced rise in business plant and equipment spending and a rise in the rate of inventory investment. Further higher consumer incomes will stimulate extra residential construction ; and the higher revenues that State and local governments will receive under existing tax rates will prompt a rise in their investments in schools roads and urban facilities. The exact amount of each of these increases is hard to estimate with precision. But it is reasonable to estimate their sum as in the range of $ to $ billion. This extra spending would also be subject to a multiplier of as incomes rose and consumer spending increased. Thus there would be a further expansion of $ to $ billion in GNP to add to the $ billion or so from the consumption factor alone The total addition to GNP would match rather closely the estimated $ billion gap II. T H E PERSISTENT PROBLEMS OF STRUCTURAL UNEMPLOYMENT The tax cut would thus increase demand to levels consistent with a 4percent rate of unemployment. It would ease our most pressing unemployment problems. But no one can assume that our worries about unemployment would then be over. Some of its most distressing and inequitable aspects would remain To be sure tax-reduction will create new jobs in every community across the Nation and expand employment in every industry. The overwhelming majority of American families will benefit directly from the income tax cuts that will accrue to million tax-paying individuals and taxpaying corporations. Their direct rise in after-tax income will soon be translated through the marketplace into stronger markets for all kinds of goods and services and a quickening of the business pulse in all communities With average working hours already at a high level this added demand and activity will in large part be translated in turn into additional jobs and income for the unemployed. Thus the non-taxpaying minority will in a very real sense be the greatest beneficiaries of the tax program Experience ( which we will review later in this statement ) clearly shows ( ) that the unemployment rate will decline for every major category of workers and ( ) that the sharpest declines will occur where the incidence of unemployment is the highest : among teenagers the Negroes the lessskilled the blue-collar groups generally But even so the unemployment rates of many groups will still be intolerably high. Back in for instance when the average unemployment rate was just over percent for the whole economy the rates were much higher for many disadvantaged groups and regions e.g. percent for teenagers percent for nonwhites percent for unskilled manual workers and percent for workers in Wilkes-Barre-Hazleton Pennsylvania These high specific unemployment rates which persist even when the general rate falls to an acceptable level are the essence of the problem of structural unemployment. Even a fully successful tax cut can not solve problems like these by itself. They require a more direct attack To reduce the abnormally high and stubborn unemployment rate for Negroes requires a major improvement in their education and training and an attack on racial discrimination. To reduce the persistent high rate for the unskilled and the uneducated groups demands measures to help them acquire skills and knowledge. To reduce excessive unemployment associated with declining industries and technological advance requires retraining and relocation. To reduce high unemployment in distressed areas of Pennsylvania Michigan Minnesota and elsewhere calls for special measures to rebuild the economic base of those communities and assist their workers Both the Administration and the Congress have recognized that these measures must be taken concurrently with measures to expand aggregate demand. Coal miners in Harlan County are structurally unemployed now and so are Negro and Puerto Rican youths in New York City. Yet programs to reduce structural unemployment will run into severe limits in the absence of an adequate growth of demand i.e. in the absence of rapid expansion of total job opportunities. Such expansion is needed to assure that retrained and upgraded workers for example will find jobs at the end of the training period and will not do so at the expense of job opportunities for other unemployed workers. As structural programs create new and upgraded skills they will in some cases fit the participants for jobs that had previously gone begging. But for the most part the needed jobs must be created by expansion of total demand Quite apart from the human significance of structural unemployment it also has great economic importance. For only as we reduce structural and frictional unemployment can we achieve the higher levels of total output which would be associated with unemployment rates below our 4-percent interim target. The Council emphasized this point in its Annual Report ( p. ) as follows : " Success in a combined policy of strengthening demand and adapting manpower supplies to evolving needs would enable us to achieve an interim objective of percent unemployment and permit us to push beyond it in a setting of reasonable price stability. Bottlenecks in skilled labor middle-level manpower and professional personnel [ now ] tend to become acute as unemployment approaches percent The result is to retard growth and generate wage-price pressures at particular points in the economy. As we widen or break these bottlenecks by intensified and flexible educational training and retraining efforts our employment sights will steadily rise. " Every worker needlessly unemployed represents a human cost which offends the sensibilities of a civilized society. But each worker needlessly unemployed also represents a waste of potential goods and services which even an affluent society can ill afford. More intensive measures to attack structural unemployment are necessary to reduce the unemployment rate not merely to percent but beyond III HAS STRUCTURAL UNEMPLOYMENT INCREASED ? The preceding section addressed itself to structural unemployment as a human and social problem and considered its role in the process of lowering the unemployment rate to and below percent. But it is also appropriate to ask : has structural unemployment increased to such an extent since the last time unemployment was near percent that it will impede the expansionary effects of demand-creating measures in general and the tax cut in particular ? An affirmative answer would we believe represent a misreading of the facts. As we have already pointed1 out there are serious structural problems and prompt action is needed both to root out inequities and hardships they inflict and to help us reach our employment goals. But this conclusion need not and does not rest on a belief that there has been a disproportionate surge in structural unemployment since A reading of the evidence on this score must focus principally on what happens over time to the unemployment rates of particular groups teenagers untrained and unskilled workers Negroes and other disadvantaged groups and regions in relation to the total unemployment rate. It would clearly be misleading simply to compare unemployment rates for such groups in a year like when the total rate was about percent with the corresponding rates in when the total rate has averaged percent. Rather it is the relationship between the total rate and the groups ' rates and its historical development that reveals whether the structural problem is getting worse or not. And this relationship has been remarkably stable The disadvantaged groups almost invariably share more than proportionately and the skilled and white-collar groups less than proportionately in both decreases and increases in total employment. In the past when the over-all unemployment rate has risen ( or fallen ) percentage point the rate for nonwhites and teenagers has risen ( or fallen ) by about percentage points the rate for unskilled workers by about 2J4 percentage points. But the rate for professional and technical workers has risen or fallen by only about one-fourth of a percentage point One obvious reason for the disproportionate impact on teenagers is that they are the most recent additions to the labor force. When new job opportunities are few there is a backing-up at the point of entry. Furthermore even when they do find jobs they tend to have the lowest seniority and are therefore first to be laid off. Much the same is true of Negroes Given existing patterns of discrimination they are often in marginal jobs or at the bottom of seniority lists. Moreover when jobs are scarce and labor is plentiful racial discrimination where it exists is more likely to enter into hiring and firing decisions. And at such times employers are also more inclined to pass over inexperienced and untrained workers and less inclined to press their own efforts to adapt such personnel to their needs via in-service training programs. They tend to be less aggressive in seeking new employees outside their own local labor markets. And labor supply considerations are less likely to determine the location of new plants On the other hand employers do not typically discharge many supervisory and technical personnel when output drops and as a result they do not need to expand their employment of such persons proportionately when output rises Moreover there are other reasons why the employment of many categories of workers does not rise and fall in the same proportion as the total Some disparities arise from the complex interrelationship between the composition and the level of total output. To cite just one example the rate of inventory accumulation is highly sensitive to the rate of expansion or contraction in total output and goods that typically are inventoried tend to require large numbers of production workers. In contrast the service industries whose output is not subject to inventory accumulation nor to such wide fluctuations in consumption generally use more technical and white-collar workers Thus it is not surprising to find that slackened demand since has intensified inter-group and inter-regional disparities in unemployment rates at the same time that it raised the total unemployment rate. Nonwhites teenagers unskilled and semi-skilled workers have suffered a greater-thanaverage increase in unemployment since But these same groups will also benefit disproportionately as demand expands and the over-all unemployment rate declines. This point is illustrated in the table below which shows how the incidence of unemployment changed during the recession and the recovery Change in unemployment rate selected groups and areas Percentage points Total Teenagers. Nonwhites Nonfarm laborers __ _ Operatives Manufacturing workers Miners For illustrative purposes : Michigan Wheeling W. Va_ _ __ Studies of changes in the incidence of unemployment among unskilled and semi-skilled blue-collar workers whose jobs would seem to be highly vulnerable to technological change can provide important insights into the structural unemployment problem. One would expect an accelerated rate of technological displacement to be reflected in rising rates of unemployment for these groups relative to total unemployment. One would also expect to find such a relative rise for workers in industries such as manufacturing mining and transportation where automation has so far found its widest application To test this possibility we have correlated the unemployment rate in specific occupations and industries with the rate for all experienced workers in the labor force during the period in other words for the period before the main structural unemployment upsurge is alleged to have occurred. These correlations were then used to calculate what the occupational and industrial distribution of unemployment would have been in if the old relationships had held. If there had been a substantial increase in structural maladjustments the actual unemployment rates for what we may call the " technologically vulnerable groups " should have been higher than these calculated rates. But in fact as Table shows a majority of the rates are lower. For some of these occupations and industries the actual increase in unemployment was greater than expected but in most cases it was less. And taking all of the blue-collar occupations and goods-producing industries together we also find that the rise in actual unemployment was somewhat less than the experience would have suggested TABLE Unemployment rates in industries and occupations most vulnerable to technological displacement and [ Percent ] Change in rate Industry or occupation Actual All workers _._ Experienced wage and salary workers Expected ' Workers in selected industries ( goods producing ) Mining forestry and fisheries Construction Durable goods manufacturing Nondurable goods manufacturing Transportation and public utilities Experienced workers.

In some labor market areas imbalances have lessened ; in others they have increased. But this does not suggest that the over-all rate of structural unemployment has risen significantly One similar piece of evidence relates to job vacancies. Since structural unemployment is a form of joblessness that persists over a protracted period even if unfilled jobs are available an increase in structural unemployment would be clearly suggested if it were found that the number of job vacancies were rising along with the number of unemployed men Unhappily we have no comprehensive and adequate series designed to measure job vacancies in the United States. The Department of Labor currently is proposing experimental work leading toward the eventual establishment of such a series. This is a proposal we strongly endorse although we share the Labor Department 's awareness that such a series involves many technical problems and will need to be interpreted with care especially in its early years Edward F. Denison The Incidence of Unemployment by States and Regions and I960 and The Dispersion of Unemployment Among Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas and Mimeograph. Otto Eckstein The Unemployment Problem in Our Day paper delivered before the Conference on Unemployment and the American Economy Berkeley California April But meanwhile the only available indicator that bears upon the jobvacancy situation is the National Industrial Conference Board 's index of the number of help-wanted advertisements published in the classified section of a leading newspaper in each of leading labor market areas. While this series does a good job of reporting what it is designed to report obviously it provides a comparatively sketchy and imperfect indication of job vacancies. All the same it is interesting that after adjustment for changes in the size of the labor force the help-wanted index was substantially lower in and than in when the total unemployment rate was about percent. We have further adjusted the index for changes in the total unemployment rate in order to screen out the effects of slack demand. Even in this form the index fails to rise significantly since as one would expect it to do if underlying structural unemployment had broadened The evidence reviewed above does not yield persuasive indications that structural elements are today a significantly larger factor in our unemployment than in Nevertheless it would not be surprising if some particular aspects of structural unemployment have intensified. One would assume that the longer a period of slack persists the more likely it would be that the detailed structure of skills experience and training of the labor force would fail to reflect fully the pattern of job requirements at high levels of employment. High employment in will call for a somewhat different pattern of jobs than existed in and a slack labor market does not accurately foretell what that pattern will be. Moreover there is danger that after a long period of slack new hiring standards habits of mind and expectations appropriate to an " easy " labor market will have become entrenched rationalizing increased discriminations against disadvantaged groups. Thus after the period of prolonged slack since there is more need than in the usual " cyclical " recovery for an effective program of specific labor-market policies to assist demand-stimulating policies in tailoring men to jobs and jobs to men IV SHIFTING EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND POSSIBLE SKILLED MANPOWER BOTTLENECKS In recent weeks partly before this Committee partly elsewhere particular attention has been given to one aspect of the problem of structural maladjustments. This is the question of whether a recent shift in the pace and character of technological change has accelerated the long-term rise in job educational and skill requirements in a way that imposes a new bottleneck an expansion. The issue merits special discussion because of the obstacle to the employment-expanding effects of the tax program that this skilled-manpower bottleneck is alleged to present The argument is that the nature of recent technological change has caused a rapid shift in the pattern of manpower demand pushing down the demand for workers with little training and pushing up the demand for the highly educated. Everyone agrees that the educational level of the Nation 's population has continued to advance causing the supply of highly educated manpower to grow rapidly and the supply of relatively uneducated manpower to decline. Thus the concern expressed is not about keeping pace with an absolute increase in job educational requirements which have been rising right along but about being unable to keep pace with an abrupt recent rise in such requirements It is feared that as demand increases there will not be enough highly educated workers to fill the key technical and professional positions that must be manned if production is to expand to levels consistent with 4-percent unemployment ; that in consequence expansion of output will be frustrated ; and that because of this high percentages of the remainder of the labor force including poorly educated workers will be left unemployed It is important to distinguish this quite specific point about near-term bottlenecks from other propositions about the economic importance of education. It is unquestionably true we believe that greatly reinforced education is needed to press the attack on the pockets of long-term structural unemployment that have plagued the economy for a long time It is unquestionably true moreover that educational attainment enormously affects the employment prospects of the individual. Whether the economy is booming or stagnating the poorly educated always come off second best. A grade school graduate is times likelier to be unemployed than is a college graduate. Today 's school dropouts are tomorrow 's unemployed It is further well-known that long-term shifts which can be projected to continue in the relative importance of various industries and long-term trends in technological development are on the whole raising ( as well as altering ) educational requirements. The Report on Manpower Requirements Resources Utilization and Training by Secretary Wirtz last March indicated the nature of these continuing shifts including projections by broad groups to and The clearly indicated rise in the requirement for professional technical and kindred workers teachers scientists physicians engineers technicians and nurses pose obvious demands on education in general and higher education in particular. And increased demands for many special skills create needs for expanded programs of vocational education and for more persons with a basic high school education. These long-term trends are not at issue in the present discussion Likewise there can be little doubt about the enormous importance of education as an engine for stimulating the long-term growth of our productive potential. Edward Denison has estimated that percent of the increase in output per worker between and was the result of education and another percent the result of the general advance in the application of scientific and technological knowledge to which our educational process and institutions clearly were heavy contributors. All of these are extremely important in fact conclusive reasons for strengthening our educational programs. But they should not be confused with the view that educational deficiencies prevent the solution of our current problem of excessive unemployment and specifically that near-term manpower bottlenecks will significantly restrain a demand expansion stimulated by a tax cut from accomplishing its employment objective The statistical testing of the educational bottleneck hypothesis turns out if properly done to be a very complex undertaking. There are problems of the noncomparability between Decennial Census data and information drawn from Current Population Surveys ; of the lack of appropriate annual series ; of calculating appropriate current full-employment labor-force participation rates for particular age and educational-attainment groups instead of arbitrarily projecting the rates of a remote year ; and of including not merely the male but the female components of our population however some reliable impressions already have emerged from the figures at hand. One is that while there does appear to have been some rise in the demand for highly educated workers relative to their supply during the postwar period as a whole the timing of this change is crucial for purposes of evaluating the bottleneck thesis. Since the economy operated at approximately a 4-percent unemployment rate in the mid-fifties without encountering serious skilled-manpower bottlenecks the key question is whether most of this shift occurred before or after the period Hence a shift in job educational requirements relative to supply that had occurred before those years and was not serious enough to obstruct expansion then poses little threat to a new move back toward 4-percent unemployment now The available unemployment data seems to show that whatever shift may have occurred in job educational requirements relative to supply did occur prior to Indeed it may have been partially reversed since that time From to for example the unemployment rate for male workers with an 8th grade education or less rose by about one-half roughly the same as the rate of overall unemployment. But the unemployment rate for college graduates rose from percent to percent In addition to unemployment rates the percentages of labor-force participation by groups of different educational attainments also have changed during the postwar period. Here the data currently in hand do not permit us to locate the timing of these changes to the degree that has been possible with the unemployment rates. And so we simply do not know whether here too the shift toward greater participation by the well-educated and lesser participation by the poorly educated may largely have occurred before * * From data examined since the Testimony was prepared it appears that the shift toward greater participation by the well educated primarily occurred before ; as to the poorly educated roughly half of the shift toward lower participation occurred prior to and half after If in the absence of information one assumes that the shift in relative participation rates occurred more recently one might conclude that there have been some withdrawals from the labor force by poorly educated male workers. Whenever they occurred they present an obvious challenge to both public and private training programs. But the magnitude of these shifts is easily exaggerated especially if one fails to make adequate allowance for the improvements in retirement programs during the past dozen years. It is clear that the vast majority of the so-called " losses " of less educated workers from the male labor force were concentrated in the 65and-older age group In any event none of this goes to the real nub of the issue. That nub is the failure of the bottleneck hypothesis to make any allowance for the proven capacity of a free labor market especially one endowed with a high average level of education and enterprise and expanding programs to improve labor skills and mobility to reconcile discrepancies between particular labor supplies and particular labor demands If relative shortages of particular skills develop the price system and the market will moderate them as they always have done in the past. Employers will be prompted to step up their in-service training programs and as more jobs become available poorly skilled and poorly educated workers will be more strongly motivated to avail themselves of training retraining and adult education opportunities. Government manpower programs begun in the period will also be operating to help ease the adjustment of specific shortages As for the personnel with the very highest skills many for the very reason that they are scarce have been " stockpiled " by their employers and are not working to capacity when business is slack. As business picks up they will be used more fully and they will be used more efficiently As engineers become scarce and more expensive their talents will be concentrated on engineering assignments leaving drafting ( for example ) for draftsmen who can be trained more quickly Naturally most college graduates will have jobs no matter how high the unemployment rate in the whole economy even if they have to work below the level for which they are qualified. If they are already in the supervisory or technical jobs for which they are best qualified their employers will not have to increase by percent the number of such jobs in order to increase total employment by percent. And to the extent that they are not already in such jobs they are a hidden reservoir of superior talent The highly-educated-manpower-bottleneck argument arrives at its alarming conclusion by projecting to new situations a perfectly static set of educational requirements. The argument makes no allowance for flexibility in the system. Flexibility of course is not unlimited. If we were talking about accomplishing a massive increase in output within a few months manpower bottlenecks might indeed become critical. But we find it unrealistic to be- lieve that they represent a major constraint upon an extra $ billion of output in what will soon be a $ billion economy especially when ( a ) there are virtually no current signs of tension in either labor markets or product markets and ( b ) the demand expansion that will accomplish the closure will be spread over or more years in which continuing new supplies of highly trained manpower will be entering the labor market At the beginning of Section III the question was raised whether structural elements in unemployment have grown so much since that they threaten to impede an economic expansion induced by the tax cut. In Sections I I I and IV we have examined this question from a number of directions and we now summarize our answer The answer is clear : The evidence we have assembled and the tests we have made do not support the thesis that over-all the incidence of structural unemployment has increased in importance since we last achieved high employment. There may be some problems that seem more serious today than earlier ; but in other areas we have probably progressed Expansion of the economy in response to a stepping-up of the growth of demand will not be impeded by pockets of surplus labor existing in a limited number of categories we have always had distressing surpluses in certain categories and the tax cut will not fully eliminate them. Economic expansion could eventually be impeded by shortages in strategic categories of skills and training but the statistical evidence reveals no such shortages enroute to 4-percent unemployment It is difficult to believe that an economy that was able to absorb the dramatic shifts needed to convert to war production in World War II and that operated at unemployment levels as low as percent during that war and more recently ( ) at percent could not move rather readily over the space of or years to our interim target of 4-percent unemployment Unsatisfied as we all must be with our Nation 's achievements in education and with the distressing problem of school dropouts we must not disregard the fact that our labor force today is better educated and as a result more flexible than ever before. The median level of education among the adult male members of the labor force has risen by an astonishing percent since the beginning of the Second World War. New entrants into the labor force are on the average better equipped than ever before to respond to a changing pattern of demand. By when the full effects of the tax cut will be apparent the ranks of trained workers will have been swelled by two more annual graduating classes from our high schools colleges and professional and graduate schools. In each case the size of the groups will dwarf all previous records.3 For example the projected numbers graduating from college ( bachelors or first professional-degrees ) in and will be about percent above the numbers graduated in and By the estimated number will exceed by percent Our own recent economic history assures us of the economy 's ability to adapt to rapid change. Additional assurance along this line is found in the experience of other countries whose systems and values are similar to our own. During the past decade the Western European economy has undergone staggering structural changes. France and Belgium have adjusted to the decline of important mining areas Germany to the inflow of millions cf refugees from the East and Italy to the problem of absorbing large numbers of poorly educated rural migrants into urban occupations. And all of Western Europe has adjusted to the replacement of obsolete capital and of productive methods often unchanged for a century or more with machinery and methods geared to the most advanced technology in the world. The advance of productivity has been revolutionary. During the 19505s output per manufacturing worker increased ^ times as fast in Germany as in the United States times as fast in France and times as fast in Italy. In their adjustment to these changes the Europeans though they may have other advantages did not have the advantage of a labor force nearly as well educated as well trained as mobile or as flexible as ours Nonetheless the Europeans have maintained unemployment rates considerably lower than ours. After adjustment for conceptual differences the unemployment rate in was percent in Germany percent in France and percent in Italy. In Italy and Germany these low rates represented a considerable improvement over earlier postwar experience and the higher Italian rate has subsequently declined materially The major explanation for such low unemployment rates in economies undergoing such profound transitions lies in the maintenane of a very high level of demand. During the 's the average annual growth rate in France was percent in Italy percent and in Germany over percent and both Italy and France have had even higher rates so far in the 's This experience demonstrates beyond any doubt that under the stimulus of adequate demand and with the aid of active labor market policies modern economies are sufficiently resilient to absorb poorly educated workers to adapt to skill shortages and to adjust to rapid technological change in a manner which maintains extremely low unemployment rates. This European experience which in broad outline has been matched in Japan reassures us that once high and growing demand presses our capacity we too will adapt to rapid change and maintain our economic health Structural unemployment is a human and an economic problem that we must attack by every means available. But the expansion of total demand through tax reduction remains the crucial central element in our attack upon unemployment V. T H E RATE OF GROWTH OF PRODUCTIVITY * VI T H E CHALLENGE OF AUTOMATION * * In a way it is surprising how reluctant we are to embrace the higher productivity levels and living standards which " automation " makes possible. Some of the more popular literature on the subject treats it as a new and frightening development. But in fact it is only the most recent aspect of a continuing process of technological advance that dates back to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Taking full advantage of this process the United States has built the most productive and most remunerative economy in the world. Through time brute strength has been progressively replaced by simple machines mechanical power complex machines assembly lines and today increasingly by sophisticated automatic feedback systems. At each stage of the process individuals were temporarily displaced from existing jobs new skills were found to be needed and were acquired and total output and employment expanded as demand increased in line with the new higher production capabilities Ultimately the total effect has always in the past been a higher standard of living for almost everyone higher pay for workers cheaper and better products for consumers and larger profits for businessmen and stockholders On the basis of our historical experience automation should be recognized for what it is an open door to a more productive economy to higher levels of private consumption to more effective public services and to larger resources for the support of our international objectives Despite this historical record it is occasionally argued that the newest techniques are becoming so much more productive than those they replace that we can not possibly adjust to them as smoothly as in the past. As indicated earlier the evidence available to date does not enable us to draw firm conclusions about the prospective rate of increase in productivity Yet it is clearly possible that as the newest production techniques are increasingly embodied in new capital the future growth of productivity will speed up Should this possibility be a source of concern ? Rather than viewing it with concern or alarm we would argue that we should work as hard as we can for faster productivity growth indeed it holds the key to success of our national policies for faster economic growth and for the cost-cutting that is essential to our international competitive position. It is a prime objective of this year 's tax bill as well as last year 's special tax stimulants to investment Doubts about our ability to adjust to automation seem to be based on two questions : Can we really use the enlarged output of goods and services * The text of this section has been deleted because the same material is covered using more recent data in Chapter of the Report especially in the subsection headed " The Trend of Labor Productivity. " * * Parts of this section overlap with material contained in the text of the Report made possible by a rising rate of productivity advance ? Will the new speed and character of technological change create impossible problems of adjustment for the labor force ? Those who raise the first question sometimes argue that we can not possibly consume all that the new techniques can produce that the persistent high level of unemployment over the past few years is evidence of " satiation " that the fantastic productivity of the American economy has outdistanced the needs of the American people. What do the facts show ? First and most obvious it is impossible to square this notion with the persistence of poverty in the American economy. We are indeed an affluent society by every comparative standard. Nonetheless even in this age of affluence one-fifth of American families still have annual incomes below $ that is they live in poverty. To them the suggestion that we are economically satiated must seem ridiculous if not cruel. Until our society has met the challenge of poverty in the midst of plenty it is in no danger of being satiated with goods and services But quite apart from the persistence of poverty there is nothing in the economic behavior of even the more affluent American consumers to support the satiation hypothesis. At all income levels except perhaps in the top or percent of the income-wealth distribution the ratio of consumption to disposable income is one of our most stable economic relationships Year-in year-out ever since American consumers have continued to spend from to percent of their aggregate disposable income their income after taxes on consumer goods and services. During this period total income and average family income have both risen markedly ; but there is no evidence of any growing disinclination to spend a stable and high percentage of each additional dollar of income on consumption. Even those in the upper " middle " income groups who are already able to meet without strain the basic requirements for food clothing housing and transportation find that they have ample and often urgent uses for additional incomes This may take the form of an improved quality or manner in which basic requirements are satisfied a larger house a newer car or it may take the form of meeting new and different demands : longer and more rewarding vacations better education for one 's children better medical care more books and more concerts and more expensive hobbies This does not of course rule out the possibility that as in the past some many or even all of us will prefer to forego still higher income in favor of greater leisure in the form of shorter hours longer vacations or earlier retirements. ( There are indications incidentally that many people find it easier to become satiated with leisure than with income ! ) In addition to unsatisfied private consumption needs there are pressing needs for goods and services which are ordinarily and in some cases inevitably provided by the public sector. Admittedly there is disagreement as to just which of these " public goods " most need to be increased. There are also differences of opinion as to which levels of government should under- take expanded activities. Nevertheless almost all major segments of the American community support increases in the level of one or another of such " public " goods and services whether they be for example urban renewal or improved health services or better schools or better roads and airports or purer water and air or more adequate facilities in national parks. Certainly none of this bespeaks a satiated society In a somewhat different vein it should also be noted that technologically advancing societies also generate high levels of investment demand demand for producer goods like machines equipment buildings. In large part of course this reflects the favorable impact of new technological developments on the profitability of investment. During most of our history American business has responded to such opportunities by enlarging its investment outlays. Postwar Western Europe and Japan provide examples of economies with impressive rates of productivity increase along with buoyant demand reflecting more than anything else extremely high quotas of investment Clearly we need not fear that the increasing productivity associated with even a speeded-up rate of technological progress will founder upon a contradiction between our needs and our ability to satisfy them. As people continue to receive the extra incomes which our enlarging production can generate they will also continue to use those extra incomes to buy the enlarged output for private and public consumption and for investment The second question raised about our ability to adjust to automation concerns the labor force adjustments it necessitates If the advance of technological progress has speeded up it is reasonable to suppose that as a by-product the rate at which particular skills are rendered obsolescent is also increasing. But a further and different point is sometimes made namely that automation ( in its narrower technical sense ) is shifting not merely the rate but the character of skill requirements generated by technological change. Previously it is suggested technological change simplified the work process and hence created many semiskilled jobs which could be filled by workers with little training. Automation however reintegrates the production process and thus eliminates many unskilled and semi-skilled jobs Whether this interpretation is correct is a highly complex empirical question. Many of the jobs displaced by automation are low-skilled and some of the jobs added are extremely high-skilled. The design and installation of automation equipment surely requires highly trained personnel Yet the need for these people is clearly limited and they do not stay with the equipment long after installation. Once in operation the equipment may actually diminish rather than raise skill requirements. Examples of highly automated installations have been cited where all of the maintenance is done by high school graduates with a fairly short trade school course in electronic repair. High skills are required for the programming function but this also tends to be concentrated in the initial stages and " canned " programs are increasingly available in some applications. A good deal more study and experience is needed before we can safely generalize about the impact of automation on skill requirements for the labor force as a whole Beyond the question of how automation ( in the narrow sense ) affects average skill requirements lies the broader question of the impact on labor markets of any general acceleration that may occur in the rate of technological advance. This broader question involves at least two dimensions A " vertical " dimension relates to the impact of speeded technological change on the long-term rate of increase in the average educational content of jobs. As noted repeatedly our past rapid increase in educational levels has both responded to and helped bring about our steady technological advance and rising productivity. The exact nature of the complex interrelationships between the average educational accomplishment of the labor force job educational requirements and a further speeding up of the pace of technological advance is a matter for some speculaion. But whatever the answer more and better education will continue to have one of the highest priorities among the values of American society The " horizontal " dimension of our question requires less speculation. We can be certain that a speeded pace of technological change will increase the rate of job displacement and will require even greater attention to measures for improving labor mobility for training and retraining of workers and for an effective level of basic education to promote adaptability and flexibility. The possibility of an accelerated pace of technical change thus underscores an already powerful case for stonger labor market policies to meet existing problems of displacement Our past economic growth has brought unparalleled levels of well-being for all in our society. Today we need and we actively seek even higher levels of productivity to help us solve both domestic and international problems If as a result of our policies to stimulate investment and improve efficiency or as an unexpected bonus from autonomous developments in technology the U.S. rate of productivity growth accelerates we may encounter problems but we will reap large rewards. If we pursue appropriate policies we can meet the challenge of automation VII CONCLUSIONS This statement has been long and necessarily complex. But the issues involved are of the highest urgency and significance for the economic future of our Nation and they are far from simple. In so characterizing them we know we share the view of this Subcommittee which has been so tirelessly pursuing all aspects of this subject We have tried to draw our conclusions from the evidence as we have gone along and therefore need only pull them together here. These are our principal conclusions : O-64-13 Enactment of the major tax reduction program which is now before the Senate is a necessary condition for solution of the problems that concern this Subcommittee. It will directly add $ billion to total output and create to million extra jobs. Without the continuing lift in total demands for goods and services that the tax program is designed to accomplish little progress can be expected in reducing and eliminating problems of excessive unemployment for the Nation as a whole. Had this lift in demand been effective in the years through it would have overcome economic slack ; achieved a considerably higher level of output of needed goods and services ; maintained unemployment rates comparable with those realized in the years before ; and in the process reduced or eliminated our budget deficits Although tax reduction will alleviate it will not by itself cure longstanding problems of structural unemployment of incomplete adaptation of the structure of our labor force to the structure of demand of regional imbalances and of consequent hardship inequity and inefficiency. The need to attack these problems stems first from our concern to alleviate unnecessary human distress. Second it stems from the desire to convert unproductive and unwanted idleness into productive employment so that we can increase our output of needed goods and services even beyond the potential output associated with our interim target of a 4-percent rate of unemployment. And third if the rate of technological displacement of workers is in the process of accelerating it will need to be matched by a similar increase in the mobility and adaptability of our labor force This Administration has placed high priority upon measures to accelerate our productivity gains through the stimulation of investment by tax measures the improvement of technology in lagging sectors of the civilian economy and in other ways with the urgent purpose of improving the competitive position of American producers in world markets and of stepping up our long-term growth rate. It has promoted policies designed to realize the benefits of maximum productive efficiency policies which may require shifts in our resource use and consequent displacement of labor It would be irresponsible not to complement these policies with others designed to facilitate the transfer of resources and to ease necessary burdens of adjustment as indeed was done in the " adjustment " provisions of the Trade Expansion Act Without attempting to be comprehensive we can indicate some of the important channels of attack on structural problems : improved labor market information services ; improved guidance and placement services ; improved programs of apprenticeship ; strengthened programs to reduce discriminatory hiring and employment practices by race sex or national origin ; expanded and more effective programs of vocational education general adult education and retraining ; basic improvements in the quality of our educational system at all levels ; measures to enlarge educational opportunities for children of low income families and minority groups ; programs to assist the geographical movement of workers ; expanded policies to strengthen the economic base and to speed the economic growth of distressed communities and regions The tax cut and other measures to expand total demand are no substitute for policies like these ; while these policies in turn are no substitute for a tax cut. Yet a more vigorous expansion of demand will release forces that will powerfully aid in the solution of structural problems. The existence of a stronger demand for labor will by itself strengthen the incentives for workers to undertake training or retraining and for employers to help provide it ; will attract workers to move to the places where jobs are plentiful and stimulate employers to assist such movement ; will ease the financial burdens on local communities in undertaking improvements in their educational systems ; will reduce discriminatory practices both by employers and by unions ; and will increase the effectiveness of the free-market price system in encouraging appropriate adjustments of both labor supply and labor demand the need for which is now partly obscured by slack markets Important as is the attack on structural problems we need not fear that structural obstacles will block a healthy expansion of jobs and output resulting from the tax cut. The feasibility of our 4-percent interim target assumes not some newly perfected system of labor market adjustment but the labor market as it exists today with its present adjustment mechanism. Possible and desirable improvements in our labor market adjustment processes can smooth and accelerate achievement of the interim target. And they can permit us to penetrate beyond it to even lower unemployment rates. But it is on demand stimulus that we must rely to get to the provisional 4-percent objective There are hopeful hints in the most recent evidence that we may be achieving a somewhat higher rate of average productivity growth than in the past although it is too early to be sure. If our potential output per worker should grow more rapidly in the future than in the past it would mean that an even more rapid expansion of total demand would be required to reach and maintain reasonably full employment of the labor force But we see no basis for fears that our wants and needs are already satiated or that total spending will fail to rise with potential output and thus thwart faster expansion. It is true that demand does not automatically adjust yearby-year to the growth of potential output. But there is no reason to suppose that demand is more likely to be deficient when potential output is more rapidly growing than when growth in potential output is less dynamic On the contrary the conditions that are conducive to faster productivity growth are also conducive to more rapid expansion in private demands Instead of fearing an accelerated growth of productivity we should and do seek it to achieve more fully our private and public domestic economic goals ; to help us correct our balance-of-payments deficit ; and to raise the standard and quality of life for all of our citizens Appendix B REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS DURING LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL DECEMBER The PRESIDENT SIR : The Council of Economic Advisers submits this report on its activities during the calendar year in accordance with the requirements of Congress as set forth in Section ( d ) of the Employment Act of Respectfully WALTER W.

Government enterprises are those agencies of government whose operating costs are at least to a substantial extent covered by the sale of goods and services in contrast to theSgeneral activities of government which are financed mainly by tax revenues and debt creation. Government enterprises in other words conduct operations essentially commercial in character even though they perform them under governmental auspices. The Post Office and public power systems are typical examples of government enterprises.

Figures beginning have been revised since the Economic Report of the President January In addition to the concept of saving shown above there are other concepts of individuals ' saving with varying degrees of coverage currently in use. The personal saving estimates of the Department of Commerce are derived as the difference between disposable personal income and expenditures. Conceptually Commerce saving includes the following items not included in Securities and Exchange Commission saving : housing farm and unincorporated business investment in inventories and plant and equipment net of depreciation and increase in debt. Government insurance is excluded from the Commerce saving series. For a reconciliation of the two series see Securities and Exchange Commission Statistical Bulletin July and Survey of Current Business July Theflow-of-fundssystem of accounts of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System includes capital investments as well as financial components of saving and covers saving of Federal State and local governments businesses financial institutions and consumers. While the Federal Reserve 's estimates of consumer saving in financial form are similar to the Securities and Exchange Commission estimates of individuals ' saving there are some statistical and conceptual differences in the two sets of data Revisions for in the consumer credit statistics of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System have not yet been incorporated into these estimates Data for Alaska and Hawaii included for all periods 8ource : Securities and Exchange Commission TABLE C-18.
