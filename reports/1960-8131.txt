LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL

THE WHITE HOUSE,

January 20}1960.
To the Congress of the United States:
I present herewith my Economic Report, as required by Section 3(a) of
the Employment Act of 1946.
The Report was prepared with the advice and assistance of the Council
of Economic Advisers and of the heads of the executive departments and
independent agencies directly concerned with the matters it discusses. It
summarizes the economic developments of the year and the steps taken in
major areas of economic policy to promote the sound expansion of employment, production, and income. It also puts forward a program for
the year 1960 which, in the context of present and prospective economic
conditions, would effectively implement the purposes of the Employment
Act.
The major conclusions and recommendations of the Report are set forth
below, in part in the words of the Report itself.
By the first quarter of 1959, the recovery that started early in 1958
had already carried production and income to levels higher than ever
before attained in the American economy. A considerable further advance
was scored during the remainder of 1959, despite the deep effect of the
116-day strike in the steel industry.
The Nation's output of goods and services in the fourth quarter of 1959
was at an annual rate of $482 billion. When adjusted for price changes,
this rate of output was 3/2 percent higher than the rate attained in the
corresponding period in 1958. By December 1959, total employment had
reached a record level, 66.2 million, on a seasonally adjusted basis. And
personal income payments in December were at an annual rate of $391
billion, $24 billion greater than a year earlier. After adjustment for increases in prices, the rise in total personal income in 1959 represented a
gain of nearly 5 percent in the real buying power of our Nation.
As we look ahead, there are good grounds for confidence that this
economic advance can be extended through 1960. Furthermore, with appropriate private actions and public policies, it can carry well beyond the
present year.




Hi

However, as always in periods of rapid economic expansion, we must
avoid speculative excesses and actions that would compress gains into so
short a period that the rate of growth could not be sustained. We must
seek, through both private actions and public policies, to minimize and contain inflationary pressures that could undermine the basis for a high, continuing rate of growth.
Three elements stand out in the Government's program for realizing
the objectives of high production, employment, and income set forth in the
Employment Act: first, favorable action by the Congress on the recommendations for appropriations and for measures affecting Federal revenues
presented in the Budget for the fiscal year 1961; second, use of the resulting surplus, now estimated at $4.2 billion, to retire Federal debt; third,
action by the Congress to remove the interest rate limitation that currently
inhibits the noninflationary management of the Federal debt. Numerous
additional proposals, many of which are described in Chapter 4 of the
Economic Report, will be made to supplement the Federal Government's
existing economic and financial programs.
Following the budget balance now in prospect for the fiscal year 1960,
these three elements of the 1960 program will strengthen and be
strengthened by the essential contributions to sustainable economic growth
made through the policies of the independent Federal Reserve System. Fiscal and monetary policies, which are powerful instruments for preventing
the development of inflationary pressures, can effectively reinforce one
another.
But these Government policies must be supplemented by appropriate
private actions, especially with respect to profits and wages. In our system
of free competitive enterprise and shared responsibility, we do not rely
on Government alone for the achievement of inflation-free economic
growth. On the contrary, that achievement requires a blending of suitable
private actions and public policies. Our success in realizing the opportunities that lie ahead will therefore depend in large part upon the ways
in which business management, labor leaders, and consumers perform their
own economic functions.
A well-informed and vigilant public opinion is essential in our free
society for helping achieve the conditions necessary for price stability and
vigorous economic growth. Such public opinion can be an effective safeguard against attempts arbitrarily to establish prices or wages at levels that
are inconsistent with the general welfare. Informed public opinion is also
necessary to support the laws and regulations that provide the framework
for the conduct of our economic affairs.
Further progress is needed in establishing a broad public understanding
of the relationships of productivity and rewards to costs and prices. It
would be a grave mistake to believe that we can successfully substitute legislation or controls for such understanding. Indeed, the complex relationships involved cannot be fixed by law, and attempts to determine them by




rv

restrictive governmental action would jeopardize our freedoms and other
conditions essential to sound economic growth.
Our system of free institutions and shared responsibility has served us
well in achieving economic growth and improvement. From our past experience, we are confident that our changing and increasing needs in the
future can be met within this flexible system, which gains strength from
the incentive it provides for individuals, from the scope it affords for individual initiative and action, and from the assurance it gives that government remains responsive to the will of the people.

Economic Growth in a Free Society

T

HE VIGOR of the underlying forces that make for growth in the
American economy was clearly evident in 1959. Employment, production, and income at the end of the year were substantially above the levels
reached at the end of 1958, despite the prolonged strike in the steel industry. As this Economic Report is transmitted to the Congress, the outlook
is good for an extension of growth through 1960 and beyond.
In these circumstances, it is appropriate that the first chapter of this
Report should be addressed to the question of how best to extend economic
growth into the years ahead at a high and sustainable rate and in ways that
strengthen and reinforce our political and economic freedoms. Other
chapters of the Report summarize the leading economic developments in
1959; describe the policies that were pursued in the past year to promote
higher employment, production, and purchasing power; and set forth the
Administration's 1960 program for extending the Nation's economic progress.
RECORD OF GROWTH IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY
A few facts illustrate the ability of the American economy to continue
raising what has long been the highest living scale in the world, while
carrying a heavy defense burden and meeting broad international obligations.
In the 14 years since the passage of the Employment Act, employment
has advanced, on the average, by nearly 800,000 a year. In real terms,
the Nation's output of goods and services, as well as its personal income,
has increased by more than 50 percent, or at a rate of 3.2 percent per
year; and the output of the private sector of the economy has advanced
at a slightly higher rate, 3.5 percent. For industrial production, the rate of
increase has been 4.5 percent. The annual increase of 3.2 percent in total
national output, which corresponds to a doubling every 22 years, is roughly
equivalent to the long-term average reached in our previous history. Thus,
the American economy has sustained its long-term record of growth, despite
the high level of industrial development already achieved and despite
temporary setbacks.
The increase in national output has made possible very great gains in the
well-being of American families. Evidence of the advances made in this
respect since passage of the Employment Act is presented in the Appendix




on "Diffusion of Well-Being" included in this Report. Real income per
capita has increased by nearly 20 percent since 1946, and the increase
per family has been 16 percent. As incomes have risen and as paid vacations
have become longer and more common, leisure time has increased and
recreational activities have become more widely enjoyed. The shortage
of housing so evident immediately after World War II has been virtually
eliminated. Since 1946, the housing supply has been increased by the construction of 15 million private nonfarm dwelling units, and there have
been marked improvements in the quality of housing. At the same time,
there has been a general increase in home ownership; some 60 percent of
all nonfarm dwelling units are owned by the occupant families.
Attention to such material advances should not obscure the accompanying
gains made with respect to other components of our well-being, some of
which are less tangible. In health, there has been remarkable progress in
the reduction of infant and maternal mortality, in the prevention, mitigation,
and treatment of many diseases, in restoring the physically handicapped, in
making available a better balanced diet at lower cost, and in creating other
conditions conducive to longer years of life and greater efficiency. Health
services are more and more widely available, and the great majority of
Americans now have some protection under voluntary plans of hospital,
surgical, and medical insurance.
Notable gains have been made in education and other cultural areas.
School enrollment has risen in the last 12 years from 50 percent to about
65 percent of all persons in the age group of 5 to 29 years. From 1946
to 1959, the number of Bachelor's and first professional degrees conferred
annually almost trebled, and the number of Master's and second professional
degrees showed a still greater relative increase. To some extent, these
advances represent the resumption of academic work interrupted by war,
but the large gains made in the past few years indicate a rising trend that
will accelerate in the years ahead. The number of earned Doctorates conferred rose sharply after the war, reaching in 1954 a new high, which has
been maintained for several years. In the past decade, more than 83,000
Doctorates have been conferred, compared with some 27,000 during the
1930's and about 31,000 in the 1940's. Marked increases are expected
also in the next several years. Another source of satisfaction is the record of
scientific achievement. Since 1946, close to half of the Nobel awards for
contributions to medicine, chemistry, and physics have been bestowed on
American citizens.
The economic security of American families has been advanced significantly in the years since World War II. About 58 million personsâ€”87 percent of all those in paid employmentâ€”are now covered by the Federal
Government's old-age, survivors, and disability insurance system and related
programs. More than 19 million persons are covered by privately financed
pension plans. The Federal-State Unemployment Compensation System,
which has proved its worth as a defense against loss of income during periods




of economic adversity, now provides protection for nearly 85 percent of
all persons on nonfarm payrolls.
But the progress made under Government programs should not divert
attention from the extensive provisions made independently by Americans
for personal and family security. The number of life insurance policyholders, for example, has increased by about 60 percent since 1946; about
115 million persons were insured through legal reserve companies in 1959.
The volume of time and savings deposits of individuals has increased by
nearly $35 billion, or more than 50 percent, since 1952. Share accounts
in savings and loan associations have also risen by $35 billion in this periodâ€”
by nearly 200 percent.
And it is not too much to say that we have made good progress in moderating fluctuations in our economy. Although economic recessions, however
minor, must remain a matter of concern to all Americans, the relative
mildness and short duration of the three since the war have to be reckoned
as a major factor in the strengthening of personal security.
NEW CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
These improvements in the well-being of the American people offer convincing testimony of the productiveness of our free economy and the wide
distribution of its annual yield. Continuing efforts are needed, however, to
assure that advances are extended into the future at high rates.
One important line of progress to this end is the lessening of fluctuations
in our economic development. Although the severity and duration of economic recessions have been limited in the postwar period, we must strive
for a steadier rate of growth. This would not only reduce the personal
hardships incident to economic setbacks but could also yield a higher
annual rate of growth over a period of years.
In addition to lessening cyclical declines in employment, efforts should
be made to improve the skills of our labor force and to make consistently
fuller use of economic resources in all parts of the Nation. In general, unemployment rates in the United States have not been high for an economy
which allows and experiences considerable labor mobility and job change,
but they can and should be lower. Since unemployment is typically highest
among those persons with inadequate training in the skills demanded by a
dynamic industrial economy, better schooling and improved counseling services are clearly desirable. Also, while advances in economic activity and in
well-being have been widely shared, constructive measures are needed to
draw more fully into the mainstream of economic growth those communities and areas that experience persistently high unemployment.
In the decade we have just entered, a new factorâ€”the expected sharp
increase in the labor forceâ€”will require, and will help to achieve, more
rapid economic growth. Over the past decade, our labor force increased
at an average rate of about 825,000 a year. But the sharp rise in births




in the years since the war means that the annual increase in the number
of persons available for employment will rise rapidly in the next ten years.
Projections suggest something close to a doubling of this annual increment
to the labor force by the end of the 1960's. The rapid expansion of our
manpower will offer a unique opportunity for increasing our rate of output.
By the same token, our economy will have to supply additional employment
openings, by the end of the decade, at a rate twice that required in the
1950's.
The coming of age of this large group of young people will also require
great increases in the output of housing and of consumer goods and services
of all kinds, as new families are formed and new households are established
in increasing numbers. Meeting these output and employment demands
in the next decade will require a vast increase in savings and invested capital
to supply needed tools and facilities. It will require continuing extensive
private and public support of basic and applied research. It also will require greater efforts, primarily by local and State governments and private
groups, in education and training.
Success in providing the additional new job opportunities would, of
itself, accelerate our rate of economic growth. By the end of the 1960's,
this acceleration and an improvement in productivity similar to the average
for recent decades would yield an annual national output close to half
again what it is today. And this performance could be bettered if we
succeed in creating conditions that favor a higher rate of increase in
productivity.
SHARED RESPONSIBILITY FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND IMPROVEMENT
The economic tasks of the next decade pose impressive challenges, but
there is every reason to believe that they will be met, just as similar challenges have been met in the past. We should regard these challenges as
opportunities, and recognize that we have great advantages as we go about
meeting them. A large productive base already exists in the American
economy, and our competitive enterprise system is well able to expand this
base as needs increase. The ideals, freedoms, incentives, and rewards of our
enterprise society are powerful forces in directing efforts and material
resources to the meeting of new tests. And our traditional and proven
system of sharing responsibility for economic growth and improvement between the private and public spheres of our society, and among the several
levels of government, provides a means for guiding those efforts along fruitful lines.
The premises of this system of shared responsibility, recognized by the
Congress in Section 2 of the Employment Act, deserve renewed emphasis
as we prepare for the challenges and opportunities of the new decade. In
our society, the maintenance of a climate conducive to orderly and vigorous
economic growth is not exclusively the function of government. Indeed,
excessive reliance on governmental machinery may not only frustrate the




quest for steady growth and reasonably stable prices, but may also have
undesirable consequences for our economic system and our freedoms. The
more effective the job done by individuals and private groups and by government at the State and community levels, the less the danger of Federal
encroachment in areas that have traditionally been the province of private
enterprise and of local government. Our various levels of government and
private individuals and groups have distinctive roles in our free society's
system of shared responsibility. At this point it is well to recall these roles,
with particular reference to the problem of maintaining a high rate of
economic growth.
Roles of Government
In a free society, government makes its major contribution to economic
growth by fostering conditions that encourage and reinforce the efforts of
individuals and private groups to improve their circumstances. This includes the preservation and enhancement of competition, the maintenance
of a stable currency, the moderation of fluctuations in employment and output, participation in the development of human and natural resources,
the enhancement of personal security, provision of a sound national defense,
and the maintenance of mutually advantageous ties with other countries.
Responsibility for many of these roles is divided among the various
levels of government, but none can be carried out adequately without the
initiative and cooperation of individuals and private groups. This network
of relationships is the product of our history. It embodies the American
concept of government as the responsive instrument of the people.
The Federal Government's contribution toward preserving and strengthening the institutions of our competitive enterprise system, to which the
Employment Act properly directs attention, is of special importance. Open
markets perform the essential task of channeling economic resources into
the uses that businessmen and consumers deem most satisfactory; in this
way, they contribute to the productiveness of our economy and to the quality
of our living. They should remain free of unwarranted restraints. Leaders
of business, labor, farming, and the professions, as well as the various levels
of government, have responsibilities for maintaining the openness and resiliency of our economic system. The competitive nature of this system is
closely linked to our ideals of freedom and individual initiative, which have
far more than economic significance. A free society, free political institutions, and a free economy are interdependent and reinforce each other.
As indicated earlier, Federal action to help smooth out economic fluctuations affords another opportunity to promote growth. Deep and prolonged
declines of production, involving substantial reductions in investment, not
only interrupt current advance but impede future growth. It is widely
acknowledged that to avoid such declines Government should take measures,
appropriately designed and timed, to counter recessionary tendencies. It




is also important that appropriate measures should be taken to restrain
surges in economic activity that might lead to drastic corrections.
Governmental decisions regarding the volume and character of public
expenditures have powerful effects on the health of the economy and on
its prospects for vigorous and sustainable growth. Especially in a briskly
growing economyâ€”the kind to be expected in the current decadeâ€”
demands on economic resources are heavy and rising, and public outlays
are made at the expense of private spending. The public use of funds,
whether to continue established programs or to initiate new ones, must be
justified on the ground that it makes a larger contribution to well-being
and economic strength than could be made by their private use. The entire
range of Federal spending must be continuously under review, with this
criterion in mind. Many public programs make important contributions
to growth, both directly by increasing the productive capacity of individuals
and business firms and indirectly by facilitating and encouraging the greater
private investment that enlarges our capacity for future production. It
must always be borne in mind, however, that we grow only by investing
more and producing more, not simply by spending more.
The way taxes are levied also affects the advance of productivity and
output. We must remain alert to the possibility of making the tax system
a more effective instrument for promoting economic growth. Taxes affect
the ability of individuals and corporations to save. Likewise, their impact on the risk and return of investment influences the willingness to
make productive use of savings. Our tax system should give encouragement
to productive effort and should facilitate the mobility and efficient use of
capital. We should continue to review our tax system from these standpoints, as well as from the standpoint of equity.
The Federal Government can make a basic contribution to an environment favorable to economic growth through a constructive, forward-looking
management of its finances. To meet this vital responsibility in fiscal affairs, while performing its functions adequately, Government must give
clear evidence, in actual results, of its ability and determination to control
its expenditures. When the Nation is prosperous, as it is today, with
production, employment, and incomes rising, the most appropriate fiscal
policy is one that provides a sizable excess of Federal revenues over Federal
expenditures. In the economic circumstances now prevailing and expected in the near future, a budgetary surplus used to retire debt would
be a powerful aid in helping to restrain inflationary pressures and to promote sound growth. The added savings which it would supply to the
economy would help keep interest rates lower than otherwise, and facilitate
private investment activity and the financing of public projects by State
and local governments. The monetary authorities would have a freer hand
in pursuing policies aimed at promoting steady, inflation-free growth. And
such a fiscal policy would be a potent instrument for strengthening confidence in the dollar at home and abroad. Indeed, a sizable budget surplus




6

at this time, used to retire Federal debt, would effectively implement the
objectives proclaimed in the Employment Act.
Roles of Individuals and Private Groups
Since the vast majority of economic decisions in a free society are made
by private individuals and groups, the rate at which national output grows
and the character of that output are determined chiefly by private attitudes
and actions. The expenditures of consumers command about two-thirds
of the Nation's total product, and private investment expenditures command another one-eighth, or more. Individuals and business concerns
supply the bulk of the Nation's savings, and the major responsibility for
directing these savings into private and public investment rests with private
institutions. Finally, as citizens of a democracy, individuals determine
directly or through chosen representatives what they want done through
government, and at what cost. Obviously, the performance of our free
economy depends largely on how individuals and private groups fulfill their
many critical roles.
In their key role as consumers, individuals can contribute to the Nation's
economic strength by spending wisely, just as government, acting as their
agent, can promote growth by prudence in its spending. By the use to
which they put their income they determine in large measure how economic
resources are allocated. And in buying carefully for price and quality,
they exert a restraining influence on the cost of living.
Individuals and corporate groups, in their roles as business leaders, can
help strengthen the economy by the use they make of the resources under
their control. They may be able to speed the increase in productivity in
the private sector through allocating a greater share of these resources to
investment and research and through pricing policies that favor the expansion of markets. Also, they can speed growth by upgrading worker
skills, by improving the skills of management, and by eliminating wasteful
practices.
Equally, leaders of labor have an opportunity as well as a responsibility
to help realize more fully the Nation's economic potential. They can
contribute significantly in this direction by fostering arrangements favorable
to higher labor productivity.
And leaders of business and labor have a joint responsibility for facilitating economic growth through the conduct and results of collective bargaining. This responsibility is especially great in industries that are basic to
the Nation's defenses and economic health. Events of the past year demonstrate the damage that can be done when established methods for settling
industrial disputes break down. An obvious way to achieve our economic
potential more fully is to improve on this aspect of the past year's record.
Labor-management disputes in basic industries should be settled promptly,
preferably without recourse to strikes, and certainly without extended interruptions of production that cause widespread dislocation and unemploy533287 i




ment and threaten to paralyze our entire economy. They should be settled
also on terms that are fair to the public at large as well as to the parties
directly involved.
Labor-management negotiations in all industries offer opportunities to
help promote sound growth by avoiding settlements that contribute to inflation. Settlements should not be such as to cause the national average
of wage rate increases to exceed sustainable rates of improvement in national productivity. A national wage pattern that fails to meet this
criterion would put an upward pressure on the price level. Hourly rates
of pay and related labor benefits can, of course, be increased without
jeopardizing price stability. Indeed, such increases are the major means
in our free economy by which labor shares in the fruits of industrial progress. But improvements in compensation rates must, on the average,
remain within the limits of general productivity gains if reasonable stability
of prices is to be achieved and maintained. Furthermore, price reductions warranted by especially rapid productivity gains must be a normal
and frequent feature of our economy. Without such reductions we shall
not be able to keep the price level as a whole from advancing.
A well-informed and vigilant public opinion is essential in our free society
for helping achieve the conditions necessary for price stability and vigorous
economic growth. Such public opinion can be an effective safeguard
against attempts arbitrarily to establish prices or wages at levels that are
inconsistent with the general welfare. Informed public opinion is also
necessary to support the laws and regulations that provide the framework
for the conduct of our economic affairs.
However, we must go further in establishing a broad public understanding of the relationships of productivity and rewards to costs and
prices. It would be a grave mistake to believe that we can successfully
substitute legislation or controls for such understanding. Indeed, the
complex relationships involved cannot be fixed by law, and attempts to
determine them by restrictive governmental action would jeopardize our
freedoms and other conditions essential to sound economic growth.
Our system of free institutions and shared responsibility has served us
well in achieving economic gro\yth and improvement. From our past
experience, we are confident that our changing and increasing needs in the
future can be met within this flexible system, which gains strength from the
incentive it provides for individuals, from the scope it affords for
individual initiative and action, and from the assurance it gives that
government remains responsive to the will of the people.




Chapter 2
Economic Developments in 1959
HE ECONOMIC RECOVERY in the United States that started
early in 1958 carried production and incomes to new high levels
by the first quarter of 1959. The Nation's output, in terms of the physical
volume of goods and services, surpassed its previous peak. The flow of
income payments also exceeded the previous record, and civilian employment, though still below the high reached in the second quarter of 1957,
was 1.2 million greater than in mid-1958, after seasonal adjustments.
These advances were extended into 1959, though economic activity
was sharply affected by the 116-day steel strike which began on July 15.
Developments in the steel industry had first an expansive, and then an
increasingly contractive, effect. Anticipatory purchases of steel and products of steel quickened the advance in the Nation's output in the first half
of the year, but led to a drop in gross national product in the third
quarter, as about 85 percent of steel capacity was idled and the output
of steel-using products had to be sustained in the main out of previously
produced steel supplies. Still, by the end of the year, the Nation's
aggregate output amounted to $482 billion, on an annual rate basis;
employment had risen to 66.2 million (seasonally adjusted), the highest
in the Nation's history; and personal income was being received at the
rate of $391 billion a year, 5 percent (adjusted for price changes) higher
than in the last month of 1958.

T

EXPANSION OF OUTPUT
The rapid rise in general economic activity already in progress as 1959
began raised output to $484.5 billion in the second quarter of the year
(Chart 1). This exceptionally rapid expansion reflected not only the abnormal demand for inventories induced by the expectation of a steel strike,
but also a substantial, continuing increase in the final demand for goods and
services. To a certain extent, these two factors reinforced one another, but
increasing outlays by business concerns on plant and equipment, rising
expenditures on residential construction, and increased purchases of durable
goods by consumers had significant independent effects in stimulating the
expansion of production, employment, and income.

The shift between early 1958 and mid-1959 in the inventory policies of
business had a marked economic effect. Inventory accumulation began
in the latter part of 1958, following a full year of liquidation. It
quickened during the first half of 1959, as business firms replenished
their stocks of materials and finished goods to meet rising operating needs;
and it became especially rapid in the second quarter of the year as businesses
sought to assure continuance of their operations in the event of an interruption of steel production. Approximately one-third of the inventory
accumulation in the second quarter was attributable to increased holdings
of steel mill products. And inventory accumulation alone was equal to
one-third of the rise in gross national product from the 1958 recession low
to the 1959 high.
The advance in final purchases of goods and services which began in
the second quarter of 1958 also reached a peak rate in the second quarter




10

of 1959. Virtually all the main categories of final purchases increased.
Improved investment opportunities, supported by higher business earnings
and retained income, provided a basis for increased business outlays on plant
and equipment. These rose by about 10 percent, from a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $33.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 1958 to $36.6
billion in the second quarter of 1959 (Table D-8). Within nonfarm
business investment outlays, expenditures on equipment moved forward
somewhat more swiftly, rising approximately 14 percent from the end of
1958 to mid-1959. But nonresidential construction grew at a slower rate,
as substantial expenditures for public utility and commercial projects were
partially offset by a decline in factory building. Residential construction,
on the other hand, rose rapidly in the early months of 1959. The public
sector of the economy provided a moderately expansive impetus to aggregate output. State and local purchases of goods and services continued to
rise, while those of the Federal Government remained stable. Net exports
were the single contractive factor among the major components of national
output, declining from $0.2 billion at the close of 1958 to minus $1.8 billion
(on a national accounts basis) in the second quarter of 1959.
The underlying strength in these categories of final purchases of goods
and services helped bring about a rise in employment and income, and
consumers responded by expanding their outlays substantially. A further
rise of income incident to the production of goods to meet abnormal inventory needs, particularly in the second quarter, also helped to swell consumer
incomes and spending. And consumer confidence, reflected in high personal borrowings, brought particular strength to purchases of durable goods.
Economic developments in the second half of the year were also greatly
affected by the inventory factor. In this case, however, it exerted, on
balance, a pronounced contractive influence. Largely reflecting reductions
of holdings by manufacturers and retail dealers affected by the steel strike,
inventoriesâ€”which had been accumulated at an annual rate of $10.4 billion
in the second quarterâ€”were reduced by $1 billion in the third quarter.
This reduction was the dominant economic force in that quarter. Although
making possible a continued though less pronounced increase in final purchases, the drawing down of inventories incident to the stoppage in steel
production resulted in a rather sharp dropâ€”$6 billionâ€”in gross national
product. During the fourth quarter of the year, deficiencies and imbalances of steel inventories moderated the growth of final purchases, despite
the resumption of steel production in November. As a result, the increase
in gross national product (GNP) was limited to $3.4 billion, and most of
the recovery in economic activity expected after the strike was postponed
beyond the end of the year. Nevertheless, GNP in the fourth quarter
was nearly $25 billion (annual rate) above the level in the fourth
quarter of 1958.




1I

Divergent movements in the second half of the year in the major
components of national output reflected, in part, the impact of steel shortages. Sales of consumer durable goods, which had been rising rapidly, fell
as demands could not be fully met. New construction expenditures, which
had been very high in early 1959, decreased noticeably, though part of
this decline may have reflected the increased competition for funds arising in
other sectors of the economy. On the other hand, purchases of consumer
nondurable goods and services and of producer durable equipment, and
purchases by State and local governments continued to advance in the
second half of the year. And net exports of goods and services, which had
been a contractive influence before midyear, became moderately expansive.
EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME
The gains in employment and earnings that followed the upturn of the
economy in 1958 were extended at a rapid rate into 1959. By January,
the average length of the manufacturing workweek had increased to 40.1
hours (seasonally adjusted), from a recession low of 38.7 hours. Total
civilian employment had risen by more than 1 million (seasonally adjusted)
from its cyclical low, and unemployment had been reduced from the recession high of 7/2 percent of the civilian labor force to 6 percent.
As the year advanced, economic expansion brought about increasingly
heavy demands for labor. The average length of the workweek in manufacturing industries advanced to 40.7 hours in April, the highest since April
1956, and the average amount of overtime for production workers increased
rapidly, to almost 3 hours a week in June. Longer workweeks and increased overtime were the rule also in most nonmanufacturing industries.
Unemployment changed very little during the early months of 1959,
because the expansion in employment was nearly matched by the growth of
the labor force. But in the early spring, as production reached record
levels, the number of employed persons rose swiftly, exceeding the growth in
the labor force, and unemployment declined. Total nonfarm employment
expanded by nearly 1.3 million (seasonally adjusted) in the four months
from February to June 1959, and unemployment was reduced by 750,000.
By midyear, unemployment had fallen to about 5 percent of the labor force;
long-term unemploymentâ€”the number of individuals seeking work for 15
weeks or moreâ€”was 1 million below its recession high of nearly 2 million;
unemployment among men 25 years of age and over was sharply below
that in 1958; and the unemployment rate for family men in June 1959 was
2.7 percent, likewise far below its recession high. Nevertheless, these unemployment rates were above those prevailing prior to the 1957â€”58 recession,
and unemployment remained comparatively high, especially for persons
lacking work experience, for mining employees, and for nonwhite persons.
However, total unemployment was being reduced at a rapid rate until the
trend was reversed in July by the beginning of the steel strike (Chart 2).

After some 500,000 employees in the steel industry went on strike on
July 15, nearly 100,000 other persons were soon laid off in related industries,
especially in mining and rail transportation. Even though substantial inventories of steel had been accumulated by many firms, stocks were being depleted rapidly by mid-October and serious imbalances were making themselves felt. As a result, layoffs became increasingly heavy. By the time
steel production was resumed on November 7, under a Federal court injunction, employment in steel-related industries had declined by more than
500,000, exclusive of the number on strike. In most other industries,
employment ceased to advance during this period, and in October the rate
of unemployment increased to 6.0 percent of the civilian labor force.
The resumption of steel production brought an increase in employment
by the end of the year, and unemployment was again reduced. Although
the replenishment of working stocks of steel could not be accomplished
immediately, total employment reached 66.2 million (seasonally adjusted)
in December, slightly above the record of 66.0 million that had been
attained in June. Unemployment in December was 3.6 million (seasonally
adjusted), or 5.2 percent of the labor force.
The employment situation in areas of heavy labor surplus was improved
significantly by the economic advance of 1959. Although in November
1959 there were 29 major continental labor markets where unemployment
exceeded 6 percent of the labor force, the number of such areas was far
below the peak of 86 reported in July and September of 1958. And by
November 1959, unemployment had fallen below the 3 percent level in 27
major areas. Also, most labor market areas, regardless of their over-all
unemployment situation, experienced shortages in 1959 of certain types of
workers, notably professional, technical, clerical, and skilled.
The improving employment situation was reflected in substantial gains
in personal income. In the early months of 1959, higher hourly wage rates
supplemented the effects of longer workweeks and more extensive overtime employment on average weekly earnings (Chart 3). Wage rates in
manufacturing industries advanced in the first six months of the year by
about 2 percent, on the average. On an annual rate basis, this gain was
about the same as the increases in 1957 and 1958. Average weekly earnings for workers in these industries were 4.5 percent higher in the first six
months of 1959 than in the last six months of 1958. In nonmanufacturing
industries, also, earnings of workers increased. Despite the fact that the
advance of weekly earnings and employment was interrupted by the strike
in the second half of the year, wage and salary payments in the fourth
quarter exceeded payments a year earlier by $16.4 billion, or 6.7 percent.
Other forms of personal income, not as large in dollar terms as wages
and salariesâ€”personal interest, dividends, incomes of nonfarm proprietors
(including self-employed professional persons), and transfer paymentsâ€”
also rose above their levels at the end of 1958. Rental income increased
slightly, while the income of farm proprietors declined. The aggregate of

all these income paymentsâ€”total personal incomeâ€”rose by $20.3 billion,
or 5.5 percent, and the amount of income available for spending and saving
after the payment of personal income taxesâ€”disposable personal incomeâ€”
increased at the same rate.
Since prices were relatively stable in much of the first half of the year,
the increases in disposable income were reflected almost entirely in increases
in real income. In the next six months, however, part of the gain was
offset by increases in prices. Over the year as a whole, per capita disposable
income, in dollars of constant purchasing power, increased by 2.2 percent
(Chart 4).
Personal savings, which had expanded earlier in the recovery period,
leveled off in the first half of 1959 as consumer expenditures on goods and
services rose by about as much as disposable income. In the final six
months, as consumption continued to rise in the face of a much slower

growth in personal incomes, the share of disposable income that was saved
fell to about 6.7 percent., the lowest since early 1956. This decline was
reflected both in a less rapid addition to most financial assets of individuals and in a more rapid expansion of personal borrowings.
Corporate profits, which are especially sensitive to fluctuations in business
activity, expanded in 1959 in response to the increase in production and
improvement in profit margins. By the second quarter, earnings (before
taxes) reached a record figure of nearly $53 billionâ€”$19 billion more than
in the second quarter of 1958, when they had been severely depressed.
Subsequently, they declined as the steel strike caused a curtailment of
activity, and were about the same as in early 1959 (Chart 5).

Dividends did not match the rapid advance of profits after taxes for
the year ended in mid-1959; accordingly, retained earnings recovered
sharply. Together with the continued growth in funds generated through
depreciation allowances and rapidly rising tax accruals, these retained
earnings made it possible for corporations to acquire a substantial volume
of United States Government securities in the first half of 1959, while at
the same time increasing their outlays for inventory and for plant and
equipment.




FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
The impact of rising economic activity was clearly evident in credit and
capital markets in 1959. Inventory accumulation in the early part of the
year, the resurgence in consumer spending on durable goods, and a high
level of construction activity combined to produce a heavy demand for commercial bank credit. Reflecting these demands, bank loans expanded
almost $12 billion, about the same as the record increase in 1955. However,
Federal Reserve policy made possible only a small expansion in total bank
assets, and banks financed about $8 billion of their loan expansion through
sales of United States Government securities. The financial markets were
Under considerable pressure in absorbing these security sales, since they were
also financing the Treasury deficit and meeting substantial demands for
funds from mortgage borrowers, State and local authorities, and corporations; and interest rates, particularly in the short-term and medium-term
range, advanced sharply.
The distribution of the increase in bank credit among the major users
largely reflected the character of the year's advance in economic activity
(Table 1). The growth in both consumer loans and real estate loans of

commercial banks appear to have exceeded the high rates of 1955. The
expansion of business loans up to the middle of the year was comparable
to that of 1955, but the liquidation of inventories after midyear reduced this
use of bank funds considerably below the amounts extended in 1955.
Nevertheless, the business lending activity of banks was markedly greater
than in 1958, as most major groups of commercial and industrial businesses
employed more bank credit.




18

Not only was consumer lending by banks at a record rate, but so was the
over-all increase in consumer credit outstanding (Chart 6). All major
categories of instalment credit other than that extended for the purchase
of automobiles rose more than in 1955. Contrary to the developments in
that earlier year, however, there appears to have been no appreciable
liberalization in 1959 of the maximum terms on which instalment credit was
made available to consumers.
Long-term capital markets were subject to divergent influences but, on
balance, experienced larger demands. Corporate security offerings for new
money were lower than in 1958 by abount $1.5 billion, or 15 percent, as a
result of the sharp increase in corporate retentions of income and the
greater reliance on bank borrowing. The latter reflected the predominantly short-term nature of business financing requirements in this period
and, possibly, the high level of long-term interest rates prevailing. However, the reduction in corporate offerings was more than offset by the flow
of credit into home building. The amount of nonfarm residential mortgage credit in use increased by a record $15 billion, compared with an increase of $12 billion in 1958. State and local security issues exceeded those
in any previous year, as new authorizations of State and local securities continued to build up a large backlog of issues.
The credit markets were also required to supply funds associated with an
increase of $7.9 billion in United States Government debt and to absorb
outside of the banking system the $8 billion reduction, referred to above, in
bank holdings of United States securities. Most of the new issues of Federal securities were obligations of short- and intermediate-term maturity,
because the 4J4 percent interest rate limitation effectively precluded flotations of longer-term United States Government securities after the early
part of the year. Hence, the Federal Government was forced to do much of
its needed financing in the same maturity range in which commercial banks
were reducing their holdings of Government obligations.
Investment sources outside the commercial banking system absorbed
the new offerings of Federal securities, as well as bank sales of short- and
intermediate-term Federal obligations, but at a substantial increase in rates.
Nonfinancial corporations expanded their holdings by $5 billion (Table
D-49), mostly in very short-term securities; foreign and international
accounts, savings and loan associations, and individuals likewise added to
their portfolios.
These developments in the banking system and in capital markets,
jointly with the policies pursued by the monetary authorities, had significant effects on the financial position of the major lending institutions
and of nonfinancial businesses and individuals. The liquidity position
of commercial banks, as measured by the ratio of their holdings of United
States securities to deposits, was at about its postwar low, and the cash and

United States Government security holdings of insurance companies,
mutual savings banks, and savings and loan associations declined relative
to their respective liabilities.
For the economy as a whole, holdings of liquid assets increased only
moderately, though there were significant differences among the components
of the total. The money supply expanded by about 0.5 percent. Time
deposits of commercial banks advanced by 3/2 percent and mutual savings bank deposits by 4 percent, rates of increase that were appreciably lower than in recent years. The volume of outstanding Series E
and Series H savings bonds, including accrued interest, leveled off early
in the year, and then declined; however, the decline was reversed after a
new rate of 3% percent was announced for these bonds and the total at the
end of the year was almost the same as at the beginning. Total savings
bonds, which include other series not currently being sold, decreased by
about $3 billion during the year, though this decline partly reflected advance
refunding into marketable securities. Savings and loan share accounts rose
by 14 percent, about the same as in 1958. The decline in the rate of increase in savings-type liquid assets reflected the failure of personal savings
to keep pace with disposable income, as well as a shift of the flow of savings
into less liquid assets. On the other hand, the volume of marketable
United States Government securities with maturities of less than one year
increased by about $7 billion, or 10 percent, contrasted with a small decline
in 1958.
The advance in the cost of borrowing in 1959, though less steep
than in the second half of 1958, continued through most of the year. The
13-week Treasury bill rate rose from 2.7 percent to more than 4.5 percent.
The prime rate of commercial banks was raised in two stages, from 4 percent
to 5. The average yield on outstanding long-term taxable Government
bonds increased from about 3.8 percent to 4.4, while that on outstanding
corporate Aaa bonds rose from 4.1 percent to 4.6. It is estimated that the
yield on FHA-insured home mortgages purchased in the secondary market
rose from around 5.6 percent to about 6.3.
A significant development was the considerably more rapid advance
in short- and intermediate-term interest rates than in long-term rates. The
change in this relationship was such that short- and intermediate-term borrowing, on which the Federal Government was compelled to rely because
of the 454 percent limitation on its new issues of longer-term securities,
became considerably more expensive than long-term borrowing.
The exuberance that characterized the stock market in 1958 gave way
to a more restrained tone in most of 1959. Stock prices advanced about
9 percent, and the amount of credit used in stock market transactions varied
little during the year (Chart 7 ) . Since dividends increased at about the
same rate as stock prices, the average yield on common stocks remained at

Continuing declines in food prices during the early months of the year
offset increases in the prices of consumer services and small advances in the
prices of nondurable goods other than food. Prices of consumer durable
goods changed little in this period. After late spring, however, food prices
fluctuated within a narrow range, primarily in response to seasonal and
weather factors, whereas the prices of nondurable commodities (exclusive
of food) and of consumer services rose at an increased rate. Accordingly,
the over-all index began to rise and continued upward almost without interruption through the end of the year, though at a slower rate than in
the corresponding months of 1956 and 1957 (Chart 8).
The index of wholesale prices changed very little in 1959, but divergent
trends among its components (Table 3 and Chart 9) are significant for

the current movement of consumer goods prices and possibly also for
future changes in the cost of living. Declines in wholesale prices of a
number of farm products and processed foods brought reductions in retail
prices of food during the year. Sizable reductions in pork prices reflected
a cyclical expansion in hog production; and at the year-end, beef prices,
which for most of 1959 had been higher than in 1958, also showed a
moderate decline. A sharp increase in supplies exerted downward pressure on poultry and egg prices during the year. At the same time, higher
wholesale prices of wool and hides and skins, and a pronounced rise in the
prices of intermediate wool and leather products, were major factors
in the 2 percent increase in the retail prices of apparel. In the latter part
of the year, hide prices declined and a large cotton harvest, in combination
with somewhat lower price supports, helped to moderate the rising trend
in prices of textiles and apparel.
Prices of crude and semifinished materials and other items important in
the manufacture of durable goods rose during 1959, though there was some
diversity in their behavior. Prices of steel mill products, which had risen
significantly in the second half of 1958, remained substantially unchanged
in 1959, as did wholesale prices of consumer finished durable goods. Prices

of semifinished aluminum products were stable over most of this period, but
price increases were announced at the end of the year. Primary nonferrous
metals as a group, and the corresponding semimanufactured products,
advanced in price, especially during the final months.
Materials of importance for construction became somewhat more expensive in 1959. By late spring, lumber prices were 12 percent higher than a
year earlier, but they receded in the autumn, reflecting a lower rate of home
building and seasonal factors in lumber production. Other building
materials, particularly those used extensively in nonresidential construction,
displayed mixed price trends.
The wholesale price index of producer finished goods, including electrical,
metalworking, and general purpose machinery and equipment and related
capital goods, advanced in 1959, extending a rise that had begun in Septmber 1958. Including the 1959 increase, the index of these prices has
risen almost 25 percent since August 1954. Such a development, unless
offset by commensurate increases in operating efficiency, has important consequences for the prices of consumer goods since, in due course, the costs
of capital equipment influence retail prices. Foreign trade of the United
States could also be affected adversely by these price advances, since
machinery accounts for about one-fourth of the country's total exports.
The fact that 1959 and 1955 marked somewhat similar phases in the
business cycle suggests a comparison between price developments in these
two years. In 1955, the consumer price index remained fairly stable, but
substantial cost increases became noticeable as the year progressed. These

made themselves felt to an extent through price rises at wholesale of such
items as building materials, steel, nonferrous metals, and natural rubber,
and foreshadowed the consumer price rise that began after the spring of
1956. In 1959, events followed a somewhat different course. Wholesale
prices of intermediate materials for durable goods manufacturing advanced, as a group, but at a much slower rate than in 1955, especially
after midyear. The corresponding group of materials for nondurable
goods manufacturing (food excluded) showed somewhat larger wholesale
price increases last year than in 1955; but, significantly, most of the increase
in 1955 occurred after June, while in 1959 the index increased scarcely at
all over the second half of the year as several important materials declined
from earlier levels. On balance, rising costs of materials last year exerted
less upward pressure on the prices of finished manufactured goods than
they did in 1955, even if the influence of foods is excluded. This is reflected
in the fact that the wholesale price index for industrial products rose only
about 1 percent in 1959, compared with more than 4 percent in 1955. The
contrasting behavior of consumer prices in these two periods is largely
explained by the more rapid rise last year in the prices of consumer services
and by the fact that prices of consumer durable goods declined in 1955
but were for the most part unchanged in 1959.
AGRICULTURE
Agricultural output in 1959, including a very large harvest of corn
and a continued rise in the production of livestock, equaled the high 1958
volume and was 25 percent above the average output of 1947-49.
Although per capita food consumption rose to near-record levels, the full
volume of this output could not be absorbed by total domestic and export
demands at prevailing prices, some of which are supported under provisions of law, and carryover stocks of several price-supported crops continued to increase. An especially large increase in carryover stocks of corn
is in prospect from the 1959 harvest. On the other hand, wheat may account for only a small addition to stocks, and an increase in the carryover
of cotton may be avoided in the new marketing year.
This imbalance between production and commercial demand was also
reflected in the lower prices received by farmers in 1959, compared with
1958. Most of the reduction was in prices of livestock and livestock products; crop prices averaged nearly as high as in 1958. Declines in prices of
hogs, poultry, and eggs were especially sharp. However, a substantial part
of the decrease in livestock prices during 1959 was directly traceable to a
cyclical increase in the production of beef cattle and hogs, which had been
in short supply in 1958 and for which prices had been unusually high.
Among crops, price reductions in 1959 were largely confined to wheat and
fruit and oil-bearing crops.
In 1959, the realized net income of farm operators from farming fell
back from $13.1 billion in 1958 to the 1957 level of $11.0 billion (Chart 10).

The fall was due in part to the decline in farm prices and an accompanying rise in average production costs. Another cause, however, was that
income in 1958 had been lifted well above the amounts recorded in the
immediately preceding years by certain factors that could not be expected
to recur. Among these were the delayed marketings of crops from the
previous year's harvest; the record crop of wheat sold at a supported
price; payments to farmers for participation in the acreage reserve, which
has since been discontinued; and a cyclically strong demand for beef cattle,
sheep, and hogs.
The realized net income of farm operators in 1959 was not greatly different, however, than that in the years immediately prior to 1958, especially
if allowance is made for the reduction in the number of farms. In fact,
realized net income per farm in 1959 was approximately equal to the
average for the period since the end of the Korean conflict, exclusive of
1958. Income earned by the farm population from nonfarm sources, on
the other hand, continued to increase in 1959, to an estimated $6.7 billion,
thus probably amounting to more than half of the net income derived from
farming itself.
Farm land values, which had been rising for five years, continued to do so
in the first quarter of 1959. The rise was practically halted, however,
toward the end of the year. Farmers' indebtedness increased, but by a
smaller amount than assets, so that by the end of 1959 farmers' equities were
2 percent larger than at the beginning of the year and 62 percent greater
than in 1947-49.
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
In 1959, as in 1958, United States payments in international transactions
exceeded receipts by a wide margin (Chart 11). Exports, seasonally adjusted, fell to a low level in the first quarter of the year, but then began
to strengthen and in the third quarter rose vigorously. Though this expansion was interrupted later in the year by the steel shortage, the value of
exports in the 11 months through November was about the same as in the
corresponding period of 1958. Imports, which were little affected by the
1957-58 recession, staged an exceptionally rapid increase until mid-1959
and, on a seasonally adjusted basis, remained steady thereafter at a level
much higher than in previous years.
These developments in trade were superimposed upon a heavy outflow of
capital and military expenditures, though both of these flows, especially that
of private capital funds, were smaller in 1959 than in 1958. The transfer
of gold and liquid dollar assets resulting from the gap between aggregate
payments and receipts reached an annual rate of $4.5 billion in the second
quarter of 1959. This rate slackened a little in the third quarter, and there
was further improvement in later months, reflecting in part a $250 million
advance repayment by the United Kingdom to the Export-Import Bank.

Among the underlying factors that have contributed to the change in
the trade and payments position of the United States since the early postwar
years have been the steady recovery and growth in the productive capacity
of other countries, including the re-establishment of old comparative advantages and the introduction of new technologies. On the side of demand,
the pressures on domestic resources which persisted in many countries long
after the war have generally subsided. In some cases, new international
cost and price disparities may now have developed to the advantage of these
other countries, and the depressed level of ocean freight rates since 1957 has
facilitated the marketing in the United States of certain foreign products.
Much of the change in trade may be attributable, however, to intensified
production and export efforts by other countries on the basis of previously
existing cost differences.
These influences have not operated exclusively in one direction.
A detailed examination by the Department of Commerce of recent
changes in the shares of the United States in different export markets for
manufactured goods reveals a considerable diversity of trends, with many
gains as well as losses. Moreover, the serious contractions have been concentrated in a few items. Among these, automobiles and steel stand out, as
they do in the rise in imports.
A review of recent developments in the foreign trade of the United
States must also take account of the effect of business fluctuations at home
and abroad and of the special circumstances affecting trade in particular
products that figure prominently in this country's exports or imports. Thus,
the decline of exports after mid-195 7 was associated with a general weakening of foreign import demands, aggravated by the reversal of special forces
which had contributed (notably in the cases of petroleum, coal, cotton,
and wheat) to the earlier upswing. Similarly, the strengthening of exports
during 1959 reflects the renewal of economic expansion abroad. The
progress of expansion in countries that are the principal customers for
exports from the United States accordingly deserves attention.
Change in the World Market Situation
Economic conditions in virtually all industrially developed countries
improved in 1959. In Canada, as in the United States, production had
begun to recover in 1958; after some hesitation in the summer of 1959, it
rose again in the autumn. Production in Japan had also rebounded sharply
in 1958 and continued an extraordinarily rapid rate of expansion.
In Western Europe, the check to production at the end of 1957, though
enough to produce marked effects on inventory and import demands
in 1958, did not result in any widespread downturn, and a new rise in
output got under way early in 1959. The difference of about nine months
between North America and Western Europe in the inception of the expansion was of some significance for the development of trade and payments on
both sides.




31

By the second half of 1959, most of the more developed countries were
reporting impressive increases in economic activity, compared with a year
earlier (Chart 12). This strengthening extended to most industries, although coal mining remained a major exception, with adverse effects on
United States coal sales in Europe. In most countries, business fixed
investment seems to have played a small role, compared with other demands,
in starting the upturn, and the market for capital equipment was generally
weak at the beginning of the year. It strengthened, however, in most industrial countries as the expansion gained force, and in some of them, notably
Germany and Japan, new orders in the capital goods industries increased
markedly in the course of the year.
The renewed expansion in industrial countries abroad was initiated in part
by an increase in demand for their exports. It is noteworthy, however, that
these increases were, at first, almost exclusively in sales to the United States
and Canada, which rose strongly after mid-1958. Elsewhere, these other
industrial countries faced much the same market conditions as those confronting the United States. The trade among Western European countries
at the beginning of 1959 was scarcely higher than a year earlier, but in
March it began to rise significantly. Their exports to the nonindustrial
countries in the first quarter were 12 percent below shipments in the first
quarter of 1958; and in the second quarter they were still no higher than a
year earlier.
The weakness of demand in the nonindustrial countries at the beginning
of 1959 reflected their generally strained foreign exchange position, resulting
from the slowness with which their imports had adjusted downward to the
progressive fall in their export prices after mid-1957. In some cases, excess
capacity contributed to the weakness in these prices. By the first quarter
of 1959, the general level of prices in world trade for primary commodities
was 5 percent lower than at the beginning of 1958 and 13 percent lower
than at the beginning of 1957 (Table D-76). In Latin Americaâ€”a market
that is relatively much mor.e important to the United States than to Europe
or Japanâ€”the fall in export prices (exclusive of petroleum) over the twoyear period was about 20 percent. The volume of exports from the nonindustrial countries had, however, begun to improve, and in 1959 some of
them began to enjoy better export prices and sufficient earnings to permit
both some replenishment of their foreign exchange reserves and some increase in their imports. Sterling area countries were helped especially by
the improved markets for wool and rubber. Export gains by other primary
producers, notably the Latin American countries, were more moderate or
were delayed, and some of these countries continued to experience foreign
exchange difficulties.
The improvement in the world market situation during 1959 is shown
by the summary import figures in Table 4. In the first quarter, imports
of industrial countries other than the United States and Canada were little
higher, and in sonic cases lower, than in 1958, and those of the nonindustrial

countries were sharply reduced. In the second quarter, imports of the
industrial countries and of some of the nonindustrial countries strengthened
appreciably, and the improvement continued in the third quarter.
United States Foreign Trade and Payments
In the early months of 1959, United States exports continued to reflect
the consequences of the relatively low world demand and certain other
unfavorable influences. Goal exports, despite the price advantage favoring
the United States, met increasing obstacles because of the oversupply of coal
in Europe; cotton shipments were held down in prospect of a change in
the United States export price at the start of the new crop season; and
exports to many of the primary producing countries, especially in Latin
America, remained weak.
In the second quarter, and still more in the third, these influences were
offset by the resurgence of economic expansion in the more developed countries. United States exports responded well to the upturn in inventory investment and in expenditures on machinery and equipment in these countries (Table 5). Agricultural exports other than cotton also strengthened
in the course of the year, and by the fourth quarter cotton exports were
beginning to show the anticipated large increase over the previous year.

On the other hand, a decrease in exports of machinery and vehicles in
November appeared to be attributable to shortages of steel arising from
the work stoppage in that industry.
United States merchandise imports rose in little more than a year by
about 25 percent from their recession low in the first quarter of 1958. The
principal elements in this expansion were the strengthening of demand for
industrial materials, as domestic economic activity began to increase; the
continued rise in purchases of foreign automobiles and other consumer
manufactures; and special demand situations relating to meat, steel, and
building materials. With the easing of some of these demands, total imports, seasonally adjusted, did not increase further after midyear.
Changes in service transactions in 1959 were of much less consequence
than those in trade. Among United States expenditures abroad, military
disbursements were somewhat lower in the first three quarters of the year
than in the same period of 1958 and travel outlays somewhat higher.
Among receipts, income from direct investments abroad, while lower than
in 1958, tended to strengthen in the course of the year.
Influenced by the rise in interest rates in this country, the outflow of
capital in the first three quarters of 1959 remained considerably below the
high rate of the preceding year, thereby offsetting part of the adverse shift
in the goods and services balance. The net outflow of capital was exceptionally low in the first quarter, but rose in the second and remained steady
in the third. With imports of goods and services also remaining unchanged
and exports rising from the second to the third quarter, the excess of payments on recorded transactions declined. Net transfers of gold and liquid
dollar assets to other countries did not diminish correspondingly in the




35

third quarter. This disparity is thought to be due to lags in crediting payments to foreign accounts, with the result of understating the gold and
dollar outflow in the second quarter and of overstating it in the third.
Incomplete data for the fourth quarter indicate a decline in the rate of
gold and dollar transfers, partly attributable to large advance payments of
foreign obligations to the United States.
OUTLOOK
Although it is always difficult in a dynamic, free economy such as ours
to depict in advance the course likely to be taken by production, employment, and income, present indications warrant the expectation that the
expansion now in progress will be extended through 1960. And there are
good grounds for belief that, with appropriate public policies and private
actions, the expansion can continue well beyond the present year.
Prospective Expansion of Demands
Past developments and present conditions clearly suggest that the demands of business concerns for capital goods and for inventories will be
especially important factors in the year ahead. Expenditures on capital
goods have been rising for more than a year and should continue upward
in 1960. In part, and especially during the early months, the increase will
represent a catching-up on projects delayed or postponed because of shortages attributable to the steel strike. Chiefly, however, capital investment
should rise in response to favorable underlying factors now discernible and
likely to strengthen as the year progresses. Surveys of businessmen's intentions, and the increased volume of contract awards and of new orders for
industrial machinery, confirm this outlook. A good demand from the farm
economy for machinery and equipment may also be anticipated.
Expenditures for residential construction, a second major category of
capital investment, are not likely to be as high as in 1959. However, the
extent of the decline should be limited, and activity in this sector of the
economy should exceed that of most recent years. Outlays for modernization and alterations should be a steady expansive force in the building
industry.
Within the aggregate of government outlays, Federal expenditures for
goods and services should change little in the first half of the year; but
later, in line with provisions in the fiscal 1961 budget for the development
of water resources and other public works, and for space and aviation
programs, they should increase moderately. The upward trend of expenditures at the State and local level, which reflects particularly the provision
of services needed by the growing urban population, may be expected to
continue, though possibly at a slower rate. The construction of schools,
public service enterprises, and community facilities in general is expected to
advance moderately and to outweigh declines in activity that occur under




36

the Federal-aid highway program as a result of the mandatory reduction in
apportionments under the present law.
Changes in investment in business inventories are likely to be less regular
during the year than the changes in final demands. Restocking needs are
clearly apparent, not only for steel but also for many steel-using intermediate and finished products; and further additions to inventories will be
required throughout the economy as production and final sales increase.
Inventory expenditures and the other outlays noted above should contribute to a strong expansion in production, employment, and income.
The increase in employment should exceed that of the labor force and, correspondingly, unemployment may be expected to fall. Within this context,
consumer incomes and expenditures may be expected to increase substantially during the year. Also, consumer confidence is favorable to an increasing volume of purchases of consumer durable goods.
The financing of the investment needs outined here, together with a significant volume of consumer credit, will make strong demands upon the
Nation's capital and credit markets. At high levels of income and savings,
a greater supply of investment funds may be expected. The sizable Federal budget surplus projected for the fiscal year 1961 would be helpful in
relieving pressure on the supply of funds.
Balance of Payments Prospects
A moderate improvement in the United States balance of international
payments seems to be ahead in 1960. Imports of capital equipment and
consumer manufactures may, on balance, continue their upward trend.
And, as industrial production continues to rise, imports of industrial materials may grow, though presumably more slowly than in the recovery
phase following the 1957-58 recession. On the other hand, the particular
supply and demand situations noted earlier in this chapter, which have
been responsible for the rapid rise of certain imports, are shifting; these
imports are now expected to increase less rapidly, and some of them may
even decline. The growth of total imports, therefore, may well be considerably smaller in 1960 than the rise in the period from early 1958 to mid1959.
Exports should gain from the strong expansion of production and investment that is proceeding in the industrial countries abroad. This expansion should benefit United States sales indirectly also, as the primary producing countries find their purchasing power raised by their higher exports
to the industrial countries. Moreover, certain major exports that declined
in 1959, as discussed above, may cease to decline in 1960, or may increase.
On this appraisal, exports in 1960 should rise appreciably more than
imports. Also, receipts from services are expected to rise faster than
payments for services and military expenditures abroad. Net exports of
goods and services, as registered in our national income accounts, should
show a positive balance. On the other hand, new United States invest-




37

ment abroad may increase, especially if interest rates in other countries
continue to rise. Therefore, the over-all payments deficit may still be
relatively large in 1960. To assist in attaining a needed adjustment of
the balance of payments consistent with our goal of promoting multilateral
world trade, a strengthening of exports continues to be essential. The level
of exports will depend on such fundamental conditions as the rate and
regularity of expansion of activity abroad, the progress of other countries
toward more liberal trade policies, and our own efforts to strengthen the
competitive position of United States products in foreign markets.
Conditions for Sound Advance
Our success in realizing the opportunities that 1960 presents, and for
extending economic growth at a high and stable rate into the future, will
depend upon the actions of business management, labor leaders, and consumers, as well as on the policies of Government, toward maintaining the
balance in our economy that is required for sustainable growth. A Federal
program for 1960 that is designed to help achieve our national economic
objectives is offered in Chapter 4, together with suggestions for appropriate
private action.




Chapter 3
Economic Policies in 1959
HE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES of the Administration's economic
policies in 1959 were, first, to extend the economy's expansion, already
well advanced when the year began; second, to counter the development of
imbalances that might jeopardize a sound expansion; third, to restrain
potential inflationary pressures; and, fourth, to improve the economic basis
for the Nation's international policies.
The present chapter describes briefly how the Federal Government's
fiscal and monetary policies were administered during the year to help
achieve these objectives. It also summarizes the steps taken directly to
strengthen the Nation's balance of international payments and to achieve
program objectives in two areas in which the Federal Government's role
is especially importantâ€”housing and highway construction. Activities
conducted under other continuing programs that have a significant bearing on economic growth and well-being, including measures taken in
agriculture, are dealt with in Chapter 4.

T

FEDERAL FISCAL POLICIES
As the year 1959 began, a budget deficit of substantial size was indicated for the fiscal year ending June 30. Although it proved to be $444
million smaller than was estimated in January 1959, it amounted to $12.4
billion, more than four times the deficit in the fiscal year 1958 (Chart 13).
The two factors jointly responsible for this budgetary outcome were a
sharp decrease in Federal revenues below what might have been obtained
if there had not been an economic recession in 1957â€”58, and a sizable
increase in Federal expenditures. Although tax receipts in fiscal 1959
fell substantially below first estimates, they were only slightly under those
of the fiscal year 1958. A decrease of nearly $3 billion in corporate income
tax receipts was offset in part by a rise of $2 billion in receipts from individual income taxes. The former reflected the impact of recession on
corporate earnings in the calendar year 1958; the latter reflected the steady
rise in personal incomes which, by mid-1959, were significantly higher
than they had been a year earlier.
On the expenditure side, all major categories except interest payments
on the public debt rose in fiscal 1959 (Table 6). Part of the increase can
be attributed directly to actions taken to help counteract economic recession.

Expenditures in this category involved mainly advances to the States for the
temporary extension of unemployment compensation payments, purchases
of mortgages by the Federal National Mortgage Association, and the acceleration of construction of water projects and other public works. Yet these
increases were not large in relation to the total rise in spending. The major
items were a rise of $2.3 billion for national security programs; an increase
of $2.1 billion for agricultural programs; an additional subscription of $1.4
billion to the International Monetary Fund; and substantial amounts for
higher pay for Government personnel (both civilian and military), increased
public assistance grants, larger expenditures for health, increased grants to
local governments for the support of education in federally affected areas,
and an increased Post Office deficit.

In addition to these expenditures, all encompassed within the conventional administrative budget, payments from the old-age and survivors trust
fund and from the highway trust fund, which are reflected in the consolidated cash accounts, were substantially higher in fiscal 1959 than in the
previous fiscal year. An excess of payments over receipts in each of these
two funds and in the unemployment trust fund accounted for the fact that
in the fiscal year 1959, in contrast to most previous years of deficit, the
excess of the Federal Government's payments over its receipts in the consolidated cash accounts was larger than the deficit in the conventional
administrative budget.
Largely owing to seasonal factors, by far the greater part of the budget
deficit in fiscal 1959 occurred in the six months ended December 1958â€”
$11.0 billion, contrasted with $1.4 billion in the next six months ended June
1959. Similarly, in the consolidated cash accounts, $12.6 billion of the
total excess of payments over receipts occurred in the six months ended
December 1958, and only $400 million in the next six months. This
substantial lessening of the deficit between the first and second halves of
the fiscal year 1959 reflected, in addition to seasonal factors, a significant
rise in revenues attributable to economic recovery.




41

The changes in the deficit between the first and second halves of the
fiscal year and their relationship to economic developments become clearer
when stated in terms of the national income accounts, which reflect the
accrual of tax liabilities as they are incurred and also give expression to
certain other circumstances affecting the budget. In these terms, the peak
of the deficit ($10.9 billion, seasonally adjusted) was in the April-June
quarter of 1958, although the impact upon the administrative budget and
the consolidated cash accounts was felt principally in the fiscal year 1959.
In the April-June quarter of 1959, the budget, again in national accounts
terms, was already showing a small surplus.
With a continuing economic advance in prospect, the Administration's
fiscal policy as set forth in the January 1959 Budget was designed to
achieve a balance of revenues and expenditures, to forestall inflationary
pressures, to promote a sustainable rate of expansion, and to help restrain
the rapidly rising pressures of demand in capital and credit markets. It
contemplated expenditures and receipts balanced at $77 billion.
Actual expenditures during the first half of fiscal 1960 exceeded the rate
projected in the January 1959 Budget, partly as a result of increases that
had not been anticipated in expenditure programs not directly subject to
administrative control, partly because of the continuing uncorrected deficit
of the Post Office Department, and partly because appropriations enacted
for certain Federal programs were higher than requested. On the other
hand, despite the adverse effect of the prolonged steel strike on Federal
corporate and individual income tax collections, the rapid recovery and
expansion of the economy now suggest that revenues will be higher than
estimated in January 1959; accordingly, a budget surplus of $200 million
is anticipated.
FEDERAL DEBT MANAGEMENT
The Federal Government's indebtedness rose in the calendar year 1959
by $7.9 billion, almost entirely:)as a result of the budget deficit. To this
financing requirement was added the refinancing of $52.3 billion of maturing marketable issues (exclusive of $24 billion of weekly bills), which
was accomplished by refunding $37.9 billion and paying off $14.4 billion.
These latter payments plus the net redemptions during the year of savings
bonds and other nonmarketable debt added further to the Treasury's 1959
cash financing needs.
As far as possible, the Administration sought to conduct these large
financing operations without contributing to inflationary pressures and on as
economical a basis as conditions permitted. Whenever feasible, it sought
to lengthen the maturity structure of the debt. Two issues of securities with
long-term maturitiesâ€”$884 million of a 4 percent bond of 1980, issued at
99, and $619 million of a 4 percent bond of 1969â€”were marketed during
the first part of the year. Before midyear, however, the general rise in
interest rates stemming from increasing private and public demands for




42

capital and credit maole United States Government securities with maturities
of more than 5 years no longer competitive within the range allowed by the
statutory maximum rate of 4*4 percent. In recognition of this situation,
the Congress was requested on June 8 to remove the 4!/4 percent interest
rate limitation on new issues of Federal securities with maturities of
over 5 years.
Since no action was taken on this request, Treasury financing for the remainder of the year became limited to the issuance of securities with
maturities of 5 years or less. This contributed to the decline in the
average maturity of the public debt from 4 years and 7 months at the end of
June 1959 to 4 years and 4 months at the end of December. Partly because
demands for short-term credit in this period were particularly large in the
private sector of the economy, the additional pressures on short-term credit
markets incident to Treasury financing caused interest rates on short- and
intermediate-term Government securities, and on private borrowings as
well, to rise considerably more than rates on long-term issues. Indeed, during much of the year, rates on Federal securities with maturities of less
than 5 years, except on the very shortest-term issues, actually exceeded rates
on long-term securities. Thus, the statutory limitation on interest rates on
longer-term United States securities made Treasury financing more costly
in its immediate effect, and possibly also in its longer-term effect, than it
might otherwise have been.
Still more serious, the interest rate limitation impaired the ability of
the Federal Government to manage its debt with a minimum potential inflationary impact. Excessive reliance on short-term Government securities
is an undesirable financing practice, since such securities are in some respects
the equivalent of money and, like additions to the money supply, help
stimulate expenditures. Moreover, the frequent refunding entailed by a
large volume of short-term debt may complicate, in the future, the pursuit
of the monetary policy most appropriate to the economy's needs.
The adverse effects of this constraint on longer-term financing were
minimized during the year by a more orderly spacing of short-term issues
and by the issuance, insofar as feasible, of securities with maturities close to
5 years. An exchange offering in July, at 4% percent, of marketable
Treasury notes with maturity of almost 5 years totaled $4.2 billion; and a
cash offering in October of 5 percent notes of similar maturity amounted to
$2.3 billion. The October offering attracted a much broader range of individual savers than usual. Subscriptions included $941 million from 108,000
subscribersâ€”largely individualsâ€”who submitted paid-up subscriptions for
$25,000 or less. Another intermediate-term issue, a 4% percent 4-year
note, was offered as part of a refunding operation in November, and issues
of these notes to holders of two maturing securities totaled $3 billion. The
4% percent notes issued in July were reopened in November for holders of
Series F and G savings bonds maturing in 1960, and close to $800 million
was added to the issue in this way. Thus, between July and November more




43

than $10 billion of new Treasury issues were placed in the 4-5 year area.
These intermediate-term issues, however, did not eliminate the need for the
longer-term funding of a significant part of the Federal debt.
Adjustments were also made during the year in the United States
Savings Bond program. Sales of Series E and H bonds, some $42.5 billion
of which are held by individuals, were adversely affected as the interest
rates paid on other forms of savings increased steadily, making the 3J4
percent interest rate on these securities increasingly less attractive. As
indicated above, the net drain on Treasury cash on the part of savings
bonds of all series added to the already large financing requirements of the
Federal Government.
Accordingly, a recommendation was made to the Congress that the
3.26 percent interest limitation on savings bonds be removed to permit the
Treasury to restore the attractiveness of these securities relative to other
savings media. In September, legislation was enacted to increase the
maximum limit on the interest rate on savings bonds to 4% percent, and
the rate on new Series E and H savings bonds was promptly raised to 3%
percent, effective June 1, 1959. The return on outstanding Series E and H
bonds purchased before June 1 was also increased by approximately l/z
percent over their remaining life, if held to maturity. November and
December were the first months in 1959 in which sales of new Series E
and H savings bonds exceeded those in the corresponding months a year
earlier; and by the year-end the amount outstanding had recovered to the
level of the end of 1958.
MONETARY AND CREDIT POLICY
Monetary policy in 1959 was designed to influence the availability of
funds and the liquidity of the economy in ways that would help foster the
steady growth of production and employment and prevent the development of potential inflationary forces. In seeking to achieve these results,
Federal Reserve authorities increased the degree of the restraint that they
had been exercising on credit markets since August 1958, when recovery
from recession called for a gradual change in policy.
In pursuance of a policy of greater restraint, Federal Reserve Banks in
March, May, and September 1959 raised the discount rate charged by
them to member banks from 2/2 to 4 percent, paralleling the rise in the
interest rate on 3-month Treasury bills (Chart 14). Open market operations in United States Government securities were a major policy tool used
to influence member bank reserves. With Federal Reserve operations in
the Government securities market withdrawing somewhat more reserve
funds than usual on balance over the first half of the year, and with the
demand for bank credit expanding, commercial banks were under pressure
to enlarge their borrowings at Federal Reserve Banks (Chart 15). These
borrowings increased from a range of $500-700 million to around $ 1 billion
about mid-year, and they remained near the higher level during the rest of

the year. Over the year as a whole, total member bank reserves available
for monetary and credit expansion changed only slightly. Reserves supplied by open market purchases of United States Government securities,
when added to those supplied through the increased borrowings and other
factors, sufficed to offset a drain on bank reserves resulting from changes in
the gold stock and in the amount of currency in circulation.
Some additional funds for seasonal monetary and credit needs were released in early December when the Federal Reserve took its first step in
exercising the authority provided by Public Law 86-114 to include vault
cash in meeting required reserves. Country banks with vault cash holdings
greater than 4 percent of demand deposits were allowed to count the excess
to meet their required reserves, while central reserve city and reserve city
banks were permitted to count any excess greater than 2 percent. However,
this move released only $270 million of vault cash, out of an average of $2.3
billion held by member banks.
Reflecting all developments influencing the availability of reserve funds,
the money supply (demand deposits and currency) grew by about 0.5
percent in 1959, compared with 4 percent during 1958. Additions to
time deposits of commercial banks also were smaller; they amounted to
about 3.5 percent, compared with an increase of 13 percent in 1958. At
the same time, the amount of marketable U.S. Government securities with
maturities of less than one year increased by about $7 billion.
Regulations T and U were amended by the Federal Reserve authorities,
as of June 15, to make margin requirements more effective as a restraint
on the use of credit in stock market transactions. No change was made in
the 90 percent margin requirement.
FEDERAL HOUSING AND HOME FINANCING
Increasing demands for capital and credit in 1959 led to more intensive
competition for funds in the markets from which much of the financing of
home construction and purchase is normally drawn. As construction
financing and commitments for mortgage funds became less readily available in an increasing number of housing market areas, and as borrowing
costs rose, numerous adjustments were required in Federal housing and home
financing programs. These actions were taken to facilitate the flow of
private funds into home financing and thereby to help sustain an adequate
level of home building and to avoid unnecessary demands for Federal
financial assistance.
First, adjustments became necessary in the maximum interest rate that
private lending institutions are permitted to charge on Government-insured
or guaranteed home mortgage and project loans. In the absence of such
adjustments, the availability of private funds for families wishing to purchase
homes with federally insured or guaranteed mortgages and for the construction of apartment projects under such financing would have decreased
rapidly. In March, the Federal Housing Administration raised to 4/2




47

percent the maximum permissible interest rates on armed service project
mortgages. In September, the maximum permissible interest rate on FHAinsured home loans was raised to 5% percent. Pursuant to the authority
granted by a 1959 legislative act, the Veterans Administration in
July increased to 5}4 percent the ceiling rate chargeable on its guaranteed
and insured home loans and charged by it on direct home loans. Also,
following approval of the Housing Act of 1959, on September 23, 1959,
interest rate ceilings were raised on FHA-insured loans on rental and
cooperative projects; the maximum size of home loans eligible for insurance by the Federal Housing Administration was increased; and the
limits were raised on the size of mortgages that could be insured for rental
housing projects. Other adjustments permitted by the new legislation were
put into effect where needed to take account of changes in construction
cost and design that had taken place in earlier years. The Farmers Home
Administration raised the interest rate on direct home loans to farmers from
4^4 to 5 percent in September 1959; a similar increase had been made in
December 1958 on certain types of insured home loans.
Second, changes were required in Federal programs that supplement and
support private sources of credit and capital for home construction and
purchase. The Federal National Mortgage Association made several reductions in its schedule of mortgage purchase prices under special assistance
programs. In the Association's secondary market operations, prices on
FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed 5 54 percent loans were reduced in a
series of five changes, and corresponding reductions were made in the
prices of mortgages bearing other interest rates. The several Federal Home
Loan Banks advanced interest rates on loans to member associations to bring
the cost of these borrowings into closer alignment with conditions in the
capital markets.
Despite these changes, total demands for assistance under Federal programs that supply funds directly to the home mortgage market increased
rapidly during the year, as progressively higher yields on long-term nonmortgage investments tended increasingly to attract investment funds that
might otherwise have been available for the purchase of home mortgages.
In 1959, the Federal National Mortgage Association purchased $735 million of mortgages under its secondary market operations program and
$1,172 million under its special assistance programs; purchases in 1958 had
totaled $623 million under all programs. The advances of the Federal
Home Loan Banks to their member institutions, most of which are savings
and loan associations, increased by approximately $760 million over the
year, a rise of nearly 60 percent; the 1958 increase in these advances had
been only $33 million, or 3 percent. The Veterans Administration made
$200 million of loans to veterans for the purchase of homes in areas
eligible for such assistance under its direct lending program. And the
Farmers Home Administration extended credits of $84 million for the
purchase or improvement of farm homes (Table 7).

These direct financial supports of home financing themselves involved
demands on the capital markets. To obtain additional funds, the Federal
National Mortgage Association increased its debentures to the public by
$540 million during the year. It also increased by $1 billion its use of funds
furnished by the Treasury. In other home loan operations, the Veterans
Administration used $150 million and the Farmers Home Administration
$115 million of Federal funds. The expanded advances of the Federal
Home Loan Banks necessitated an increase of more than $1 billion in their
capital market borrowings.
FEDERAL AID FOR HIGHWAYS
Progress continued during the past year in carrying forward the interstate
highway program initiated in 1956. By the end of 1959, some 5,300 miles
of this' nation-wide system of highways had been completed, and some 5,000
miles of additional roads were under contract for construction.
The cost of this construction is financed predominantly by the Federal
Government out of taxes on highway fuels and certain other excise taxes
paid by highway users. To the end of 1959, total construction expenditures
on the program amounted to $4.3 billion, of which some $3.6 billion was
financed by grants to the States from the highway trust fund. During this
period, the Federal Government also made grants to the States of $3.5 billion
for primary and secondary highways and roads under a Federal assistance
program that extends back for many years (Table 8).
Under legislation enacted in 1958, apportionments of grant-in-aid funds
to the States for highway construction under Federal-aid programs were
sharply increased to combat the recession. As a result, the highway trust
fund, in the absence of additional revenues, faced prospective deficits beginning in the fiscal year 1960. Moreover, the likelihood that such deficits
would arise made it necessary, under the mandatory terms of the basic
legislation, to discontinue apportionments to the States on behalf of the
interstate program until a prospective balance of revenues and disbursements in the trust fund could be foreseen.

In order to avoid the costly cutback in highway planning and construction
that a cessation of apportionments would entail, and to assure continuance
of the interstate program on a self-sustaining basis and on the scale originally scheduled, the Administration requested an increase of 15/2 cents per
gallon, for a period of five years starting July 1, 1959, in the excise tax
levied on highway fuels. The Congress chose to raise the tax by only one
cent per gallon, starting October 1, 1959 and continuing until July 1, 1961,
and during the subsequent three years to transfer from general revenues
to the trust fund part of the revenue from the excise taxes on automobiles,
automobile parts and accessories. However, these revenues are less than
are needed to maintain apportionments at the level provided for in the
1958 legislation. Accordingly, while the 1959 legislation authorized apportionments of $2.0 billion, the amount apportioned to the States in
October 1959, covering the fiscal year 1961, was necessarily limited to $1.8
billion.
FOREIGN ECONOMIC POLICY
The Administration continued in 1959 to provide substantial assistance
for the economic development of less developed areas as well as military
and economic assistance to countries of the free world. The importance of
these programs and their need for adequate budgetary support was emphasized in a special message of the President transmitted to the Congress on
March 13, 1959. During the year, the United States increased its participation in existing international financial institutions and encouraged the setting
up of certain new institutions designed to promote the flow of capital to
underdeveloped countries. The United States also continued its traditional efforts to reduce impediments to international trade.




The economic potential and the security of the free world, and the future
growth of the less developed countries, depend in large measure upon the
economic strength of the United States in both its domestic and its international aspects. With a view to safeguarding that strength, action was
taken in 1959 to improve the United States balance of payments, in which
a sizable deficit was anticipated for the year. The payments deficit underlined the importance of the firm fiscal and monetary policies being pursued
to restrain domestic inflationary pressures and to assure stable economic
growth. These policies served to maintain confidence in the dollar throughout the world. They also helped to lessen the danger that, through
inflation, the competitive strength of United States trade in foreign markets
might be weakened.
Throughout 1959, the United States emphasized that the strong economic
position attained by the other industrial countries justified moves on their
part to liberalize commercial policies and to expand foreign investment. A
great rise had occurred in their gold and exchange reserves, their balance
of payments positions had become strong, and major progress had been
made toward currency convertibility. Thus, at the Fifteenth Session of
the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariff's and Trade,
it was agreed that discriminatory import restrictions based on financial
reasons, largely affecting the United States, should quickly be eliminated.
Moreover, the rise in reserves of most industrial countries provides the
basis for reducing quantitative import restrictions generally. The United
States pressed this view at other international meetings also, as well as
directly with the governments concerned. By the end of the year, many
countries had taken action to reduce discriminatory restrictions against
imports from and travel to the United States. A number of these countries
indicated their intention to take further action in the near future. The
United States also asked the industrially advanced nations to increase their
assistance to less developed countries. The economic progress of these
industrial countries was clear evidence of their capacity to provide increased
aid.
A specific step to improve the balance of payments was taken with the
announcement that the Development Loan Fund (DLF) henceforth would
place primary emphasis, in its lending to the less developed countries, on
the financing of goods and services which these countries require from the
United States. This decision was taken in the knowledge that other industrial countries are now capable of financing their exports of capital goods
to these countries on a long-term basis. Also, steps were taken to transfer
from the International Cooperation Administration (1CA) to the DLF,
to the greatest extent possible, assistance which ICA affords in the form
of aid to specific development projects. Projects so transferred are subject
to the new DLF financing procedures. There is reason to expect that these
measures, in addition to strengthening the United States balance of payments, will bring about an increased volume of foreign lending by other
industrial countries.




51

Several steps were taken during the year to augment the flow of capital
from the United States and other nations to the less developed countries
and to strengthen international financial agencies. On June 17, the President signed legislation authorizing an increase in the subscriptions of the
United States to the International Monetary Fund and to the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The added subscriptions
amounted to $1,375 million to the Fund and $3,175 million to the Bank.
A second step to expand the flow of capital was taken when the United
States joined with the Latin American countries in the establishment
of the Inter-American Development Bank. It is contemplated that the
Bank will have an ordinary capital of $850 million, in addition to a separate
fund of $150 million for special operations. The United States contribution will amount to $450 million.
A third move was the decision taken by the Governors of the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, on the initiative of the United
States, to proceed with the formulation of plans for an International Development Association (IDA). This institution would have resources of
about $1 billion, including a prospective United States contribution of
somewhat more than $300 million, payable over approximately five years.
It would be closely affiliated with the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development and would give greater flexibility to the operations of
that institution. It would also facilitate the use, for development purposes,
of the local currencies of certain member countries provided to IDA out
of holdings by other members. Such use would be with the consent of the
countries whose currencies were involved.
The economic aid extended in various forms by the United States to
other countriesâ€”almost entirely to less developed countriesâ€”totaled about
$3 billion in the year ended September 1959. Disbursements under the
Mutual Security Program for economic assistance amounted to about $1.4
billion, exclusive of disbursements by the Development Loan Fund. The
latter, whose operations were still in an initial stage, disbursed $114 million
and committed $393 million. Under Public Law 480, agricultural surpluses were disposed of as follows: $736 million against local currencies;
$133 million through transfers to private welfare and international relief
agencies for foreign operations; and $58 million through deliveries for
famine and other emergency relief purposes. The Export-Import Bank
disbursed $598 million in loans and committed $693 million, while receiving
repayments of $301 million. During the year, it increased the portion of
suppliers' credits which it will finance.
Under the national security provision of the trade agreements legislation,
the President approved a finding that oil and oil products were being imported in such amounts as to threaten to impair the national security and
instituted a program for regulating these imports. The Director of the
Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization found no threat to national
security from imports of certain heavy electrical equipment, fluorspar, and




52

cobalt. Under the escape clause provision of the trade agreements legislation, the President approved a Tariff Commission finding of injury from
imports of certain stainless steel flatware products, but disapproved such
findings for tartaric acid and cream of tartar. The Tariff Commission
found no injury in eight cases and terminated three other cases without
formal findings.
In pursuance of its policy of seeking a reduction of barriers to international trade, the United States in October 1958 proposed to the Contracting
Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that they sponsor
a new round of multilateral tariff negotiations. The proposal was approved
by the Contracting Parties in May 1959, and the tariff conference is
scheduled to begin in September 1960. Its successful conclusion will
permit further progress toward the attainment of higher levels of trade.

Chapter 4

A Legislative Program for 1960

T

HE 1960 PROGRAM for promoting high employment, production,
and income is intended to supplement and reinforce the large body of
pertinent laws already administered by the Federal, State, and local governments. It also takes account of the pervasive influence on economic growth
and well-being of the institutions and practices of the private sector of the
economy. Thus it is consistent with the concept of the Employment Actâ€”
that responsibility for economic advance in our free society is shared by the
Federal Government with other political divisions and the private economy.
The specific proposals have been shaped with a view to their appropriateness
in the current economic context and with due regard to the longer-range
challenges and opportunities noted in Chapter 1.
FEDERAL FINANCES
In view of present economic conditions and prospects, a Federal budget
that not merely balances expenditures with revenues but achieves a significant surplus for debt retirement is clearly the fiscal plan most appropriate
for promoting the purposes of the Employment Act. Such a plan has been
transmitted by the President to the Congress for the fiscal year 1961.
In addition to making adequate provisions for defense, for meeting the
obligations of our international leadership, and for supplying other needecf
services, the proposed budget would make an essential contribution to the
strengthening of our national economy by yielding a $4.2 billion surplus of
receipts over expenditures. By helping to restrain inflationary pressures,
such a budgetary surplus would be a significant factor in promoting steady
and vigorous economic growth. It would help meet demands for savings in
credit and capital markets and thus facilitate and make less costly the
financing of private and State and local investment projects important to
economic growth and well-being. It would greatly facilitate the economical
and noninflationary management of the Federal debt. It would also reinforce confidence at home and abroad in the United States dollar, and contribute in this way not only to the strength of our economy but also to the
economic health of the entire free world.
Attainment of the projected surplus in the fiscal year 1961 will depend
in part on economic conditions in the next year and a half. However,
favorable action by the Congress on certain tax and postal rate pro-




54

posals and on recommended expenditures is also needed to assure this
highly desirable budgetary outcome.
The Congress has been requested to extend the corporate income tax
at the present rate for another year; to postpone for an additional year the
reduction of excise taxes on alcohol, tobacco, automobiles, and automobile
parts and accessories that is now scheduled for June 30, 1960; and to postpone for a year the repeal of the tax on local telephone service and the
reduction of the tax on transportation of persons, likewise scheduled for
June 30, 1960. The Congress has also been requested to make certain corrective amendments in the tax laws applicable to cooperatives; to preclude
unintended and excessive percentage depletion allowances for mineral
products, if this problem is not satisfactorily resolved through litigation
pending before the Supreme Court; to tax as ordinary income any gain
realized by the sale of depreciable personal property used in business, to
the extent of the depreciation deductions previously taken on the property;
to defer the taxation of income earned in less developed countries
of the world; to increase the aviation fuel tax to 45/2 cents per gallon;
and to impose a tax of 4^ cents per gallon on jet fuel. To assure construction of the interstate highway system at a high rate and on a self-supporting
basis, the Congress has been asked to increase the highway fuel tax by l/z
cent per gallon and to continue the tax at 4^ cents per gallon until June 30,
1964. This action would obviate diversion of excise taxes from the general
fund. In addition, favorable action by the Congress has been requested
on an adjustment of postal rates. The effect of the recommended rate
increases would be to reduce the deficit on postal operations by about
$550 million and to contribute, by this amount, toward the attainment of
the desired surplus.
Expenditures in the fiscal year 1961 are estimated at $79.8 billion, an
increase of $1.4 billion above the estimate for the current fiscal year. Some
of this increase will occur under commitments already made in accordance
with existing laws; some would be incurred under recommendations made
to the Congress in the budget for fiscal 1961. A considerable part of the
rise involves programs that directly support our economy's capacity for
growth. Among these are programs for the development of land and water
resources; for the promotion of research, education, and science; for
the construction of physical facilities in the field of health; for urban renewal ; for the expansion and improvement of highway and air transportation; and for aid to other nations of the free world.
A major proposal has been made to the Congress for legislative
action in the field of public debt management. This proposal is of particular importance in view of the large amount of the public debt, now
more than $290 billion, and its heavy cost, involving interest payments in
the fiscal year 1960 estimated at $9.3 billion. Specifically, the Congress
is requested to remove the 4% percent ceiling on the interest rate which can
be paid on United States Government securities with a maturity of more
533287 Oâ€”60â€”â€”5




55

than 5 years. Events since this request was first made have underscored
its importance for minimizing the hazard of creating inflationary pressures
through public debt transactions; for giving greater latitude in the conduct
of monetary and credit policies conducive to the growth and stability of the
economy; and for financing the debt as economically as possible.
Also, to permit the financing of seasonal increases in the Federal debt
during the fiscal year 1961, it is necessary to enact a temporary debt limit
that is somewhat higher than the present permanent limit of $285 billion.
A proposal to this effect will be made to the Congress prior to the expiration
on June 30, 1960 of the present temporary limit of $295 billion.
COMPETITION
The importance of vigorous competition to the promotion of economic
growth is recognized in the Employment Act, which calls upon the Federal
Government to pursue policies for economic expansion in ways that foster
free competitive enterprise. To strengthen competition, some improvement
is needed in the existing body of antitrust laws.
Four specific legislative actions recommended last year are again
requested of the Congress. The first would require that antitrust agencies be notified when firms of significant size engaged in interstate commerce
propose to merge. The second would authorize the Federal Trade Commission to seek preliminary injunctions in merger cases where a violation of law
is likely. The third would strengthen Federal law governing bank mergers
accomplished through the acquisition of assets. The fourth would grant
the Attorney General power to issue civil investigative demands under
which the necessary facts may be elicited when civil procedures are contemplated in antitrust cases. This recommendation, which was acted upon
favorably last year by the Senate, is urgently needed to strengthen the
investigative authority of the Attorney General.
SMALL BUSINESS
Federal policies and programs to benefit small business, which also
contribute to the competitive quality of our enterprise economy, have
evolved along lines marked out by recommendations of the Cabinet Committee on Small Business and by various laws.
The Small Business Administration (SBA) provides a wide variety of
services to eligible firms and individuals. For example, it supplies loan
funds, for periods up to ten years, to small businesses unable to obtain
financing from other sources on reasonable terms. Under this program,
SBA in 1959 approved a total of 4,533 loans, amounting to $217 million,
to small business concerns; $186 million was to be supplied directly by SBA
and the remainder by private financial institutions under participation
arrangements. Second, in cooperation with the Defense Department and
civilian procurement agencies, SBA reserves certain proposed Government




56

procurements for competitive bidding exclusively by small businesses.
These "set-asides" amounted to $1.1 billion for the 11 months through
November 1959. As a result of them, contracts amounting to $860 million
were awarded to small firms in the first 11 months of 1959, contrasting
with $771 million in the full year 1958 and $557 million in 1957. Third,
with the concurrence of the Attorney General and the Chairman of the
Federal Trade Commission,, SBA approves the formation of small-business
pools to assist enterprises in overcoming handicaps attendant upon a
small scale of operations in carrying out production and research and development contracts. Fourth, SBA publishes and distributes information
on management and technical subjects and has developed a program of
courses in cooperation with educational institutions to acquaint owners and
managers of small concerns with more efficient methods of planning, organizing, and conducting business operations. Fifth, SBA awards grants
to universities, colleges, and State agencies, for research on problems of small
businesses; these grants in 1959 totaled $1.9 million. Finally, loans are
being made under the authority provided in the Small Business Investment
Act of 1958 for long-term loans to State and local development corporations for the ultimate benefit of small business concerns; by the end of 1959,
these loans amounted to some $4 million.
The use of the new powers granted by the Small Business Investment Act
of 1958 to license and help finance investment companies that specialize in
providing equity capital or long-term loans to eligible small concerns was
promptly initiated by the Small Business Administration. Some 61 such
companies are now licensed, with a present total capitalization of $40
million, of which $5.5 million has been committed by SBA.
Experience so far suggests that the specifications set down in the Small
Business Investment Act as to the types of securities that may be purchased
by small business investment companies are perhaps too rigid. Accordingly,
proposals have been made to the Congress for amendments to the Act
to provide the needed flexibility. Long-term financing by small business concerns would also be assisted by favorable Congressional action on
a request, repeated again, for an amendment to the Securities Act of 1933
to increase from $300,000 to $500,000 the maximum amount of a corporate
security issue for which the privilege of simplified Regulation A filings may
be accorded.
AGRICULTURE
Federal expenditures for agriculture and agricultural resources in the
fiscal year 1960 are expected to total $5.1 billion. Of this amount, some
$1.6 billion is for the support of research, conservation, marketing, and
similar services, and for loan programs; and $3.5 billion is for price and income stabilization. A sizable portion of the latter amount is absorbed by
interest charges, storage and transportation costs, and disposal losses on
excess stocks of farm commodities.




57

To the extent possible under present legislation, administrative actions
were taken in the past year to help bring about a better adjustment between
agriculture's greatly expanding capacity to produce and the demand* for
farm products, to improve farm incomes, and to reduce the heavy cost of
agricultural programs to the Federal Government. More emphasis is
being placed on the development of markets for farm products at home
and abroad, on efforts to support prices at levels that will more nearly
balance production with potential demand, on the removal of cropland
from production, and on the development of the nonagricultural resources
of marginal, low-income farm areas.
Several actions taken in these directions during 1959 were of special
importance. First, support prices for cotton were adjusted as individual
producers were given, for the first time, a choice between (1) continuing compliance with tightly restrictive acreage allotments, with prices
supported at 80 percent of parity, and (2) freedom to plant up to 40
percent beyond the allotment, with prices supported at 65 percent of
parity. Second, under existing legislation, corn producers abolished! their
acreage allotments by referendum late in 1958 and thereby put into effect a
single schedule for price support at 90 percent of the three-year average
market price with a minimum price support level of 65 percent of parity.
Third, support prices for several commodities, including rye, oilseeds, dry
beans, and feed grains other than corn, were reduced under discretionary
authority of the Secretary of Agriculture. A number of these commodities
are selling at prices above support levels. The /support prices for tobacco
were increased under mandatory provisions of the law. Fourth, under the
law, efforts were continued for the disposal abroad, without disrupting
ordinary commercial markets, of as large a volume as possible of stocks of
the Commodity Credit Corporation. This action was aided' by a renewal
of the International Wheat Agreement and by a lowered price and an increased export subsidy for cotton. Fifth, in accordance with legislation,
the acreage reserve portion of the Soil Bank was terminated after the
1958 season, but the Conservation Reserve was increased from 9.9 million
acres in 1958 to 22.4 million in 1959. Sixth, the Rural Development Program was strengthened with the establishment, by Executive Order, of an
interdepartmental committee responsible for the coordination of policies
and actions of all participating Federal agencies and for the acceleration of
activities under the Program. Finally, under a newly enacted law, benefits
under price support loans for 1960 were limited for a number of crops
to $50,000 per producer, unless acreage is reduced 20 percent below the
1959 amount or the part of the loan in excess of $50,000 is repaid within
12 months.
Additional agricultural legislation is urgently needed, however, in view
of the continuing high program costs borne by the Federal Government
and the continuing accumulation of surpluses of farm products. Such legislation should assist an orderly transition toward eventual balance between




58

production and demand for farm products, so that the restrictive limitations to which agriculture is subject under present law may be removed.
The Conservation Reserve Program should be expanded, provided certain conditions are fulfilled, and adapted to the correction of specific
commodity problems on a regional basis. Legislation is proposed to extend
through the 1963 crop year authority, which expires after the 1960 crop
year, to bring additional land into the Conservation Reserve; and to expand the program by increasing the basic limitation on the total payments
in any calendar year from $450 million to $600 million. It is planned
under the proposed legislation to add about 9 million acres to the
program during the 1961 crop year, thus bringing the total to about
37 million acres. Together with this expansion in acreage in the Conservation Reserve, realistic price support programs are needed, especially
for wheat.
Specific authority will be requested for the Secretary of Agriculture
to give special consideration, in allocating Conservation Reserve funds,
to those States and regions in which curtailment of production of wheat
or other surplus commodities is consistent with long-range conservation
and production-adjustment goals. The future authorization for the Conservation Reserve Program should not be increased above the 1960 level
unlejss needed price-support legislation is enacted for wheat. Federal
policy on cost-sharing should be concentrated in the future on conservation measures that foster needed shifts to less intensive uses of cropland;
and cost-sharing assistance should be eliminated for practices which increase output of agricultural commodities already in excess supply.
New obligational authority of $10 million is requested for the Great
Plains Conservation Program, the same as for the fiscal year 1960. Under
this Program, conducted in designated counties of the ten Great Plains
States, the Federal Government provides technical assistance to farmers
who enter into long-term contracts to make needed adjustments of land use
on their farms, and it shares in the cost of making such adjustments.
The Sugar Act, which expires on December 31, 1960, should be extended
early in the present session of the Congress.
Limitation on price support for certain crops grown on newly irrigated
or drained land should be extended for another three years.
The Congress should again consider the amendments to the Agricultural
Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (Public Law 480) proposed
last year to make more effective the program for surplus disposal abroad.
Favorable action by the Congress is also requested on pending legislation
to place the loan program of the Farmers Home Administration on a
revolving-fund basis and to make other improvements in the laws affecting
this activity.
The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) continues to provide
additional electric power generating capacity and heavier transmission and
distribution facilities. At present, 96 percent of all farms have central




59

station electric service, and more than one-half of REA's power is sold to
nonfarm customers. The latter comprise over 80 percent of the new customers served. Legislation is proposed under which REA's borrowings
from the Treasury would be at an interest rate not in excess of the average
rate paid by the Treasury on recently issued long-term marketable obligations, and REA would charge that rate plus one-fifth of one percent on
future electric and telephone loans. Also, pending legislation should be
enacted to place REA's operations on a revolving-fund basis.
NATURAL RESOURCES
The Federal Government has traditionally pursued policies designed
to assure an adequate supply of raw materials for current economic activity and also to conserve and develop resources for future needs. Significant advances in geological and geophysical exploration methods have led
to the discovery of new bodies of ore. Another area of Federal activity is
participation in the construction, maintenance, and operation of water
projects. These projects meet various needs, often simultaneouslyâ€”human consumption, irrigation, flood control, power generation, navigation,
and recreation. Expenditures for such purposes are expected to rise to
$1.2 billion in the fiscal year 1961. The Congress is requested to enact
a pending proposal for establishing a consistent basis on which non-Federal beneficiaries will share the costs of protection against floods.
Additional programs are being conducted by the Federal Government
to improve the water supply, which is a major problem in many parts
of our country. Encouraging progress is being made in research on techniques of converting brackish and sea water into fresh water. Important
research advances have also been made in water conservation techniques.
The Congress will be requested this year to strengthen the enforcement
provisions of Federal legislation for control of water pollution. Increasing attention is being directed also *o local needs for limiting air
pollution.
Sound management of timber resources is another aspect of Federal
concern in the development of natural resources. The Government seeks
not only to improve timber stands in national forests and on other public lands, but also to promote conservation practices on private woodlands. More than $200 million is being spent annually on Federal programs concerned with forest resources, in addition to outlays for soil conservation on farms, a part of which is also directed to improving forest
resources.
In recent years, increasing amounts of Federal funds have been spent
annually for the conservation, development, and wise use of recreational and
fish and wildlife resources. Intensive efforts are being made to accommodate an ever-increasing number of visitors to national parks, expected
to reach 80 million by 1966. In this connection, enactment has been




60

requested of a pending proposal for the preservation of certain undeveloped
shoreline areas for public use.
Federal assistance is also being provided for the enlargement and diversification of the Nation's mineral reserves. Mapping surveys, field
appraisals, and research programs on extraction methods and product
utilization contribute directly to these ends. Other contributions are being
made, for example, through the schedule of depletion allowances in the
Internal Revenue Code and the mandatory limitation of imports of petroleum and petroleum products. Legislation will again be recommended
for a long-range program to conserve helium gas, for contract authority
on coal research, and for revision of the fee schedule for noncompetitive
oil and gas leases on public lands.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The annual investment of sizable amounts of Federal funds in research
and development programs has served significantly to enlarge the scientific
and technological potential of the Nation. These outlays, which have
increased rapidly in recent years, exceed those made by business firms and
nonprofit institutions for the improvement of the technical base of our
society. According to revised compilations recently reported by the
National Science Foundation and the Bureau of the Budget, Federal research
and development obligations for the fiscal year 1960 exceed $8.1 billion;
they were $7.9 billion for the fiscal year 1959 and $5.9 billion for fiscal
1958. Estimates of expenditures for the same three periods are somewhat
lowerâ€”$7.5 billion, $6.6 billion, and $4.5 billion.
The predominant share of the Federal funds for research and development is devoted to military projects; but, even so, the benefits obtained from
them by the civilian economy have been, and will remain, impressive. The
billions of dollars spent annually for procurement and construction under
programs of the Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission
likewise have a peacetime value apart from their immediate contribution to
the Nation's security. Many areas of defense spending that will continue
to influence civilian technology may be citedâ€”for example, the development and production of aircraft and missiles, data-processing machines,
electronic communication and control equipment, high-energy fuels, unconventional devices for generating electrical energy, solar furnaces, and
metallic and other materials meeting strict performance requirements under
stress and at extreme temperatures.
The peacetime usefulness of atomic energy is also being demonstrated in
both research and production. Thus, more than 2,000 patents have been
released for public use without payment of royalties. Civilian nuclear
power reactors are being developed for eventual economic use in the United
States and abroad. Research is being conducted in the realms of highenergy physics and controlled thermonuclear fusion. Radioisotopes are
being used in agricultural research and various industrial processes.




61

Through bilateral agreements, participation in the International Atomic
Energy Agency, cooperation with regional atomic energy organizations, and
international conferences and exchanges of visits, efforts are being made to
widen these opportunities for the constructive application of nuclear energy.
By far the greater part of the Federal research and development budget
supports projects that are performed extramurally by profit and nonprofit
organizations under contract. Accordingly, many of the benefits of new
knowledge are diffused quickly and widely. Thus, some companies acquire
patents and know-how that serve, and will continue to serve, productive
purposes that range far beyond the objectives of the original research projects. Employees acquire new skills and specialized experience, and the
backgrounds of participating teachers, doctors, and other professional
workers are also enriched. In the fiscal year 1960, extramural projects
will account for about $6 billion of the Federal obligations for research and
development. The corresponding figure for the fiscal year 1959 is $5.5
billion, and for the fiscal year 1958, $4 billion.
The civilian economy is deriving technological advantages not only from
Federal expenditures for research, procurement, and construction but also,
of course, from the multibillion-dollar annual research outlays of business
firms and other private organizations. Various Federal legislative provisions have been designed to encourage business participation in private
research ventures. Among these are Section 174 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954, which permits business expenditures for research to be deducted from taxable income, and Section 9 of the Small Business Act of
1958, which encourages small business concerns to engage in joint research
and development efforts.
Federal support of basic research in the physical, biological, and social
sciences has been expanded in recent years, and an increasing proportion
of the funds for such research is being channeled into educational institutions, including research centers administered by colleges and universities.
The amount obligated for basic research in the fiscal year 1960, as in 1959,
is close to $500 million, an increase of almost one-half over the total for 1958.
EDUCATION AND HEALTH
In our Nation, responsibility for education and training and for
health services has traditionally been borne by local and State governments and by private groups. The Federal Government supplements these
efforts, however. In the current fiscal year, its expenditures for the promotion of education will total $549 million. Indeed, Federal support for
public education dates from the Ordinance of 1787; another landmark is the
land grant college system, which will soon celebrate its 100th anniversary.
Federal interest in health may be traced to 1798, when the Public Health
Service was established; the first food and drug law was enacted over half
a century ago.




62

The efforts in these fields at all levels of governmentâ€”local. State, and
Federalâ€”and by private groups are impressive, and they are expanding
rapidly. In the last ten years, total public and private expenditures for
education have almost tripled, reaching $22 billion in 1959; the number of
teachers in elementary and secondary schools has increased by 450,000, and
their average compensation has risen by 71 percent.
Public and private expenditures for health and medical care have almost
doubled during this periodâ€”from more than $12 billion to about $24 billion.
Annual Federal expenditures for health and medical programs rose from
about $700 million to $1.5 billion, and State and local expenditures increased from $1.7 billion to well over $2.5 billion.
Yet, as noted in Chapter 1, increased public and private efforts in education and health will be required to meet the needs of a growing population
and labor force. During the next five years, the population aged 14 to 24
will increase by nearly 1,400,000 annually, compared with 625,000 per year
from 1955 to 1960. The Nation's educational institutions will have to
prepare to accommodate far greater numbers of high school, college, and
graduate students. State and local governments will have to redouble their
programs to provide teachers and equipment for secondary and higher education. The assurance of an adequate supply of doctors and other health
personnel will require an expansion of medical training facilities. Since the
growth of the seasoned labor force of persons over 25 years of age will be
small, in contrast to the increase in the number of younger and less-experienced persons who will be seeking employment, business firms will find
it advisable to expand job-training programs.
For its part, the Federal Government has already been providing largescale support for education programs administered by the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare, the National Science Foundation, the
Atomic Energy Commission, and other agencies. Under the National Defense Education Act of 1958, Federal contributions are being made to
student loan funds; matching grants are being provided for equipment
needed in teaching science, mathematics, and foreign languages; and assistance is being given to teacher training in foreign languages, graduate study
in all fields, including science and mathematics, and guidance counseling
and testing services. Other programs include graduate and faculty fellowships, institutes for college and high school teachers of science and mathematics, traineeships, and grants for research and equipment. In the current
school year, about 100,000 college students, almost three times as many as
last year, are expected to make use of the loan funds established under this
Act.
Expenditures for education and training of veterans, currently requiring
nearly $450 million, will amount to a little more than $300 million in the
fiscal year 1961. For ex-servicemen having service-connected disabilities,
however, a necessary program of vocational rehabilitation will be recommended to the Congress.




63

As noted, programs for raising standards of health throughout the Nation
have been given large and increasing Federal support in recent years.
These programs include the research conducted at the National Institutes
of Health, research grants to medical schools and research institutions,
and grants to States for the construction of hospitals and other health
facilities. They will entail Federal expenditures approaching $600 million
in 1961, about double the amount spent for these purposes in the fiscal
year 1953.
Finally, a program involving Federal expenditures of nearly $1 billion
in the fiscal year 1961 serves veterans eligible for hospitalization and other
medical benefits under existing law.
PERSONAL SECURITY
The efforts of Government to foster sustainable inflation-free economic
growth are its principal contribution to strengthening the foundations of
personal security for all Americans. An expanding economy offers opportunities for better jobs and self-advancement, for good homes, and for
greater independent financial provision against the hazards of life. As
indicated in Chapter 1 of this Report, Americans have scored impressive
improvement in recent years in individual security and well-being. Nevertheless, as earlier Economic Reports have pointed out, a dynamic, urban
economy also presents hazards to personal security that in some instances
may be met inadequately or not at all by individual efforts. By helping
individuals overcome these hazards, Government strengthens the foundations of personal security; and, by improving morale and efficiency and
helping to maintain incomes in times of economic slack, it further enhances
the economy's capacity for healthy growth.
Existing programs for promoting personal security and welfare should
be adjusted in certain respects. First, improvements are needed in the
Federal-State unemployment insurance system. The scope of this system,
under which some $2.4 billion was paid in 1959 (exclusive of benefits for
Federal employees, veterans, and railroad employees), should be extended
to employers of one or more persons, to nonprofit institutions, and to
Federal instrumentalities that are not now covered. It is also recommended
that the Federal-State system be extended to Puerto Rico, which now has
its own unemployment insurance law, and that the provisions of the District
of Columbia law be brought up to the standard recommended for all States.
Under the present Federal-State system, the responsibility for the amount
and duration of benefits rests with the States. In general, benefits have
lagged behind the rise in wages, and it is again recommended that the States
increase their benefits to make the great majority of covered workers eligible
for payments equal to at least half their regular earnings; and that the States
increase the maximum duration of benefits to 26 weeks a year for all eligible
workers who remain unemployed that long.




The heavy unemployment benefit payments during the last recession
strained the finances of several State unemployment funds. Three of these
States secured $213 million in loans from the Federal Unemployment
Account. Three other States were eligible for such advances. It is possible that the funds of a few additional States would be in a precarious
financial condition if another recession should occur in the next few years
unless their finances are improved. This problem is under study by the
Secretary of Labor.
The proceeds of the present Federal unemployment tax barely suffice
to finance the administration of the Federal-State employment security
system as it stands today. Steps should be taken to provide additional
funds for administration as the system expands and also to rebuild the
Federal Unemployment Account which is virtually exhausted.
Amendments are needed to remedy serious defects in the legislation enacted in 1958 to protect the interests of the Nation's working men and
women in private pension and welfare plans, under which funds amounting
to more than $30 billion have been accumulated. Corrective legislation
was proposed in the last session of the Congress to allow the Secretary of
Labor to make necessary interpretations of the law and to enforce compliance. The proposal also contained provisions necessary to deal with
such crimes as bribery and embezzlement. Both of these amendments are
again recommended to the Congress.
The Congress is again requested to extend the coverage of the Fair Labor
Standards Act to several million workers not now receiving its protection.
While such a law does not deal with the fundamental causes of low incomes, it may help safeguard the economic interests of workers at the fringes
of competitive labor markets.
To enhance the progress being made toward equalizing economic
opportunity for all citizens, certain legislative improvements are required in
programs that lie within Federal jurisdiction. Favorable consideration is
again requested for legislation to revise the outmoded provisions of the
8-hour laws applying to Federal and certain federally assisted construction
projects, and to carry out the principle of equal pay for equal work without
discrimination because of sex. The Congress should also establish a statutory commission on equal job opportunities under Government contracts.
Efforts to reduce the hardship and loss occasioned by occupational accidents, which amount to nearly 2 million each year, should be intensified by
employers and by State and local governments. Where necessary, the
States should improve workmen's compensation systems with respect to
benefits, administration, and provision for rehabilitation.
Nearly 14 million persons are currently receiving benefits under the Federal program of old-age, survivors, and disability insurance, compared
with 12.4 million at the end of 1958 and 11.1 million at the end of 1957.
Old-age benefits exceed $112 per month, on the average, for a retired
worker and his wife; aggregate benefits amounted to $10.3 billion in 1959,




65

compared with $8.6 billion in 1958. The liberalization of benefit amounts
in 1958 and an increase in the number of beneficiaries caused the rapid
rise in total benefit payments. The provision of benefits for permanently
disabled workers and their dependents, which became effective in 1957,
has added more than 400,000 persons to the rolls. The average monthly
benefit for a disabled person exceeded $88 in 1959. The public assistance
programs, to which the Federal Government now contributes more than
$1.8 billion of the funds expended annually, distributed more than $3.6
billion to needy persons in the fiscal year 1959, compared with $3.3 billion
in 1958.
Programs designed to return handicapped persons to remunerative employment are administered by all States. The Federal Government supports State programs with grants averaging about 60 percent of total State
agency expenditures. Federal grants in support of rehabilitation and rehabilitation research and training totaled $58 million in the fiscal year 1959.
In that year, 81,000 persons were rehabilitated, compared with less than
56,000 in 1954 and the long-range objective of at least 200,000 persons
annually.
AREA ASSISTANCE
Although the number of labor market areas in the United States with
a substantial surplus of labor beyond current requirements has been reduced
significantly as economic activity has expanded, many communities continue to suffer from substantial and persistent unemployment. Assistance
to these communities is available through a number of Federal agencies,
whose activities in this connection are coordinated through an interdepartmental Committee To Coordinate Federal Urban Area Assistance Programs, as well as from State and local groups. In 1959, the Office of Area
Development of the Department of Commerce, which carries the principal
responsibility for providing Federal assistance, aided an increasing number
of area development groups in their efforts to strengthen the economic bases
of their communities. Technical assistance furnished by the Office included
counseling on methods used by various communities to solve their development problems, on community industrial foundations and industrial parks,
and on State and local financing plans for promoting economic development.
The Department of Labor aids community organizations in connection
with manpower aspects of economic development and with on-the-job training. Financial assistance to business concerns is furnished through the
Small Business Administration. The "set-asides" of defense contracts
for concerns located in areas of substantial labor surplus help to bolster
economic activity in particular communities.
Legislation is needed, however, to supplement and strengthen these efforts
to help areas of persistent unemployment create new job opportunities.
Such legislation should stimulate and complement the efforts of communities to help themselves, should promote maximum participation by private




66

financial institutions and by State and local agencies, should encourage the
creation of new job opportunities rather than the mere transference of jobs
from one area of the country to another, and should encompass technical aid
for the economic diversification of rural low-income areas and single-industry
communities.
A recommendation has already been made to the Congress for a program
that meets these specifications. It would provide for Federal participation
in loans to business concerns, for financial assistance to State and local development groups, and for technical assistance to local groups seeking to
strengthen their regional economies.
HOUSING AND HOME FINANCING
The past year was an exceptionally active one in the home building and
home financing industries. Some 1,340,000 new private dwelling units
were started, of which 440,000 were financed under mortgages either insured
or guaranteed by the Federal Government. The funds that flowed into
this use in 1959 are estimated at $15 billion, a record amount, despite
the increasingly intensive competition of other financing requirements.
The role of the Federal Government in home financing has assumed
great importanceâ€”in terms of the impact on housing and home financing
markets and in respect of the burden on the Federal budget. Thus, the
Federal National Mortgage Association now holds a portfolio of $5.6
billion of mortgages and utilizes $2.7 billion of Treasury funds for this purpose. Under the Urban Renewal Program, nearly $250 million has already been paid out in grants as the Federal share of clearing city areas
for redevelopment, and some $1.1 billion of additional funds will ultimately be paid to the cities under existing contracts and reservations of
funds. Nearly $675 million has already been paid out under the public
housing program in annual contributions to local housing authorities; and
the Federal Government is obligated to make annual contributions for the
next several decades to repay $3.5 billion of outstanding indebtedness, together with interest, under contracts for projects completed or under construction. Loans of about $700 million have been disbursed to colleges and
universities under the college housing program, and about $460 million
of commitments and reservations for additional loans are outstanding. The
Veterans Administration has employed $1 billion of Treasury funds for
direct loans to veterans for the purchase of homes.
Under present law, the Federal Housing Administration's program for
the insurance of home improvement and modernization loans will expire
on October 1, 1960, unless extended. This program, under which some
$12.4 billion of loans have been insured since its inception in 1934, should
be made permanent. Also, the present ceiling on VA interest rates is
again restricting the ability of veterans to avail themselves of this form
of home-purchase financing. The Congress should accordingly place this




67

program on the same basis,, with respect to maximum interest rate requirements, as FHA programs. The maximum permissible interest rate
on armed service housing loans insured by FHA should also be adjusted to
permit such loans to be made at rates above the present 4/2 percent ceiling.
FOREIGN ECONOMIC RELATIONS
Stronger efforts must be made at this time to expand United States
exports of goods and services. Fiscal and monetary policies designed to
restrain inflation provide a solid basis for such efforts, but more needs to
be done to strengthen the competitive position of our exports. In this
connection, the Federal Government should encourage intensified use of
Department of Commerce facilities for disseminating foreign trade information to exporters and potential foreign buyers of American products;
strengthen the commercial activities of our Foreign Service; increase the
number of our trade missions to other countries; and arrange for more
extensive United States participation in trade fairs abroad.
These steps should make more effective the efforts of private businesses
to increase foreign sales. Expansion of exports should be a major aim of
American business in the coming year. To take full advantage of expanding market opportunities abroad, businessmen will have to price competitively, sell aggressively, adapt and design products to meet the needs of
foreign buyers, and offer adequate credit and service facilities.
Markets for United States products were significantly expanded last
year, particularly toward the end of the year, by the reduction of quantitative restrictions on dollar imports by many of our trading partners abroad,
as described in Chapter 2 of this Report. The United States intends to
continue encouraging the removal of remaining restrictions on imports
from the dollar area. These efforts, which are expected to result in a
further expansion of United States export opportunities, will be made in
such international forums as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
and the International Monetary Fund, as well as through bilateral consultations with foreign governments.
It is hoped that the industrial countries, consonant with their growing
financial ability, will increase their long-term lending to less developed
countries, and this subject is being actively discussed with the governments
concerned. For its part, the United States will continue vigorously with its
plans to aid the economic growth of less developed countries. The efforts
of many of these countries have already been fruitful, and the groundwork is
being laid for more rapid advances in the future. In many instances, however, the level of living in the less developed countries remains very low.
The efforts of the United States to aid less developed countries to improve their productivity and level of living will be channeled through institutions that have served in the past, including both the Development Loan
Fund and the Export-Import Bank (which has just observed its twenty -




68

fifth anniversary), and through appropriate new institutions. The InterAmerican Development Bank, which came into existence late last year, will
begin operations shortly. This institution, which brings together the United
States and the countries of Latin America, manifests the enduring interest
that the United States has in the economic progress of its neighbors.
The formation of the International Development Association will also
be pursued actively during the year. It is expected that funds for the
initial United States subscription will be requested during the year.
FEDERAL STATISTICS
Significant steps have been taken in recent years to achieve an improved
and better integrated program of Federal statistics on the Nation's economy.
Important additional improvements are proposed for the coming fiscal year.
The 1961 budget for current statistical programs provides for a net increase of about $2.5 million over 1960 appropriations. This increased appropriation would make it possible (1) to provide better crop and livestock
estimates, based on experimental work previously undertaken, (2) to
improve retail trade statistics, (3) to initiate a monthly survey of the service
trades and a quarterly survey of State and local government finances, and
(4) to carry forward work initiated this year, within the framework of the
national income and product accounts, for a table of interindustry purchases
and sales and for real output estimates by major industries.
In the area of social statistics, provision is made for obtaining data from
health examinations of a scientifically selected random sample of the population, as part of the national health survey program initiated in 1957.
Improvements in statistics on education and on marriages and divorces
are also planned.
Provision is also made for the continuation of work on the periodic censuses and on the five-year project to revise the consumer price index. The
1961 budget recommends funds for tabulating and processing economic
and demographic data collected through the 18th Decennial Census, and
for final publication of the results of the 1958 Censuses of Business, Manufactures, and Mineral Industries. The major appropriations for these
censuses were made last year. Funds are alsa included for preparatory work
on the 1962 Census of Governments.
A consumer expenditure survey will be undertaken as an integral part of
the revision of the consumer price index* This index, along with additional needs for price information, is being studied by a Price Statistics
Review Committee, which will make recommendations concerning these
programs by October 1960.
Improvements are also being made in the statistics on wages and salaries
for different occupations and in different industries and labor markets;
on fringe benefit costs; and on current wage rate changes.




69

COMBINING PRIVATE ACTIONS WITH PUBLIC POLICIES
This chapter has presented the major legislative proposals of a 1960 program to supplement and reinforce existing Federal laws that contribute to
our Nation's capacity for inflation-free economic growth. In accordance
with the language and the spirit of the Employment Act, this program
acknowledges that the State and local governments and the private sector
of the economy have vital roles to play in the achievement of such growth.
Indeed, in the present economic circumstances, when opportunities for
vigorous expansion are abundantly evident, these roles should be encouraged to the fullest extent, while the Federal role should become more
restrained.
The current economic setting is favorable for the enactment of proposals
of long-run significance for sound growth and greater well-being. Accordingly, the 1960 program looks to a modification of farm programs and includes proposals for enhancing the competitive character of our economy,
for improving the effectiveness of various Federal lending and loan insurance programs, for extending and strengthening present provisions for personal security and welfare, for helping to provide new job opportunities in
areas with high and persistent unemployment, and for establishing a new
international agency to assist the less developed countries of the free world.
At the present time, the Federal Government could make its greatest
contribution to inflation-free economic growth through financial policies
that help create an environment favorable to the exercise of maximum
private initiative. The major step in creating such an environment would
be the achievement of the recommended budget surplus for debt retirement in the fiscal year 1961. The effectiveness of this policy would be
heightened by removal of the interest rate limitations that currently inhibit
the noninflationary management of the Federal debt. Following the budget
balance now in prospect for the fiscal year 1960, and complemented by the
policies of the independent Federal Reserve System, these elements of the
1960 program would make important contributions to sustainable economic
growth.
Fiscal and monetary policies gain strength from each other and are
powerful instruments for preventing the development of inflationary pressures which can endanger the healthy growth of our economy. But there
is need to supplement these Government policies with appropriate private
actions, especially those affecting profits and wages. Our markets must
be sufficiently flexible to allow downward as well as upward adjustments
in individual prices if we are to achieve greater stability in the general level
of prices. Achievement of this desirable result is unlikely unless the national
average of increases in wage and salary rates and related labor benefits remains within the limits of national productivity gains. Under such a
standard, price reductions in sectors of the economy where productivity is
advancing especially rapidly would offset increases that might be warranted
elsewhere.




70

The general wage-productivity-price relationship emphasizes the importance of private actions favorable to the acceleration of productivity
gains. The achievement of widely shared and sustainable increases in
economic rewards, without inflation, must rest on a solid foundation of
productivity advance. Accordingly, it is important for management and
labor to cooperate for more complete attainment of the productivity potentials afforded by continuing technological progress.
In our free economy and under our system of shared responsibility, we
do not rely on Government alone for the achievement of inflation-free
economic growth. On the contrary, the attainment of this objective requires a blending of suitable public policies and private actions, both of
which rest upon an informed public opinion. To enhance public awareness
of the damage that could be done by inflation and to support Government's
efforts to restrain inflationary forces, the Congress should amend the Employment Act of 1946 to make reasonable price stability an explicit goal
of national economic policy. Although this goal may already be implied in
the declared objectives of the Act, such an amendment would express more
firmly our national determination to curb inflation. The amendment that
has been proposed by the Administration is limited to a change in the language of the Act's declaration of policy. Such an amendment would help
accomplish the desired purpose without causing changes in our economic
institutions that might be inimical to the freedoms we now enjoy.

Report to the President on the Activities of the
Council of Economic Advisers During 1959
In pursuance of the duties set forth in the Employment Act of 1946, the
Council continued in 1959 to follow developments in the economy, to
analyze their significance for outlook and policy, and to keep under study
major policy questions having a bearing on the objectives of the Employment Act. The Council consisted of Raymond J. Saulnier, Chairman,
Karl Brandt, and Henry C. Wallich.
Through its Chairman, the Council reported frequently to the President
and to the Cabinet on current economic developments and on the economic
effects of Government policies and programs. As circumstances warranted,
it submitted recommendations for legislative enactments and for administrative actions under existing programs, which, in its judgment, would help
to further vigorous, sustainable, inflation-free economic growth. The
Council made numerous analytical reviews of legislative proposals emanating from the Congress.
The Council continued to draw heavily on the resources of the operating
departments and agencies of the Federal Government and to avail itself
fully of the information and counsel of individuals and private groups.
As in previous years, it was aided by the Advisory Board on Economic
Growth and Stability, which is particularly helpful in maintaining close
and constructive working relationships with various departments and agencies of the Government. Member agencies of the Board are presently
represented by the following officials:
Department of Stateâ€”Thomas C. Mann, Assistant Secretary for
Economic Affairs
Department of the Treasuryâ€”Julian B. Baird, Under Secretary
Department of Agricultureâ€”True D. Morse, Under Secretary
Department of Commerceâ€”Philip A. Ray, Under Secretary
Department of Laborâ€”James T. O'Connell, Under Secretary
Department of Health, Education, and Welfareâ€”Bertha Adkins,
Under Secretary
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Systemâ€”Abbot L. Mills,
Member of the Board
Bureau of the Budgetâ€”Elmer Staats, Deputy Director
Export-Import Bank of Washingtonâ€”Samuel C. Waugh, President
The White House Officeâ€”Don Paarlberg, Special Assistant to the
President
Council of Economic Advisersâ€”Raymond J. Saulnier, Chairman




77

Committees and Task Forces
The Council participated during the year in the work of a number of
important committee groups and task forces within Government. The
Chairman of the Council serves as a member of the Cabinet Committee
on Price Stability for Economic Growth, chaired by the Vice President
of the United States. He also serves as a member of an informal group
which discusses problems of financial policy with the President; the other
members are the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Special Assistant to
the President with responsibilities in the economic area.
The Chairman of the Council attends all Cabinet meetings, special meetings on legislative matters, and those meetings of the National Security
Council at which economic matters are discussed. Members of the Council
and its staff participate in the work of the Planning Board of the National
Security Council.
The Chairman of the Council serves as Chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Small Business and of the Committee on Government Activities
Affecting Prices and Costs. He is a member of the Board of the Federal
National Mortgage Association, represents the Council on the Civil and
Defense Mobilization Board and on the President's Special Committee on
Financial Policies for Postattack Operations, and participates in semiannual meetings of the Business Advisory Council of the Department of
Commerce. Meetings of the technical consultants to the Business Advisory Council are attended by a member of the staff of the Council of
Economic Advisers.
Dr. Brandt served as a member of the interdepartmental Committee for
Rural Development Program and as a member of the interagency work
group on research and analysis of the Federal Council on Aging. He also
attended regularly the sessions of the Council on Foreign Economic Policy
and of the National Agricultural Advisory Commission.
Dr. Wallich participated in the work of the National Advisory Council
and served as a member of the interdepartmental Committee To Coordinate Federal Urban Area Assistance Programs, under the Chairmanship
of the Under Secretary of Commerce.
The Council met during the year with representatives of industrial and
commercial concerns and financial houses, with professional economists
from universities, with representatives of agriculture, industry, and labor,
and with groups considering business conditions, the economic outlook,
and policies relating to economic growth and stability. Throughout the
year, Council staff members were in touch with experts of other Government departments and agencies and outside groups, as the need arose.
Participation in international meetings here and abroad and frequent
discussions with foreign visitors continue to be an important part of the
Council's activities. In the past year, two members of the Council and
members of the Council's staff took part in meetings held in Paris under




78

the auspices of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation
(OEEC), and prepared, as in previous years, a report on the United States
economy for use in the OEEC's annual review of world economic developments. The Council and members of its staff received various visiting
groups of economists and officials from other countries and international
organizations, and two members of the Council staff held a number of
seminars for foreign businessmen and Government officials.
Publications Work
In keeping with its responsibilities under the Employment Act, the Council assisted the President in the preparation of his annual Economic Report
to the Congress; 30,000 copies of the January 1959 Report were printed.
Copies were distributed to members of the Joint Economic Committee, all
other members of the Congress, departments and agencies of the Government, representatives of the press, and depository libraries throughout the
country. The Superintendent of Documents sold 19,000 copies to the
general public.
The Chairman of the Council, accompanied by the other Council members, testified in executive session before the Joint Economic Committee on
the 1959 Economic Report of the President. At these hearings, the character and effectiveness of economic policies for the preceding year were
reviewed, the prospects for 1959 were appraised, and recommendations
were made for policies that would promote economic growth and price
stability in the year ahead.
The Council prepares Economic Indicators, a monthly compendium of
current economic statistics, published by the Joint Economic Committee
of the Congress. Copies of this publication are distributed to all members
of the Congress and to depository libraries. In addition, 10,000 copies of
each monthly issue are sold by the Superintendent of Documents to subscribers and others.
Council Members and Staff
Dr. Saulnier served as Consultant to the Council from 1953 to 1955,
has been a member of the Council since April 1955, and its Chairman
since December 1956. He is on leave of absence from Barnard College,
Columbia University, where he is Professor of Economics, and from the
National Bureau of Economic Research.
Dr. Brandt, who received an interim appointment as a member of the
Council in November 1958, was confirmed by the Senate on March 12,
1959. He is on leave of absence from Stanford University, where he is
Professor of Economic Policy and Associate Director of the Food Research Institute.
Dr. Wallich was appointed a member of the Council on April 15, 1959
and confirmed by the Senate on May 5. He is on leave of absence from
Yale University, where he is Professor of Economics. Dr. Wallich succeeded




79

Paul W. McCracken, Professor of Business Conditions at the School of
Business Administration of the University of Michigan, who resigned on
January 31, 1959, to return to his University work; he had served as
a member of the Council from December 1956.
The Council is assisted by a staff of 12 senior economists and statisticians
who are experts in their fields. Each staff member is responsible for
obtaining the cooperation of other Government agencies and of business,
labor, and other private groups in analyzing and evaluating economic
developments in his assigned areas, and for keeping the Council advised
of current and foreseeable developments. The full-time staff members
are Bernard S. Beckler, Harold F. Breimyer, Henry W. Briefs (on leave
from Georgetown University), Samuel L. Brown, Robert C. Colwell,
Frances M. James, Marshall A. Kaplan, Hal B. Lary, David W. Lusher,
Irving H. Siegel, Walter F. Stettner, and Collis Stocking, who is also
Administrative Officer of the Council. Charles A. Taff of the University
of Maryland serves as a Consultant to the Council.
Charles L. Schultze resigned from the Council staff on January 30, 1959
to join the faculty of Indiana University and John A. Schnittker on August
14, 1959 to return to his post of Associate Professor, Department of
Economics, Kansas State University.
For the fiscal year 1960, the Congress appropriated $395,000 for the
Council's activities, the same amount appropriated for the fiscal year 1959.

I. Growth of Population
Notable changes have occurred during the past decade in the size and
structure of the United States population and in the composition of both
families and households. The impact of these changes is already evident
in numerous sectors of the economy and will have a further important
bearing on national economic development in the decades immediately
ahead. An understanding of the dimensions of the accelerated growth of
the population in recent years and of the structural changes in economic
demands that are inherent in its changing age composition should be
helpful in orienting public and private policies appropriately to these
important movements.
POPULATION INCREASES DURING 1950-59
Between January 1, 1950 and July 1, 1959, the estimated population of
the United States, including armed forces abroad, increased from
150,552,000 to 177,103,000 persons. This increase of more than 17/2
percent in the course of 9 5/2 years resulted from 23,648,000 more births
than deaths, a net immigration of 2,750,000, and the addition of 153,000
Alaskans (civilian population on January 1, 1959) to the United States

population. The population of Hawaii, which is estimated to have been
about 603,000 on September 1, 1959, will further increase the national
totals for January 1, 1960 and thereafter.
Except in 1952, 1953, and 1958, the estimated annual net increase in
each year ended July 1 in the last decade exceeded that of the preceding
year (Table B-l); the percentage increase ranged from 1.66 to 1.80 per
annum. As recently as 1941, the increase had been less than 1 percent. The
estimated number of births each year ended July 1 during the last decade
was larger than the number in the preceding year, with the exception of
1950 and 1959. The number of deaths also increased each year, except
in 1954 and 1959, but the annual average increase was only about one-third
of the annual average increase in the number of births. Net civilian immigration varied from year to year, within the range of 200,000 to 400,000
per annum.
FUTURE AGE GROUPINGS OF PERSONS BORN BEFORE JULY 1, 1957
Because birth rates, as measured by the number of live births per 1,000 of
population, have varied considerably over the last hundred years, the distribution of our population among age groups is relatively uneven. Not
only did the rising birth rate after World War II cause a disproportionate
increase in the number of persons now under 14 years of age, but the declining birth rate during the decade of the 1920's and the very low birth rate of
the 1930's reduced the size of the group that is now between 25 and 35
years of age.
Many of our future demands for goods and services, as well as our needs
for specific resources with which to supply them, will depend on the number of persons in the various age groups at the time. Needs for education
and employment and also the timing of household formation are, for the
population as a whole, closely related to the number of persons who pass
certain age marks each year.
Table B-2 gives estimates of the number of persons in various age groups
on July 1 of 1950, 1955, and 1957, and of the distribution in selected years
up to 1980, on the assumption of a moderate reduction in mortality rates
and about the same volume of immigration as in recent years. The percentage change from 1960 in the number of persons in each age group is
shown in Table B-3.
Of particular interest is the marked increase during the next decade that
is indicated for the number of high school and college-age boys and girls.
Also, substantial increases are expected during at least the next 15 years for
the age groups from which new entrants to the labor force are drawn.
Those who reach the average age for marriage are generally in the same
age groups as those who commence working. Thus the projected increase
in the number in these groups foretells a corresponding growth in the rat;e
of household formations and in the creation of additional demands for
housing and for a wide range of commodities and services generally pur-

chased by newly employed and newly married persons. However, it is
significant that almost no change during the next five years is indicated for
the total number of persons between the ages of 25 and 45, the period of
typical first ownership of homes. But the projections show that after 1965,
the group between 25 and 35 years of age will expand considerably, while
the group between 35 and 45 will decline slightly until after 1975. Rather
sharp increases will occur during the next two decades in the number of
persons aged 65 and over, and by 1980 there will be nearly twice as many
persons in this group as there were in 1950.
Estimates of the size and composition of the labor force over the next
decade have been constructed on the basis of various assumptions. These
estimates point toward a labor force growth of from 12 million to 14 million
by 1970, with the greater part of the increase occurring in the second half
of the decade. Women are expected to comprise some 40 percent of the
increase. For men, the rate of growth will be substantially greater in the
younger working groups, particularly those under 25, than in the older




85

groups; for women, however, proportionately greater increases are expected
in groups 45 years of age and older.
ESTIMATES OF POPULATION GROWTH
The future size of the population in the younger age groups will be influenced more by birth rates than by death rates or by net immigration. Over
the past fifty years, the birth rate has fluctuated considerably, in contrast
to the death rate, which has declined gradually; and in recent years, net
immigration has been relatively unimportant in shaping the size of the total
population. Thus, estimates of the number of persons expected to comprise
the various groups under 25 years of age until 1980 will be governed largely
by the assumptions made regarding the birth rate during the interim years.
Because of the previous variability in birth rates and their dependence on
factors that, in many cases, cannot be accurately forecast, the projections of
the population born after July 1, 1957, shown in Table B-4, were based on

several fertility assumptions that span the high and low rates actually experienced in recent years. Fertility, as used in this connection, refers to a measure which takes into account both birth rates according to the ages of women
and the number of women of childbearing age. Series I, which shows the
largest increase over the period 1960-80, assumes a fertility rate from 1958 to
1980 of 10 percent above the 1955-57 average; Series II, that the rate will
remain at the 1955-57 average until 1980; Series III, that by 1965-70 the




86

rate will decline to the 1949-51 level and will remain there to 1980; and
Series IV, that by 1965-70 fertility will drop to the 1942-44 level and
will then even out. All computations are carried forward from July 1, 1957
as a date of reference.
It is apparent from the projections that steady or rising fertility rates
during the next two decades will cause substantial increases in the pre-school
and school-age segments of the population. It should be noted, however,
that there are significant differences in the various projections, depending
on the assumptions made with respect to fertility rates.
CHANGES IN FARM POPULATION
The farm population has declined by about 34 percent since 1910 (Table
B-5). The decrease in the number of persons living on farms was rather
gradual until World War II, but since then net migration has proceeded
more rapidly. While the farm population has been dwindling, the total

population of the United States has been growing, so that the proportion
living on farms has declined substantially. Fifty years ago, one out of three
persons lived on a farm; at present, one out of eight is a farm resident.
The decline in farm population since 1950 has been much greater among
persons 18 to 44 years of age than among other age groups. Because of
this, farm people 45 years old and over now outnumber, for the first time,
farm persons who are 18 to 44 years of age. The total number of males on
farms slightly exceeds the number of females, except in the age group 25 to
44 years.
The net migration of persons from farms in the past four decades has
been substantially larger than the decline in the farm population, as farm
families have continued to contribute to the growth of the total population.
During the 1930's, as a result of the depression, the rate was considerably
less than in the 1920's; but World War II caused a record increase. The

annual average migration was very high in the years 1950-53, owing in part
to the Korean conflict, declined somewhat until 1956, but rose again in the
following three-year period (Table B-6). Since 1920, net migration from
farms has totaled nearly 27 million persons; however, the farm population
has declined by only 11 million, from 32.1 million to 21.2 million. The
continuing migration from farms to urban areas has contributed to the
increase in the nonagricultural labor force and to the growth of towns
and cities.

The employment status of persons 14 years old and over living on farms
has changed significantly since 1950 when, out of nearly 9.5 million such
persons employed, nearly 70 percent worked in agriculture. The number
of employed farm residents has since declined by almost 2 million, and
less than 60 percent, or 4J/2 million, now work in agriculture. During the
past decade, the number of persons who live on farms but are engaged in
nonagricultural activities increased, and, as a percentage of the farmresident labor force, rose from 29 percent in 1950 to 38 percent in 1958.
Participation in off-the-farm employment among employed farm residents
is more common for women than for men.
CHANGES IN HOUSEHOLD FORMATION
The number of households in the United States increased from 15,992,000
in July 1900 to 51,302,000 in March 1959. Households that include both
a husband and wife rose from 12,804,000 to 38,420,000 during this period,
while all other households, including single persons living alone in a dwelling
unit, increased from 3,188,000 to 12,882,000 (Table B-7).
Over the past fifty years, the number of nonfarm households has increased by 31,920,000; the number of farm households rose moderately
until 1935, but since then it has declined by more than 1,800,000. During
the past decade, nonfarm households have increased at an average rate
of about 1,000,000 per year, while the number of farm households has
declined at an annual average rate of about 100,000.

HOUSEHOLD AND FAMILY CHARACTERISTICS
Differences in the composition of households are a reflection of current
economic and social influences. In 1959, nearly 75 percent of the households included a husband and wife, over 14 percent had as a head a person either living alone or with unrelated persons, and 11 percent were
comprised of related persons but not including a husband and wife. More
than three times as many women as men were the heads of families that
did not contain both spouses.
In urban places, husband-wife families comprised only about 71 percent of all households, while in rural farms they accounted for nearly 84
percent. Conversely, the households of single and unrelated persons made
up over 17 percent of the total in urban places but less than 8 percent in
rural farm areas.
The median age of husbands in husband-wife households was 44 years
in 1959, and the median age of wives was 41 years. However, in other
households, the median age of the head was 57 years. In nearly a million
cases where married couples lived in the household of relatives, the median
age of the husband was 34 years and that of the wife was 30 years.
Since 1948, there has been a marked increase in the number of husbandwife families having two or more children under 18 years of age. In that
year, 32 percent had two or more children of their own, 23 percent had one
child, and 45 percent had none. By 1958, 40 percent had two or more chil-




dren, 19 percent had one child, and 41 percent had none. The increase in
the number of their own children was less marked in farm families than in
nonfarm families.
PROSPECTIVE INCREASES IN HOUSEHOLDS
On the basis of projected population growth and various assumptions
concerning continuation of the changes in marital and household status
that occurred between 1950 and 1957, estimates have been made of the
number of households there will be in the United States up to 1980. In
constructing such estimates, several assumptions had to be made, which
involved different rates of household formation in future years. Accordingly, as shown in Table B-8, the outlook for household growth is expressed
in terms of four separate series. Because of the variations in the assumptions, the four series differ in respect of the amount of increase in the
number of households from 1960 to 1980.

These estimates rest in a considerable degree on projections of the population in various age brackets. Until the latter part of the 1970's, the number
of households formed will be determined largely by the marriage, divorce,
and mortality rates of persons now living, and by their actions regarding the
formation or dissolution of households. Sometime before 1980, however,
the number of households will be influenced also by the birth rate during
the next several years.
The economic significance of the indicated growth in the number of
households is considerable. Since most of the increase will arise in husbandwife households, the requirements for family dwelling units will grow
correspondingly. From this will stem the related demands for household
equipment and furnishings and a wide range of related items of consumption.




II. Employment and Earnings
As the recovery movement was extended in 1959 into a more general
expansion, employment increased and unemployment was substantially reduced. During the first half of the year, workweeks were lengthened and
hourly and weekly earnings increased rapidly. Real earnings also were
sharply higher, because price increases were small. From July to November, however, prolonged strikes in industries producing primary metals
adversely affected employment and earnings, but expansion was resumed by
the end of the year.
EMPLOYMENT AND THE LABOR FORCE
The total number of persons employed in civilian occupations averaged
65.6 million in 1959, compared with 64.0 million in 1958 (Table B-9).
Employment increased rapidly until July, but then was seriously checked
by the widespread effects of the long strike in the steel industry; before the

end of the year, however, expansion was renewed. In December, the total
number employed was 66.2 million (seasonally adjusted), a rise of more
than 2.8 million from the recession low of 1958 and an increase of nearly
800,000 above the high point attained in 1957. Agricultural employment,
in which a decreasing proportion of the labor force is engaged, changed
little during the year.
The civilian labor force increased by nearly 750,000 in 1959, but since
employment increased by a greater amount, unemployment was substan-




91

tially reduced, averaging about 850,000 less than in 1958. The growth of
the labor force, like the expansion of employment, was greater in the first
half of the year than in the second. Women, especially those over 35 years
of age, accounted for much of the increase in the labor force. For men
over 25 years of age, the increase was slight; this reflected the small number
of births in the 1930Js and the greater inducements to retirement provided
by the social security system for those reaching age 65. The great rise in
the number of births, which began in the 1940's, is now beginning to affect
the labor force, however; for the teen-age group, the labor force increase
was comparatively large in 1959 (Table B-10). As the generation of the
1940's comes of working age in the next decade, the labor force is expected
to grow more rapidly.

Over the years, technological progress and rising levels of living bring
about substantial changes in the occupational and industrial structure of
employment. "White collar" employment, especially of professional and
technical staff, gains rapidly; agricultural employment declines; and other
manual occupations do not keep pace with the general long-term expansion.
Employment in the service industriesâ€”trade, government, and othersâ€”
tends to increase more, over the long run, than in industries producing
goods (Tables B-ll and B-12). These trends suggest, in broad outline,
the character of the employment opportunities that may be expected for
the growing labor force.
Over the shorter period of the business cycle, however, different changes
take place in the occupational and industrial distribution of the employed
population. Just as employment declines most sharply among production
workers in durable goods manufacturing industries during periods of recession, so it recovers most rapidly in these industries during periods of

and the middle of 1959 there was a net increase of 1.3 million in employment in the Nation's factories, a rise of 9 percent. The industries in which
employment recovered most rapidly were primary and fabricated metals,
machinery, transportation equipment, and apparel, but nearly all major
industries shared in the expansion. Employment in nonmanufacturing
industries, which had been less affected by the recession, rose by nearly 1.2
millionâ€”an increase of 3 percentâ€”in the same period (Table B-13).

1 Based on preliminary data for December.
2 See Table D-22, footnote 1, for types of workers included.
Source: Department of Labor.

During the long steel strike, which began on July 15 and continued until
suspended by injunction on November 7, employment ultimately declined
by more than 500,000 persons in the industries affected, exclusive of the
steel industry, whose striking workers also numbered approximately 500,000.




94

In the early weeks of the stoppage, employment fell by less than 100,000,
almost all the decline occurring in the mining and transportation industries,
which service steel production. Layoffs in steel-using industries increased
slowly at first. By the middle of October, however, work forces were being
cut back rapidly as inventories were drawn down. Because of the need to
replenish working stocks of steel, additional layoffs occurred in some steelusing industries for nearly a month after the mills were reopened. Employment ceased to expand in most other major industries during the period of
the strike; but as steel output was resumed in November, employment began
to recover rapidly.
UNEMPLOYMENT
Unemployment in 1959 averaged 3.8 million or 5.5 percent of the civilian
labor force, compared with 4.7 million, or 6.8 percent, in the previous year.
During the spring and early summer, the number unemployed was reduced
to about 5 percent of the labor force, seasonally adjusted, as employment
expanded and furloughed employees were recalled. However, for reasons
associated with the strike in the steel industry, the number increased in
the third quarter. This trend was reversed during the final months of the
year, and in December unemployment was 5.2 percent of the civilian labor
force, seasonally adjusted.
The individuals comprising the jobless group changed substantially in
every month of 1959, as people seeking work found jobs or retired from
the labor force, and as others became unemployed or began to look for work.
On the average, about 1.8 million persons became unemployed, voluntarily
or involuntarily, each month, and nearly 1.9 million found work or left the
labor market. During the spring, the number of people newly unemployed
(i.e., those seeking work for less than 5 weeks) declined to pre-recession
levels; it increased again in the autumn, with the spreading effects of the
steel strike. The number unemployed for periods of 15 weeks or more,
which had reached the high figure of almost 2 million in 1958, declined
rapidly in the first half of 1959 but did not change much thereafter. By
December, this group had been reduced by 1 million, but it still numbered
about 300,000 more than before the recession.
Unemployment during the recession increased most among men aged
20 to 44; correspondingly, the reduction during recovery was greatest for
this group. Rates of unemployment were also reduced, but not so substantially, for younger people, for men over 65, and for women. Unemployment among married men living with their familiesâ€”the group most firmly
committed to the labor forceâ€”averaged 3.6 percent of their number in the
labor force during 1959, compared with 5.1 percent in 1958 and 2.8
percent in 1957. The increase of unemployment attributable to the steel
strike occurred chiefly among men.
During the recession, unemployment was highest in durable goods manufacturing, mining, rail transportation, and construction. But by May
1959, unemployment rates in these industries had been sharply reduced




95

by extensive recalls of laid-off employees and by shifts of workers to other
lines of activity. Rates of unemployment for less experienced workers, employees in mining and construction, and nonwhite workers remained
higher in 1959 than before the recession.
Insured unemployment, which covers only persons eligible to draw unemployment compensation benefits, declined rapidly in the first half of 1959.
By July, the number in this group was 1.4 million, or about 3.3 percent
of the number of insured employees; this was approximately the level prevailing before the recession. Beginning in August, insured unemployment,
seasonally adjusted, increased again, as employees laid off in industries related to steel production filed claims for benefits. By the end of the year,
2.1 million people, or 5 percent of insured employees, were claiming benefits.
In all, about $2.6 billion was paid in unemployment benefits in 1959; payments in 1958 totaled $4.2 billion.
The general expansion of employment is reflected in data on employment conditions in the Nation's 145 major continental labor markets. In
July 1958, 86 major urban areas were officially classified as "areas of
substantial labor surplus," indicating unemployment in excess of 6 percent
of the labor force. The number was reduced to 73 in January 1959, to 43
in July, and to 29 in November. Of the major areas where unemployment
remained relatively high in November, 21 were in New England or other
eastern States. In this month, 116 of the 145 areas were classified in categories indicating a rate of unemployment lower than 6 percent, in contrast
to 59 in July 1958; of the 116 areas, 27 (including 11 in the midwestern
industrial region) had unemployment rates lower than 3 percent. Surveys
indicated that, while there were adequate numbers of workers in nearly
all of the Nation's labor markets, persons seeking work often lacked the
skill or training required for the job opportunities that were available.
Shortages of professional, scientific, clerical, and skilled manpower are the
rule in most labor markets.
HOURS OF WORK AND EARNINGS
The average length of the workweek of production employees in manufacturing industries turned upward in March 1958 and increased without
significant interruption through June 1959. From the low point in February 1958, the average workweek increased by 2.3 hours, or 6 percentâ€”a
larger expansion than occurred in the corresponding period of the 1954-55
recovery. Increases were greatest in the durable goods industries, but they
were substantial also in nondurable goods and nonmanufacturing industries.
Longer workweeks normally mean more overtime hours of work and
result in sharply increased hourly, as well as weekly, earnings. An increase
in overtime was general throughout manufacturing industry in the first
half of 1959 and was especially important in the industries producing
primary and fabricated metals, machinery, textiles, and rubber products.




96

The annual rate of flow of labor income was augmented by $29 billion
between April 1958 and June 1959. This rise of 12 percent in 14 months
of recovery and expansion was larger than that in the corresponding 14month period from July 1954 to September 1955. Important elements of
the increase were the longer workweeks and higher employment, which
have already been noted, and the substantial increase in hourly earnings
resulting from higher wage rates and increased overtime (Table B-14).
Average weekly earnings of production workers in manufacturing industries
rose from $80.81 in April 1958 to $91.17 in June 1959, or by nearly 13
percent; and the increase in real purchasing power was nearly as great,
since prices of consumer goods advanced only a little during this period.

Labor income declined during the steel strike from an annual rate of
$272 billion in June to $269 billion in October; by December, it had
increased again, to $274 billion. Lower employment, reduction of the
average workweek, and reduction of average hourly and weekly earningsâ€”
because the employees on strike or laid off had been employed in relatively
high-paid industriesâ€”were important factors in the decline.
DEVELOPMENTS IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
Wage rates continued to rise and fringe benefits continued to grow in
1959. Wage increases were put into effect for 7 million employees, about

85 to 90 percent of those covered by major labor agreements (Table B-15).
The average wage increase was smaller in 1959 than in 1958 primarily
because cost of living changes were smaller. The most common increase
was about 9 cents per hour, compared with about 12 cents in 1958.
Settlements negotiated in 1959 were concentrated in nondurable goods
manufacturing and in nonmanufacturing industries and affected nearly 3
million workers. As in 1958, negotiated wage increases averaged 7 or 8
cents per hour, and fringe benefits were improved in 7 out of 10 major
contracts. Revisions of health and welfare plans were the most frequent
type of fringe improvement. Relatively few settlements were concluded in
heavy industries in 1959; negotiations were not completed in railroads;
settlement of the steel dispute was not reached until January 4, 1960; and
contracts negotiated in earlier years and providing for deferred increases
were already in existence in the automobile and related industries.
The steel agreement provided for wage rate increases which, including
incentive pay effects, average 9.4 cents per hour, effective on December 1,
1960, and 8.6 cents per hour on October 1, 1961, in addition to liberalized
insurance and pension benefits. The companies will assume immediately
employee contributions for insurance, thus increasing hourly take-home
pay by about 6^2 cents. Steel companies estimate the increase in hourly
employment costs by the end of the 30-month contract period at 39 to 41
cents, including maximum effects of cost of living adjustments and indirect
effects on premium pay for overtime, social security, holidays, etc. This
settlement involves substantially smaller percentage hourly employment
costjncreases than in previous postwar steel settlements.
In the construction trades, about 9 out of 10 union wage scales were raised
in 1959, about the same proportion as in prior years. The average increase




for all scales was about 16 cents per hour, compared with 15 cents in 1957
and 1958.
Longer-term contracts and the use of cost of living escalator clauses
continued to be important in 1959. However, cost of living increases were
much smaller than in 1958, amounting to 1 cent per hour in steel, 3 cents
in railroads, 3 cents in the automobile and related industries, and 2 cents
in major bargaining situations in the trucking industry. Several new
agreements reached in 1959 placed limits on cost of living adjustments.
Agreements in the aluminum industry and in can manufacturing limited
adjustments to a maximum of 3 cents in each of the second and third
years of the contract. In the steel industry, the agreements concluded in
January 1960 also limited such increases to 3 cents in each of the last two
years of the contract period, and provided that increases due under these
clauses will be used to offset anticipated higher costs of insurance. Deferred
increases, most commonly amounting to 6 or 7 cents an hour, became effective for 2J4 million workers in 1959.
Concern with problems of unemployment was evident in the terms of
some settlements. Severance pay was established or liberalized, and in
two instances funds were established to cushion the impact of technological
change on employment.
Extended work stoppages occurred in 1959 in the basic steel, nonferrous
metals, meat-packing, and rubber industries. For the year as a whole,
the number of strikes recorded and the number of workers involved were
not notably high, judged by experience since World War II, but the
number of man-days of idleness due directly to labor-management disputes
was estimated at 69 million, the highest total for any year since 1946. The
116-day steel strike, lasting from July 15 to November 7, accounted for more
than one-fourth of the 1.9 million workers directly involved in strikes
during the year, and for about 60 percent of the time lost.

III. Agriculture
Despite less favorable weather, output on the Nation's 4.6 million
farms in 1959 slightly exceeded the record volume attained in 1958 and
was 25 percent above the 1947-49 average. Crop production was virtually
unchanged, while livestock production increased slightly. The corn harvest
increased by 560 million bushels, to a new high of 4.4 billion, and cotton
output rose by 3.2 million bales, to 14.7 million. These gains offset a decrease of 330 million bushels in wheat and sizable declines in oats, barley,
and soybeans. Production of hogs, broilers, and eggs increased substantially
while milk production declined somewhat.
OVERPRODUCTION AND EXCESS STOCKS
Food and natural fiber production in 1959 was so great that it exceeded,
once again, the absorptive capacity of domestic and foreign demand. As a
consequence, carryover stocks, already excessive, continued to grow. The
magnitude of present and prospective stocks is indicated by the data in
TableB-16.

The stock of 121 million tons of five grains expected to be on hand by
the summer and fall of 1960 exceeds by 70 million tons the estimated size
of reserves required to meet the initial needs of defense emergencies and
all but the worst weather contingencies. Cotton stocks also are much in
excess of a desirable carryover.
The major part of total stocks is in Government hands and constitutes a
burden on the Federal budget. This ties up sizable amounts of Federal
funds: during the fiscal year I960, Commodity Credit Corporation investment in inventory and loans may at times reach nearly $10 billion, and
by June 30, 1960 it is expected to be about $9 billion. Expenditures during
the year for storage, transportation, and interest will exceed $1.25 billion,
and substantial losses will be incurred as those commodities are disposed of
in domestic and export markets.
MAGNITUDE OF OUTPUT
As Table B-17 indicates, United States agricultural output increased
slowly during the three decades preceding World War II, and then advanced steeply during the two decades from 1940 through 1959. Output

was particularly large in 1958 and 1959 when, for the first time, annual
grain production exceeded 200 million tons; this is 80 percent more than the
average annual production during the decade before World War II. Production in 1959 of all kinds of meat, including poultry meat, exceeded 16
million tons, a rise of nearly 80 percent since the 1930's. Cotton and tobacco
production have increased less rapidly.
The more than 200 million tons of grain and 16 million tons of meat
currently produced in the United States compare with an estimated 125
million tons of grain and 7 million tons of meat produced in the Soviet
Union in 1957-58, and with a total of 107 million tons of grain and 14
million of meat produced in the 17 member countries of the Organization
for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), Yugoslavia, and Spain.
Yet the population of the Soviet Union is 30 million more than that of
the United States, and the population of the 19 European countries is almost
twice the United States total. Production per capita in the United States,
averaging 2,325 pounds of grain and 185 pounds of meat, compares with
1,200 pounds of grain and 70 pounds of meat in the Soviet Union, and 625
pounds of grain and 80 pounds of meat in the 19 European countries.
GROWTH IN PRODUCTIVITY
The growth in United States farm output" has been achieved through
an extraordinary increase in production per unit of labor and per unit of
land (Table B-18). Production per man-hour on farms in 1958 was more
than three times the 1930-39 average. The increase in the last ten years
was about 80 percent, a growth rate of 6 percent per year, or from 2 to 3
times the increase per year in nonfarm output per man-hour. Production

per man-hour has increased much faster in crop production than in animal
husbandry, since high mechanization and the heavy use of fertilizer in crops
have had no equivalent counterparts in livestock production.
The national average production of crops per acre increased by 15 percent
from 1946-48 to 1956-58. In view of the very large acreage devoted to
farming and the wide variation in latitude and climatic conditions under
which farming is carried on, this over-all productivity increase is most significant. Underlying it is an even more rapid rise in yields per acre of such
important crops as wheat, corn, and cotton, which have been pushed in
recent years to levels twice those in the decade prior to World War II.
There is as yet no sign of a halt in the uptrend in yields per acre.
Although the increase in productivity has been less for livestock than for
crops, livestock output per man-hour, per animal, and per dollar of total
capital has shown sizable gains, especially since the 1940's.
Because, as described below, increasing quantities of resources other than
labor and land have been employed in agriculture, productivity has risen
less rapidly in terms of total input than in terms of labor and land. The
ratio of output to total input is estimated to have increased at an annual
rate of about 2 percent during the last ten years, and to have been more
than 50 percent higher in 1959 than in the 1930's. This increase in
efficiency is the composite result of greater precision in apportioning and
coordinating factors of production, the use of improved crop varieties and
hybrid animals, a reduction of losses by plant and animal protection, andâ€”
most important of allâ€”the increased managerial skill of farm operators.
CHANGES IN TYPES AND RATES OF INPUT
The changes in technology and management in agriculture leading to
the remarkable growth in output per man-hour and in output per acre of
land have involved extensive shifts in the mix of factors of production. By
19585 labor input had been reduced to scarcely half that used in 1930-39
(Table B-19). Much labor has been replaced by capital. Investment in
labor-saving machinery has increased greatly, and purchases of petroleum
fuels have multiplied several times. The 1958 inputs of mechanical power
and machinery, including fuels, were more than 2.5 times the inputs in the
decade prior to World War II, owing in part to the substantially faster
increase in farm wage rates than in prices of farm machinery and motor
fuels.
A second important factor has been the increase in the application of
purchased plant nutrients to crops and pastures. Commercial fertilizer
applied in 1958 was 5 times the 1930-39 average. In addition to intensive
application to cotton, truck crops, root crops, soybeans, and irrigated pasture,
the use of fertilizer in the production of feed crops has increased rapidly in
recent years. According to the latest Census of Agriculture data, the
amount of nitrogen used on corn, oats, and barley in 1954 was 3 times
that in 1947. A comparatively stable cost has encouraged this larger use of

fertilizer. For instance, the 1959 price of $1.06 per unit of 20 pounds of
pure nitrogen, in the form of anhydrous ammonia, differed little from the
average for the last 25 years. The marginal return for expenditures on
fertilizer appears to have continued high. For 1954 it is estimated to have
been $3.00 per dollar spent on fertilizer for corn, $2.27 for soybeans, $1.55
for grain sorghum, $1.62 for barley, $1.44 for oats, and $2.26 for wheat.
Since then, it appears to have been reduced somewhat, as prices of those
commodities have declined.
Another input factor that has contributed to the expansion of output is
the application of supplementary sprinkler irrigation in subhumid and
humid climates, which is being used increasingly in connection with nitrogen fertilizer. Also, such inputs as commercial mixing of feed, pesticides
and other materials, the services used in livestock production, selective
weed-killing chemicals, and related items used in crop production have been
rising rapidly.
When all inputs are combined, their total traces a slowly rising long-term
trend. During the last few years, however, withdrawal of land from use
by the Soil Bank and continued reductions in labor inputs have brought
some declines in total inputs.
Indicative of the changing mix of inputs is the shifting proportion
between those which are "paid" and "unpaid." The former refer to cur-




104

rent cash costs, the latter to farm family labor and owned capital including
land. Paid inputs increased by two-thirds from 1930-39 to 1958; unpaid
declined by one-third. The increase in paid inputs, reflecting greater
commercialization in farming, makes agriculture increasingly sensitive to
the prices of goods and services that farmers buyâ€”prices that recently have
been rising.
CHANGING ORGANIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES
The rapid increase in productivity in agriculture has been a major factor
in releasing resources for use in the industrial economy. Only 8l/2 percent
of the civilian labor force is now engaged in agricultural production on the
farm; the remainder is available to the nonfarm economy.
High productivity in agriculture, reducing labor needed for farm production, was achieved as profound structural changes in agricultural
resources took place. The number of farms declined from 6.7 million
in the 1930's to 4.6 million in 1959 (Table B-20). The average size
increased by approximately 100 acres. Yet the total acreage of cropland

declined slightly. Moreover, in 1959 only 69 percent of cropland was
actually used for harvested crops; of the other 31 percent, much is reserve
capacity. Even so, at present yields per acre, the number of acres used
for harvested crops is too great relative to the effective demand.
The number of tractors, trucks, and automobiles on farms increased from
5.8 million in the 1930Js to 12.2 million in 1959, or from less than 1 per
farm to nearly 3 per farm. The value of the inventory of machinery and
motor vehicles increased from $3.1 billion in 1940 to $18.4 billion in
1959.
INCREASING PREDOMINANCE OF LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION
Among agriculture's major structural changes is the shift in land utilization toward more animal husbandry. Some 960 million acres of land are
used for grazing animals. In 1959, 154 million acres were planted to the 4
feed grains and 23 million acres to soybeansâ€”all sources of concentrate
feed. The milling and other processing by-products of oilseeds, sugar
beets, other bread grains, and other food cereals, as well as the by-products
of the dairy and meat-packing industries, are converted to food by animals.
As the farmers' managerial skill in primary production of vegetable matter increased, the secondary livestock industry expanded, converting more
and more feed into animal products in response to increasing consumer
demand. Livestock and products contributed roughly 57 percent to the
cash receipts from marketing in 1959.
The number of grain-consuming animal units (each equivalent to 1
milk cow) increased from 147 million in the 1930's to 171 million in 1959
(Table Bâ€”20). With an increase in output per animal, livestock production rose even moreâ€”from 136 million units (each equivalent to the milk
produced from 1 milk cow) to 191 million units. The value of all livestock
on farms in 1959 was $18.1 billion, considerably above the value of $5.1
billion in 1940.
FARMERS' INCOME AND FINANCIAL POSITION
Realized gross income from farming (including cash receipts from farm
marketings, Government payments to farmers, home consumption of farm
products, and the rental value of farm dwellings) declined from $38.3 billion
in 1958 to $36.9 billion in 1959. With a slightly increased volume of
farm marketings, prices averaged about 4 percent less in 1959 than in
1958. Because of increased prices of production cost items, farm operators' realized net income from farming (Table B-21) was probably $11.0
billion in 1959, compared with $13.1 billion in 1958, $11.0 billion in 1957,
and $12.0 billion in 1956. Since the number of farms has been declining,
the average of $2,363 per farm operator, while $404 less than in 1958, was
about equal to the average for 1954-57.
Despite rapid adjustments in the structure of resources and the number
and size of operational units, average income of farm operators has not




106

shown the same advance that has generally characterized the nonfarm
economy. On the other hand, many farm people, particularly those living
on units with a small income-earning capacity, have availed themselves of
the opportunities afforded by general economic expansion and are earning
income outside the farm. In 1959, farmers' income from nonfarm sources
amounted to $6.7 billion, compared with $6.3 billion in 1958 and $6.6
billion in 1957. The average total net income per capita of the farm
population from all sources was $960 in 1959, compared with $1,043 in
1958 and $933 in 1957.

Agriculture as an industry continues to be in a financially strong position.
Total agricultural assets have risen steadily for many years; the increase
in 1959 was 2.5 percent, to $208 billion at the end of the year. This value
was 68 percent above the 1947-49 average and 293 percent above that
for 1940. Farm real-estate debt at the end of 1959 was about 6 percent
higher than at the end of 1958, or more than twice the 1947-49 average.
Yet total liabilities, including non-real-estate debt, amounted to only 11.5
percent of total assets; thus proprietors' equities of $184 billion were 56
percent higher than in 1950 and 328 percent higher than in 1940. The
foreclosure rate of 1.6 per 1,000 farms for the year ended March 15, 1959
was near the very favorable low average of the last decade; since March,
the rate probably has changed very little.

CHANGES IN DEMAND FOR FOOD
The structural change in the resources used in agriculture, as well as the
shift to more animal production, has been induced by the general expansion
of the United States economy, rising consumer incomes, and the resulting
trend in demand toward preferred food commodities within a better balanced diet.

According to the data in Table B-22, the civilian per capita consumption
of red and poultry meat increased by 24 pounds between 1947-49 and
1959. By contrast, consumption of wheat products declined by 18 pounds
in the same period, and of all cereal foods by 25 pounds.
Of the total caloric content of the American diet in 1959, 31 percent
was derived from foodstuffs of livestock origin; in 1935-39, those foods
contributed 24 percent of the total (Table B~23). The share of the total
caloric intake in 1959 obtained from the starchy items, such as bread,
cereals, potatoes, and sweet potatoes, was only 24 percent, appreciably less
than in 1935-39. Animal protein made up 65 percent of all protein consumed in 1959, compared with 54 percent in 1935-39. Nevertheless, there
is no indication that per capita consumption of animal products has reached
saturation.
SCOPE AND DEGREE OF MALADJUSTMENT
The problems of commercial agriculture are chiefly the result of oversupplyâ€”a supply which exceeds even the very strong domestic, and fairly
strong foreign, demandâ€”and rising costs of production. Changes in the
output of major commodity groups measured in pounds per capita of
the total population of the United States are given in Table B-24. The
most impressive change shown is for the output of all grains, root crops,
and oil-bearing crops; on a per capita basis, the output of these crops in
1959 was about 260 pounds, or 10 percent, above the high average for
1940-49.

Correction of the existing maladjustment would require persistent efforts
to lower output toward market equilibrium and to dispose of the accumulated excess carryover of commodities with the least possible market impact.
The magnitude of the problem is demonstrated by the size of the surplus:
the excess carryover of grain would feed all the Nation's livestock for almost
six months; if converted over a period of six years into meat, it would yield
more than 1 million short tons (carcass weight) per year, or more than
500,000 short tons of canned meat. The excess stocks of cotton would run
the cotton mills for six months. Obviously, correction requires an adjustment of production to effective demand. Until this adjustment is accomplished, the problem of surpluses willâ€”even when seemingly dormantâ€”
remain a cause of public concern.

IV. United States Foreign Trade and Payments
The United States has had a large deficit in its balance of payments for
the greater part of two years; over most of this period, it has ranged around
$4 billion, on an annual rate basis, as measured by net transfers of gold
and recorded liquid dollar assets to foreign ownership. The main constituents of the deficit have varied much more widely, however, with
partially offsetting changes in goods and services and in capital movements.
There were indications in the second half of 1959 that the deficit was
diminishing. The third quarter brought a substantial rise in exports,
seasonally adjusted, for the first time in two years (Table B-25). Imports,
which had been increasing rapidly, held steady, on a seasonally adjusted
basis, and the net outflow of United States capital on private and public

account combined showed no change from the second to the third quarter,
at a level lower than in 1958. Total recorded receipts thus increased in
the third quarter, while total recorded payments leveled out, but the
improvement was only partially reflected in a decrease in net transfers of
gold and liquid dollar assets to other countries. This discrepancy (which
is reflected in the wide shifts in the errors and omissions item of the balance
of payments) is believed to be attributable to lags in crediting payments to
foreign accounts, with the result of understating gold and dollar transfers
in the second quarter and of overstating them in the third. Incomplete
data for the fourth quarter show a much lower rate of transfer of such
assets, partly because of a $250 million repayment by the United Kingdom
to the Export-Import Bank.
Development of the Deficit
With respect to the evolution of the deficit, it is relevant to note that in
the last several years the United States would have had to achieve an
extraordinarily rapid growth in its earnings from exports and other receipts
to match, within the same period, the swift rise which occurred in its
payments.
As a starting point for this comparison, the years 1953-55 may be taken.
This was a relatively quiet period between the disturbances associated with
the Korean conflict and those produced by the Suez crisis. It may be
noted, however, that the United States was in deficit in its balance of payments at that time, in the sense of transferring gold and liquid dollar assets
to other countries at a rate averaging some $1.6 billion annually. These
transfers were related, on the one hand, to the position of the United States
as an international reserve center and, on the other hand, to the needs of
other countries to reconstitute, and to add to, their exchange reserves as
international trade expanded.
Measured from the 1953-55 average, United States payments to other
countries rose, with some irregularity, by almost $9 billion, or 43 percent, to
the second and third quarters of 1959. All of the main categories of payments contributed to this increase, as may be seen in Table B-25 (also
Chart 11 in Chapter 2 ) . The magnitude of this expansion, as well as the
adjustment problem which it presented for exports, is brought out by the
fact that the total value of world trade rose by only about 30 percent over
the same period.
A striking feature of the evolution of the United States balance of payments is that until mid-1957 the rise, relative to 1953-55, in export earnings
and other receipts was even faster than the rise in payments. The underlying circumstances proved, however, to be short-lived. Starting in the
latter part of 1957, total receipts fell back sharply and then fluctuated for
a time before recovering in the third quarter of 1959 to the level reached
three years before, that is, some 36 percent higher than in 1953-55.




112

INCREASE IN PAYMENTS SINCE 1953-55
The outflow of United States capital and grants at the rates prevailing
in the second and third quarters of 1959 was more than one and one-half
times the rate in 1953-55 (when, however, the movement averaged less
than in earlier years), after having risen to even higher rates in the intervening period. United States private direct investment abroad moved up
rapidly in 1956 and 1957 in connection with major petroleum and other
resource development projects, especially in Latin America and Canada.
This movement subsided during the 1957-58 recession, but in the first half
of 1958 the outflow of United States capital through new issues of foreign
securities and other portfolio investments rose in response to the markedly
higher level of yields prevailing in other financial centers. But these
capital flows also declined subsequently as monetary policies in the United
States became more restrictive. Net credits by the United States Government increased in 1956 and 1957 and have since varied only moderately,
except as they were reduced by large repayments by the Federal Republic
of Germany in the first quarter of 1959 and by the United Kingdom in the
fourth quarter.
Among services, the chief increases have been in payments for transportation and foreign travel, both of which were some $500 million higher
in 1959 than in 1953-55. These outlays have been stimulated by the rise
in the volume of foreign commerce and in personal incomes in this country.
United States military expenditures abroad rose by some $750 million from
1953-55 to 1958, but they have now moved part way back to the earlier
level, as payments on procurement contracts and construction projects
abroad have declined.
Expansion of Merchandise Imports
The rise in the value of merchandise imports by the United States was
interrupted briefly by a dip, chiefly affecting industrial materials, during
the 1957-58 recession. After that, the increase became extraordinarily
rapid for a time, the total value of imports expanding by almost onequarter from April-June 1958 to the same period in 1959.
Finished manufactures have been among the most important elements
of growth since 1953-55 (Table B-26). Passenger cars led the rise until
mid-1959 but were imported at lower rates during the rest of the year. The
growth of imports of other consumer goods was resumed, after a pause during the recession; these goods have included both wearing apparel and a
wide variety of sundry consumer items (Appendix Table D-74). Imports
of capital goods, though small compared with the amounts exported, have
also moved up rapidly. Petroleum figured prominently in the import
increase until 1958 but has since been limited by import controls.
In addition, imports of certain other products rose substantially in 1959,
owing in part to temporary circumstances: steel because of the anticipated

and actual effects of the strike on deliveries from domestic producers; building materials because of the high level of housing construction during recovery from the recession; and feeder cattle and beef for processing because of
relatively short domestic supplies of beef and veal while cattle herds were
being built up. Normal demands for imported industrial materials were
also intensified as expansion spread throughout the economy.
The unusual speed of the increase in United States imports from the
second quarter of 1958 to the second quarter of 1959 may thus be attributed
to a combination of forces. Some of these began to exercise a less buoyant
effect in the second half of 1959, and total imports, seasonally adjusted,
remained at about the level set in the second quarter.




114

The products leading the import expansion since 1953-55 have come
mainly from the industrially developed countries. Until 1958, imports
from the petroleum-producing countries also grew rapidly. Imports from
other nonindustrial countries, on the other hand, showed little tendency
to rise until stimulated by the quickening of United States demand for
industrial materials in 1959. Even with this pick-up, the value of imports
from Latin America (exclusive of Venezuela) remained lower than in
1953-55; the fall in coffee prices from the extraordinary 1954 peak had
a particularly depressing influence on the value of imports from this area.
VARIATIONS IN RECEIPTS
Merchandise exports have accounted for the greater part of the swings
noted in United States receipts from abroad since 1953-55; these changes
will be examined more closely below. It is also relevant to observe that
receipts from services, including earnings on foreign investments, rose
swiftly up to 1957 but then fell the next year by more than $300 million
(Table B-25; also Appendix Table D-72). This decline (largely in
transportation earnings as a result of the reduction in export cargoes and
in freight rates) contrasted with a further increase of about the same
amount in 1958 in United States payments abroad on services and military
expenditures. The two sides of the services account together thus contributed some $700 million to the deficit in that year.
The 1957-58 Decline in Exports
The fall in United States exports after mid-1957 was not unrelated to
the forces behind the preceding upsurge. Some of these forces were of a
quite specific character, including the effort to ensure Europe's petroleum
supplies during the closure of the Suez Canal in 1956-57 and the special
supply and demand situations affecting cotton and wheat (Table B-27).
These developments for particular commodities were superimposed on
a much more general shift in the world economic climate. For some years,
foreign countries, especially the more developed ones, had been experiencing a rapid growth in capacity and in output. Inflationary tendencies were
fairly common, and there was a general pressure on supplies of fuels, industrial materials, and capital equipment. The Suez crisis accentuated these
demands. Whether or not the expansion had run its course, policies of restraint became imperative in a number of countries whose imports of
capital goods and industrial materials had grown faster than their export
earnings or other means of financing. As a result, the pace of production
abroad slowed down and capacity was less fully utilized; investment activity
became more hesitant in many countries; inventory policies shifted toward
liquidation; and prices and earnings of countries supplying primary products
weakened.

This shift in the foreign economic situation, together with the changes
that affected particular commodities, brought a severe setback to United
States exports. About two-thirds of the decline from 1957 to 1958 was
in fuels and industrial materials. For petroleum and coal, the decline,
though immediately attributable to the short-term factors mentioned,
seemed to mark a shift in the world energy situation. The weakness in the
steel market abroad, largely attributable to a reduction in inventories by the
steel-consuming industries, was more temporary, but enough to cause a
fall in aggregate steel output in Western Europe and Japan.
Finished manufactures accounted for only about one-third of the decline
in total exports from 1957 to 1958. Within this group, a few major types
of capital equipment (Table B-27) were affected most sharply because of
their apparent sensitivity to the investment cycle. These items are construction, excavating, and mining equipment, and tractors and trucks.
Among other finished manufactures, the declines from 1957 appear relatively modest when the change in the business situation in some of our
leading markets is taken into consideration.




116

Divergent Tendencies in Exports During 1959
Unfavorable conditions continued to affect certain of our main export
commodities and markets through part, and in some cases all, of 1959.
Among our leading exports, cotton shipments to all destinations were extremely low through the third quarter (Table B-27). Market conditions
abroad improved as consumption rose and stocks fell, but United States
exports lagged pending an announced change in export price policy with the
start of the new crop year. In the fourth quarter, this change was Deflected
in a steep rise in cotton shipments, and heavy export bookings extended well
into 1960.
Exports of coal, petroleum products, and steel remained very weak
throughout the year. For the first two, this weakness reflected the shift
in the world fuel balance and the growth of foreign refining capacity. The
further decrease in steel exports, like the rise in steel imports, may have
been influenced by diverging trends of United States and foreign prices,
but the more immediate factor in both cases was the prolonged steel strike
in the United States. Late in the year, the steel shortage began to affect
also the availability of products made of steel.
Exports of railway equipment fell in 1959, following large deliveries in
the two preceding years financed by export credits. Exports of civilian
aircraft in each of the first three quarters of 1959 also were consistently
lower than a year earlier but rose from the second to the third quarter of
1959, as deliveries started against large orders for the new plane models.
Among our major markets, United States exports during 1959 were
particularly affected by weaknesses in the trade and payments position of
the Latin American countries, which normally take about one-quarter of
our total exports. The reductions were in a broad range of export products, especially in the capital equipment field.
The weaknesses noted in certain key products and in some of our main
markets tended, during much of the year, to offset the increases in exports
of foodstuffs, oils and oilseeds, machinery, tractors, automotive parts, chemicals, and other manufactures to Canada, Western Europe, and Japan,
where economic activity was expanding. But as the year advanced, and
the tempo of economic activity increased further in the leading industrial
countries, the gains outweighed the losses and total exports in the third
quarter were above those a year earlier. Subsequently, however, exports
were restrained by the relatively brief dock strike in October and possibly
also by the spreading effects of the steel shortage.
RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF UNITED STATES EXPORTS
As the preceding analysis points out, changes in foreign demand associated with changes in general economic conditions abroad and shifts in the
market situation with respect to particular products have had an important
effect on United States exports. It is also relevant to consider whether the
behavior of our exports reflects any general deterioration in the ability of




117

United States producers to compete in foreign markets. This question is
chiefly of interest with respect to finished manufactures. These constitute
about 60 percent of total United States exports, though, as noted above,
they accounted for a much smaller part of the setback in exports after 1957.
United States Share in Export Markets for Manufactures
Measured on a global basis, the share of the United States in total
exports of manufactures by all industrial countries to all destinations has
declined appreciably in the last ten years. Its share, so computed, was
around 26 or 27 percent in the early 1950's, remained slightly over 25
percent through 1957, and has since declined to 22 or 23 percent. There
are, however, several reasons why this type of global calculation is unsatisfactory as a criterion of the performance of United States exports. For
one thing, the shift was in part a necessary consequence of the belated,
but then swift, recovery in the exports of Germany and Japan, which caused
a decline not only in the United States share of the export market but
still more, up to 1957, in the shares of other industrial countries. Second, the over-all shares are appreciably affected by the rapid increase in
recent years in other countries' exports of manufactures to the United States
itself. Similarly, the global percentages are affected by the rapid expansion
of Western European exports of machinery and steel to the Sino-Soviet
bloc. A further distorting influence arises from the fact that two markets
which are of much greater importance to the United States than to Europe
or Japan have recently been rather depressedâ€”Canada in 1958 and Latin
America in 1959â€”thus reducing the United States share in any simple
global calculation.
An analysis by the Department of Commerce examines recent changes
in the United States share for each of 45 items or groups of manufactures
in each of six regional markets (that is, 270 product-market subdivisions)
comprising together by far the greater part of free world trade in manufactured goods. The analysis compares the shares in 1958 with the averages for 1954-56 on the basis of uniformly classified trade statistics compiled by the United Nations. Had the earlier United States shares prevailed in all the cases considered, United States exports of manufactures
would have been some $500 million greater in 1958 than they actually were
(Table B-28).
It is noteworthy, moreover, that the declines in the United States share
were heavily concentrated in automobiles, iron and steel, and aircraft.
Shortfalls in these three categories totaled $483 million. It may be significant that the first two of these groups, especially iron and steel, were
marked by greater-than-average price increases in the United States over
the last ten years. United States losses in the automobile market abroad
were universal and were the continuation of a trend of some years' duration. The decrease in our share of steel exports, on the other hand, was
predominantly in Europe and was attributable, at least in part, to tempo-

rary market conditions in that area in 1958, though in 1959 the steel strike
here continued to depress our share in export markets for this product.
In aircraft, the decline was attributable to the switchover in production to the new jet and turbo-jet models; large export deliveries of the new
planes are scheduled for 1960, after which, however, they are expected to
fall again as the reequipment of the major airlines is completed.
Exclusive of these three groups and also of ships (exports of which from
the United States include mere transfers of registry), the weighted index
of United States shares in the six regional markets for manufactures showed
virtually no change in 1958 compared with 1954-56. In none of the 41
manufactured items other than those specified were the decreases in market shares particularly great insofar as the dollar magnitudes are concerned. The decreases as well as the increases in the United States share

clear sign of significant shifts. This reserved judgment seems all the more
warranted when account i&taken of the effects of cyclical movements during
the period on United States exports of machinery.
Machinery Exports and Investment Activity Abroad
The competitive position of the United States as a supplier of machinery
is of particular importance to its trade and payments position. Machinery
alone accounts for almost one-quarter of United States exports and has
a strong growth potential in view of the stress placed on construction
projects and industrial expansion in both underdeveloped and developed
economies.
In 1958, the United States supplied one-third of all machinery exports
of the industrial countries to markets outside the United States. Its share
in the total and in most machinery categories was, however, slightly less
than in 1954-56 (Table B-28) and still less than in the early postwar
years when the United States was drawn upon even for items of which it
had not been traditionally a major exporter. The supply capacity of
other countries has greatly strengthened since that time. There are also
some indications, though this is a difficult area of measurement, that machinery prices may have increased rather more in the United States than
in most other countries, especially during the investment upsurge in 1955-57.
Foreign demand for United States machinery is also closely related to
the state of business abroad and especially to changes in investment activity.
This relationship may be further examined in the light of Table Bâ€”29,
which shows, for a number of countries, investment in machinery and
equipment (exclusive of transportation equipment wherever possible) and
machinery imports, both total and from the United States, over the period
1954-59. The availability of information limits these comparisons to
Canada, Japan, and a number of Western European countries, and the
data for 1959 are necessarily based on partial information or forecasts
for the year. Most of the countries considered went through fairly pronounced cyclical phases in machinery and equipment investment over the
last several years; in the United Kingdom, however, the fluctuations were
small after 1957, and in Germany, Sweden, and Denmark the expansion
proceeded without interruption. The data in the table permit the following generalizations with respect to the behavior of the machinery imports
of the various countries:
(1) When investment rose strongly, total imports of machinery
tended to rise proportionately more strongly. It is also true that
machinery imports from the United States tended to rise more than
proportionately when investment activity in these countries was expanding rapidly. At such times, the rise in machinery imports from the
United States tended to equal, or frequently to exceed, the rise in total
machinery imports of the countries consideredâ€”at least up to 1956 or
1957.

(2) In most countries where investment activity ceased to rise after
1956-57, or where it fell, there was a weakening tendency in total machinery imports and, still more, in machinery imports from the United
States. In countries, which were still fairly numerous, where investment remained below earlier peaks, the relative weakness in imports
of machinery from the United States usually continued into 1959.
(3) Where, however, the expansion of machinery investment continued or was resumed in strength in 1959, machinery imports from the
United States usually responded vigorously. The increase in such
imports by Germany, one of the strongest competitors in this field, is
especially noteworthy, though Germany's total machinery imports rose
even more strongly. The increase in imports of United States
machinery by the Scandinavian countries in 1959 was also substantial
and greatly exceeded the increase in their total machinery imports.
Machinery exports from the United States in 1959 thus appeared to reflect,
in accentuated measure, the differing degrees of intensity in the investment
activity of foreign countries. A firmer view of these relationships and trends
as currently experienced can scarcely be formed until investment has risen
further in countries where it is still sluggish in relation to earlier peaks.
As far as the past is concerned, however, the observations made with respect
to Table B-29 suggest that machinery exports from the United States do
well under conditions of sustained investment expansion in other countries
or in periods of strong cyclical upswing, but may fare relatively badly when
investment abroad slows down and the machinery production capacity in
other countries is underutilized. Price disparities could contribute to this
result. Another influence could be the greater cyclical sensitivity of some
types of machinery than of others (as suggested above with regard to the
1958 fall in United States exports of construction, excavating, and mining
equipment). Moreover, even in the absence of price or other differences,
any foreign discrimination against imports from the United States would
have a greater adverse impact in slack periods when foreign producers have
spare capacity available than in periods when they have long delivery dates.
THE CONTINUING ADJUSTMENT PROBLEM
The preceding analysis has described the present balance of payments
position of the United States largely in terms of the changes that have taken
place since 1953-55. At that time, payments already exceeded receipts
by some $1.6 billion annually, and since then have risen faster, the increase
being about 43 percent in payments against some 36 percent in receipts,
measured to the third quarter of 1959.
Neither of these percentage increases is in any sense a stable figure. On
the payments side, imports contain certain strong growth elements, even
though there were some exceptional ones in the recent past which are not
expected to continue. And the outflow of private capital from the United
States for investment abroad, which was lower in 1959 than in the three




122

preceding years, has undoubtedly been restrained in some measure by conditions that may be subject to change. These include the relatively lower
demand for capital prevailing until recently in foreign financial centers
and the relatively large production facilities, built up in earlier years, for
certain raw materials, which, especially in a period of slack demand, have
been a deterrent to the further expansion of capacity.
Receipts have varied rather more widely than payments over the last
five years, first rising and then falling abruptly in response to a combination
of cyclical and special influences. More recently, despite unfavorable
conditions affecting some of our main export products and markets, export
earnings have strengthened in response to the renewed upswing in other
industrial countries. Other more temporary factors have also influenced the
current development of exports, some favorably, as in the case of aircraft
deliveries, and others unfavorably, as in the case of steel. These factors,
too, are subject to change.
By some standards, our recent export performance in relation to the
1953-55 level is not unfavorable. The increase in exports, for example,
was greater than the rise of about 30 percent in world trade as a whole over
the same period, though less than the rise of some 45 percent since 1953-55
in intra-European trade, which has set a remarkably fast pace.
The rise in export earnings and other receipts has not been sufficient so
far, however, to offset the extraordinary rise in payments, and the deficiency
appears to be greater than can be attributed to still depressed conditions in
some of our major markets or to temporary factors which have affected
trade in cotton and steel.
The problem has been complicated by obstacles that have developed to
our coal exports and by changes in the international automobile trade.
The latter alone has had an adverse effect of some $1 billion on the United
States trade position, including both the rise in our imports and our failure
to share in the growth in export markets abroad.
Such changes as these increase the burden of adjustment to be borne by
other United States exports, and especially by other manufactures. Some
of the latter have gained and others have lost in relative standing in different
markets but without a decisive impact either way on the dollar magnitudes
involved. Increases in United States shares of export markets sufficient to
meet the balance of payments problem would have been difficult to attain
under the relatively dull or depressed conditions prevailing in international
trade until the last few months. The current upturn in economic activity
abroad and in world trade, together with further steps taken recently by
other countries to eliminate or to reduce discrimination against dollar
goods and the anticipated increase in their financing extended to the less
developed countries, provides a more favorable setting for the attainment
of the desired expansion in our exports. As discussed in Chapter 4, the
realization of these potentials would be aided by efforts of United States
producers to strengthen their competitive position in foreign markets.

Statistical Tables Relating to the Diffusion of Well-Being,
1946-59
The following tables present certain indicators of the improvement of
well-being that has been attained in the United States since 1946. Necessarily, they are limited to those aspects and conditions of personal welfare
that can be expressed in quantitative terms. Although they fail to reveal,
except indirectly, the qualitative aspects of welfare, they may be useful
indicators of some of the material conditions on which improvements in the
quality of living are based. Tables are included on production and employment; personal income and its distribution; consumption; material
comforts and conveniences; conditions of work; education; leisure and
recreational activities; personal financial security; and health.

An approximate conversion of the 1947 and the 1955-57 income distributions of families and unattached
individuals into 1958 dollars has been made by applying the implicit price deflator of the personal consumption expenditure component of gross national product to the current dollar distribution for the earlier years.
Separate indexes applicable to the various income brackets are not available. It is therefore necessary to
use the same index throughout the income range even though all brackets may not have been actually
affected in the same way by the price rise.
2
Includes unattached individuals.

The Social Security Amendments of 1950 expanded by more than 10 million the number of jobs eligible
for coverage by old-age and survivors insurance in a given month. The Social Security Amendments of
1954 extended coverage to an additional 7^i million jobs eligible for coverage on an average monthly basis,
while the 1956 Amendments to the Social Security Act further extended coverage to nearly 1 million civilian
workers and 3 million members of the armed forces on a contributory basis in 1957. The Social Security
Amendment of 1958 had only a slight effect on coverage of the program. Members of the armed forces are
also included in the earlier years, although on a noncontributory basis, as provided under special provisions
of the Social Security Act. Thus, 90 percent of all gainfully employed persons are covered or eligible for
coverage.
The expansion in the number of jobs eligible for coverage did not result in an equal number of additional
covered persons, for three reasons. First, many persons holding these newly covered jobs had been working
at some time during the year in other jobs already covered; for these, the coverage was strengthened rather
than extended. Second, a substantial number of persons affected by the amendments were eligible for
coverage on a group elective basis, and not all of these groups had elected coverage by the end of 1959. Data
on covered workers in this table include only those workers hi the voluntary coverage group who had elected
to be covered. As of December 1959, there were about 7l/i million persons in jobs subject to coverage on a
group elective basis. Approximately three-fifths of the number of persons in this group, comprised primarily
of ministers (eligible on an individual elective basis) and employees of State and local governments and
nonprofit organizations, had elected coverage. Third, even in those jobs for which coverage was compulsory,
some persons had not reported their earnings for social security tax purposes.

1 These estimates represent an approximate conversion of the Department of Commerce series in 1954
prices. (See Tables D-4 and D-5.) This was done by major components, using the implicit price indexes
converted to a 1959 base. Although it would have been preferable to redeflate the series by minor components, this would not substantially change the results except possibly for the period of World War II, and
for the series on change in business inventories.
For explanation of conversion of estimates in current prices to those in 1954 prices, see U, S. Income and
Output, A Supplement to the Survey of Current Business, 1958.
2 For 1929-45, net exports of goods and services and net foreign investment have been equated, since foreign
net transfers by Government were negligible during that period.
3
Net of Government sales, which are not shown separately in this table. See Table D-l for Government
sales in current prices.

Gross national product less compensation of general government employees, i. e., gross product accruing
from domestic business, households, and institutions, and from the rest of the world.
2
See Survey of Current Business, October 1958, for description of series and estimates in current and constant prices and implicit deflators for 1910-57.
s Includes compensation of general government employees and excludes compensation oi employees in
government enterprises. Government enterprises are those agencies of government whose operating costs
are at least to a substantial extent covered by the' sale of goods and services, in contrast to the general activities of government which are financed mainly by tax revenues and debt creation. Government enterprises, in other words, conduct operations essentially commercial in character, even though they perform
them under governmental auspices. The Post Office and public power systems are typical examples of
government enterprises. On the other hand, State universities and public parks, where the fees and admissions cover only a nominal part of operating costs, are part of general government activities.

Undistributed corporate profits, corporate inventory valuation adjustment, capital consumption
allowances, and excess of wage accruals over disbursements.
a
For 1929-45, foreign net transfers by Government were negligible; therefore, for that period, net exports
of 3goods and services and net foreign investment have been equated.
Government transfer payments to persons, foreign net transfers by Government, net interest paid by
government, and subsidies less current surplus of government enterprises.
* Preliminary estimates by Council of Economic Advisers.
8
Data for corporate profits and inventory valuation adjustment are approximations for the year as a whole;
they do not derive from, nor imply, specific estimates for the quarters. All other data incorporating or
derived from these figures are correspondingly approximate.

National income is the total net income earned in production. It differs from gross national product
mainly in that it excludes depreciation charges and other allowances for business and institutional consumption of durable capital goods, and indirect business taxes. See Table D-10.
2
Wages and salaries and supplements to wages and salaries (employer contributions for social insurance;
employer contributions to private pension, health, and welfare funds; compensation for injuries; directors'
fees; pay of the military reserve; and a few other minor items).
3
Excludes income resulting from net reductions of farm inventories and gives credit in computing
income to net additions to farm inventories during the period. Data for 1929-45 differ from those shown in
Table D-65 because of revisions by the Department of Agriculture not yet incorporated into the national
income accounts.
4
See Table D-57 for corporate tax liability (Federal and State income and excess profits taxes) and
corporate profits after taxes.
8 Less than $50 million.
6
Preliminary estimates by Council of Economic Advisers.
7 Data for corporate profits and inventory valuation adjustment are approximations for the year as a whole;
they do not derive from, nor imply, specific estimates for the quarters. All other data incorporating or
derived from these figures are correspondingly approximate.

The total of wage and salary disbursements and other labor income differs from compensation of employees in Table D-9 in that it excludes employer contributions for social insurance and excludes the excess
of 2wage accruals over wage disbursements.
Excludes income resulting from net reductions of inventories and gives credit in computing income
to 8net additions to inventories during the period.
Data for 1929-45 differ from those in Table D-65 because of revisions by the Department of Agriculture
not yet incorporated into the national income accounts.
4
Nonagricultural income is personal income exclusive of net income of unincorporated farm enterprises,
farm wages, agricultural net interest, and net dividends paid by agricultural corporations.

1
Individuals' saving, in addition to personal holdings, covers saving of unincorporated business, trust
funds, and nonprofit institutions in the forms specified.
2
Includes shares in savings and loan associations and shares and deposits in credit unions.
3
Includes U.S. Government issues (except savings bonds), nonguaranteed Federal agency securities, and
securities of State and local governments.
4
Includes insured pension reserves.
5
Includes Social Security funds, State and local retirement systems, etc.
6
Mortgage debt to institutions on one- to four-family nonfarm dwellings.
7
Consumer debt owed to corporations, largely attributable to purchases of automobiles and other durable consumer goods, although including some debt arising from purchases of consumption goods. Policy
loans on Government and private life insurance have been deducted from those items of saving.
8
Change in bank loans made for the purpose of purchasing or carrying securities.
9
Less than $5 million.
10
Preliminary.

NOTE.â€”In addition to the concept of saving shown above, there are other concepts of individuals'
saving, with varying degrees of coverage, currently in use. The personal saving estimates of the Department of Commerce are derived as the difference between personal income and expenditures. Conceptually,
Commerce saving includes the following items not included in Securities and Exchange Commission saving: Housing, farm and unincorporated business investment in inventories and plant and equipment, net
of depreciation, and increase in debt. Government insurance is excluded from the Commerce saving series. For a reconciliation of the two series, see Securities and Exchange Commission Statistical Bulletin,
July 1959, and Survey of Current Business, July 1959.
The Federal Reserve Board's flow-of-funds system of accounts includes capital investments as well as
financial components of saving and covers saving of Federal, State and local governments, businesses, financial institutions and consumers. While the Federal Reserve Board's estimates of consumer saving in financial form are similar to the Securities and Exchange Commission estimates of individuals' saving, there
are some statistical and conceptual differences in the two sets of data.
Revisions for 1947-59 in the consumer credit statistics of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System have riot yet been incorporated into these estimates.
Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding.

Net exports of goods and services less foreign net transfers by Government. For 1929-45, net foreign
investment and net exports of goods and services have been equated, since foreign net transfers by Government were negligible during that period.
2 Less than $50 million.
3 Preliminary estimates by Council of Economic Advisers.
4 Data for corporate profits and inventory valuation adjustment are approximations for the year as a
whole; they do not derive from, nor imply, specific estimates for the quarters. All other data incorporating or derived from these figures are correspondingly approximate.

Data for 1940-52 revised to include about 150,000 members of the armed forces who were outside the
United States in 1940 and who were, therefore, not enumerated in the 1940 Census and were excluded from
the 1940-52 estimates.
2 See Note.
' Not available.
NOTE.â€”Civilian labor force data beginning with May 1956 are based on a 330-area sample. For January
1954-April 1956 they are based on a 230-area sample; for 1946-53 on a 68-area sample; for 1940-45 on a smaller
sample; and for 1929-39 on sources other than direct enumeration.
Effective January 19.57, persons on layoff with definite instructions to return to work within 30 days
of layoff and persons waiting to start new wage and salary jobs within the following 30 days are classified
as unemployed. Such persons had previously been classified as employed (with a job but not at work).
The combined total of the groups changing classification has averaged about 200,000 to 300,000 a month in
recent years. The small number of persons in school during the survey week and waiting to start new
jobs are classified as not in the labor force instead of employed, as formerly. Persons waiting to open new
businesses or start new farms within 30 days continue to be classified as employed.
Beginning July 1955, monthly data are for the calendar week ending nearest the 15th of the month; previously, for week containing the 8th. Annual data are averages of monthly figures.
For the years 1940-52, estimating procedures made "se of 1940 Census data; for subsequent years, 1950
Census data were used. For the effects of this changv* on the historical comparability of the data, see
Annual Report m the Labor Force, 1954, Series P-50, No. 59, April 1955, p. 12.
Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rou iding.

Includes all full- and part-time wage and salary workers in nonagricultural establishments who worked
during, or received pay for, any part of the pay period ending nearest the 15th of the month. Excludes
proprietors, self-employed persons, domestic servants, and unpaid family workers. Not comparable with
estimates of nonagriculturaJ employment of the civilian labor force (Table D-17) which include proprietors,
self-employed persons, domestic servants, and unpaid family workers, which count persons as employed
when they are not at work because of industrial disputes; bad weather, etc.; and which are based on a
sample survey of households, whereas the estimates in this table are based on reports from employing
establishments.
2
Beginning with 1939, data are not strictly comparable with data shown for earlier years because of the
shift of the automotive repair service industry from the trade to the service division.

Averages are based upon monthly data (exclusive of switching and terminal companies) summarized
in the M-300 report by the ICC and relate to all employees who received pay during the month, except
executives, officials, and staff assistants (ICC Group I). Beginning September 1949, data reflect a reduction in the basic workweek from 48 to 40 hours.
2
Prior to April 1945, data relate to all employees except executives; from April 1945 to May 1949, mainly
to employees subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act; and beginning June 1949, to nonsupervisory employees only.
' Not available.
4
Data beginning with January of year noted are not comparable with those for earlier periods.
â€¢ Nine-month average, April through December, because of new series started in April 1945.
8
Preliminary.
NOTE.â€”Data are for production workers in manufacturing and mining, construction workers in building
construction, and for nonsupervisory employees in other industries (except as noted). Data are for pay
period ending nearest the 15th of the month.
The annual figures for 1959 are simple arithmetic averages of the monthly figures shown and are not
strictly comparable with the averages for earlier years, which have been weighted by data on employment.

the M-300 report by the ICC and relate to all employees who received pay during the month, except executives, officials, and staff assistants (ICC group I). Beginning September 1949, data reflect a wage rate
increase and reduction in the basic workweek from 48 to 40 hours.
2
Prior to April 1945, data relate to all employees except executives; from April 1945 to May 1949, mainly to
employees subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act; and beginning June 1949, to nonsupervisory employees
only.
3
Weighted average of all farm wage rates on a per hour basis.

Excludes agriculture.
2 Commercial and other includes trade, service, finance, communications, and construction.
3
Annual total is the sum of unadjusted quarterly expenditures; it does not necessarily coincide with the
average of seasonally adjusted figures. See footnote 4.
4
Estimates for fourth quarter 1959 and first quarter 1960 based on anticipated capital expenditures reported by business in late October and November 1959. The quarterly anticipations include adjustments,
when necessary, for systematic tendencies in anticipatory data.
NOTE.â€”These figures do not agree precisely with the plant and equipment expenditures included in the
gross national product estimates of the Department of Commerce. The main difference lies in the inclusion
in the gross national product of investment by farmers, professionals, and institutions, and of certain outlays charged to current account.
This series is not available for years prior to 1939 and for 1940 to 1944.
Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding.

1
The series beginning in 1948 are not comparable with the previous years because of changes in definition
for the wholesale series. Beginning in 1951, the estimates of retail sales and inventories are based on a
new method of estimation adopted by the Bureau of the Census.
2
Monthly average shown for year and total for month.
3
Seasonally adjusted, end of period.
4
Inventory/sales ratio. For annual periods, ratio of weighted average inventories to average monthly
sales; for monthly data, ratio of inventories at end of month to sales for month.
5
Where December data not available, data for year calculated on basis of no change from November.
'Preliminary.
NOTE.â€”For a description of the series and their comparability, see Survey of Current Business, September
and November 1952, January 1954, and June 1957 for retail, and August 1957 for manufacturing and
wholesale.
The inventory figures in this table do not agree with the estimates of change in business inventories
included in the gross national product since these figures cover only manufacturing and trade rather
than all business, and show inventories in terms of current book value without adjustment for revaluation.

beginning with 1938, includes U.S. Treasurer's time deposits, open account.
2 Includes holdings of State and local governments.
3

Preliminary; December estimates by Council of Economic Advisers.
NOTE.â€”Monthly data are for the last Wednesday of the month, except the unadjusted data for December
1958, which are for the call date. All end-of-year figures except 1959 are for call dates.
Between January and August 1959, this series was expanded to include data for all banks in Alaska and
Hawaii. In December 1959, demand deposits were reduced as a result of a change in the definition of
such deposits.
Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding.

1 End-of-year (except 1959) and June and December 1958 figures are for call dates. Other data (including those for June and December 1959) are for the last Wednesday of the month.
2
Data are shown net, i. e., after deduction of valuation reserves. Includes commercial and industrial,
agricultural, security, real estate, bank, consumer, and other loans.
3
Beginning with 1948, data are shown gross of valuation reserves, instead of net as for previous years.
Prior to June 1947 and for months other than June and December, data are estimated on the basis of reported
data for all insured commercial banks and for weekly reporting member banks.
* Figures in this table are based on book values and relate only to banks within the United States.
Therefore, they do not agree with figures in Table D-49, which are on the basis of par values and include
holdings of banks in United States Territories and possessions.
5
June data are used because complete end-of-year data are not available prior to 1935 for U. S. Government obligations and other securities.
6
Not available.
7
Preliminary; December estimates by Council of Economic Advisers.
NOTE.â€”Between January and August 1959, this series was expanded to include data for all banks in
Alaska and Hawaii.
Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding.

Series revised beginning June 1956. For details, see Federal Reserve Bulletin, November 1959.

Gross receipts less refunds of receipts and transfers of tax receipts to the old-age and survivors

trust fund.

i For derivation of Federal cash receipts and payments, see Budget of the United States Government for the
Fiscal Year ending June SO, 1961, and Table D-55.
i Estimated by Council of Economic Advisers from receipts and expenditures in the national income
accounts. Cash receipts consist of personal tax and nontax receipts, indirect business tax and nontax
accruals, and corporate tax accruals adjusted to a collection basis. Cash payments are total expenditures
less Federal grants-in-aid and less contributions for social insurance. (Federal grants-in-aid are therefore
excluded from State and local receipts and payments and included only in Federal payments.) See
Table D-54.
Â» Less than $50 million.
< Preliminary.
Â»Estimate.

Not available.
These accounts, like the cash budget, include the transactions of the trust accounts. Unlike both the
conventional budget and the eash statement, they exclude certain capital and lending transactions. In
general, they do not use the cash basis for transactions with business. Instead, corporate profits taxes are
included in receipts on an accrual instead of a cash basis; expenditures are timed with the delivery instead
of the payment for goods and services; and CCC guaranteed price-support crop loans financed by banks are
counted as expenditures when the loans are made, not when CCC redeems them.

NOTE.â€”Federal grants-in-aid to State and local governments are reflected in Federal expenditures and
State and local receipts and expenditures. Total government receipts and expenditures have been adjusted
to eliminate this duplication.

All United States corporations, excluding banks, savings and loan associations, and insurance companies.
Year-end data through 1956 are based on Statistics of Income (Treasury Department), covering virtually all
corporations in the United States. Statistics of Income data may not be strictly comparable from year to
year because of changes in the tax laws, basis for filing returns, and processing of data for compilation purposes. All other figures shown are estimates based on data compiled from many different sources, including
data on corporations registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As more complete information becomes available, estimates are revised.
2 Receivables from and payables to U.S. Government do not include amounts offset against each other
on the corporation's books or amounts arising from subcontracting which are not directly due from or to
the U.S. Government. Wherever possible, adjustments have been made to include U.S. Government
advances offset against inventories on the corporation's books.
3 Includes marketable securities other than U.S. Government.

1 Farm population as denned by Department of Agriculture and Department of Commerce, i.e., civilian
population living on farms, both urban and rural, regardless of occupation.
2 Total population of United States as of July 1, excluding Alaska and Hawaii; includes armed forces abroad.
3 Net change for year beginning in April, estimated by Department of Agriculture. For 1940 and subsequent years, includes inductions and enlistments into the armed forces, and persons returning from the
armed forces. For all years, includes persons who have not moved but who are in and out of the farm population because agricultural operations have begun or have ceased on the place where they are living.
* Includes persons doing farm work on all farms. These data, published by the Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Marketing Service, differ from those on agricultural employment by the Department
of Labor (see Table D-17) because of differences in the method of approach, in concepts of employment,
and in time of month for which the data are collected. For further explanation, see monthly report on
Farm Labor, September 10, 1958.
Â« Computed from variable weights for individual crops produced each year.
Â« Not available.
7 Preliminary.
NOTE.â€”Farm population figures have been revised for 1954-58. A similar revision of net migration
data for 1953-57 is in process, but not yet completed. Therefore, the two series are not strictly comparable
for the periods mentioned.
