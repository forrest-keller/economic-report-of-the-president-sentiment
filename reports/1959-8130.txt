LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL
THE WHITE HOUSE,
January 20, 1959.
To the Congress of the United States:
I present herewith my Economic Report, as required by Section 3(a)
of the Employment Act of 1946.
In preparing this Report, I have had the advice and assistance of the
Council of Economic Advisers. I have also had the advice of the heads of
executive departments and independent agencies of the Government. I set
forth below, largely in the language of the Report itself, what I consider to
be its salient conclusions and recommendations.
Economic Recovery in 1958
When the Economic Report was submitted to the Congress in January
1958, a contraction in production and employment that had started some
six months earlier was still under way. The decline proved to be sharper
than the 1953-54 recession, but it did not last as long. A recovery began
in May 1958, and by the end of the year most of the ground lost had been
regained. Gross national product, our broadest measure of the Nation's
output of goods and services, was at an annual rate of $453 billion in the
fourth quarter of the year. In dollars of constant purchasing power, this
was almost equal to the highest output attained in the pre-recession period.
Nearly a million more people were at work in December 1958 than in July,
after allowance for seasonal changes. Although the number of persons unemployed was above 4 million in December, it was 1 million below the highest
unemployment figure reached during the recession. Wage and salary income
and consumer spending were at an all-time high, and the index of consumer
prices had been virtually stable for six months, although about 2 percent
higher than a year earlier.
Economic Policies in 1957-58
The events of the last 18 months show again the considerable capacity
of our economy to resist contractive influences and to hold a downturn
within fairly narrow limits.
Many factors contribute to this capacity. Chief among them are the
industry and resourcefulness of our people, the strength and resiliency of our
free competitive institutions, and the continuing operation in the American
economy of powerful forces making for long-term growth.
Also of importance are features of our economic system that moderate
the impact of contractive influences on personal income, and thus help to




in

maintain demand. Increasingly, our people work in industries and occupations that are not readily affected by moderate economic declines. And
such reductions in income as do result from lower production and employment are offset, to a considerable extent, by supplementary payments, notably by those made under the Federal-State system of unemployment
insurance.
Governmental actions also played an important role in moderating the
recession and helping to bring about a prompt and sound recovery. Monetary and credit policies were employed vigorously to assure ample supplies
of credit. Legislation was enacted to lengthen temporarily the period of
entitlement to unemployment benefits. Numerous actions were taken to
spur building activity. Steps were taken to accelerate Federal construction
projects already under way and to speed up projects supported by Federal
financial assistance. Activities under a number of Federal credit programs,
in addition to those in the housing field, helped counter the recession. And
the acceleration of defense procurement, which was being undertaken in
line with national security policy, exerted an expansive effect.
The 1957-58 recession shows that the major emphasis of Federal policies
to counteract an economic downturn should be placed on measures that
will act promptly to help shift the balance of economic forces from contraction to recovery and growth. Though an effective contribution can be
made by the acceleration of public construction projects already under way,
little reliance can be placed on large undertakings which, however useful
they may be in the longer term, can be put into operation only after an
extended interval.
The 1957â€”58 experience is also a reminder that there is no simple prescription for corrective action which can be applied with only minor variations in every business downturn. It emphasizes the importance, in a
situation in which powerful corrective forces are at work, of avoiding hasty
and disproportionate actions, such as tax reductions that needlessly endanger
the prospects of future fiscal balance and prejudice the orderly revision of
the tax structure.
As production, employment, and income moved upward in 1958, the
economic policies of Government became increasingly concerned with keeping the recovery on a sound basis and promoting a sustainable long-term
expansion. Monetary and credit policy was shifted with a view to limiting
the expansion of bank credit to a sustainable pace. The large financing operations of the United States Treasury are being conducted with a view to
enhancing the basic stability of our financial system and promoting sound
economic growth. And the fiscal operations of Government are moving in
the direction of restoring a balance between outlays and incomes and thereby
countering potential inflationary tendencies.
The Economic Outlook
As 1959 opens, there is reason for confidence that the improvement
in business activity which began in the second quarter of last year will




rv

be extended into the months ahead. Factors that influence decisions
on business capital outlays have become more favorable, and an upturn
in these expenditures may already be under way. Residential construction
outlays should contribute further to economic expansion, especially if favorable action is taken by the Congress on recommendations made in the
Report to provide a steadier and more assured flow of private funds into
mortgages. Sales of United States products in foreign markets may increase
as the pace of business activity abroad quickens and the trade position of
primafy producing countries is improved. The combined outlays of Federal, State, and local government units will continue to rise. Under the
impact of these developments, the liquidation of inventories should soon
come to an end; indeed, the gap between current sales and stepped-up
production schedules may already have been closed. The effect of these
favorable factors on employment and income can be expected to enlarge
the markets for consumer goods and thereby to reinforce the conditions
making for over-all economic expansion.
A Program for Economic Growth with Stable Prices
Our objective must be to establish a firm foundation for extending economic growth with stable prices into the months and years ahead. This will
not come about automatically. To attain our goal, we must safeguard and
improve the institutions of our free competitive economy. These are basic
to America's unassailable economic strength. We must wage a relentless
battle against impediments to the fullest and most effective use of our
human and technological resources. We must provide incentives for the
enlargement and improvement of the facilities that supplement human
effort and make it increasingly productive. Finally, an indispensable condition for achieving vigorous and continuing economic growth is firm confidence that the value of the dollar will be reasonably stable in the years
ahead.
Action to meet these challenges is required on many fronts, by all groups in
our society and by all units of government.
The individual consumer can play an important part by shopping carefully for price and quality. In this way the American housekeeper can be
a powerful force in holding down the cost of living and strengthening the
principle that good values and good prices make good business.
Businessmen must redouble their efforts. They must wage a ceaseless
war against costs. Production must be on the most economical basis possible. The importance of wide and growing markets must be borne in mind
in setting prices. Expanding markets, in themselves, promise economies
that help keep costs and prices in check.
Leaders of labor unions have a particularly critical role to play, in view
of the great power lodged in their hands. Their economic actions must
reflect awareness that the only road to greater material well-being for the
Nation lies in the fullest realization of our productivity potential and that
stability of prices is an essential condition of sustainable economic growth.




The terms of agreements reached between labor and management in
wage and related matters will have a critical bearing on our success in
attaining a high level of economic growth with stable prices. It is not
the function of Government in our society to establish the terms of these
contracts, but it must be recognized that the public has a vital interest in
them. Increases in money wages and other compensation not justified
by the productivity performance of the economy are inevitably inflationary.
They impose severe hardships on those whose incomes are not enlarged.
They jeopardize the capacity of the economy to create jobs for the expanding labor force. They endanger present jobs by limiting markets at home
and impairing our capacity to compete in markets abroad. In short, they
are, in the end, self-defeating.
Self-discipline and restraint are essential if reasonable stability of prices
is to be reached within the framework of the free competitive institutions
on which we rely heavily for the improvement of our material welfare. If
the desired results cannot be achieved under our arrangements for determining wages and prices, the alternatives are either inflation, which would
damage our economy and work hardships on millions of Americans, or controls, which are alien to our traditional way of life and which would be an
obstacle to the Nation's economic growth and improvement.
The chief way for Government to discharge its responsibility in helping
to achieve economic growth with price stability is through the prudent
conduct of its own financial affairs. The budget submitted to the Congress for the fiscal year 1960, which balances expenditures with receipts
at a level of $77 billion, seeks to fulfill this responsibility. If Government spending is held within the limits set in the proposed budget, the
growth of our economy at the rate that may be expected would make it
possible in the reasonably foreseeable future to provide, through a significant further step in tax reform and reduction, added incentives and means
for vigorous economic growth and improvement.
Governmental actions in other areas can also help to maintain price stability as our economy expands. The Congress will be requested to amend
the Employment Act of 1946 to make reasonable price stability an explicit
goal of Federal economic policy, coordinate with the goals of maximum
production, employment, and purchasing power now specified in that Act.
Steps will be taken within the Executive Branch to assure that governmental
programs and activities are administered in line with the objective of
reasonable price stability, and programs for the enlargement and improvement of public information on prices, wages and related costs, and productivity will be accelerated.
The many continuing programs of Government that promote the expansion and improvement of our economy will be administered vigorously.
Also, new legislation will be requested to strengthen competitive forces, to
enhance personal welfare, to promote integrity in labor-management relationships and to foster better industrial relations, to assist local areas




VI

experiencing heavy and persistent unemployment, to make more effective
use of the large Federal expenditures relating to agricultural price support,
to promote conditions favorable to trade among nations, and to assist in
the economic growth and development of the Free World.
Favorable consideration of these legislative proposals by the Congress
will materially help to achieve the goals of vigorous, orderly, and sustainable economic progress within a framework of reasonable price stability.
All of our people, in view of their broad common interest in promoting
the Nation's economic strength, can fully support this program.

The Lessons of Recession and Recovery in 1957-58
TTTTHEN THE ECONOMIC REPORT was submitted to the Congress
* * in January 1958, the American economy was in a recession that had
started about six months earlier. The decline was still moderate, but it
was gaining momentum and spreading to additional areas of the economy.
The Economic Report gave an account of the recession as it had developed
to the turn of the year, and expressed the view that the underlying strength
and regenerative powers of our free competitive system, supported by
appropriate private and public policies, might be expected to bring the
decline to an end soon and to restore the economy to an upward path. The
recession did, in fact, halt in April 1958. By May, a recovery was under
way; and before many months had passed, most of the ground lost during
the decline had been regained. As 1958 ended, we were moving toward
new high levels of production and employment.
The present Economic Report therefore reviews the greater part of a
full economic cycle. Chapter 2 describes the extent of the contraction
and how it started, what helped to keep it within narrow limits, how
recovery began and developed, and what the economic situation was at the
end of the year. Chapter 3 summarizes the Government actions that helped
to shorten the decline, to reduce the severity of its impact, and to promote
a sound recovery. And Chapter 4 proposes a program for promoting
economic growth on a sustainable, inflation-free basis.
These major divisions of the Report are-presented in fulfillment of the
explicit requirements of the Employment Act of 1946. But it is useful also
to consider what broad lessons may be learned from the events of the past
year and a half as guides for the future. What do these events tell us
about how our economy responds to contractive influences, about the role
that Government can usefully play in seeking to moderate economic fluctuations, and about the problems that Americans must face in the years ahead
in striving to achieve high and sustainable rates of economic growth,
unmarred by inflation? These questions are treated in the present chapter.
THE ECONOMY'S CAPACITY TO RESIST RECESSION
In many respects, the most important lesson taught by the recent recession
is that a competitive economic system has remarkable power to resist contractive pressures and, without an extended interruption of growth, to stage




a good recovery. The inherent features of our economy that make this
possibleâ€”its strength and resiliencyâ€”are due mainly to our free competitive
institutions, to the stability of our institutions of saving, banking, and finance,
and to the character of our people, notably their industry and resourcefulness
and their capacity to take a confident and balanced view of the Nation's
economic prospects. Other sources of strength are due to certain long-term,
structural changes in our economyâ€”which have resulted in growing percentages of American workers being employed in industries and occupations
not readily affected by an economic downturnâ€”and to certain changes in
business practices, notably long-term planning for the enlargement of
operations.
Our economy is also aided in resisting recession by features that tend to
moderate the impact of a decline in economic activity on the flow of income
to individuals and thus on the volume of spending for consumption. The
most important of these is the Federal-State unemployment insurance system,
under which payments are made to individuals out of work. In addition,
our system of graduated personal income taxes cushions the impact of an
over-all decline in income on the amounts available for spending on consumer
goods and for savings.
These features of our economy, which were clearly evident in the 1957-58
recession, have certain implications for public policy that are worthy of
special note. First, the capacity of our economy to withstand contractive
influences provides time for regenerative processes to make the adjustments
needed for sound recovery, and for the counteractive measures taken by
Government, jointly with factors making for long-term growth, to make
their effects felt. Where necessary, efforts should be made to strengthen
these features of our economic system.
Second, the major emphasis of Federal countercyclical policy should be
placed on measures that will result in prompt action to help promote a shift
in the balance of economic forces from contraction to recovery and growth.
Though a useful contribution can be made by the acceleration of public
works projects that are already under way or are ready to be started, little
reliance can be placed on large undertakings which, however useful they
may be in the longer term, can be put into operation only after an extended
interval of planning. By the time they are fully under way, they may exert
excessive demand on an economy that has already recovered.
Third, in contrast to large-scale public works, monetary and credit policy,
used vigorously, can produce prompt and significantly helpful results.
Although the easing of credit does not affect all parts of the economy to the
same degree, it works broadly, is promptly reversible, and makes its impact
felt without entailing direct governmental intervention in the affairs of
business concerns and individuals.
Finally, the capacity to resist short-term fluctuations can be increased by
Government actions to strengthen the factors that make for long-term
economic growthâ€”vigorously competitive markets, research and develop-




ment activity, and heightened incentives for all Americans to work, save,
and invest. It is on these factors that we depend most heavily for the thrust
that lifts the economy from recession to recovery and for the stimulus to
continuing economic expansion and improvement.
POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENCES AMONG ECONOMIC CYCLES
Although all economic cycles have certain common characteristics, each
is unique in character and follows a course that varies in significant respects
from its predecessors. These distinctive characteristics must be taken into
account when governmental policies intended to help reverse a recessionary
trend are formulated.
The need to do this was especially evident in the 1957â€”58 recession. It
had been preceded by a major expansion in productive capacity without
a corresponding increase in utilization, so that when the downturn began
there was ample, if not temporarily excess, capacity in a number of important
industries. In contrast, the expansion of capacity prior to the 1953 downturn had been matched by a roughly equivalent increase in production.
Similarly, the American consumers' requirements for a broad range of goods
were more nearly satisfied when business activity turned down in 1957 than
they had been when activity began to recede in 1953. Sales of automobiles
reached an exceptionally high level in 1955, aided by a sharp easing of
instalment credit terms. In 1953-54, production of Western European
nations was expanding rapidly, world commodity prices were relatively
stable, and international trade was continuing to rise. In 1957-58, on
the other hand, industrial activity in Western Europe tended to level off,
commodity prices weakened, and international trade turned downward for
the time being.
These differences naturally affected the character and extent of the recent
decline. Business expenditures for new plant and equipment, which had
fallen only 11 percent in 1953-55, dropped 22 percent in 1957-58. Total
consumer expenditures were virtually stable in both periods; but in the nine
months following the 1957 peak, automobile production fell 47 percent,
compared with an 11 percent decline following the economic downturn in
1953. Merchandise exports, which had increased 18 percent in 1953-54,
fell by about that amount in the 1957-58 recession.
But from the viewpoint of public policy, the most significant difference
between the two periods was in Federal fiscal operations. In the three
quarters following the 1957 peak of activity, Federal purchases of goods
and services increased $1 billion, measured on an annual rate basis; in
the comparable period of 1953-54, they fell $6 billion, largely as a result
of the termination of the Korean conflict. This critical difference was
accentuated by the fact that, although State and local government purchases
of goods and services were rising in both recessions, they rose more in 1957-58
than in 1953-54. It was clear in January 1958 that even without a general
tax reduction the fiscal operations of the Federal Government would have




a significantly more expansive effect on the economy than they had had
during the 1953-54 recession, notwithstanding the tax cut of $7.5 billion
in early 1954. As it turned out, the economy received an even larger
stimulus from Federal fiscal operations in the fiscal year 1958 than had been
expected at first. And this effect has been intensified in the fiscal year 1959.
These facts are a reminder that there is no single prescription for corrective
action which can be applied with only minor variations in every cyclical
episode. They emphasize the importance, in a situation in which powerful
corrective forces are already at work, of avoiding hasty and disproportionate
actions, such as tax reductions that needlessly endanger the prospects of
future fiscal balance and prejudice the orderly revision of the tax structure.
Clearly, the distinctive features of a downturn are pertinent not only to an
appraisal of the probable course of business activity as contraction develops
but also to the design of measures to help stem the downturn and promote
recovery.
ACHIEVING VIGOROUS AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH
We may justifiably take satisfaction in the increases already achieved in
employment, production, and incomes and in the. fact that the price level has
been reasonably steady of late.
Our objective now must be to establish a firm foundation for extending
this economic advance and price stability into the months and years ahead.
But this will not come about automatically. On that point, history is clear.
Action is required on many fronts, by all groups in our society, and by all
units of government.
First, we must zealously safeguard and improve the institutions of our
free and competitive economy. America's unassailable economic strength
derives in no small measure from the fact that over the years there have
been incentives and freedom to do new things and to challenge old and
established ways. Our strength comes in large part from the pressures which
this competition entails, pleasures to shelter groups from these pressures
and from the need to make the readjustments that they compel come at the
cost of limiting our capacity to grow.
Second, a high rate of growth in our economy requires that we wage a
relentless battle against impediments to the full and most effective use of
our human and technological resources. Such impediments curb the productivity of our work force and increase production costs. They raise the
prices of the things we buy and limit the success of our efforts to lift levels
of living.
Third, if we are to achieve a rapid rate of economic growth and improvement in the years ahead, we must continue to enlarge and improve the plant
and equipment that supplement human effort and make it increasingly
productive. There must be strong incentives for businesses to commit ever
larger sums for expanding their operations and reducing their costs. And
there must also be incentives for the thrift essential to the financing of these




critically important outlays. Policies that weaken these incentives will cause
us to fall short of achieving our full potential for expansion.
Finally, an indispensable condition for achieving vigorous and continuing economic growth is firm confidence that the value of the dollar
will be reasonably stable in the years ahead. In recent months, prices
generally have moved within a narrow range, and some of the price increases
early in the year were the result of temporary conditions, such as the effect of
adverse weather on food supplies. But these facts provide no basis for complacency regarding the long-term problem of maintaining reasonably stable
prices. Despite recession during the first part of the year, wage rates
continued to move upward. The rate of increase was nearly as great
as in periods of economic expansion, and higher than the rate at which
gains in productivity have been achieved in our economy over extended
periods of time. Obviously, if we have only limited success in restraining
increases in unit costs during recession, much remains to be done to achieve
a basis for holding prices reasonably steady when productive capacity is
more fully utilized. To this challenge everyone must respond.
The individual consumer can play an important part by shopping carefully
for price and quality. In this way, the American housekeeper can be a
powerful force for holding down the cost of living and strengthening the
principle that good values and good prices make good business.
Businessmen must redouble their efforts. They must wage a ceaseless
war against costs. Production must be on the most economical basis possible. The importance of wide and growing markets must be borne in mind
in setting prices. Expanded markets, in themselves, promise economies that
help keep costs and prices in check.
Leaders of labor unions, in view of the great power lodged in their hands,
have a particularly critical role to play. Their economic actions must reflect
awareness that stability of prices is an essential condition of sustainable
economic growth and that the only road to greater material well-being for
the Nation lies in the fullest possible realization of our productivity potential.
This requires not only that our resources be fully employed, but that
arbitrary restraints on their most effective utilization be removed. We
can realize more from our economy only to the extent that we produce more.
It is not the function of Government in our society to establish the terms
of contracts between labor and management; yet it must be recognized that
the public has a vital interest in these agreements. Increases in money
wages and other compensation not justified by the productivity performance
of the economy are inevitably inflationary. They impose severe hardships
on those whose incomes are not enlarged. They jeopardize the capacity of
the economy to create jobs for the expanding labor force. They endanger
present jobs by limiting markets at home and impairing our capacity to
compete in markets abroad. In short, they are, in the end, self-defeating.
Self-discipline and restraint are essential if agreements consistent with a
reasonable stability of prices are to be reached within the framework of the

489916 Oâ€”59-




free competitive institutions on which we rely heavily for the improvement
of our material welfare. If the desired results cannot be achieved under
our arrangements for determining wages and prices, the alternatives are
either inflation, which would damage our economy and work hardships on
millions of Americans, or controls, which are alien to our traditional way of
life and which would be an obstacle to the Nation's economic growth and
improvement.
Government also has a vitally important part to play in helping to prevent
inflationary developments. First, through the management of its fiscal
affairs, it can help to create an environment favorable to the achievement
and maintenance of price stability. Second, to the extent consistent with
other national objectives, it must strive to operate those Government programs that directly affect costs and prices in a way that will contribute to
over-all price stability. Third, it must lose no opportunity, through revisions
of its tax structure or by other means, to promote improvements in productivity and to provide greater incentives for economic expansion.
Numerous elements in the program recommended to the Congress in
Chapter 4 of this Report are concerned explicitly with establishing a more
secure basis for the price stability essential for orderly economic expansion.
Other parts of the program, though immediately directed to other goals,
will also further this objective. All of our people, in view of their broad
common interest in economic growth, can fully support this program.

and, once started, the recovery spread rapidly through the economy. By
the end of the year most of the ground lost during the contraction had been
regained. The index of industrial production was 142 percent of the 194749 average, compared with the peak of 146 in 1957; total employment had
increased by about 1 million from its recession low; unemployment had been
reduced by approximately the same amount; and the income and expenditures of individuals were at new high levels. Gross national product, our
broadest measure of the Nation's output of goods and services, had risen to
an annual rate of $453 billion. Expressed in dollars of constant purchasing
power, this represented an output of goods and services about equal to the
peak reached in 1957.
EXTENT OF THE DECLINE
Measured by the duration and extent of declines in employment, production, and income, the 1957-58 recession may be regarded as a moderate one

of goods and services, adjusted for changes in prices, fell about 5*/2 percent
between the third quarter of 1957 and the first quarter of 1958. Industrial output decreased more sharply, which is typical of economic contractions; over a period of eight months, it decreased 13 percent. Employment
in manufacturing industries began to decline in January 1957, slowly for
six or seven months and then more rapidly. By May 1958, one month
after what is commonly regarded as the low point in general business
activity, a decline of 11 percent had been recorded. Reductions in nonfarm employment outside of manufacturing were smaller. Unemployment began to rise in the third quarter of 1957 and fluctuated around 5
million in the spring and summer of 1958. Lower employment naturally
meant a reduction in the incomes received by individuals. Total wage and
salary payments fell 3/2 percent between July 1957 and April 1958. The
drop in total personal income, on the other hand, was only 1 percent.
These broad measures tend to obscure the fact that economic fluctuations characteristically affect some parts of the economy more severely than
others. The recent recession was no exception in this respect. Production
of nondurable goods declined very little, and the output of the service industries actually increased. On the other hand, production of consumer durable
goods fell 27 percent from July 1957 to April 1958; the output of steel and
of machinery fell 40 percent and 21 percent, respectively; and the production
of automobiles in April 1958 was about 40 percent below what it had been
in the same month of 1957.
The pace of the decline was also uneven. The downturn was preceded
by a slowing in the rate of growth of the economy, and for the first few
months the rate of contraction was relatively moderate. However, it tended
to accelerate in the early months of 1958, with the result that a large proportion of the total decline was compressed into a period covering less than half
of its full duration.
By the end of March the decline was abating, and by May indications
of a general improvement began to appear. The signs of recovery, which
multiplied quickly, were confirmed before long by a sustained upturn, and
the recession may now be regarded as having ended in April.
MAJOR FACTORS IN THE DECLINE
Early in 1957, changes in several economic sectors, developing at the same
time mainly by coincidence, tended to sap the vigor of the expansion then in
progress. Each exerted a growing downward pressure on production and
employment, and ultimately their joint effect was to tip the balance, around
midyear, toward a general reduction in economic activity (Chart 1).
The major developments were the decrease in the volume of incoming
business of the capital goods industries and reduced appropriations by manufacturing businesses for their investment expenditure programs. By the
end of 1957, these early signs were confirmed by lower expenditures of business concerns on machinery, equipment, and new facilities. Throughout

1958

most of 1957, financing for expansion programs was becoming more costly.
Corporate liquidity was low, and instances of capital issues being postponed
because of unfavorable financing conditions increased. Clearly, financial
considerations were exerting a progressively greater influence on businesses to
restrict their commitments for further expansion of their facilities.
A more basic factor affecting the capital expansion programs of businesses
was the widening gap between the supply and use of industrial capacity. In
manufacturing alone, spending on new plant and equipment between 1953
and 1957 had increased capacity by about one-fourth, but production had
increased by only 7 percent. At the same time, the cost of new capacity, as
reflected in the prices of industrial equipment, rose substantially more than
the prices of industrial output (Chart 3).
Pressure to curtail the capital improvement and expansion programs of
businesses mounted rapidly. By the second quarter of 1958, outlays for
these purposes had dropped $7.4 billion, on an annual rate basis, from the
peak reached three quarters earlier. This sharp decline was a major factor
in initiating the general economic contraction.
A similar though lesser impact on business activity resulted from a reduction in merchandise exports. These had risen at a particularly rapid rate
in 1956 and early 1957, and in the first quarter of the latter year they were
60 percent higher than in 1954. The decline that began in the second quarter of 1957 persisted through the first quarter of 1958, when the volume of
exports stabilized some 20 percent below the level a year earlier. Initially,
the decline occurred largely in wheat, cotton, and petroleum, but it soon
spread to exports of metals, machinery, and manufactured goods generally.
The rising volume of exports in 1956 and early 1957 had helped to maintain an upward trend in our economy at a time when domestic investment
demands were beginning to level off. The disappearance of the special
factors accounting for this surge in foreign sales coincided with the decline
in investment outlays of business concerns, and reinforced this downward
pressure on economic activity. The Suez crisis that had led earlier to
unusually heavy petroleum shipments subsided. Shipments of cotton and
other agricultural products, which had been exceptionally large during the
second half of 1956 and the first half of 1957, declined. Economic activity
in certain industrialized countries of Western Europe and in Japan ceased
to increase, following a prolonged period of expansion; and, in view of
their large stocks of imported materials, these countries reduced their
demands on the productive capacity of the United States. Industrial contraction in Canada resulted in smaller United States exports to that important market, and some of the less developed countries of the world curtailed
imports, because of a weakening in their terms of trade and foreign exchange
positions.
The drop in our shipments abroad, occurring at a time when our imports
were declining very little, meant a decrease in net exports of goods and




12

services of about $4 billion on an annual rate basis from the first half of 1957
to the first half of 1958.
Obligations by the Department of Defense for major procurement and
production items, which had risen in the second and third quarters of 1956
to an annual rate of about $18.2 billion, were being made at a $10.6 billion
rate in the same period of 1957, but actual expenditures changed much less,
and only after some time lag. The annual rate of purchases of goods
and services for national defense declined from $44.9 billion in the second
and third quarters of 1957 to $43.9 billion in the fourth quarter; but since
Federal expenditures for nondefense programs increased, total expenditures
in the fourth quarter declined only $600 million. Additional nondefense
expenditures caused a rise in the total for the first quarter of 1958. Subsequently, however, both defense and nondefense spending increased, and total
expenditures in the fourth quarter reached $53.8 billion. Meanwhile, the
rise in expenditures of State and local government units continued. As a
result, total expenditures for goods and services by all units of governmentâ€”Federal, State, and localâ€”increased throughout the recession. In
the first quarter of 1958, they were 3 percent higher than they had been six
months earlier.
Finally, although the aggregate of consumer spending changed very little,
large and important shifts occurred in the amounts spent on different groups
of goods. Purchases of consumer durable goods moved irregularly in the
first three quarters of 1957, then dropped sharply in the next six months.
In the first half of 1958, they were 11 percent less than in the third quarter
of 1957, and approximately four-fifths of the decline was accounted for by
reduced purchases of automobiles. Sharp cuts in consumer purchases of
durable goods are by no means unprecedented in recession, but the 1957-58
decline was unusually large in view of the small reductionâ€”about 1 percentâ€”in the amount of income available to consumers after payment of
taxes.
These largely independent changes in demandâ€”lower rates of spending
by businesses on new plant and equipment, smaller exports, briefly and
slightly reduced purchases by the Federal Government, a lower rate of
contract placement, and reduced expenditures by consumers for durable
goodsâ€”led to a change in the inventory policies of business concerns. This
change was a major factor in the decline.
From 1955 to mid-1957, business inventories were increased substantially.
To a considerable extent this represented the rebuilding and enlargement of
stocks of materials, work in process, and finished products that are a normal
part of any expansion period. The rate of inventory accumulation slackened noticeably in the first three quarters of 1957, however, as uncertainties
about future sales and prices emerged and as the financing of inventories
became more costly and difficult. But the major change did not come until
the final quarter of the year. Business concerns then curtailed their production schedules sharply below the rate at which they were making sales, and




by the first quarter of 1958 inventories were being reduced at the rate of
$9.5 billion per year. Thus, a rather common feature of economic fluctuations in an enterprise economy was repeated: a moderate decline in the pace
of actual sales produced a much larger effect on production and employment by provoking a sharp swing from inventory accumulation to inventory
liquidation.
The inventory declines were closely related to the specific reductions in
demand already noted. Indeed, reductions in inventory holdings by manufacturers of machinery, aircraft, and automobiles accounted for over one-half
of the decline in total business inventories. Producers supplying these industries in turn were faced with substantial declines in incoming business, and
they attempted to pare down their holdings. As a consequence, particularly
large reductions occurred in the output of the supplying industries.
Certain additional developments also influenced inventory policies. Special problems of excess capacity and unfavorable relationships between
current sales and inventory holdings affected the petroleum, chemical, and
paper industries. The inventories of manufacturers of consumer household
durable goods were high when the downturn began; although sales declined
only moderately, production was cut sharply in order to complete the indicated adjustment. And distributors of all types of consumer goodsâ€”apart
from automobile dealers, whose inventories were rising sharplyâ€”cut their
purchases from manufacturers and drew down their inventories, even though
consumer purchases were well maintained. The major part of this liquidation of trade inventories came in the first quarter of 1958, when recessionary
pressures were greatest.
The impact of these inventory adjustments was considerable. The swing
from accumulation at an annual rate of $2.2 billion per year in the third
quarter of 1957 to liquidation at the annual rate of $9.5 billion during the
first quarter of 1958 reduced gross national product by $11.7 billion, about
60 percent of its entire decline during this period.
RESISTANCE TO CONTRACTION
Measures taken in 1957-58 specifically to counteract economic recession,
and other measures taken for reasons independent of economic conditions,
played an important part in limiting the contraction in production and
employment to a moderate over-all decline and to a brief span of time. But
these limiting features were in part also the result of the considerable and
growing capacity of our economic system to resist deflationary forces.
A major element in the economy's resistance to recession in 1957-58 was
the maintenance of over-all consumer demand, a result that may be attributed to consumer confidence and to the maintenance of personal income.
Although gross national product was $20 billion lower on an annual-rate
basis in the first quarter of 1958 than in the third quarter of 1957, the decline
in personal disposable (after tax) income was less than $4 billion, and
aggregate consumer expenditures fell only $2 billion.




14

In contrast, during the recessions prior to World War II, large declines
in investment activity commonly resulted in large contractions in personal
income, and reduced incomes naturally led to lower consumer purchases.
But in recessions since the war, the relative stability of consumer incomes
and purchases has provided a check on this potentially cumulative process.
As a result, declines in production have been contained within a narrower
segment of the economy.
A number of factors help to account for the maintenance of consumer
income during the 1957-58 recession. First, the decline in personal
income earned in production was small relative to the contraction in the
value of output. For every decline of $1 billion in private output, personal
income earned fell only $360 million; in 1929-30, it fell $670 million for
each $1 billion decline in output. This relatively more moderate decline
in earned income resulted in part from the fact that a larger proportion of
our labor force is now employed in industries and occupations not quickly
affected by moderate changes in business conditions; and even in the industries that are more sensitive to business fluctuations, a larger proportion of
employees hold positions not usually affected by production cutbacks of
short duration. Moreover, wage rates continued to press upward during the
1957-58 period, increasing the pay of employed persons and moderating the
income reductions of those working a shorter week. But this is a factor that
works two ways. It may sustain income for the employed; but to the extent
that it leads to higher costs and prices, it may induce reductions in the
working force and be an obstacle to re-employment.
Some of the factors that have made personal income earned in production
more resistant to recession have, on the other hand, made corporate income
more sensitive. Total corporate profits, and consequently the revenues
received by Government from corporate income taxes, fell sharply during
the recession. Because corporate dividends were maintained at a high level,
helping to sustain personal income, corporate retentions of income were
sharply reduced. For every $1 billion decline in gross national product,
corporate income taxes and retained earnings (adjusted for inventory valuation) together fell $590 million from the third quarter of 1957 to the first
quarter of 1958, compared with a drop of $240 million from 1929 to 1930.
Another development accounting for the small decline in personal income
earned in production was the rise in farm income during the recession.
Net farm income rose in the first quarter of 1958 to an annual rate that
was 10 percent higher than in 1957, increased another 6 percent in the
second quarter, and then remained roughly unchanged for the rest of the
year. To some extent, however, the beneficial results for the economy of the
larger income of farmers were offset by the effect of higher farm prices,
which reduced nonfarm real income and purchases.
Second, certain supplements to earnings helped to maintain aggregate
consumer income. Unemployment compensation payments increased
sharply as employment and earnings fell, and the extension of these benefits




15

for additional periods in 1958 provided a further offset to lost pay for those
who had exhausted their rights. Actually, the extended benefits did not
begin to be paid until after the recovery had started; nevertheless, they
assisted those who felt the recession's effect for the longest time and they
also strengthened the recovery movement. In addition, supplemental unemployment compensation payments under private plans helped to maintain
personal incomes and consumption expenditures. Another major income
supplement was the steady increase in payments under social security,
pension, and other benefit arrangements. The increase in such payments
during the recession resulted from the growth in the number of persons
eligible to receive them and from benefit increases under certain public
social security programs which had been legislated earlier.
The increase in these so-called "transfer" payments was very large:
$2.6 billion on an annual rate basis between the third quarter of 1957 and
the first quarter of 1958, and another $2.6 billion by the third quarter. In
this way, not only was the personal income earned in production relatively
well maintained during the recession, but the declines that did occur were
appreciably moderated in their effect on total personal income.
Finally, part of the fall in personal income was offset by a decline in
tax obligations, so that the income available to consumers after taxes, and
thus their purchasing power, declined less than the flow of personal income.
The combination of these three stabilizing factorsâ€”the small decline in
earned personal income relative to the decline in production, the growth
in transfer payments, and the reduction in personal tax paymentsâ€”greatly
moderated the fall in consumer income available for spending. And consumers, in turn, reduced their purchases of goods and services by less than
the fall in their income.
If purchases by consumers in 1957-58 had fallen as much, in proportion
to the decline in all other demands for output, as from 1929 to 1930, they

would have dropped by at least $26 billion. Actually, they fell only $2
billion. While gross national product fell 4/2 percent, personal disposable
income fell only about 1 percent, and consumption expenditures only 0.7
percent (Table 2 ) .
The moderate extent and relatively short duration of the recession were
also due in part to the absence of adverse financial developmentsâ€”which in
the past have tended to aggravate business contractionsâ€”and to the increase
of asset values, notably farm land and real estate. These circumstances
reflect the fact that the recession was brief and moderate, but they helped
to keep it brief and moderate.
PRICES AND COSTS
Public attention was attracted during the recession to the apparent paradox of prices continuing to rise while production and employment were
declining. Attention was naturally focused mainly on consumer prices.
As measured by the consumer price index, this group of prices rose, on the
average, by about 2 percent, though there was considerable diversity of
movement among different items. A major part of the increase was due
to higher food prices and the continuing upward drift in the costs of various
services used by consumers (Charts 4 and 5). On the other hand, prices of
manufactured products, with the major exception of new and used automobiles, were reasonably stable.

Prices in wholesale markets rose somewhat less than prices at retail, and
have been roughly stable since early in 1958. Again, however, the average
of wholesale prices fails to disclose the considerable differences of movement
among commodity groups. Prices of farm products and foods rose sharply
during the recession and then declined after mid-1958. Prices of raw
materials, which are always sensitive to changes in domestic and world
market conditions, declined sharply during the recession but recovered
rapidly after the upturn. Prices of manufactured products continued to
rise during the early months of the contraction, but fluctuated within a
narrow range throughout 1958 (Chart 6).
While it is important to beware of overly simple explanations for the rise
in prices during the last few years, and in particular for the continuance of
some increases during the recession, three factors of major importance may
be identified as having contributed to these results. First, during the early
part of the upward price movement which started about three years ago,
some increases were caused by heavy and rapidly mounting demands. These
higher prices often became higher costs for other industries, thus diffusing
their effects throughout much of the economy.
Second, a substantial part of the rise during the recession reflected forces
not closely related to the immediate business situation. Prices of services,
on which consumers spend over one-third of their total outlays, were making
a delayed adjustment to earlier increases in prices and costs. This paralleled
CHART 5

prices; in recent months the over-all index has been stable.

the experience in the other two postwar recessions. Prices of food, which
account for roughly one-quarter of the expenditures of consumers, rose
mainly because of supply conditions. Lower marketings of livestock resulted
in higher meat prices; and unfavorable weather conditions reduced the
supplies, and led to higher prices, of fresh fruits and vegetables.
Third, substantial increases in costs in recent years have influenced prices.
Large additions to productive capacity, and the replacement in this period
of facilities originally acquired when costs and prices were lower, have
caused capital costs to mount sharply. A rapidly enlarging complement of
professional and technical personnel has also added to costs, though inevitably the full beneficial effects of these larger staffs will be realized only over
an extended period of time. Since commensurate gains in output have not
occurred, these increases in costs have resulted in higher expenses per unit
of output produced.
Finally, wages, salaries, and employee fringe benefits have increased at
rates above those consistent with the long-run productivity performance of
the economy. As a result, employee compensation per unit of output, which
had been fairly stable between 1953 and 1955, rose about 10 percent in the
next two years.
This persistent advance in costs of all types naturally exerted an upward
pressure on prices. The increase in prices that did occur was less than the
rise in costs, however, with the result that profits per unit of output were
lower in 1956 and 1957 than in 1955.
Clearly, severe reductions in the price level during a brief and moderate
recession are not to be expected and would not be a proper objective of
national economic policy. Indeed, such reductions might impede early
recovery of the economy. Rather, the problem is how to achieve a reasonable stability of prices when economic activity is advancing and output and
employment are high. The limited downward flexibility of prices in a
moderate recession, and the upward movement even then of certain key
prices and costs, highlight and emphasize the need for public and private
policies that will produce the desired price stability at all times.
RESUMPTION OF ECONOMIC EXPANSION
Even during periods of general economic contraction, some industries
and some regions of the Nation continue to forge ahead and others experience only a temporary cessation or slowing down of their rate of growth.
This continuing strength helps to moderate cutbacks of production elsewhere ; and when demands begin to rise again in areas where there had been
actual declines, over-all gains in output and employment follow quickly.
A pattern of this type prevailed in the 1957-58 recession. While production and employment were declining rather sharply in some sectors, notably
in the heavy industries and in those producing consumer durable goods,
output and sales of consumer nondurable goods fell only slightly, the service
industries expanded, and purchases by State and local governments con-

tinued to rise. Then, as areas of the economy that had suffered declines
resumed expansion, and as sales began to be met increasingly out of current
production rather than out of inventories, a rise in general economic activity
started (Chart 2 ) .
In the early part of 1958, shifts of this kind developed quickly. In February, employment was declining in all major sectors of the private economy;
only in government was it increasing. By April and May, increases in
private employment were reported (Charts 7 and 8). The demand for
goods and services ceased declining in a number of industries and in some
cases began to rise. The decline of exports virtually ended by the second
quarter of 1958, eliminating an important contractive force.
As indicated earlier, Federal outlays on goods and services fell only in the
fourth quarter of 1957, and then by a relatively small amountâ€”$600 million
on an annual rate basis. A rise in such outlays began in the next quarter.
Purchases of nondefense goods and services by the Federal Government rose
at an annual rate of $3 billion from the first to the fourth quarter of 1958,
largely on account of increased payments under agricultural price support
programs and higher Government pay scales. And defense outlays, significantly influenced by the effect of pay increases, rose at an annual rate of
$400 million between the first and second quarters of 1958 and by another
$900 million in the next two quarters. At the same time, there was a sharp
increase in the placement of contracts for the purchase of military goods.
New orders for major items of defense goods, which in the second half of
1957 were being placed at an annual rate of $12 billion, increased to an
annual rate of $22 billion in the first half of 1958. The most immediate
effect of this rise was to slow and eventually halt the liquidation of inventories
by defense contractors.
Most of the decline in business expenditures for plant and equipment
had occurred by the second quarter of 1958. However, indications that
the decline would not be of long duration began to appear early in the
year; new orders for machinery and equipment, after falling sharply in
the late months of 1957, stabilized after the turn of the year and moved
upward shortly thereafter. Surveys of the plans of businesses for capital
outlays reported in September 1958 and again in December indicated that
the decline in these expenditures had ended and that some increase was in
prospect. Although industrial capacity was generally ample, the need for
more or for improved facilities was already being felt in some industries.
Throughout the economy, increased competitive pressures and rising costs
intensified the search for more efficient production techniques.
Indications that home building would help promote an upturn were
apparent early. Applications for FHA commitments, after declining more
than seasonally in the final quarter of 1957, moved moderately upward
through March 1958 and then increased strongly for the next six months.
The number of new private dwelling units being started increased steadily
after February. As was to be expected, time was required for these changes

to be translated into actual construction activity, but the volume of expenditures for residential construction turned upward after May and quickly
pushed well above the levels of 1956 and 1957.
The rise in home building activity and the stability of consumer demand
in general began early in 1958 to exert a favorable influence on the inventory policies of producers and distributors of building materials and consumer
goods. In the first quarter of the year, these industries were cutting back
their inventories sharply. Except for automobiles, however, sales were not
falling by a significant amount, and in many cases were rising. As retail
and wholesale firms placed larger orders with manufacturers, the latter increased their production, both to meet the increased sales and to replenish
their own inventories. In preparation for a new model year, the automobile industry also began expanding production and adding to inventories.
The change in the rate of inventory investment by wholesalers and retailers
and by the automobile industry accounted for a rise of about $4 billion in
national product between the first and fourth quarters of 1958, about oneseventh of the total increase recorded for that period.
Although inventories of manufacturers not closely associated with consumer developments continued to decline throughout the summer at a fairly
rapid rate, they eventually began to feel the effects of the increase in demand
elsewhere. Inventory reductions were slowed considerably, as production
expanded faster than sales; but in some industries, particularly those producing capital goods, liquidation continued in the final quarter of 1958.
For the economy as a whole, however, the rate of production in the fourth
quarter was equal to sales, whereas in the first quarter it had been $9.5
billion less than sales. This rise of $9.5 billion accounted for more than
one-third of the increase in gross national product during the period.
As a result of increases in sales and production, and a continued rise in
transfer payments, personal income began to rise in March. Apart from the
effects of retroactive salary payments to Federal employees in July, and the
pattern of dividend payments in December, the increase continued through
the year, providing the basis for higher consumption expenditures. Although
the decline in consumer spending on durable goods continued through the
second quarter, total consumption expenditures began to increase in that
quarter and by the end of the year retail sales were above sales a year earlier.
After September, purchases of durable goods increased substantially.
Responding to the increase in output and sales, corporate profits recovered
sharply in the second half of 1958. By the fourth quarter of the year, they
were apparently equal to the highest quarterly figure in 1957 and only
slightly below the peak attained in 1955. Supplementing the increasing
allowances for depreciation, these higher earnings were providing substantially larger amounts of internal funds to business concerns by the end of
the year.
Had it not been for extensive work stoppages in the final quarter, the
recovery in output, employment, and income, and in spending by consumers,
would have been more rapid. As it was, changes in employment followed
fairly closely the patterns of change in previous postwar cycles. The rate of




26

unemployment, which had risen above the rate in previous recessions since
the war, also fell rapidly. In the final two months of the year, the unemployment rate was close to what it had been in the corresponding period in
the 1948â€”50 recession and recovery, though still above what it had been in
the corresponding period in 1953-55 (Chart 9).
DEVELOPMENTS IN WORLD PRODUCTION AND TRADE
The recession was not limited to the United States in its origins or in its
effects. Production ceased to expand in most other industrial countries of
the Free World, and in some countries it declined in 1957-58 (Chart 10).
However, the general level of industrial output abroad in the closing months
of 1958 was moderately higher than it had been a year earlier, and many
indications pointed toward a renewal of expansion in countries with which
the American economy is closely related. World commodity prices, crucial
to the incomes of the primary producing countries, stabilized in the first half
of the year, and some of them tended to strengthen in the second half.
World trade, after its first significant setback since the Korean conflict, also
appeared to reflect a strengthening of demand.
The period of expansion which preceded the recession produced certain
maladjustments abroad, the correction of which entailed at least some
slowing down in production and trade before growth could be resumed
on a firmer footing. As in the United States, the expansion of industrial
capacity in certain countries was greater than the increase in industrial
output. In the United Kingdom, the increase in capacity resulting from
large investment outlays after 1955 was not matched by a corresponding
increase in industrial production or in output per worker. As wage rates
continued to rise rapidly, labor costs per unit of output increased. Together
with rising capital costs, they exerted an upward pressure on prices. In
most other industrial countries, the investment boom was translated
into a rapid growth in output and in productivity. Some of these
countries, especially the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, and Austria,
successfully combined these high growth rates with only moderate price
increases. Others, however, including particularly Japan, France, and
the Netherlands, developed strong inflationary pressures at home and unsustainably heavy external deficits as their demands for capital goods and industrial materials rose. To these maladjustments were added the strains in
international payments produced by the Suez crisis and the short-term
capital movements that started in late 1956.
Readjustments thus had to be made in a number of countries at about
the same time. The timing of these shifts was partly coincidental, but their
effects were closely intertwined. A contraction of demand arising out of
them had immediate effects on inventory policies not only in the countries
immediately concerned but in other countries as well, as world prices of
primary commodities weakened. Some commodities were already vulnerable to such changes. This was especially true with respect to nonferrous
metals, for which production capacity in the United States and abroad had

been rapidly expanded in response to the extraordinary demands generated
by the Korean conflict and its aftermath and by the investment boom.
Burdensome surpluses of coffee had also been generated by excessive increases in capacity.
The decline of commodity prices, in turn, reduced the buying power of
countries producing primary products, in many of which the demand for
imports had already grown beyond export earnings or other means of
financing.
For these reasons, international trade receded from the high level reached
in the first half of 1957 and declined into the early part of 1958 (Chart 11).
The decline was especially marked in United States exports, for reasons
related to their commodity composition and country distribution. In the
second half of 1958, however, United States exports were at about the same
rate as in the first half of the year, and there appeared to be some strengthening in world trade.
OUTLOOK FOR 1959
An examination of changes in demand that have been occurring recently
in the major sectors of our economy provides a useful basis for estimating
further changes during the months ahead. In the private sector, the
industries that supply capital goods and facilities have, so far, contributed only modestly to the recovery. New orders for such goods have
improved and demands for them have begun to rise, but output in the
industries producing these goods has not increased markedly and the
increase in employment has been even more restricted. In the months
ahead, however, these industries and others more or less closely related
to them should make a larger contribution to rising production, employment, and income. Factors that have a considerable influence on capital
outlay decisions have become more favorable. Business earnings have
improved. The rate of utilization of existing industrial capacity, though
still not exerting pressure on businesses generally to enlarge their facilities,
has increased sufficiently to bring the need for additional capacity within
sight for some industries and firms. Moreover, the need for controlling
costs provides incentives to replace obsolete and high-cost facilities, even
though they remain operational. Present evidence indicates that business
concerns contemplate no further curtailment of their expenditures for new
and better facilities, and an upturn in such expenditures may already be
under way. In the past, improving economic conditions have typically led
business concerns to revise upward their plans for capital outlays, and it is
reasonable to believe that some such revision may take place as the year
progresses. There is not, as yet, a sufficient basis for judging how large
the eventual increase in demand from this sector of the economy may be,
but it seems reasonable to expect that it will make an increasing contribution
to a rise in over-all economic activity.
Although residential construction has already risen by about one-fourth
since mid-1958, it is continuing to be a major factor in economic recovery.




3Â°

Financing commitments already in hand and uncompleted starts should
entail some further increase in construction outlays in the next few months.
Subsequently, however, the level of building activity will depend increasingly on the capacity of the industry to compete for funds in the capital
markets. Favorable action by the Congress on recommendations made
elsewhere in this Report to correct those features of our housing laws that
tend currently to impede the flow of private funds into home financing
would significantly improve the outlook for a sustained high level of residential construction.
For the time being, exports are still affected by some of the factors that
contributed to their decline in 1958: a leveling of industrial activity abroad;
apparently large inventories of some commodities that are important in
United States shipments; and continued trade deficits and strains on foreign
exchange reserves in some of the primary producing countries. These
conditions not only moderate foreign demands for United States output but
also produce keener export competition. A decisive upturn in United
States exports can scarcely be expected until a renewed rise in industrial
activity abroad sets in, and perhaps then only with some delay where
inventories or idle capacity are large. However, there are encouraging
indications of such a rise in some countries abroad, and policies favorable to
economic expansion have been undertaken generally. Increased demand
arising from renewed expansion in the industrial countries may be expected
to benefit the trade position of primary producing countries. Meanwhile,
United States imports appear to be strengthening further, as domestic economic activity rises, and this should help to increase foreign buying power,
both directly through larger earnings from the United States and, more
widely, through some continued firming of raw material prices. Accordingly, the prospect is that in the course of this year foreign economic activity
and, possibly with some delay, the foreign demand for United States exports
should begin to rise again in a mutually reinforcing relationship with our
own economy.
Farm production may be expected to remain an element of strength and
stability in 1959. Even with growing conditions less favorable than in
1958, which was an exceptional year, the aggregate output of crops promises to remain high. It is expected that the total supply of milk, eggs, and
meat will be increased, the last especially by a substantial amount of pork.
Large production and stocks of many crops are likely to keep farm prices
under some pressure, but prices of many products are protected from severe
decline by governmental supports. Livestock prices may recede somewhat,
owing to larger supplies of hogs and poultry, though beef cattle prices may
remain relatively unchanged. Farmers' cash receipts from marketings
may be well maintained but total expenses on account of farm production
will probably continue to rise somewhat, reflecting higher payments for
wages, taxes, interest, and machinery. Lower or unchanged costs are
expected for other items. In these conditions, income from farming may
be slightly below that in 1958, but still high, and farmers' expenditures for




31

production and consumption may be expected to remain at levels favorable
to an expansion of business activity. Also, the high productivity of agriculture and large stocks of food and feed should help restrain increases in the
general price level in the year ahead.
In the public sector of the economy, a rise in Government outlaysâ€”Federal, State, and local combinedâ€”may be expected in the present year,
though probably a smaller increase than in 1958. Outlays by State and
local governments have been rising steadily, and they may be expected to
continue expanding at the same rate as in the past year, if not at a somewhat
higher rate. The Federal Government's outlays for goods and services and
for transfer payments in connection with social security programs will increase in 1959, though by a lesser amount than in the past year.
If increases in the demand for output continue to develop along these
lines, the liquidation of inventories should soon come to an end, if it has not
already done so, and some stepping up in production schedules above sales
can reasonably be expected. A building up of stocks of materials and work
in process is typical of a period of economic expansion. Moreover, inventories of some businesses in 1958 appear to have fallen below the amounts
appropriate for even the reduced pace of sales at that time. The improved
liquidity position of business concerns and financial institutions should make
it possible to finance needed increases in inventories with reasonable ease.
When account is taken of the currently favorable appraisal of economic conditions which consumers appear to hold, their improved credit
position, and the higher incomes likely to be generated in sectors of the
economy not directly connected with the production of consumer goods, it
seems reasonable to expect an enlarging market for these goods in the coming
year. In turn, higher employment in these industries may be expected to
contribute further to the increase in economic activity generally. On the
other hand, the extent to which increases in income can lead to higher consumption of goods and services, and thus to higher levels of production and
employment in the consumption goods industries, depends on whether
increases in wage and other costs are held within limits consistent with reasonable stability of consumer prices.
With due allowance for the limitations that surround all efforts to forecast the probable course of activity in a free economy, there is a reasonable
basis for confidence that the recent improvement in activity will be extended into the months ahead. However, it must be recognized that the
actions of all individuals and groups in the Nationâ€”consumers, business
concerns, labor organizations, and Governmentâ€”will have a decisive bearing on the outcome. All must play their parts appropriately if the high
levels of employment, production, and purchasing power envisaged by the
Employment Act are to be attained. A significant contribution by Government to the accomplishment of this purpose, and particularly to the
achievement of the price stability essential for sustainable economic growth,
would be assured by the economic program outlined in Chapter 4. That
program is recommended to the favorable attention of the Congress.
32




Chapter 3
Economic Policies in 1958
ARIOUS MEASURES undertaken by Government helped overcome
the contractive forces in our economy in 1957-58. Some of these
measures were initiated specifically to help reverse the decline and to
promote a higher level of business activity. Others were designed to
mitigate the special hardships experienced by individuals and families
through loss of employment. Still others were called for by considerations
entirely independent of economic conditions, but they nevertheless had the
effect of stimulating economic activity. After the recovery started, policies
were directed to helping achieve a high and sustainable rate of economic
growth with stable prices.
A review of these actions and an appraisal of how they influenced
the year's economic developments are important as guides for Government and for private individuals and groups in meeting future problems of
economic stabilization with balanced and constructive policies.
POLICIES DURING THE CONTRACTION
Money and Credit
During the past 18 months, monetary and credit policy was directed
successively to moderating the rate of credit expansion, helping to reverse
economic contraction, and encouraging a steady and balanced recovery and
growth.
Demands for capital and credit were heavy in the months preceding the
1957 downturn. Plant and equipment expenditures were at an all-time
high, and expanding inventories required financing. Because the cash and
liquidity position of businesses was relatively strained, funds to help finance
investment programs and working capital needs were necessarily sought in
large volume from outside sources. But because the Federal Reserve System confined the reserves supplied to member banks at its own initiative to
amounts consistent only with seasonal swings in activity, bank credit was
less readily available than in 1956. Businesses did obtain additional credit
from commercial banks, but the increase was much smaller than in 1956,
and more reliance for funds had to be placed on the capital markets.
Securities offered by corporations increased to a new high volume, and the
offerings of State and local governments approached record amounts.
Meanwhile, the flow of funds into life insurance companies, savings and
loan associations, and mutual savings banks slackened. Although larger

amounts of savings were supplied from other sources, notably from the increasing volume of time deposits in commercial banks, the rising tide of
financial demands in the capital markets helped bring about progressively
higher interest rates and bond yields. The peak of credit and capital costs
came in the fall of 1957, when interest rates generally reached the highest
levels since the early 1930's (Chart 12).
By the end of September, there were indications that the demand by
business concerns for bank credit was slackening; and the flow of funds
into home financing fell as the ceiling interest rates on federally underwritten mortgages became increasingly out of line with yields available on
investments not subject to such controls. In the second half of October,
the Federal Reserve authorities began to ease slightly the reserve position
of member banks through open market operations in United States Government securities. This was followed in mid-November by a reduction
in the discount rate from 3/2 percent to 3 percent, signaling a decisive
change in policy. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve authorities eased
reserve positions still more by open market purchases of Government
securities and released some $1.5 billion of bank reserves by lowering reserve requirements. In a series of steps over five months beginning
in mid-November, the discount rate was reduced to 1% percent.
By March 1958, the reserve position of banks had eased markedly. Member bank borrowings from the Federal Reserve Banks were nearly $ 1 billion
below those of September 1957, and net free reserves (excess reserves less
borrowings) had increased to $500 million. This reserve position of member banks remained virtually unchanged until July 1958 (Chart 13).
Monetary policy was, moreover, sufficiently expansionary to offset the
impact on bank reserves of a gold outflow of $1.4 billion, which took place
in the first six months of the year.
These steps produced emphatic reactions in financial markets. The
improved reserve position of commercial banks enabled them to add nearly
$10 billion in loans and investments to their assets in the first half of 1958.
This took the form largely of additions to their holdings of United States
Government securities, which increased $6.0 billion by midyear, but their
holdings of State and local securities also increased significantly. The demand for bank credit from most other borrowers was not heavy, and other
forms of credit increased only a little or declined. As a result, the
ratio of United States Government securities to loans in bank portfolios
increased.
Because the major part of this increase in bank assets was reflected in
an expansion of $5.7 billion of time deposits, the volume of demand
deposits and currency, which is the economy's active money supply, increased
by only $2.2 billion, on a seasonally adjusted basis (Chart 14). Without
posing potentially inflationary threats, this timely expansion of the money
supply helped to improve the liquidity position of the economy generally.

Borrowing costs and investment yields in capital and credit markets reacted quickly to these developments. Short-term interest rates fell sharply.
The rate on 91-day Treasury bills dropped significantly below 1 percent by
May, and the rate on prime commercial paper was reduced to as low as 1 1 /%
percent in June. In the market for longer-term funds, the yield on outstanding long-term United States Government issues fell to a low of 3.05
percent in April, a decline of 19 percent from the October 1957 high. By
the time the economy was turning from recession to recovery, the yield on
high-grade corporate bonds had fallen 14 percent below its 1957 high,
and the yield on high-grade municipal securities almost 19 percent. Prices
of FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed home mortgages in secondary markets
had risen significantly by midyear, and there was a rapid improvement in
the availability of mortgage investment funds throughout the country.
Housing and Home Financing
Nowhere in the economy was the stimulative effect of the easing of credit
conditions more clearly visible than in residential building. Evidences of
underlying strength in this area, in which activity had been declining more
or less steadily for two years, were apparent as early as mid-195 7. Low
vacancy rates, a somewhat quickened tempo of sales, and a reduction in

the number of unsold houses held by builders suggested a firming of
demand. In numerous communities, the elimination of rent controls had
created conditions more favorable to the construction of apartment projects; and significant progress had been made, through the provision of
needed community facilities, in removing deficiencies that were impeding
the construction of single-family homes. In August 1957, minimum downpayment requirements on FHA-insured loans were reduced by administrative order, issued under the authority granted by the Housing Act of that
year. And the increase in residential construction costs, which had been
particularly rapid during 1955 and a good part of 1956, halted.
In this favorable environment, an increase in the flow of private funds
into the home mortgage market served rather quickly to initiate an upturn
in prospective residential building activity. Indeed, the reaction was so
marked that it was necessary in January 1958 to request authority from
the Congress to use additional funds to meet the costs of processing an
unexpectedly large volume of applications for FHA loan insurance (Chart
15).
Numerous administrative actions were taken to spur building activity.
In December 1957, more than $175 million was released for purchases of
mortgages by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and
to assist urban renewal. Early in January 1958, the rule requiring that
closing costs on FHA-insured loans be paid in cashâ€”a rule which had been
imposed in 1955 as a check on the excessive use of creditâ€”was rescinded.
In February, a new program was launched by the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board to make loans available on a five-year basis to member associations, supplementing its shorter-term loan program. In March, adjustments were made in allowable discounts on VA loans, another $200 million
was released to the FNMA for the purchase of mortgages under its special
assistance programs, and the Housing and Home Finance Agency was
directed by the President to expedite construction on approved and planned
projects for college housing, urban renewal, and public housing. Early in
April, minimum downpayment requirements on VA-guaranteed loans were
reduced. In the same month, several additional steps were taken under
authority granted by the newly approved housing legislation. Adjustments
were made in the interest rate on military housing to expedite the flow of
private funds into this type of investment; minimum downpayment requirements were reduced on FHA-insured loans; the interest rate on VA-guaranteed loans was adjusted upward to the maximum permitted under the law,
in order to draw additional funds into this type of investment; discount
controls, which had previously tended to block the flow of funds into FHAinsured and VA-guaranteed loans, were removed; and $325 million was
released by the President for purchases by the FNMA of mortgages on
properties in urban renewal areas and on housing for elderly persons and
for military personnel. Funds were made available in April, May, July,




and August^ under the FNMA special assistance program created by the
April housing legislation for the purchase of mortgages ranging in amount
up to $13,500. At that time, the law required that qualifying mortgages
be purchased at par. Since this assured financing of projects at costs below
the price of funds obtainable from private sources, and because the law
authorized the issuance of advance commitments, builders turned at once
to the Federal Government. By the middle of September, virtually all of the
$1 billion authorized by this legislation had been committed to be paid out
as mortgages were delivered.
As already indicated, evidence of an imminent upturn in home building
was visible even before the end of 1957, but the increase naturally lagged
by some months behind the improvement in financial conditions. A small
increase in housing starts began in March 1958, when the seasonally adjusted annual rate rose slightly above the 915,000 reached in February. By
December 1958, starts of new homes had reached a rate of 1,430,000. The
volume of new residential construction expenditures also increased, but
somewhat later than the rise in housing starts. Although other types of
construction activity continued at a high level, it was residential building
that supplied the major impetus from the construction field to general
economic recovery.

Unemployment Insurance Benefits
The primary objective of our Federal-State system of unemployment
insurance is directly to aid those experiencing involuntary loss of employment. However, by sustaining the aggregate purchasing power of consumers
at a level higher than would otherwise prevail, these payments contribute
significantly to the stabilization of the whole economy.
In both these respects, benefit payments were materially helpful during
the 1957-58 recession. Payments rose moderately in the third quarter of
1957 and very sharply in the fourth quarter and after the turn of the year,
as unemployment mounted. From July 1957 to April 1958, they directly
offset about one-third of the decline in wage and salary disbursements
and, because they are not taxable, their effect in maintaining disposable
personal income was even greater.
The contraction of job opportunities meant that unemployment was extended for many workers beyond normal lengths and beyond the period
of benefit rights under basic laws. As a result, the number of persons
exhausting their benefits rose from 82,000 per month in September 1957
to a peak of 285,000 in July 1958.
Legislation was requested in March 1958 to lengthen temporarily the
period of entitlement to unemployment benefits, and a bill was enacted in
June. States participating in this temporary program, or otherwise extending the duration of benefits, accounted for 70 percent of covered employment. The number of Unemployed persons eligible for its benefits
reached a maximum of 658,000 in late August 1958. Extra benefits
amounted to about $390 million during the year.
Defense Procurement
The Economic Report of January 1958 noted that the economy was
beginning to feel the impact of an increase in defense expenditures. In
the January 1958 Budget Message, $39.6 billion of new obligational
authority was requested for the military functions of the Department of
Defense, and budget expenditures of $40.3 billion were contemplated for
the fiscal year 1959. The latter figure was $1.4 billion higher than the
expenditures estimated for fiscal 1958. Much of this increase resulted
from higher planned expenditures for military research and development
programs, additional military construction, and a contingency reserve for
the acceleration of weapons development. In line with national security
policy, a supplemental appropriation request of close to $1.3 billion was
made on January 7, 1958, as an advance on the program for the fiscal year
1959; and in April, close to $1.5 billion of additional funds were requested
for the fiscal year 1959.
The acceleration of defense procurement under the amounts appropriated
in the calendar year 1958 and prior years was soon evident in the awarding




40

of contracts for major items. In the third quarter of 1957, gross obligations
for major procurement and production in the Department of Defense military functions amounted to $2.2 billion. They rose to nearly $3.9 billion
in the fourth quarter of 1957, and reached $4.7 billion and $6.1 billion in
the first and second quarters of 1958, respectively.
Because changes in the backlog of unfilled orders permit the rate of current production to follow a more even course than would be dictated by
the flow of new orders alone, this acceleration in defense contracting was
not accompanied by a corresponding increase of output in the affected
industries. However, the rise in defense contracting in the first half of
1958 did result in an expansion of defense production, and through its
effect on the inventory policies of defense contractors had a significantly
stimulative effect on the economy.
Civil Procurement and Construction
Steps taken to accelerate needed Government procurement and construction in nondefense programs also had a helpful, though necessarily
limited, effect. Early in March, accelerated procurement of needed equipment and supplies was authorized, and instructions were issued to agencies
calling for the placement of as many planned orders as possible under available authorizations. Stress was placed on the desirability of giving these
orders, insofar as possible, to firms in areas of substantial labor surplus.
Legislation was requested in March and enacted in April to make available for immediate use one-half of the amounts requested for the purchase
of supplies and equipment in the fiscal year 1959. The General Services
Administration, the Veterans Administration, and other civilian agencies
ordered substantial quantities of supplies under this plan, and the Post
Office Department placed orders for new trucks earlier than had been
scheduled. A program for accelerating the repair and modernization of
Federal buildings was also put into operation in March, and congressional
assent to requests for supplemental appropriations made it possible to continue an accelerated rate of activity on Federal water projects already under
way.
Acceleration of Grants-in-Aid and Tax Refunds
Allocations to State and local bodies under various Federal grant programs, including aid for the construction of hospitals, medical research
facilities, and airports, were accelerated during March and April so that
contracts might be negotiated for projects that could be started immediately.
Special efforts were made by the Internal Revenue Service in 1958 to
speed up the payment of refunds to those who had overpaid their 1957
income taxes. Refunds distributed in the first five months of the year exceeded those of the same period of 1957 by $700 million.




41

Federal-Aid Highway Program
In order to maintain construction of the Interstate Highway System on
schedule, legislation was requested to permit larger allocations to the
States than would have been possible under the original provisions of the
law. Such legislation was enacted in April, and allotments were promptly
made. During the following six months, contracts were negotiated by the
States for the construction of Federal-aid highways to cost $3 billion, 80
percent more than the amount obligated during the corresponding period
of 1957 (Table 3). During this same six-month period, Federal payments
to the States exceeded $1^4 billion. This, also, was more than 80 percent
greater than the amounts paid during the same months a year earlier.

Federal Credit Programs
Steps to help counter the recession were taken in a number of Federal
credit programs outside the housing field. Loan approvals by the Small
Business Administration during the first half of 1958 amounted to about
$122 million, $33 million more than in the corresponding period of 1957.
The Export-Import Bank contributed even more heavily to the increased
volume of Federal lending activity. Its contribution through loan authorizations toward the financing of domestic economic activity is estimated to
have been more than $250 million larger in the first half of 1958 than in
the corresponding period of 1957.
Federal Fiscal Operations
Not all Federal actions taken to help counteract recession are reflected in
Federal budget accounts. Many involved no additional budget outlays
at all and, where the placement of contracts and orders was involved, some
part of the impact on the economy came at an earlier date than would be
suggested by their eventual reflection in the budget as expenditures. Even
so, significant interactions between economic developments and Government fiscal operations are revealed in the Federal budget.




42

In the fiscal year 1958, Federal expenditures were $2.5 billion higher
than in the fiscal year 1957â€”the twelve-month period which preceded the
1957 downturn (Table 4). This increase was due in part to actions taken
specifically to help counter the recession but in part also to actions which,
though taken for other reasons, had an expansive effect on the economy.
Directly and indirectly, increases in Federal expenditures resulted in an

additional demand for output at a time when private demand had slackened. Furthermore, a small part of the impact of the recession on
economic activity in general was lessened by a decline in personal income
tax payments. Because of the structure of our tax system, the decline in
personal income after taxes was less than the decline in income before
taxes.

The effect of changes in the Federal Government's fiscal operations can
be followed more closely in our national income accounts. Total receipts
and payments as registered in these accounts are larger, and differ from
those in the budget, mainly because of the inclusion of trust fund operations,
the exclusion of intra-governmental transactions, and the timing of transactions on a basis more closely related to their economic effects.
These accounts show that in the third quarter of 1957 the Federal Government was withdrawing more funds from the economy through receipts
than it was putting in through disbursements. Aggregate receipts at the
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $83.3 billion exceeded disbursements
by $3.4 billion. By the first quarter of 1958, on the other hand, receipts
fell short of disbursements by an annual amount of $6.6 billion; in this
quarter, therefore, the Federal Government's combined fiscal operations
were, on balance, exerting a stimulative effect on the economy. This
turnabout of $10 billionâ€”nearly three-fourths of which was reflected in
the decline in receiptsâ€”had a greater impact on the economy than did fiscal
operations in either of the two other postwar contractions (Chart 16).
POLICIES AFTER THE UPTURN
With production, employment, and income moving upward in the second
quarter of 1958, the economic policies of Government became concerned
increasingly with keeping the recovery on a sound basis and promoting a
sustainable, long-term expansion.
Credit and capital markets responded quickly to the rapidly strengthening confidence that a firm recovery was under way. The large financing
requirements of the Treasury also influenced financial mairkets. The
upturn in interest rates, which reflected these changed views and conditions,
was accentuated by the liquidation, beginning in June, of large speculative
holdings of United States Government securities. Interest rates subsequently stabilized, however, and the liquidation appears not to have had any
continuing effect on capital costs. To the greatest extent possible, the
large-scale Treasury financing that was essential in these months was carried
out in ways designed to minimize inflationary consequences and yet not to
hamper the recovery and expansion of the economy by putting undue pressure on long-term capital markets.
The events of 1958 presented an unusual variety of problems in the management of the public debt. During the year, an increase of $8 billion in
the public debt had to be financed, and $53.2 billion of maturing marketable
issues (exclusive of bills) needed refinancing. At the same time, the
reduced pressure of private demand for credit made it practicable to undertake a lengthening of the average maturity of the Federal debt. In the first
six months of the year, $19.6 billion of intermediate and long-term securities
were issued, which resulted in a significant increase in the average length of
the outstanding marketable debt. But after July, heavier than expected
subscriptions to the June exchange bond and the later rapid decline in bond

prices caused the Treasury to repurchase a quantity of its newly issued securities. During the latter part of July, the Federal Reserve suspended
temporarily its policy of confining open market operations to short-term
securities. For the remainder of 1958, the Treasury confined its borrowings
to maturities not in excess of 2/2 years.
It was evident by the end of the year that the Treasury's vast and difficult financing operation was being satisfactorily concluded. By December 31, most of the Treasury's prospective new money requirements
for the current fiscal year had already been met. The Federal debt increased
$6.6 billion during the second half of the year, but only about $2 billion of
additional United States Government securities had been absorbed by the
banking system. The expansion of the money supply, measured in terms of
demand deposits and currency in circulation, had been limited to about $3
billion, or 2 percent, in the second half of the year. Most of the remainder
of the Treasury's borrowing needs during this half-year were met from nonfinancial corporations and other short-term investors, rather than from
longer-term holders of securities.
As business conditions improved, monetary and credit policy was shifted,
with a view to limiting the expansion of bank credit to a sustainable pace.
The increased restraint on bank reserves was marked by the sharp rise
in member bank borrowings that began in August. Discount rates were
raised to 2 percent in August and to 2/2 percent in October, as short-term
money rates moved upward. Margin requirements on new stock purchases
were raised from 50 percent to 70 percent in August and to 90 percent in
October, to prevent the excessive use of credit in stock market transactions,
equity prices having risen in the meantime to record levels (Chart 17).
The response of interest rates to the recovery of the economy and the
shift in monetary policy was rapid. Within the short space of four months,
a rise in short-term borrowing costs wiped out much of the previous reduction, long-term capital costs returned to the levels they had reached
in the late summer and early fall of 1957, and funds became more costly
and somewhat less readily available in the mortgage market. By the close
of the year, capital and credit markets had moved a considerable distance
toward the conditions prevailing 18 to 24 months earlier.
Federal receipts and disbursements also reflected the economic and
financial developments of the recovery period. The aggregate of the Federal Government's disbursements, as registered in national income accounts,
rose from a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $82.8 billion in the first
quarter of 1958 to $90.6 billion in the final quarter. Meanwhile, Federal
receipts of all types, which had declined under the impact of recession to
an annual rate of $76.1 billion by the first quarter of 1958, rose to a rate
of $83.4 billion in the fourth quarter.
The gap between the Federal Government's disbursements and receipts
narrowed, from a rate of $9.9 billion in the second quarter of the year to
$7.2 billion as the year ended, as the fiscal operations of Government, which




had tended earlier in the year to cushion the contraction, moved in the
direction of restoring a balance between outlays and receipts and thereby
countering potentially inflationary tendencies. This direction of change in
the fiscal operations of Government is favorable to sustainable economic
growth and improvement. Its beneficial effects would be extended by
enactment of the financial plan presented to the Congress in the 1960 budget.

Chapter 4

A Program for Economic Growth
with Price Stability

T

HE EMPLOYMENT ACT OF 1946, under which this Report is
submitted to the Congress, lays principal emphasis on the need for
public and private policies to promote high levels of employment, production, and purchasing power. Achievement of these goals has assumed
increasing importance with the addition of a heavy and continuing burdenâ€”
the maintenance of strong national defensesâ€”which our economy must
carry while raising the living standards of an increasing population and
helping to discharge the Nation's international responsibilities.
Experience during the life of the Act has, however, directed attention more
and more to the need for a framework of reasonable price stability in order to
achieve sustainable economic growth. A persistent upward movement of
prices would do great harm to our economy. Quite apart from the
inequities it would impose on those whose incomes would not rise correspondingly, it would narrow markets at home for important groups of
goods, lower our capability to compete in the world's markets, and by
requiring restrictive fiscal and monetary policies, lessen our chances of
fully realizing our potential for economic growth. If price increases
were to accelerate, the continuing upward movement would sooner or later
undermine the confidence on which our economic system depends and
would eventually release drastic corrective forces. Since some of the forces
that tend to produce an upward movement of prices are themselves expressions of the process of vigorous growth in a free economy, the objective of
national economic policy must be to balance encouragement and restraint.
Clearly, reasonable stability of costs and prices cannot be preserved by
any single policy or measure, nor by Government acting alone. To achieve
the goal of inflation-free, sustainable growth requires that we adopt appropriate policies and modify certain practices in both the public and private
sectors of the economy. As noted in Chapter 1, every group in the Nation
has a responsibility to help check the forces which contribute to increases in
costs and prices. Although success depends on a combination of appropriate
public and private policies and actions, Government must supply the required leadership and direction for its achievement.




A BALANCED 1960 BUDGET
The principal means by which Government can express leadership
in the effort to preserve price stability is to conduct its own financial
affairs prudently. The budget submitted to the Congress for the fiscal
year 1960, which balances expenditures with receipts at a level of $77
billion, seeks to fulfill this responsibility.
The expenditures estimated for fiscal 1960 are $3.9 billion less than
those estimated for the present fiscal year. A few items account for most
of this difference. First, an important part is accounted for by a nonrecurring expenditure of about $1.4 billion for the increased quota of the
United States in the International Monetary Fund, which is recommended
for the fiscal year 1959.
Second, during the current fiscal year the Federal National Mortgage
Association will purchase most of the mortgages for which commitments
were made under the housing legislation enacted in April 1958. Net purchases of mortgages under this special assistance program in fiscal 1960 will
be about $360 million less than in fiscal 1959.
Third, all the budget transactions in 1960 of the Federal National Mortgage Association, and those of the Export-Import Bank as well, are being
put on a self-sustaining basis by aligning new credit extensions more closely
with collections on outstanding credits and by sales of portfolio assets.
The resulting reduction in net budget expenditures between 1959 and 1960
will be over $300 million for the Federal National Mortgage Association
and almost $250 million for the Export-Import Bank.
Fourth, the expiration on April 1, 1959 of the law providing for a temporary extension of the duration of unemployment compensation payments
will result in a decrease of over $400 million in expenditures in the fiscal
year 1960.
Fifth, the termination of the acreage reserve will reduce expenditures in
the fiscal year 1960 by more than $700 million, although a partially offsetting increase will occur in the conservation reserve program.
Sixth, proposals will be made for rate adjustments to cover the costs
of operating the postal establishment, except for specified public services;
these proposals will lower budget expenditures by $350 million. This reduction, together with nonrecurring items affecting budget expenditures in
the fiscal year 1959â€”retroactive pay increases and higher payments for
transportationâ€”account for the decrease of the postal deficit by $645 million
in the fiscal year 1960.
Seventh, the funding of retroactive pay increases to Federal civilian
employees, apart from the payments to postal employees mentioned above,
added some $250 million to expenditures. These payments were made
mainly in the fiscal year 1959 and do not recur in the new fiscal year.
Finally, expenditures of other Federal departments and agencies will
be reduced, to the extent that this is consistent with the satisfactory performance of their respective responsibilities.




49

Although the projected expenditures are lower in the aggregate, they
include increased outlays for many programs that support the growth of
our economy and assist growth elsewhere in the Free World. Outlays for
research and development will be increased over $600 million, with
emphasis on space exploration, peaceful as well as military uses of atomic
energy, and basic science. Federal expenditures to improve education,
especially in science and mathematics, will rise significantly. Federal
expenditures for the conservation and development of land and water
resources (including agricultural) will rise almost $200 million. All Federal
expenditures for civil public worksâ€”including grants to States, mainly
from the Highway Trust Fundâ€”will be increased $700 million; at $5.2
billion, they will be higher than ever before. Larger expenditures are
estimated for other grants and long-term loans to foster community development. Expenditures by the Federal Aviation Agency, primarily for the
construction and operation of new facilities for the Federal airways system,
will increase almost $100 million. Programs will be proposed for assistance
to areas where unemployment that is considerably above the national average persists, and for grants to localities for the modernization of airports;
however, the latter will not affect expenditures until after the fiscal year
1960. Higher expenditures are expected for economic and technical cooperation under the Mutual Security Program, but because of a reduction
in the military assistance portion, expenditures for this Program as a whole
will be decreased.
The revenues projected in the 1960 budget are substantially higher than
those estimated for the current fiscal year, reflecting the confident expectation that economic recovery will be extended into the calendar year 1959
and beyond.
Certain actions by the Congress are needed to give effect to the 1960
financial plan. First, changes are required in the laws affecting Federal
revenues: the corporate income tax and excise taxes on automobiles and
parts, cigarettes, distilled spirits, and wines and beer should be continued
at their present levels for one year beyond June 30, 1959; a temporary
increase in the Federal motor fuel tax should be enacted to continue construction of the Interstate Highway System on a self-sustaining basis; the tax
on aviation gasoline should be raised, and a similar rate for jet fuels, now tax
free, should be enacted, to help pay the Federal cost of operating the airways;
and a revision in postal rates should be authorized. The Congress has been
requested to enact a permanent plan for the taxation of life insurance companies, and it will be asked to adjust present laws relating to the taxation
of cooperatives. The Congress will also be requested to specify the treatment processes which shall be considered as mining for the purpose of
computing percentage depletion allowances in the case of mineral products.
This amendment, prompted by court decisions and similar to that recommended last year for cement and clay products, would prevent an unintended




extension of depletion allowances to the sales price of finished products.
Recommendations will also be made for certain additional user charges.
Second, the Congress will be requested to grant wider administrative
authority for setting maximum interest rates for various credit programs
and to make certain adjustments in rates. These include the Veterans
Administration programs of home loan guaranties and direct home loans,
the rental (including armed services) and cooperative housing programs
of the Federal Housing Administration (Sections 207, 803, and 213 of
the National Housing Act), the college housing program of the Housing
and Home Finance Agency, the loan program of the Rural Electrification
Administration,, and ship mortgage loans of the Maritime Administration.
The flow of private funds into home construction and other types of building is restricted when market interest rates are high relative to the legally
prescribed ceiling rates; as a result, the volume of construction is restricted
and an increased part of its financing is shifted to the Federal Government.
Third, improvements are needed in the procedures by which appropriation bills arc enacted into law. The Congress will be requested to grant
the President authority to veto, or reduce the amounts for, specific items in
appropriation bills and in other bills authorizing expenditures.
OTHER GOVERNMENTAL FINANCIAL POLICIES
Acceptance by the Congress of the expenditure level of the 1960 budget
would be the most important single step in discharging Government's responsibility to help preserve the stability of prices and costs through prudent
management of its own financial affairs. Moreover, adherence to the
proposed expenditure program would provide an opportunity, as budgetary
results improve with economic recovery, to promote economic growth by
making a start on constructive tax reduction and reform. The growth of
the American economy was significantly aided by the 1954 tax changes.
But our tax burden remains heavy, and in important respects Federal taxes
are levied in ways that tend to weaken the incentives on which we mainly
rely for vigorous economic expansion. If our economy grows at the expected
rate, and if Government spending is held within the limits set in the proposed budget, a significant additional step in tax reduction and reform
can be taken in the reasonably foreseeable future.
Federal debt management policies are also pertinent to the achievement
of sustainable economic growth without inflation. In the formulation of
these policies, account must be taken of the necessarily far-reaching impact on the economy of the continual refinancing of large parts of the
present debt of $283 billion, of which $228.5 billion is held by the public.
The magnitude of this refinancing problem is indicated by the fact that
$49 billion of the marketable debt outstanding at the end of 1958, exclusive
of $24 billion of 13- and 26-week Treasury bills, will mature in 1959. This




is in addition to the cash borrowing in the market required by seasonal
needs and by the redemption of nonmarketable debt.
Insofar as possible, financial requirements will be met in ways designed
to reduce the frequency of Treasury issues and to improve the structure
of the debt. By offering securities which are attractive to investors outside
the banks, particularly to savings institutions, pension funds, individuals,
and other long-term investors, the Treasury can avoid undue reliance on
bank credit and thus assist, rather than interfere with, the exercise of
monetary policies appropriate to the maintenance of sustainable economic
growth and price stability. The 4 percent bonds due in 1980 that were
announced in January 1959 are an example of such offerings.
As indicated in Chapter 2, a large part of the financing of the 1959
deficit had already been completed by the end of the calendar year 1958
without impairing the effectiveness of monetary policy. Completion of
needed financing will bring the public debt to $285 billion before June
30, 1959, and it will be necessary to renew the request made of the Congress
last summer for a permanent debt limit of $285 billionâ€”$2 billion higher
than at present. Adherence to the 1960 financial plan and receipt of
revenues as expected would obviate the need for a larger increase in the
permanent debt limit. But a temporary increase of an additional amount
will be needed to cover heavy borrowing requirements in the first half of
the next fiscal year. These borrowings would be repaid, however, before
June 30, 1960.
Finally, the maintenance of a framework of price stability requires the
avoidance of excessive extension of credit. Responsibility for monetary
and credit policies rests with the Federal Reserve authorities who have
independent status within Government. However, to help coordinate the
monetary and credit policies so determined with the economic and financial
policies of the Executive Branch of Government, frequent meetings of
principal officials have been held for the exchange of views. These meetings
have proved useful and will be continued.
ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS To MAINTAIN PRICE STABILITY
Adherence to the financial plan presented in the 1960 budget and the
pursuit of appropriate monetry, credit, and debt management policies
would help attain rising production and employment at stable prices.
Governmental actions in other areas can also help to maintain price stability
as our economy expands.
First, the Congress is requested to amend the Employment Act of 1946 to
make reasonable price stability an explicit goal of Federal economic policy,
coordinate with the goals of maximum production, employment, and purchasing power now specified in that Act. Such an amendment would
strengthen Government's hand in restraining inflationary forces and would




help build a public opinion favorable to the adoption and vigorous application of needed measures. This amendment would make it clear that
Government is as determined to direct its policies toward maintenance of
price stability as it is to employ them in combating economic contraction.
Second, a Cabinet Committee on Price Stability for Economic Growth is
being established to follow governmental and private activities affecting
costs, prices, and economic growth; initiate studies by Government or by
groups of private citizens of price stability in relation to economic growth;
seek ways to enhance productivity in the American economy and to build
a better public understanding of the need for reasonable price stability in a
free society and of the conditions necessary to achieve this objective.
Third, a Committee on Government Activities Affecting Prices and Costs
is being established, to follow the operation of all relevant Federal programs,
including those involving procurement, construction, stockpiling, and commodity price support, and to make recommendations to the appropriate
departments or agencies or to the President for the administration of these
programs in line with the objective of reasonable price stability.
Fourth, questions concerning the level and movement of consumer prices,
changes in wage rates and earnings, and changes in productivity have assumed such significance in our economy as to require more and better statistics concerning them. Accordingly, the Bureau of the Budget has been
requested to accelerate programs for enlargement and improvement of
public information on prices, wages and related costs, and productivity.
ADDITIONAL MEASURES FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH
The Federal policies and actions outlined above will do much to assure
a vigorous growth of our economy, free from inflation. However, additional
measures should be taken by Government to promote the Nation's economic
strength and well-being.
Competition
The vitality of our economic system depends in large part on vigorous
competition, which would be enhanced by certain improvements in our
antitrust laws. The Congress is urged to act favorably on five proposals, as
follows: to authorize Federal regulation of the merger of banking institutions
accomplished through the acquisition of assets; to require notification to the
antitrust agencies when firms of significant size that are engaged in interstate commerce propose to merge; to grant the Attorney General power
to issue civil investigative demands under which the necessary facts may
be elicited when civil procedures are contemplated in antitrust cases; to
make cease-and-desist orders issued by the Federal Trade Commission for
violations of the Clayton Act final unless appealed to the courts; and to
authorize the Federal Trade Commission to seek preliminary injunctions
in merger cases where a violation of law is likely.

Small Business
Legislative actions taken last year will greatly enlarge the opportunities
for the formation of new businesses and yield important benefits to existing
small concerns and to the economy generally. To facilitate the access of
small business concerns to capital and credit, the Small Business Administration was made permanent; its loan authorization was substantially
increased; and it was authorized to help State and local development companies extend financial and other aids to small businesses, and to license
and purchase the obligations of investment companies especially organized
to provide capital on a long-term debt and equity basis to small businesses.
Small concerns may also be expected to benefit from certain changes in
the tax laws enacted by the last Congress. These include ordinary-loss
rather than capital-loss treatment for losses incurred on the investment of
private funds in small business investment companies; similar treatment
of losses incurred by small business investment companies or by an original
investor in a small business concern (up to a limited amount) ; allowance
to small business investment companies of a 100 percent tax deduction for
intercorporate dividends received, rather than the 85 percent generally
permitted; provision of an additional depreciation allowance for the acquisition of new and used tangible personal property; the option for certain
small corporations of having their profits taxed directly, as if they were
partnerships; the option to pay estate taxes over a period of up to 10 years,
where the estate consists largely of investments in closely held business concerns; extension of the carryback of net operating losses from two to three
years; and an increase, from $60,000 to $100,000, in the minimum
accumulated earnings credit.
Other steps taken in 1958 include an Act to improve the opportunities of
small business concerns in obtaining Government procurement contracts,
and a new program of the Small Business Administration to facilitate the
sharing by small companies in Government research and development
contracts.
The Cabinet Committee on Small Business, which was established in
1956, continues to follow closely the position of small firms in the economy.
A recommendation made by the Committee in its Second Progress Report
is called to the attention of the Congress for favorable action, namely that
the Securities and Exchange Act be amended to extend the privilege of
the simplified Regulation A filings to a wider range of security issues.
Although significant benefits for small business concerns may be expected
from the actions already taken and from those proposed, the long-run health
of small concerns also requires an environment of satisfactory labor-management relations and opportunities to retain a larger share of business earnings. The first of these conditions would be advanced by enactment of
the proposals made below for changes in legislation governing labor-management relations. The second would be advanced by adherence to the
expenditure level proposed in the budget for the fiscal year 1960, which




54

would bring closer the time when additional steps can be taken to make our
tax system more conducive to economic growth.
Personal Welfare
Substantial progress has been made by the States in recent years in raising
the standards of the unemployment insurance system. Benefits have been
increased and their potential duration lengthened. Coverage has been
broadened to include more than four-fifths of all employees in nonagricultural establishments.
Still further improvements are necessary and desirable. Enactment of
legislation is requested to provide for extending the coverage of the system
to employees of firms having fewer than four workers; to make its benefits
available to employees of Federal instrumentalities, nonprofit organizations,
and certain other groups; to bring the provisions of the District of Columbia
system up to those recommended for the States; and to provide for extending
the system to workers in Puerto Rico. Benefits should be raised so that the
majority of covered workers will be eligible for payments equal to at least
half their regular earnings; and the maximum duration of benefits should
be lengthened to 26 weeks for any person who qualifies for any benefit and
who remains unemployed that long.
These steps would greatly enhance the contribution that the unemployment compensation system makes to our economy's capacity to resist
recession. During the recent recession, this system offset directly about onethird of the decline in wage and salary payments. Supplemented by temporary legislation providing longer duration of eligibility for employees who
exhausted their entitlement to benefits, unemployment insurance payments
substantially alleviated hardships arising from loss of income.
In an industrial economy, occupational accidents may result in hardship
for an employee and his dependents. It is therefore again recommended
that the States, which have primary responsibility, strengthen their systems
of workmen's compensation.
Certain legislative improvements are required in programs that lie within
Federal jurisdiction. Proposals will be made to the Congress to extend
the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Favorable consideration is
again requested for legislation to revise the ambiguous and outmoded provisions of the 8-hour laws applying to Federal and federally assisted construction projects and to carry out the principle of equal pay for equal work
without discrimination based on sex.
The Economic Report of 1958 outlined the responsibility of the Government to maintain a framework of laws to protect the basic rights of
the individual, to promote integrity in labor-management relationships,
and to foster better industrial relations. Proposed legislation to accomplish these purposes having failed of enactment, the Congress will again
be requested to require reporting and disclosure of financial dealings
between employers and employee representatives and their agents, and to




55

require public reports of union finances, organization, and procedures.
Requested legislation will also prescribe standards to promote democratic
procedures in union affairs, including the election of union officers, and
to correct abuses in the supervision of the affairs of subordinate bodies.
Modifications will be proposed in the law governing secondary boycotts,
organizational and recognition picketing, and representation elections, and
authority will be requested for the States to act in labor-management disputes where the National Labor Relations Board declines jurisdiction. Legislation will also be requested to correct shortcomings in the Welfare and
Pension Plans Disclosure Act enacted by the 85th Congress.
Area Assistance
Despite the forward economic strides of the Nation since the war, some
communities have suffered substantial and persistent unemployment, when
measured against national experience. Federal assistance to these communities is required not only to mitigate the hardships of individuals and
families but also to provide for the use of underutilized resources, to the
enhancement of the national welfare.
A program of assistance through development loans and through grants
for technical studies will be recommended to the Congress in order that these
communities may share in the general economic advance. By design and
administration, the program would seek to complement and reinforce community efforts to help themselves, to encourage maximum participation by
State and local agencies and private investment institutions, and to create
new job opportunities instead of merely transferring jobs from one locality
to another.
The program would also provide technical aid to towns heavily dependent
on a major industry and to rural low-income areas, to help them achieve
greater economic stability through diversification.
Agriculture
Recommendations will be made to the Congress by the Executive with a
view to reducing the cost of price stabilization operations, stopping the
increase of surplus stocks, and making progress in the reduction of accumulated supplies. Major revisions are overdue in the legislation relating to
these agricultural programs. In their present form, these statutes have the
effect of adding many billions of dollars annually to the Federal budget. Net
budget expenditures for agricultural price and income support increased
from an annual average of $3.5 billion during the fiscal years 1955-58 to
an estimated $5.4 billion in the fiscal year 1959.
What is more, experience has demonstrated that it is very difficult to
foretell reliably how much the Federal Government will be required to
expend in a given fiscal period under what are essentially open-end commitments for price support, a fact that greatly complicates the management
of the Federal Government's fiscal affairs.




56

Even these large expenditures have not brought farm output into line
with commercial demands at home and abroad while maintaining and
stabilizing farm income. Ever since the Korean conflict, the aggregate
output of our farms has exceeded these demands by subs antial amounts.
Steps taken to reduce surpluses while protecting farm incomesâ€”Commodity
Credit Corporation support of prices at slightly declining minimum levels,
retirement of acreage from cultivation, and large exports under loan or
subsidy arrangementsâ€”have not succeeded in preventing an increase in
surplus stocks. By June 30, 1959, there will be a record carryover of 1.3
billion bushels of wheat, the equivalent of more than 2 years of domestic
requirements, and a carryover of 1.8 billion bushels of corn. Stocks of
cotton remain excessive; stocks of tobacco and rice are large; and if it were
not for the surplus disposal program, stocks of dairy products and of fats
and oils would be high.
The investment of the Commodity Credit Corporation in price supported
commodities is expected to rise to more than $9 billion by June 30, 1959,
and to almost $10.5 billion by June 30, 1960. To carry out existing commitments on price support activities will probably require use of most of the
Corporation's borrowing authority of $14.5 billion. Expenditures of the
Federal Government for storage, transportation, and interest on these surplus holdings are estimated at $850 million for the fiscal year 1959 and at
$1.2 billion for the fiscal year 1960.
The recent sharp increase in the cost of our agricultural programs is due
in part to exceptionally favorable crop conditions in 1958. But a major
part of the increase is due to the programs themselves. These are not
properly adjusted to the rapidity with which farm technology is improving.
Remedial legislation should be enacted without delay. Even though action
taken at this time can become effective only in the fiscal year 1961, steps to
bring the price stabilization expenditures of the Federal Government under
control and to reduce them materially are urgently needed.
Actually, the majority of farm people derive little or no benefit from our
agricultural price support legislation. Cattle ranchers, producers of poultry
and eggs, and growers of fruits and vegetables operate their farms today
practically without price supports. Only some 1.5 million of our commercial
farmers are the recipients of price support outlays in any material amounts,
and, within this group, those with the higher incomes are the main beneficiaries. More than 2.5 million farmersâ€”whose annual sales are less than
$2,500 and who produce each year only about 9 percent of our marketed
farm productsâ€”receive only very small supplements, or none at all, to their
incomes from Government expenditures for price support.
Foreign Economic Policy
Next to maintaining the mutual security of the Free World, the chief
concern of the United States in its foreign economic policy is to promote
conditions favorable to the exchange of goods, services, technology, and




57

capital among nations, and to assist in economic growth and development. The efforts to rebuild and expand the economy of Western Europe
and Japan, to which we have contributed so much, have met with remarkable success. We can now look forward to increasingly effective participation by the industrial nations of Europe in the task of supplying credit
and investment capital, along with goods and services, to the less developed
areas of the world.
The United States will continue to share with friendly nations its advanced technology and the achievements of its scientific research in public
health, resource development, agriculture, industry, and commerce. This
policy will be continued through our technical assistance programs, as well
as through international agencies.
The impressive gains of the European economies have been accompanied
by efforts at removing hindrances to foreign trade. At the end of 1958,
the leading European countries made their currencies convertible for nonresidents. Simultaneously, the European Payments Union was replaced
by the European Monetary Agreement, which had been prepared by the
Organization for European Economic Cooperation several years earlier,
to become effective when currency convertibility measures were taken.
Although these countries have not given up their foreign exchange control,
their step implies the intention of proceeding further with the removal of
discriminatory controls and other import restrictions, beyond the liberalization measures adopted in recent months by the United Kingdom, France,
and others.
The European Economic Community of six continental countries, which
came into existence on January 1, 1958, has lowered duties by 10 percent
and liberalized quota restrictions as a first move in connection with the
development of its common market. Some of these concessions have been
extended to other countries.
The United States is favorably disposed toward such regional reduction
and eventual elimination of trade barriers; but as a signatory to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it insists on the principle that such regional
arrangements must lead to the creation of more favorable trade relations
with other countries. The new authority provided by the Congress last year
by the four-year extension of the Trade Agreements Act will be used in
further efforts to reduce trade barriers on a reciprocal basis, and the enlarged
loan authority of the Export-Import Bank will promote United States
exports as well as contribute to economic growth abroad.
The increasing participation of other industrial countries in financing the
flow of trade and the development of industrially retarded countries is reassuring and welcome, inasmuch as additional economic resources are thus
brought into action. However, the task of financing sound and sustainable
economic development in large areas of Latin America, Africa, and Asia
is of such scope and urgency that it requires joint efforts. In this connec-




tion, the Government of the United States, together with other members of
the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is proposing that the resources of those institutions be enlarged. Special legislation will be proposed to the Congress.
The United States is exploring the feasibility of cooperating with other
countries in their efforts to establish regional agreements on freer trade
and economic development. An inter-American development banking
institution is under consideration. The United States has also expressed
its readiness to support a regional Arab development institution, should the
Arab states desire it and support it with their own capital. Also under
study is an International Development Association, which would be affiliated
with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and
would extend to less developed countries loans repayable wholly or partially
in the currency of the borrowing country. Requests for authorizations for
some of these programs will be submitted in due time to the Congress.
The Development Loan Fund, which began in 1958 to extend loans for
economic growth in less developed countries, needs additional obligational
authority.
Authorization for sales of surplus agricultural commodities for foreign
currency under Title I of Public Law 480 and for the donation of such
commodities for famine relief and other assistance under Title II expires
December 31, 1959. In view of the continued existence of heavy surpluses
of farm products and the desirability of using such stocks constructively, the
authority should be extended.
CONTINUING PROGRAMS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND IMPROVEMENT
The need for new programs or for legislative changes in those already
in existence should not cause us to neglect the contributions to economic improvement that are made by continuing programs that return to the attention of the Congress only with respect to the amount of funds they annually
require or for occasional legislative revision.
Under the 1960 budget, the Federal Government will continue activities
which will strengthen the Nation in health, education, scientific development, transportation, and other important areas. The Federal Government's efforts will, of course, be supplemented by the efforts of State and
local governments and by countless private undertakings. This blend of
public and private action will enable us to take full advantage of the
opportunities that lie before us for an improvement in the level of living.
Nowhere are these opportunities more plainly registered than in recent
Census Bureau projections of population growth, which has proved a sure
avenue of economic progress in American circumstances. The lowest of
these new projections indicates a rise to 202.5 million persons by 1970,
from the present 175 million; the highest, a rise to 219.5 million. The
corresponding estimates for 1975 are 215.8 million and 243.9 million.




59

Projections for selected age groups suggest the magnitude of the developing demand for schooling. By mid-1962, children of elementary school age
(5-13 years) should number about 34.5 million, 3.3 million more than the
corresponding total for mid-1958; and the annual growth of this group
may exceed 1 million during the remainder of the 1960's. The number
of children of high school age (14-17 years), which was about 10.6 million
in mid-1958, may increase to 12.9 million by mid-1962 and to 15.9 million
by mid-1970. By 1962, the number of college-age persons (18-21) may
be about 10.7 million; in 1975, about 16.3 million, or twice the 1957 figure.
Education
To discharge fully their traditional obligation to the younger generation,
State and local governments will obviously have to increase their efforts
greatly to provide needed school buildings, equipment, and teachers, particularly for secondary education. State and private institutions will have
to do likewise to accommodate greater numbers of college and graduate
students.
In the areas of secondary and higher education, additional support is being
requested for the science and education programs administered by the
National Science Foundation and the Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare. Projected expenditures of the first of these agencies for science
education during the fiscal year 1960 are almost one-fifth greater than the
estimated expenditures for 1959 and four times the 1958 outlay. The increased expenditures would be made for graduate and faculty fellowships
and for training high school and college teachers of science and mathematics.
Further Federal assistance to secondary and higher education is provided
under the National Defense Education Act of 1958, through contributions to
student loan funds; matching grants to States for equipment needed in teaching science, mathematics, and foreign languages; fellowships for graduate
study; grants to States for guidance, counseling, and testing services; and
support of training programs for foreign language teachers. Two other
important features of the Act are the authorization of Federal financial
assistance to States for improving educational statistics, and the authorization of a unit in the Federal Government to provide or arrange for
abstracting, translating, and other services to improve the distribution
of scientific information.
Personal Security and Health
Programs designed to enhance personal security also contribute to the
Nation's economic strength and well-being. Protection from want in old
age, for families losing breadwinners, and for persons permanently disabled
is afforded by the Federal Social Security system. Broadening of the coverage of the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program in recent
years to nearly 90 percent of all persons in paid employment, together with




60

the normal increase in the number of persons eligible for benefits, has increased benefit payments from $5.7 billion in 1956 to $7.3 billion in 1957, and
to an annual rate of $8.9 billion at the end of 1958. The increase in 1958
played an important role in helping to maintain the flow of incomes during
recession. Benefits are currently being paid to more than 12 million persons,
and the average monthly benefit for old age is approximately $66. Amendments adopted in 1958 increased benefit amounts, which had been practically unchanged since 1954, by 7 percent, effective in January 1959.
Taxes were also increased in order to strengthen the actuarial basis of
the program.
Federal contributions to State-operated public assistance programs in
behalf of the aged, the blind, the disabled, and dependent children will
continue to rise in fiscal year 1960. An Advisory Council authorized by
recent legislation is studying the appropriate distribution of financial responsibility between the Federal Government and the States.
Through the Rural Development Program initiated in 1955 and carried
forward through existing agencies under the guidance of an interagency
committee of the Federal Government, efforts are being made to aid farm
families most in need of assistance. The program now reaches more than
100 rural counties. Beneficial results in the form of increased job opportunities, improved farm practices, and higher standards of living are already
evident.
In the area of health, sharply increasing outlays have been made in recent
years for the medical research and training programs administered by the National Institutes of Health in the Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare. Sizable funds have also been expended to assist the construction of hospitals and health research facilities. Expenditures will increase
further in the fiscal year 1960. The budget also provides larger sums for
the enforcement of the food and drug laws, including administration of the
new chemical additives amendment enacted in 1958.
Construction and Transportation
The increase in population and changes in the location patterns of people
and industry will require greater public and private investment in fields
other than education. The formation of new families and the continuing
movement from cities will require additional residential construction and
places of worship and commercial and community facilities of all kinds,
including utilities. Responsibility for these undertakings rests largely on
private individuals and firms, but Government programs of loan insurance
and guaranty make an important contribution to home construction. The
effectiveness of these programs would be materially increased by favorable
action on the proposals made to the Congress to grant greater discretionary
authority to the Executive for determining maximum interest rates on certain insured, guaranteed, and direct loans. Other proposals for changes




61

in present laws affecting housing and home financing and the program of
Federal assistance to urban renewal projects will be made to the Congress.
Construction of Federal-aid highways, which form a vital part of the network of roads connecting our cities, is increasing rapidly. The interstate
highway program, enacted in 1956, authorizes construction of 41,000 miles
of limited-access roads linking 90 percent of all cities with 50,000 or more
inhabitants, as well as many smaller places along the way. The Federal
share of the cost is financed out of revenues obtained from highway users.
Proposals are being made to keep the program on this self-supporting basis.
In the calendar year 1958, total capital outlays for Federal-aid and all other
new highway construction reached $6.2 billion, about $600 million more
than in 1957 and about three and one-half times the outlay of a decade ago.
Still higher expenditures may be expected in the present calendar year and
in several succeeding years.
Recent legislation will also strengthen the air, rail, and waterway components of the Nation's transportation system. A unified Federal Aviation
Agency will allocate air space, develop and operate a common system
of navigation facilities for civil and military aircraft, and make and enforce
safety regulations for civilian aviation. The Transportation Act of 1958
and the repeal of Federal excise taxes on the transportation of property,
also enacted last year, will help improve the physical and financial condition
of the railroads.
The St. Lawrence Seaway, which will open in the spring, will provide
deep water transportation almost half-way across the continent, reducing
shipping costs and directly serving eight States that have almost two-fifths
of the population and constitute the agricultural and industrial heart of the
land. User tolls will make the Seaway, constructed with Federal funds
in a joint venture with the Canadian Government, a self-liquidating project.
Water Projects and Mineral Exploration
Many public and private programs are improving the Nation's base of
material resources. Water and related power projects under way will
facilitate the economic development of the Western states. Federal expenditures for such projects are much higher than they were a few years
ago, and further increases are expected in 1960 and 1961. Progress toward
economical conversion of saline to fresh water by chemical and other techniques will be assisted by 1958 legislation for the construction of demonstration plants and by increased appropriations for the fiscal years 1959 and
1960. Other contributions to the resource base are envisaged. In 1958,
legislation authorized a continuing program of assistance to minerals exploration. The Congress is requested to enact a long-range program for
conservation of the Nation's supply of helium gas, encouraging maximum
private participation in, and financing of, this endeavor.




Research and Development
The Nation's technological base is being strengthened by Government programs in support of scientific research and development. Many of these
programs, though undertaken initially or primarily to maintain the Nation's
military might, contribute increasingly to peaceful technology. Thus, the
billions of dollars spent annually for military research and development are
extending the horizons of civilian industry, providing experience for professional and other skilled workers, and expanding private opportunities for
investment in new materials, processes, and products.
The benefits to be derived from research and development activities can
be enhanced by closer working relations between Government and private
interests. Large companies and universities already participate extensively
in Government contract or Government-supported research, supplementing
the substantial endeavors conducted on their own account. The research
capabilities of small companies are necessarily limited, but many small
firms have formal programs under way and some have achieved notable success. Explicit provision for the encouragement of researchâ€”direct and
Government contractâ€”by small businesses was made in the 1958 revision
of the Small Business Act.
Most current research and development activity involves the useful application of known principles rather than the search for new avenues of fundamental advance. Greater attention can appropriately be given by private
enterprise to the advantages obtainable from basic research. Meanwhile,
Government expenditures for basic research are rising. For all agencies,
they will amount to about $500 million in the fiscal year 1960. In the same
year, expenditures by the National Science Foundation for basic research
will be about one-third above the figure for 1959 and more than double
that for 1958.
In the field of atomic energy, important strides have been taken toward
the adaptation of military technology to peaceful uses. A full-scale prototype atomic power reactor was operated in 1958, and other plants, of commercial size, are being planned and built under cooperative industry-Government arrangements. The wider industrial, agricultural, and medical use
of radioisotopes and radiation sources is being stimulated. Incentives are
being provided to private organizations for the commercial undertaking of
activities heretofore performed only by the Government. Technical and
financial assistance is being given to the European Atomic Energy Community, and through bilateral agreements to separate nations, in the development of power reactors and provision of small-scale reactors for research
and training. Other efforts are being made through the International
Atomic Energy Agency and through diplomatic negotiations to realize more
fully for the world the peaceful possibilities inherent in nuclear fission. And
progress is being made in cooperative international research on the generation of electric power by the controlled release of fusion energyâ€”a project
which, if successful, promises great benefits to mankind.

REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT ON THE




ACTIVITIES OF THE COUNCIL
OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS
DURING 1958




Letter of Transmittal
DECEMBER 30, 1958.
The PRESIDENT.
SIR: The Council of Economic Advisers submits this Annual Report for
calendar year 1958 in accordance with the requirements of Congress, as
set forth in Section 4 (d) of the Employment Act of 1946.
Respectfully,




RAYMOND J. SAULNIER, Chairman.

Report to the President on the Activities of the
Council of Economic Advisers During 1958
The Council's attention in the early months of 1958 was focused largely
on measures to help arrest the economic decline; after April, attention was
directed increasingly to measures that would help promote a sound recovery
in the economy and a high and sustainable rate of long-term expansion.
Through its Chairman, the Council kept the President informed of economic developments and their policy and program implications. The
Chairman attended all Cabinet meetings and reported frequently to the
Cabinet on economic developments and policy. The Chairman also attended, on direction of the President, all meetings of the National Security
Council at which economic questions were discussed.
The Council was called upon frequently during the year to appraise
proposals for legislative or administrative actions, with special regard to the
effect they might have on the growth and stability of the economy. Through
its membership on interdepartmental committees and task forces, and
through frequent consultation with Government and private agencies, the
Council participated in the formulation of policies affecting economic
growth and stability. A Council member serves on the Council on Foreign
Economic Policy and the Civil and Defense Mobilization Board. The
Chairman of the Council is also Chairman of the Cabinet Committee on
Small Business and serves on the President's Special Committee on Financial Policies for Postattack Operations. Council staff members serve on
ad hoc committees of the latter committee. The Council conferred frequently with the State Department on foreign economic questions, and its
senior staff economist on international economic matters attended most
meetings of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and
Financial Problems.
The Council participated in a number of international meetings during
the year and continued its cooperation with various international agencies.
In April a member of the staff participated in the Thirteenth Plenary
Session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe held in
Geneva, Switzerland; and a member of the Council, accompanied by
senior staff economists, attended two meetings under the auspices of the
Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) in Paris. In
July, the Council submitted a Survey of Economic Developments in the
United States for the Annual Review of the OEEC; and in February, it
submitted responses to the United Nations' annual questionnaire on eco-




75

nomic developments and policies. In December, a member of the Council
staff participated in a meeting of the "Economic Experts" group of the
OEEC, held in Paris. Two members of the staff met frequently with
foreign groups studying in this country under the auspices of the International Cooperation Administration.
During the year, the Council met with representatives of business concerns, financial houses, and consumer organizations, and representatives of
farm and other groups to discuss business conditions, the economic outlook,
and policy questions relating to the economy's growth and stability. The
Chairman participated in the semiannual meetings of the Business Advisory
Council of the Department of Commerce, and a staff member attended
meetings of the technical consultants to that body.
In accordance with the Employment Act, the Council assisted the President in the preparation of the annual Economic Report. This Report, which
is transmitted to the Congress in January, reviews the economic developments of the past year, including the steps taken by Government to promote
the economy's growth and stability; appraises the current position of the
economy and the outlook for the year ahead; and makes recommendations
to the Congress and suggestions to the States, local communities, and private groups for actions and policies to help-achieve the goals set forth in the
Employment Act. It also includes an extensive appendix of statistical information bearing on the United States economy.
Twenty-nine thousand copies of the January 1958 Economic Report of
the President were published, of which half were sold to the public through
the Superintendent of Documents. Copies were supplied to all members
of the Congress and were made available to depository libraries throughout
the country.
The Council also prepares Economic Indicators, a monthly compendium
of current economic statistics. This widely used periodical is published by
the Joint Economic Committee of the Congress. Like the Economic Report of the President, it is distributed to all members of the Congress and
to depository libraries. An additional 6,500 copies of Economic Indicators
go to paying subscribers.
Council Membership
The present members of the Council are Raymond J. Saulnier, Paul W.
McCracken, and Karl Brandt.
Dr. Saulnier, Professor of Economics on leave from Barnard College,
Columbia University, and from the National Bureau of Economic Research,
where he is Director of the Financial Research Program, has served as a
consultant to the Council from 1953 to 1955, as a member of the Council
since April 1955, and as Chairman since December 1956.
Dr. McCracken, Professor of Business Conditions on leave from the
School of Business Administration, University of Michigan, has served as




a member of the Council since December 1956 and previously as a member
of the senior staff.
Dr. Brandt was designated a member of the Council, on an interim
appointment basis, in November 1958. He is Professor of Agricultural
Economics on leave from Stanford University, where he is Associate
Director of the Food Research Institute. Dr. Brandt's name will be transmitted to the Senate for confirmation when the Congress convenes in January 1959.
Joseph S. Davis, Professor Emeritus of Stanford University and formerly
Director of the Food Research Institute at tjiat University, resigned his
membership on the Council in October 1958. Dr. Davis had served as
a member of the Council from May 2, 1955.
Council Staff
The Council has a staff of 29 persons, of whom 14 are senior economists
and statisticians. Each senior staff member is assigned one or more areas for
special attention, and cooperates with other Government agencies and with
business, labor, and other private groups in analyzing and evaluating economic developments. Two of the members are on leave from university
faculties; all others are permanent employees. Supplementing its fulltime staff, several university economists serve the Council occasionally as
consultants. The present members of the senior staff are Bernard S. Beckler,
Henry W. Briefs (on leave, Georgetown University), Samuel L. Brown,
Robert C. Colwell, Frances M. James, Marshall A. Kaplan, Hal B. Lary,
David W. Lusher, John A. Schnittker (on leave, Kansas State College),
Charles L. Schultze, Irving H. Siegel, Walter F. Stettner, Collis Stocking,
and Charles A. TafT.
Advisory Board on Economic Growth and Stability

I. Employment and Earnings
Recession and recovery in 1957 and 1958 were clearly reflected in the
Nation's labor markets. Employment declined sharply in late 1957 and
early 1958. Recovery began in May and continued through the end of the
year. Unemployment, which had increased to the highest levels since World
War II, declined significantly after August 1958. Unemployment benefits,
particularly in view of the longer duration of eligibility made possible by
special temporary legislative action, played a major part in counteracting the
reduction of wage income. Despite the fall of employment and the rise of
unemployment, wage rates and hourly earnings continued to advance.
Real weekly earnings declined through April, but recovered as the workweek
was lengthened and as prices stabilized. Though infrequent for most of
the year, labor disputes increased sharply in late autumn.
EMPLOYMENT
Total employment in nonagricultural establishments, as estimated from
employers' payroll records, began to recede in August 1957, and by April
1958 it had fallen by 2.4 million, seasonally adjusted. Four-fifths of the
reduction was in manufacturing, mining, and transportation, although these
industries account for only two-fifths of nonfarm employment. The decline
was halted in April, and employment began to rise moderately in May. The
expansion continued to the end of the year, although delayed in October and
November by labor disputes. In December, employment on nonfarm payrolls was 50.7 million, an increase of 700,000 from the April low figure.
Part of the decline of nonfarm payroll employment during the recession
was due to less extensive dual jobholding and to reduced labor turnover,
as well as to the fall in the number of employed persons. Monthly estimates of the Bureau of the Census based upon household sample surveys
indicated a drop of 1.3 million from July 1957 to April 1958 in the number
of persons having nonfarm wage and salary jobs as their primary activity,
compared with a total reduction of 2.4 million estimated by the Bureau
of Labor Statistics from employer payroll records. All of this difference
cannot be accounted for, but part of it is doubtless due to the fact that
persons holding two jobs, or moving from one job to another and therefore
receiving pay from more than one employer, are counted only once in the
household surveys but twice in the payroll records. The smaller decline of
the Census estimates thus in part reflects the lessened dual jobholding and
reduced labor turnover shown by other surveys.




81

Employment began to recede in several important industrial sectors
before the general downturn in business that started after the middle of
1957. Moderate reductions commenced in the construction industry, in
transportation, and in nondurable manufacturing as early as the middle
of 1956, and in durable goods manufacturing after the end of that year.
However, until mid-1957, these declines were more than offset by continued increases in nonmanufacturing sectors, especially in trade, in State
and local government, and in financial and service industries. But in the
late summer of 1957, reductions appeared in mining, communications, and
trade, and the downward trend in employment in construction continued.

By the fourth quarter, the contraction had become quite general, and
it was accelerating in most manufacturing industries, with particularly
sharp reductions in firms producing primary metals, transportation equipment, and machinery. Steeper declines took place in the first quarter of
1958 in transportation and in construction. In financial and service industries, on the other hand, the hitherto steadily rising employment trend
merely leveled out for several months, and in State and local governments,
the strong employment uptrend was completely unaffected by the recession
(Table C-l).
Employment cutbacks were heaviest for hourly-rated production jobs in
manufacturing industries. The number of such jobs declined by 1.5
million, or 12 percent, from July 1957 to April 1958, while "nonproduction"
or salaried jobs declined by 100,000, or about 3 percent. The recovery of
manufacturing employment since late spring has been due almost entirely
to an expansion of production work; salaried employment has risen only
slightly since that time.
The occupational groups in general civilian employment that were most
affected by the recession were operatives and related workers, and craftsmen and foremen (Table C-2). The employment of professional and
technical personnel, which has followed a strong upward trend in recent
years, continued to increase, rising by 400,000, or around 7 percent, between
1957 and 1958.
Contraction of employment was very rapid in the early months of 1958,
and was aggravated by especially unfavorable weather in February and
March. Some signs of recovery appeared in April, however, as the number
of jobs began to increase in construction and firmed in nondurable manufacturing. In late spring and summer, the recovery spread to durable
goods manufacturing, trade, and service and financial enterprises, and by

August employment was expanding moderately in most of the principal
sectors of the economy.
Extensive work stoppages in the automotive and other hard goods manufacturing industries retarded the increase of employment in the final quarter
of the year. The number of employees involved in labor disputes, which had
remained very low until September, rose abruptly to more than 500,000 late
in that month, rose further to 525,000 in October, and was 300,000 in
November. These stoppages substantially afTected the recovery of employment in the final quarter of the year through their indirect effects on supplying industries, as well as by their immediate impact on the workers and
firms directly involved.
Employment in agriculture, where trends are especially difficult to
estimate over short periods, appears to have been unaffected by the
recession. The Department of Agriculture estimates that total employment
on farms was virtually unchanged in 1958. The Census Bureau, using
different definitions and procedures, reports farm employment reduced by
6 percent from 1957 to 1958 (Tables D-17 and D-65).
UNEMPLOYMENT
Unemployment, which for two years had fluctuated narrowly around
2.8 million, or 4.2 percent of the civilian labor force, began to rise moderately, after adjustment for seasonal factors, in the third quarter of 1957.
As employment fell more sharply toward the end of the year, and as the
labor force continued to grow, unemployment increased more rapidly and
in April 1958 exceeded 5 million. This high level of unemployment, seasonally adjusted, persisted until September, when substantial reductions
began. By December 1958, unemployment had declined to 4.1 million, a
seasonally adjusted rate of 6.1 percent of the labor force.
The 4.0 to 4.4 percent ratio of unemployment to the civilian labor
force that prevailed from the summer of 1955 to the third quarter of 1957
was considerably higher than that which prevailed before the onset of the
1953-54 recession, and was somewhat higher than before the downturn in
1948. The reductions of employment in 1957 and early 1958 resulted^
therefore, in rates of unemployment higher than those reached in the two
prior recessions since World War II. However, both the recovery of
employment and significant reductions of unemployment commenced relatively earlier than in 1949 or in 1954; in December, the rate of unemployment was not much different from that in the corresponding period of the
1948-50 recession and recovery, although still above the rate of the 1953-54
period.
A large part of the unemployed are a swiftly changing group, during
recession as well as in more prosperous times. Although total unemployment rose steeply from December 1957 to April 1958, an average of a
million or more previously jobless workers were able to find work each
month. However, about three-fifths of those unemployed in any month




were still unemployed in the following month, and slower rates of hiring
and rising layoffs rapidly increased the number of those out of work 15
weeks or more, from 490,000 at the outset of the recession to 1.9 million
in April 1958. In September 1958, the recall of workers who had been
laid off in manufacturing industries brought the first significant reduction
of long-term unemployment. Substantial reductions, after allowance for
seasonal factors, continued in the final months of the year.
Because the decline in unemployment was most severe in durable goods
manufacturing and related industries, the impact upon the working population was quite uneven. Of the total increase of 2.4 million jobless persons
from April 1957 to April 1958, by far the greater part were men, their
numbers rising by 1.7 million, or 93 percent. Men from 20 to 34 years of
age were especially affected, and the rate of unemployment for married
men living with their familiesâ€”that is, for those most likely to be strongly
attached to the labor forceâ€”rose from 2.3 percent in July 1957 to.a peak
of 6.5 percent in March 1958. In the spring and summer, employment opportunities improved, and the rate of unemployment diminished for heads
of families to 4.8 percent by the end of the year. Unemployment among
women also rose substantially, but not to the same extent as among men.
Durable goods manufacturing industries accounted for about one-third of
the total rise of the jobless, and rates of unemployment among durable goods
workers reached 12 percent in April 1958; they were especially high in
industries manufacturing primary metals and transportation equipment,
rising to 13 percent and 14 percent, respectively. Large increases also
occurred in the railroad industry, in mining, and in construction. Service
industries, government, and public utilities were least affected.
The uneven effect of the recession on the different areas of the country
is shown by the statistics of insured unemployment (Table C-3). By April
1958, rates of insured unemployment were 7 percent or more in New England, many of the Middle Atlantic and North Central States, and California, and were more than double the rates in the previous year. In Michigan, Ohio, and West Virginia, the rates had at least tripled. In several
Southern and Western States, however, insured unemployment remained
below 5 percent of covered employment. Of the Nation's 145 principal
labor market areas, the number having "substantial labor surpluses" increased from 21 in July 1957 to 86 by July 1958 and then declined to 80
in November, according to surveys by the Bureau of Employment Security.
However, reduced unemployment and an improved employment outlook
were evident in ?1 labor market areas during the second half of the year.
More than four-fifths of nonagricultural wage and salary workers are
covered by the system of unemployment insurance. Consequently, benefit
payments increased rapidly during the recession and partially compensated
for the wage loss to the employee and his family. While the provisions of
the unemployment insurance system still fall short of the President's recommendations, unemployment benefit payments rose from an annual rate

(seasonally adjusted) of $1.7 billion in July 1957 to $4.3 billion in April
1958, thus directly offsetting nearly one-third of the decline in total wage
and salary payments, and providing benefits for the laid-off employee averaging $30 to $37 per week in the principal industrial states. Private supplementary unemployment benefit plans, which raised the level of benefits
for the unemployed in certain industries, also helped to maintain incomes.
As in earlier recessions, the number of beneficiaries exhausting their
regular entitlement to benefits began to rise rapidly a few months after the
onset of recession. Starting at 82,000 per month in September 1957, these
exhaustions increased to a peak of 285,000 in July 1958. Legislation recommended by the President and enacted by the Congress provided, by
means of agreements with the States, for the payment of benefits for additional periods to persons still unemployed who had exhausted their regular benefits. States participating in the program, or otherwise extending
the duration of benefits, accounted for 70 percent of covered employment.
Unemployed persons claiming benefits under this temporary program
reached a maximum of 658,000 in August 1958, and then declined to less
than 400,000 by the end of the year. Extended unemployment benefit
payments amounted to approximately $390 million during 1958.
The months of recession also affected other social security and public
assistance programs, even though these are less closely related to employment trends than unemployment insurance. Total recipients of aid to
dependent children increased more sharply than in previous years. Cases
of "General Assistance"â€”relief provided from State and local funds where
applicants are not eligible for federally assisted programsâ€”also increased
more in late 1957 and early 1958 than would be expected for seasonal
reasons.
HOURS WORKED AND EARNINGS
The average workweek of production workers in manufacturing industries declined moderately during the first half of 1957, and sharply from
September 1957 through February 1958. It then turned upward and
advanced through the rest of the year. Gross average hourly earnings,
which had leveled out at $2.11 in the final months of 1957, remained practically unchanged through April 1958, but then rose at a quickening pace
during the second half of the year, reaching $2.19 in December. Hourly
earnings, excluding premium pay for overtime, continued to rise throughout the year. Average weekly earnings, reflecting both changing hours
and changing rates, declined from September 1957 to February 1958, but
by June they had recovered all of their lost ground, and at $88.04 in
December were $5.30 above earnings a year earlier. In terms of real
purchasing power, weekly earnings continued to decline through April
1958, but recovered sharply by the end of the year, as the workweek was
lengthened and as consumer prices stabilized.
The manufacturing workweek and the amount of overtime worked
began to recede early in 1956 from the high levels of 1955, and declined




87

gradually until September 1957, when the contraction became sharper.
The low point was reached in February 1958 when average hours of work
were lower (seasonally adjusted) than at any time since World War II.
An upturn occurred in March, before the beginning of the recovery of
employment. This development is typical of periods of recovery. When
demand improves, production is first increased by lengthening the workweek, and later by adding employees.
Reduced overtime tends somewhat to counteract, in recession periods,
the continued rise of basic wage rates. In February 1958, when overtime
had been minimized and the workweek was shortest, gross average hourly
earnings in manufacturing were 2.4 percent above the level of February
1957, while average straight-time earnings were 3.5 percent higher. The
continued rise in basic wage rates in 1958 is reflected in the index of hourly
earnings excluding premium pay for overtime and adjusted for interindustry shifts of employment (Table C-4).
Reduced hours of work and less overtime, and the continued rise of consumer prices, resulted in a persistent decline of real weekly earnings in 1957
and through April 1958, despite the rise of basic wage rates. However,
this tendency was reversed by the increase in hours of work and by the
tendency of prices to stabilize after the middle of 1958. By the end of the
year, real weekly wages had recovered nearly all of the ground lost since
the record rates of late 1956.
Pay rates of armed forces personnel, and of salaried civilian employees
of the Federal Government, which had been unchanged since early in 1955,
were increased by about 10 percent, on the average, during 1958. The
increases were made retroactive to January 1958 for civilian employees,

resulting in lump-sum cash payments of about $332 million in June and
July. In all, about 3.4 million persons are receiving higher salaries under
this legislation, and the total rise of income amounts to about $1.4 billion
per year.
Faim wage rates, according to the index compiled by the Department of
Agriculture, increased by about 3 percent between July 1957 and July 1958.
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING DEVELOPMENTS
Basic wage rates, established in major collective bargaining situations,
continued to rise in 1958. As in 1957, the over-all average wage increase
was about 12 cents an hour, and increases were negotiated or put into
effect for 6.8 million workersâ€”about 85 percent of those covered by major
collective bargaining contracts (Table C-5). Improvements of supplementary benefits continued to characterize three out of every four settlements.

Source: Department of Labor.

At the outset of 1958, about 3.3 million employees were covered by labor
agreements providing for specified wage increases during the year, and in
most cases for cost of living adjustments as well. In addition, at least
one cost of living wage review was scheduled for about 1 million workers
before expiration of their contracts in 1958. Employees in the steel, aluminum, meatpacking, and railroad industries received total increases ranging
from 12 to 19 cents per hour, as a result of both deferred and escalator
adjustments. Automobile workers received total increases of approximately
13 cents per hour in 1958 under both old and newly negotiated contracts.
The continued advance of the consumer price index until August, and the
record numberâ€”4 millionâ€”of employees with wages subject to cost of living
escalator clauses, were major factors in the continued rise of wage rates.




Wage increases were negotiated for 3.5 million employees in 1958. Negotiated increases tended, on the whole, to be slightly smaller than in 1957,
with 7 to 9 cents per hour being the most common, compared with 9 to 11
cents in 1956 and 1957. About 7 percent of workers affected by negotiations received no wage increase.
After delayed negotiations, three-year settlements in the automobile industry were concluded with major firms in September and October. Wage
increases of 2.5 percent at 13-month intervals, extra increases for skilled
employees, continued cost of living adjustments, and improvements of severance pay, pensions, and supplemental unemployment benefits were provided. An agreement reached in the coal mining industry in November
increased wages by $2 per day, effective in 1959, and provided higher vacation pay and other benefits.




II. Prices
Prices of most manufactured industrial goods in both retail and wholesale
markets have been fairly stable over the last 18 months. On the other hand,
prices of other types of goodsâ€”farm products, industrial raw materials,
foods, and servicesâ€”have changed by relatively large amounts, some fluctuating over a wide range and others rising steadily.
In wholesale markets, farm prices rose during most of the period of
contraction, and then declined in the last nine months of 1958. Prices of
industrial raw materials, on the other hand, moved in the opposite direction,
falling as economic activity receded and rising during the recovery. Reflecting these offsetting price movements and the stability of prices of most
manufactured goods, the wholesale price index has been roughly unchanged
since mid-195 7.
Prices of consumer services have continued to advance steadily; food prices
rose sharply in early 1958, and despite some modest declines in recent
months they have remained above 1957 levels. Together with higher
prices for new and used automobiles, these developments accounted for
almost all of the 2.6 percent increase in the consumer price index between
July 1957 and November 1958.
FARM AND FOOD PRICES
Farm prices rose irregularly throughout 1956 and 1957 from the abnormally low levels of the winter of 1955-56, and the rise was accelerated in
early 1958. During the first three months of 1958, wholesale prices of farm
products rose 9 percent above prices in the same quarter of 1957, while the
volume of marketings, particularly of price-supported crops, rose 5 percent.
Marketings of livestock, however, were smaller than in the preceding year,
and unfavorable weather during the winter and early spring reduced the
supply of fresh fruits and vegetables. Although the maintenance of consumer income undoubtedly contributed to the rise in food prices during the
recession, these changing supply conditions played the major role. As food
supplies increased in the summer and fall of 1958, food prices declined;
nevertheless, they remained above 1957 levels. During most of the period
of rising farm prices, marketing margins continued to advance. The higher
manufacturing, transportation, and distribution costs resulted not only from
higher wage rates, freight charges, and the like, but also from the costs
incurred in continually adding to the quality, variety, and "built-in" services
incorporated in prepared and packaged foods. A large part of the rise in




margins came in the second half of 1958, when the fall in farm prices was
accompanied by a much smaller decline in food prices. In November,
retail food prices were still about 2 percent above mid-1957 levels.
CONSUMER SERVICES
Ever since World War II, prices of consumer services have been rising
steadily, through economic expansions and contractions. They have increased not only absolutely but also in relation to prices of commodities.
Because of their relatively small rise during the war years, however, the
increase since then has only recently brought service prices, excluding rent,
back to their 1939 relationship to nonfood commodity prices. Rents are still
well below their prewar relationship to other prices. While the prewar
relationship between prices of services and other prices is not necessarily
normal for the current period, some of the relatively sharp increase in prices
of services during the past ten years may reflect an attempt to achieve in
these industries the real income gains attained earlier in other segments of
the economy.
Consumer services cover a wide variety of economic activities, ranging
from the highly industrialized and regulated public utilities to domestic
service. They also include such items as real estate taxes and property
insurance premiums, which have little immediate connection with the state
of business activity. It is not surprising, then, that there have been significant differences among the various categories in the timing and magnitude
of price changes.
Prices of services provided by the regulated public utilities tend to adjust
to inflationary pressures with some time lag. During the nine months
following the conflict in Korea, for example, when other prices were rising
sharply, prices .of most of these utilities increased moderately. In the
succeeding two years, on the other hand, they rose fairly rapidly while
commodity prices were falling. Similarly, the prices of this group of services
advanced quite gradually from 1956 to mid-1957, but since then they have
risen at a much more rapid rate. The recent increase is more a delayed
reaction to cost increases that occurred earlier than a reflection of inflationary forces currently at work. Since the end of World War II, prices of
some of these servicesâ€”gas, electricity, and telephoneâ€”have risen substantially less than prices of other services. A major reason for the smaller
increase is that these services are very highly industrialized and have
achieved substantial efficiencies of operation through large investment programs, rapid expansion of operations, and the introduction of new technology. Certain other utilities, particularly local public transit, although relatively large users of capital equipment, have faced problems peculiar to their
industry, which have tended to raise their costs and prices even more than
for services in general.
For another large group of services included in the consumer price
index, prices are influenced by governmental and administrative factors not




92

closely related to the current state of the economy. The most important
items in this group are real estate taxes, auto registration fees, postage rates,
mortgage interest, and automobile and property insurance premiums.
Some of these items have been included in the consumer price index only
since December 1952. Since then, prices for this group have risen faster
than service prices generally. While property taxes, insurance rates, and
other items of a similar nature tend, in the long run, to be influenced by
general economic conditions, the specific timing of changes is usually determined by noneconomic considerations.
For consumer services other than the regulated utilities and the miscellaneous group discussed above, a common characteristic is that a large
part of their total cost is payment for labor services. They normally
cannot achieve the efficiencies made possible by heavy capital investment
and new technology to the same extent as the commodity producing and
public utility industries. For this group of "other" services, prices have
risen steadily since the end of the war, and substantially more than the
prices of services provided by the regulated utilities. In many instances,
an advance in prices for this group when other prices are stable reflects an
adjustment of wages and salaries to increases in living costs which occurred
at some earlier period. Also, wage and salary gains often lead to cost and
price increases in many of the service industries, in contrast to the industrialized sectors where there is greater opportunity for wage and salary increases
to be offset by improvements in productivity.
Taken altogether, service prices, excluding rent, rose 3.9 percent between
mid-1957 and mid-1958, and another 0.7 percent in the second half of 1958.
Since March of last year, however, the rate of increase has been somewhat
slower than during most years since the war. Rent has risen about 2.5 percent in the 18 months since the middle of 1957. While this is about the rate
of increase which has persisted since 1953, it is well below the annual increases of 4 to 5 percent in earlier postwar years.
INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS
A number of important crude or slightly processed materials used by
American industry, such as lead, zinc, copper, tin, and natural rubber, are
supplied in whole or in part from abroad. In most instances, the United
States purchases a significant part of the world supply, but other industrial
nations are also heavy buyers. Hence, prices of these materials were determined during the recession not only by the course of economic activity in the
United States but also by the leveling of industrial production and the reduction in inventory purchases by other industrialized nations. Prices of these
materials have also been affected in recent years by the termination of largescale stockpiling, and by supplies from new sources which have been developed since the post-Korean defense mobilization began. The changes in
industrial production and inventories in the United States were, nevertheless,
major factors determining the movement of prices of crude and slightly




93

processed materials, not only prices of domestic materials but also those of
foreign supplies on which the United States relies heavily.
Prices of this group of commodities tend to be much more volatile than
those of fabricated materials. After reaching a peak in December 1956,
prices of crude materials, exclusive of farm products, declined irregularly to
mid-1957, as industrial production leveled and purchases for inventory
receded. In the succeeding nine months, the decline was more rapid, as
industrial consumption of materials decreased sharply and inventories were
reduced. Prices moved upward in the summer of 1958, shortly after industrial production began to recover. Since stocks of copper, lead, and zinc had
risen during the recession, the increased consumption of these materials
was at first achieved by drawing down inventories; subsequently, purchases
from primary producers increased. Later in the year, the restoration of
tariffs on copper and the imposition of import quotas on lead and zinc
strengthened the tendency for the prices of these commodities to rise. Prices
of steel scrap, rubber, and tin also advanced sharply as the recovery progressed. Prices of crude and slightly processed industrial materials as a
whole began to rise in June, and by the end of the year they had almost
reached the level recorded prior to the recession.
SEMIFINISHED AND FINISHED PRODUCTS
With some notable exceptions, prices of fabricated industrial products
(intermediate materials and finished goods) changed little during 1958
(Table C-6). Prices tended to decline in the first half of the year, but
subsequently they rose enough to erase these declines. Prices of steel and
of many intermediate steel-using products advanced significantly in both
1957 and 1958. Steel prices were raised on the average by 4.2 percent in
July 1957 and by 2.6 percent in August 1958. Both price increases were
put into effect shortly after substantial upward adjustments of wage rates
in the industry. On the other hand, prices of nonferrous metal products,
along with those of basic copper, lead, and zinc, declined during the recession. Although prices of these products have increased in recent months,
they are still below their pre-recession peaks. Prices of building materials
were relatively stable during 1956 and 1957 and then declined slightly in
early 1958. In the second half of the year, however, the rapid increase
in residential building and in public construction was accompanied by a
recovery in the prices of construction materials. Prices of semifinished
nondurable commodities, which had risen only moderately during the overall price advance in 1956 and 1957, fell throughout 1958. For all intermediate materials, components, and supplies as a group, prices at the end
of 1958 differed little from those prevailing at mid-195 7. A small rise
occurred in the last half of 1957, a modest decline during early 1958, and
an equally modest recovery in the latter part of the year.
During the two years preceding the recession, prices of machinery and
equipment rose 15 percent, the sharpest increase for any major group of

finished products. Even during the last half of 1957, when machinery orders
and sales were falling rapidly, prices advanced another 2l/z percent. After
November 1957, prices stabilized and remained so for most of 1958. Late
in the year, however, there were a number of small increases on particular
lines of equipment, notably agricultural and construction machinery.
With the principal exception of automobiles, the average increase in
prices of finished consumer goods, at wholesale and retail, was slight in the
past 18 months. Prices of new automobiles were raised in 1957 and 1958
when new models were introduced. However, a comparison of published
indexes at the end of 1958 with those in mid-1957, covering changes for two
model years, tends to exaggerate the increase, since discounts were larger at
the beginning of this period than at the end. The changes in prices of consumer goods, both as published and as adjusted to eliminate the essentially
seasonal changes in prices of automobiles, are shown in Table C-7. The rise
in prices of used cars was particularly marked in the past 18 months, continuing the advance begun in the period of very low prices in early 1956.
Over the past three years, almost half of the 9 percent increase in the prices
of consumer durable goods was due to the rise in prices of new cars, and
another third to the rise in prices of used cars.




95

Prices of appliances, which had fallen for many years, continued to decline after mid-1957, but the decreases tended to be small. Furniture prices
also fell slightly; apparel prices declined after a moderate seasonal increase in late 1957; and prices of gasoline, fuel oil, and textile housefurnishings moved lower. On the other hand, increases occurred in prices of
tires, prescriptions and drugs, cigarettes, newspapers, soaps and detergents,
and many other miscellaneous products. On balance, as can be seen from
Table G-7, when automobile prices are excluded, the indexes of prices of
consumer durable and nondurable commodities advanced very slightly.

The index of prices of consumer goods rose 2.6 percent, mainly because of increases in the prices of three groups of itemsâ€”foods, services,
and automobiles. The over-all index of wholesale prices, in contrast,
changed very little in the recession and during the recovery to date. This
index includes prices of very few service items, but it does include prices of
industrial raw materials. In general, the prices of these materials moved
in the opposite direction from prices of farm products and processed foods,
falling in the early part of 1958, when farm prices were increasing, and rising
in the latter part of the year, when farm prices were declining. Price
changes in these two major groups tended to offset each other, while prices
of semifinished and finished industrial products moved within a very narrow
range. The rise in the consumer price index relative to the wholesale price
index therefore reflects not an increase in retail margins, but rather the
substantially different composition of the two indexes.




COMPARISON OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN PRICE DEVELOPMENTS
The United States was not the only country to experience an increase in
the general level of prices during the past several years (Table C-8).
In fact, the average change in United States prices between 1953 and 1957
was somewhat less than the change in many Western European countries,
though nearly as much as in Germany and Italy. In the United States,
wholesale prices of nondurable goods and of farm products behaved in substantially different fashion from those of durable industrial products. Despite their rise in 1956 and 1957, farm prices in the United States were lower
at the end of the 1953-57 period than at the beginning, while in most WestTABLE C-8.â€”Price changes in the United States and selected other industrial nations,

ern European countries they had increased substantially. Prices of many
nondurable goods in the United States also were more stable than those
abroad, and prices of most consumer goods rose less than in Western Europe.
The increase in prices of durable goods for industrial use, on the other
hand, seems to have been greater in this country, both relative to other
prices here and to prices of similar goods produced abroad. Prices of
machinery and equipment rose at a particularly rapid rate; scattered evidence from a comparison of prices of processed durable materials indicates that the rise in prices in this country was greater than the increase
abroad. The over-all price behavior in the United States, compared with
other industrial nations, thus conceals significantly divergent trends among
different commodity groups.

III. Agriculture
For American agriculture, 1958 was a year of exceptionally favorable
weather and marked prosperity. Outstanding developments were record
yields and output of many crops, increased livestock prices, and a sharp rise
in farm income. The demand for food remained strong throughout the
year as personal incomes fell only moderately and briefly. The food component of the consumer price index averaged 4 percent higher than in 1957
as farm prices and the cost of marketing services rose about equally. Also,
exports of farm products remained high, although they were smaller in
the fiscal year 1958 than in 1957. Still, domestic and foreign demands were
again not large enough to absorb the output of many crops.
Agriculture's remarkable productivity, aided by favorable weather,
resulted in record crop output even though the acreage planted was the
smallest in many years. As a result, the two-year decline in price support
activity ended, and Federal expenditures for the stabilization of farm prices
and incomes are expected to be a record $5.4 billion in the fiscal year 1959.
Despite continued intensive efforts to dispose of surplus commodities, the
value of farm commodities under loan and in inventories of the Commodity
Credit Corporation (CCC) by mid-1959 may exceed the 1956 peak. Price
support commitments now made on 1959 crops suggest high expenditures
again in the fiscal year 1960, if production in 1959 is near the average
of recent years.
LEVEL AND SOURCES OF FARM INCOME
Realized net income of farm operators in 1958 was $13.0 billion, 20 percent more than in 1957 and the highest since 1953 (Table D-64). Delayed
marketings of 1957 crops, chiefly feed grains and cotton, contributed more
than $400 million to the increase in 1958. Total net income including
inventory change was $13.2 billion, 14 percent higher than in 1957. Production expenses increased 5 percent, as feeder livestock prices, wage rates,
prices of farm machinery and motor vehicles, and taxes rose. Farm people
earned more than $6 billion from nonfarm sources so that their average
per capita income from all sources exceeded $1,000 for the first time.
The rise in farm output and income in 1958 contributed to enlarged
expenditures on farm machinery, and thus to a greater productive capacity.
Also, the living standards of farm families continued to improve as a
result of gains in income. In addition, the increased farm expenditures
helped to moderate the business decline and to speed recovery. However,




many farm people did not share in the gains in 1958, and they still have
very low incomes. Wide differences in productive assets per farm and in
alternative employment opportunities continue to lead to large income disparities among farmers and to considerable diversity in the problems faced
by farm people.
Farms with annual gross sales of more than $2,500 represent only about
45 percent of all farms but produce nine-tenths of all farm products sold.
Operators of these farms earn most of their income from farming; they
are the chief beneficiaries of public expenditures for agricultural credit,
conservation, and price support programs; with the public, they share in
the important benefits of agricultural research. Per family average income
from all sources for the 2.2 million farms in this group has been comparatively high (Table C-9). Large differences exist within the group, however;
in 1954, 28 percent of all farms in this group made 64 percent of the group's
sales of farm products.

i Farm-operator family.
Source: Department of Agriculture.

Families on the 2.8 million low-production farms with annual sales below
$2,500 earn little income from farming, but their off-farm income is comparatively large (Table C-9). Again, there is a wide range within the
group. On many of these farms, the operator has little supplementary
employment, and farm sales are his major source of income. However, the
number of these farmers who are finding off-farm jobs is growing.
About 1.5 million part-time and residential farmers make up the remainder of the low-production group. Gross sales of these units are very
low since farms are small, and many of the farm operators have off-farm
jobs. Only 2 percent of all sales of farm products are made by part-time
and residential farms, which comprise nearly one-third of all farms. Clearly,
the welfare of the families on low-production farms is more closely linked
with the expanding nonfarm sector of our economy than with agriculture
as such.

FINANCIAL POSITION
The financial position of agriculture, which was already strong, continued to improve in 1958. Farm debt increased somewhat, but farm
assets rose by a larger amount, as the stock of machinery, the number an<i
value of livestock on farms, and land prices increased. Equities in farm
properties reached new peaks, with the gain in equities alone nearly equal
to the total farm real estate debt.
PRODUCTION AND PRICES
Most of the gains in farm income in 1958 are attributable to the coincidence of record output of crops with insufficiently flexible, supported prices;
sharply higher prices for certain crops whose output was reduced; and comparatively high prices for the moderately reduced marketings of livestock.
In addition, the maintenance of personal income and consumer spending
during the business contraction contributed significantly to higher farm
incomes.
Crops
Total crop production in 1958 exceeded the record output of 1956 and
1957 by 11 percent, while harvested acreage was little changed from those
years and was 5 percent below the 1951-55 average. New record yields
per acre were reported for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum grain, soybeans,
rice, and other crops which together made up 96 percent of all crop acreage
in 1958. These increases were the joint result of widespread favorable
weather and improved technology, the latter both a permanent and major
source of increased farm output.
Production of food grains was 48 percent higher in 1958 than in 1957.
An increase of more than 400 million bushels in stocks of wheat is indicated
by present estimates of domestic and foreign sales in the year ending June
30, 1959. Despite record output and large carryovers, the index of prices
received by farmers for food grains declined only moderately in 1958, as
price supports operating through nonrecourse loans set effective limits on
the price declines resulting from the large crops. The statutory price
support for wheat of the 1958 crop was 9 percent below, and for rice 5 percent below, that of 1957; prices for both commodities reflected these reductions, with wheat prices slightly below, and rice prices slightly above, the
support level.
Price supports had similar sustaining effects on the prices of feed grains
and oil crops in 1958, despite sharply increased output. As a result,
the increase in income from these major price-supported crops was very
large; food and feed grains, and oil crops accounted for one-third of the
increase in cash receipts from farm marketings in 1958.
Reductions in the size of crops were rare in 1958; for two major commodities, however, reduced output contributed to increases in cash receipts




100

and in net farm income. Smaller marketings of early citrus fruits following
frost damage sent their prices up sharply; the seasonally adjusted index of
prices received by farmers for all fruit rose 19 percent in the month preceding April 15. For the year, citrus fruit prices were 28 percent higher than
in 1957, while production decreased 15 percent. As a result, the value of
production of the reduced 1957-58 crop was $426 million, $47 million more
than the value of the larger 1956-57 crop. Noncitrus fruit production was
slightly reduced, and prices were moderately above those in 1957.
A shortage of fresh vegetables early in the season caused their prices
to rise sharply; prices fell as supplies increased at midyear.
Eight percent of the increased cash receipts from farm marketings
in 1958 was attributable to fruits and vegetables.
Livestock
Per capita meat consumption in 1958 was less than in 1957, as red
meat production declined 4 percent, largely early in the year. By midyear, monthly pork output began to exceed the 1957 volume. Beef
output, however, continued well below 1957, as breeding herds were
restocked following large reductions in 1956 and 1957; cattle on farms
increased by more than 2 million head in 1958. Lamb and mutton production was also slightly below 1957, but poultry meat production mcreased 11 percent, partly offsetting the reduction in red meat supplies
(Table C-10).

i Index of prices received by farmers for meat animals.
* Preliminary.
Source: Department of Agriculture.

The reduction in total and per capita meat supplies was reflected in increased prices in 1957 and even larger increases in 1958, when the index
of prices received for meat animals rose 20 percent. Because of this
sharp price response to moderately reduced marketings, sales of meat
animals accounted for nearly half of the 1958 increase in cash receipts from
farm marketings.
101
489916 Oâ€”59-




Even though there was some increase in 1958 in the volume of marketings
of poultry and eggs, prices increased slightly. Dairy production and
marketings were almost the same as in 1957, but prices fell moderately.
EXPORTS
Agricultural exports decreased by 15 percent, to $4 billion in the year
ended June 30, 1958; nevertheless, they were exceeded in only two other
years on record. Grains, cotton, and animal products accounted for
most of the decrease. Thirty percent of all exports of farm products were
shipped under special programs, compared with 40 percent in the fiscal
year 1957, mostly under provisions of Public Law 480. Cash exports
remained at $2.8 billion, partly because export subsidies continued to be
paid on several commodities in order to bridge the gap between domestic
and world prices. Sales for foreign currencies and grants for relief accounted for nine-tenths of the exports under special programs. Barter
transactions declined, under revised regulations, to only one-fourth the volume of the preceding fiscal year.
The Department of Agriculture expects a small decline in agricultural
exports during the fiscal year 1959, chiefly because of increased production
in importing countries. Cotton exports may not exceed 4 million bales,
a sharp drop from fiscal 1958, while wheat exports are expected to increase
slightly. Exports of farm products in the period from July to December
1958 were 4 percent below those in the same period in 1957.
PRICE SUPPORT OPERATIONS
Farm income has become increasingly dependent on price supports, as
rising productivity and increased resources have combined to keep the output of major farm commodities well in excess of total demand at established
prices. Somewhat less favorable crop weather, the soil bank, and large
exports based primarily on special financing or grants for relief, permitted
reductions in the carryover of wheat and cotton in 1956 and 1957. Feed
grain carryover, however, has increased in each of the last eight years. Oilbearing crops have become heavily dependent on surplus disposal programs.
High levels of price support activity in grains, cotton, and oilseeds from the
1958 crop indicate a record total of CCC holdings by mid-1959.
Since the fiscal year 1953, budget expenditures for the stabilization of
farm prices and incomes have ranged from $1.7 billion to the record $5.4
billion estimated for the present fiscal year (Table C-ll). Most of these
expenditures have been in support of the prices of wheat, corn, and cotton,
commodities which have continued to present grave problems of overproduction and excess carryover.

COMMODITY MARKETS
Per capita consumption of wheat as food in the United States has declined for many years as personal incomes have risen and diets changed.
From 1910 to 1957, the total amount of wheat used as food actually fell
slightly, although population almost doubled. Exports in the period since
the war have depended heavily on grants for relief and on sales for foreign
currencies. For the crop years 1953 through 1957, 63 percent of all wheat
exported was shipped under special Government programs, chiefly Public
Law 480 and the Marshall Plan. In that period, domestic uses plus cash
exports (excluding those under special programs) averaged 737 million
bushels per year, 73 percent of average annual production (Table C-12).
At 1956-58 average yields, enough wheat to supply these markets can be
produced on about 60 percent of the present national acreage allotment. If

such yields occur, production from a larger acreage will either add to the
already large carryover or require shipment through surplus disposal programs, unless markets are expanded. A substantial addition to stocks
appears likely from the 1959 crop, according to present indications as
reported by the Department of Agriculture.
Utilization of feed grains is tied closely to the production of livestock
and livestock products which, unlike wheat, have been increasingly in demand as per capita incomes have risen. As a result, grains fed to livestock
have increased, although irregularly; exports also have risen, partly under
special financing. Yet production has exceeded utilization each year since
1952 (Table C-13). Price support holdings of feed grains, already nearly
$3 billion on June 30, 1958, may be expected to rise as a result of the large
1958 crop.

Cotton has faced strong competition from foreign cotton in the world
market, as well as from artificial cellulose and synthetic fibers in the domestic market. Domestic per capita consumption has fallen in the past
few years, and mill consumption has been reduced despite a growing population. Exports have been unstable, rising sharply after the war and
again in 1956 and 1957, largely because of foreign shortages and special
financing. Stocks in the past six years have fluctuated widely, but at
present they are only moderately excessive. Total utilization in the 1958
crop year (August 1958 to July 1959) is estimated at 12 million bales, only
slightly more than 1958 production, which was reduced sharply because
more than one-fourth of the cotton acreage allotment was placed in the
soil bank. It is possible that, under present programs, production in 1959
and 1960 may again exceed utilization and that stocks may increase.
Tobacco also poses a serious problem in view of drastically reduced acreage, rising yields, declining cash exports, and large carryover. Under the
present program, support prices are rising, thus increasing the tendency
toward higher yields per acre and jeopardizing foreign markets.




104

Prices of oilseeds, including soybeans, cottonseed, flaxseed, and peanuts,
also depend heavily on Government support; excessive Government-held
stocks of soybeans and cottonseed have been prevented so far only by heavy
exports under Public Law 480.
While domestic consumption of these major crops either has declined or
has increased slowly, and exports have depended heavily on Government
programs, production per acre has increased sharply because of improved
crop varieties, expanded use of fertilizer, increased irrigation, and better
cultivation. In 1957, crop production per acre was 12 percent above output in 1947-49; in 1958, it was 26 percent higher. Virtually all crops have
shared in these gains. Per acre yields of wheat, corn, and rice in 1956-58
were, respectively, 37, 33, and 50 percent more than in 1947-49. Cotton
yielded 47 percent more, tobacco 30 percent more, and soybeans 16 percent
more per acre in 1956-58 than in the earlier period. The output of most
crops would be raised significantly if farmers were to increase fertilizer applications in response to present favorable crop-fertilizer price ratios, or were
to adopt available machinery even more rapidly. Also, improvements in
livestock breeding and feeding have reduced the feed requirements per unit
of output for some types of livestock production.




105

IV. Financial Developments
Shifts in monetary and credit policy during 1958, and the changes in
the underlying economic conditions that called for them, were quickly and
strikingly reflected in financial markets. The principal developments affecting the demand for capital and credit, the supply of funds available for
various users, and changes in interest rates and stock prices are described
in the following sections.
DEMANDS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
Corporations
The financing requirements of corporations in 1958 were lower than in
1957 as capital outlays and inventory expenditures declined much more
rapidly than the flow of internal funds from depreciation allowances and
retained earnings. Loans to businesses from commercial banks declined
$400 million, compared with a growth of $1.8 billion in 1957. Gross proceeds of corporate security offerings were $11.5 billion, about one-tenth
less than the record set in 1957. In the second half of the year, a rapid
improvement in retained earnings limited the need for an expansion of
borrowing as economic activity recovered. It was not until the fourth
quarter that business loan activity by commercial banks showed a significant
increase, and this was partially offset by a decline in corporate security
flotations.
Despite the attractiveness given to equity financing by rising stock prices,
only about one-tenth of corporate flotations last year took the form of common stock, compared with about one-fifth in recent years. Although bonds
convertible into common stock increased as a proportion of total offerings,
and rose somewhat in absolute dollar volume over 1957, this was more
than accounted for by one sizable offering in the first quarter.
Corporate liquidity improved over the year, though it remained close to
the low point in the period since the end of World War II. There was a
reversal of the decline that had taken place since 1955 in corporate holdings of United States Government securities and cash, and the proportion
of these liquid assets to current liabilities rose somewhat.
Consumers
In 1958, for the first time in the years since the war, consumer credit
outstanding remained practically unchanged (Table C-14). Automobile
paper outstanding declined by more than $1 billion, as the volume of new
automobile credit extended fell below repayments, which changed very




106

little. This decline was offset mainly by a continued growth in personal loan credit and in noninstalment credit.
Residential mortgage debt expanded more than in 1957, mainly in the
second half of the year. The increase reflected substantial commitments
made by financial institutions in late 1957 and the first half of 1958, when
easier credit conditions widened the differential between mortgage yields
and corporate bond yields and made mortgages a more attractive investment. Further effects of these commitments on mortgage debt will be
felt in 1959. The increase in nonfarm residential mortgage debt over the
entire year was $10.4 billion, compared with $8.6 billion in 1957; for the
second half of 1958, however, the increase has been estimated at $6.3
billion, compared with $4.2 billion in the second half of 1957.

Consumers maintained a remarkably good record in meeting debt payments, despite the recession. Delinquencies in meeting automobile payments were low, although there was a sharp increase in repossessions of
automobiles.
State and Local Governments
In order to finance mounting construction expenditures, State and local
governments further expanded their security flotations, to the record figure
of $7.4 billion. In addition, the dollar volume of bonds authorized at elections was much larger in 1958 than in 1957; however, the authorizations
fell short of the record level reached in 1956. A large part of the 1958
increase in proceeds from State and local offerings went for roads and
bridges, as States obtained funds to match Federal aid for accelerating the
highway programs.




107

Federal Government
The Federal debt rose $8.0 billion during the past year, with $6.6 billion
of the increase occurring during the second half. In addition, the Treasury
refinanced a large volume of maturing securities, thus heightening the impact of the Federal Government on credit markets. Two very long-term
bonds were issued, lengthening the maturity structure of the debt. In February, about $1.7 billion of 3J/2 percent bonds falling due in 1990 were
issued as part of a large exchange offering. In June, $1.1 billion of 3}4
percent bonds due in 1985 were offered for cash. The latter issue came at
the same time that a large refinancing offer, mainly into a new 2 $4 percent
bond maturing in 1965, was made. The sharp decline that occurred shortly
thereafter in the prices of Government securities led the Treasury Department to repurchase $625 million of the 2% percent bonds in the open
market.
In the second half of the year, the Treasury restricted its financing operations to relatively short-term securities. A notable development, initiated
in December, was the issue of a series of 26-week Treasury bills to supplement the usual 13-week bills. With capital markets again favorable, the
Treasury issued a long-term security for cash in January 1959.
SUPPLY OF FUNDS
Federal Reserve Policy
The first public indication of a reversal of the Federal Reserve's policy
of monetary restraint came in mid-November 1957, with the reduction of
the discount rate from 3/2 percent to 3 percent. Although this action by
itself did little to make money and credit more easily available, it helped
to initiate a sharp decline in interest rates that continued into early 1958.
Three further decreases lowered the discount rate to 1% percent by May
1958.
To provide funds to commercial banks, the Federal Reserve authorities
reduced reserve requirements. Successive decreases, announced in February, March, and April, lowered reserve requirements against demand deposits from 20, 18, and 12 percent in the three classes of member banks,
to 18, 16 5/2, and 11 percent. This was equivalent to releasing about $1.5
billion in reserve funds that could serve as a basis for a multiple expansion
of money and credit. In addition, the Federal Reserve authorities provided bank reserves through open market purchases of United States Government securities. This need arose in part from an outflow during the
year of more than $2 billion of gold, which, if not offset, would have
reduced bank reserves by an equivalent amount.
On July 18, the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve System authorized open market purchases of Government securities other than
Treasury bills, as a result of the sharp decline in Government security
prices. For a short while, some long-term securities were purchased by the




108

Federal Reserve System, although most of the purchases under this authorization were confined to the new 1^4 percent one-year Treasury Certificates
that were being marketed in July. Open market operations during the
major part of the year continued to be restricted to 13-week Treasury bills.
The effect of the various Federal Reserve actions was to provide the basis
for a substantial expansion of bank deposits. From January through July,
the money supply (demand deposits and currency) increased $5.4 billion,
on a seasonally adjusted basis, more than offsetting a decline during the
preceding six months. Time deposits at commercial banks increased $5.7
billion. The rise in time deposits on an annual basis was the highest in any
year since the end of the war.
Monetary policy shifted as business conditions improved and concern
emerged over possible inflationary developments. In mid-August, the
Federal Reserve Board approved an increase in the discount rate from
124 percent to 2 percent. A reversal also occurred in the tenor of Federal
Reserve open market operations. Previously, such operations, by providing
large amounts of reserve funds to member banks, had almost eliminated
the need for member bank borrowing at Federal Reserve banks. In late
August and early September, as the reserve position of member banks came
under increasing pressure, borrowings from the Federal Reserve banks rose
rapidly. In October, Federal Reserve banks again raised the discount rate,
from 2 percent to 2|^ percent. Margin requirements against new stock
purchases, which had been reduced from 70 percent to 50 percent in January, were raised again to 70 percent in August and to 90 percent in October. The money supply rose $700 million from July through December,
a rate of increase that was considerably less than the rate in early 1958.
Time deposits, likewise, grew at a much slower rate.
Commercial Bank Credit
As a result of Federal Reserve actions in the first half of the year, loans
and investments of commercial banks (excluding interbank loans) expanded
by $8.9 billion, in contrast to a decline of $200 million during the same
period of 1957. For 1958 as a whole, the expansion of bank loans and
investments was more than $14 billion (Table C-15), the largest expansion
in any year since the war.
In the absence of a strong private demand for credit, most of the expansion in bank assets took the form of enlarged holdings of United States
Government securities. These rose by $7.9 billion (based on par value; see
Table C-16) and accounted for almost all the increase in the publicly
held Federal debt. However, this increase in commercial bank holdings,
made possible by additional reserve funds, was concentrated in the first half
of 1958, and was accomplished largely through a reduction in the holdings
of other investors; Government securities outstanding rose very little during
the first half of the year.

After midyear, when the public debt rose rapidly, commercial banks
added to their holdings of United States Government securities at a much
slower rate, absorbing about one-fourth of the increase in the publicly held
Federal debt. The additional Government securities were placed in nonbank
hands, in some cases with commercial banks serving in effect as underwriters. Thus, large-scale monetization of the public debtâ€”i. e., additions
to bank holdings through reserve funds provided by monetary authoritiesâ€”
that might have provided the basis for a renewal of inflationary pressures
was avoided.

The maturity structure of Government securities held by banks was
lengthened as a result principally of intermediate-term securities offered in
Treasury financing operations. Since such issues are not as liquid as shortterm Government securities, the liquidity of banks was not enhanced as
substantially as the increase in bank holdings of Government securities
might indicate. Moreover, after the middle of the year, market prices of
securities of intermediate- and long-term maturity declined as interest rates
rose, making banks more reluctant to sell them because of the capital losses
that would be entailed.
In view of the reduced demands for consumer and business loans, the
major portion of the remaining increase in bank assets consisted of larger
holdings of State and local securities and real estate loans. The increase
in the former was a substantial fraction of the total increase in State and
local securities. Bank loans to aid in financing real estate transactions,
including mortgages and interim credit, also expanded significantly, particularly in the second half of the year, and the rise in bank holdings of real
estate loans was about the same as the 1955 record increase.
Nonbank Financial Institutions
Individuals added large amounts on balance to their financial assets.
The rise in savings capital at savings and loan associations exceeded by
more than one-quarter the rise in 1957 (Table C-17). In mutual savings

banks, which are concentrated in the northeast section of the country, the
rate of growth in savings accounts increased by more than 50 percent. The
flow of savings into life insurance companies, as measured by the net increase in life insurance assets, was slightly greater than in 1957. Savings
and loan associations and mutual savings banks used the additional funds
available to increase substantially their accumulation of mortgages, and life
insurance companies increased their accumulation of State and local securities. Holdings of United States Government securities by life insurance
companies seem likely to show little change for the year as a whole. This




ii i

would make it the first year since 1946 that life insurance companies did
not reduce their holdings of such securities significantly.
Although the flow of funds from individuals directly into common
stocks may have declined somewhat, the flow of funds into mutual funds as
measured by the accumulation of mutual fund shares was at a record level.
As a result, mutual funds increased their accumulation of common stocks. In
addition, many pension funds were reported to be enlarging their equity
portfolios. Individuals, however, continue to hold the largest amount of
shares and, according to the public transactions study of the New York Stock
Exchange, they continue to account for most transactions on the Exchange.
INTEREST RATES AND STOCK PRICES
The decline in interest rates that began in the autumn of 1957 continued into 1958 as economic activity diminished and Federal Reserve
authorities made credit more readily available. The drop in long-term
interest rates was particularly sharp through early January 1958. By then,
the average yield on long-term United States Government bonds had fallen
about /a of 1 percent, and a further decrease occurred through April.
Short-term rates declined almost continuously through late May. The rate
on new 13-week Treasury bills, which had reached 3^4 percent in 1957,
fell to about ^ of 1 percent.
With economic recovery, interest rates rose even more abruptly than
they had declined. By early autumn, interest rates on long-term Government securities not only surpassed the rates in 1957 but were the highest
since, the early 1930's. Other long-term rates also increased, although
not quite as much. Short-term interest rates rose swiftly, with new Treasury bills yielding almost 3 percent six months after yields significantly below
1 percent had prevailed; however, short-term rates did not attain the high
rates of 1957. Thus, short- and long-term interest rates advanced from
the low levels of early 1958 in a remarkably brief time, in contrast to the
protracted period of low interest rates during the economic contraction
of 1953-54.
A combination of factors contributed to the sharpness of the rise in
rates. These included the suddenness with which the upturn in business
activity came about; the projected rise in the supply of Government securities, reflecting the Federal deficit; and widespread discussion of potential
inflationary pressures. Another factor was the large-scale selling of United
States Government securities by many of those who had bought earlier in the
year on the assumption of declining interest rates and rising bond prices.
Many Government bonds, notably the 1% percent bonds of 1965 issued
in June, had been bought on a thin margin basis. When bond prices began to decline, many of these holders had little choice but to sell their
securities. This helped bring about further price declines through the
summer months, making for sharply higher interest rates.




112

Stock market prices increased persistently throughout most of 1958. By
autumn, prices of common stocks exceeded their previous highs; and,
according to one measure, prices of industrial stocks at the end of the
year were, on the average, 22 times the earnings that had prevailed in
the year ended September 1958. This high capitalization of current earnings had occurred only seldom in the past, and then under unusual circumstances. The dividend yield of a composite of stocks declined during
1958 from about 4% percent to 3J4 percent, considerably below yields on
long-term bonds. After the middle of the year, low-price stocks became the
most actively traded, and they increased in price substantially more than
high-price stocks. The proportion of stock market transactions for shortterm and trading purposes was the largest since 1955, according to the public
transactions study of the New York Stock Exchange.
Stock market credit, as measured by net debit balances of New York
Stock Exchange firms and bank loans to others than brokers and dealers,
increased about $900 million from the end of 1957 to the end of 1958,
and about $400 million when measured from the peak figure in 1957.
Most of the rise occurred before August 1958, at which time margin requirements on new stock purchases were raised from 50 percent to 70 percent,
and other moves were taken to restrain general credit expansion.




V. Government Finances
Federal, State, and local government expenditures increased during the
calendar year 1958. State and local receipts also rose, but Federal Government receipts declined, reflecting the effect of economic recession on
corporate and individual incomes. For the fiscal year 1958, the Federal
budget showed a small deficit (the first in three years), and a much larger
one is estimated for the current fiscal year. State and local debt rose by
$4.7 billion during the year ended June 30, 1958; the Federal debt increased
by $5.8 billion in the same period and by an additional $6.6 billion during
the second half of the calendar year 1958. It is expected to increase by
another $2 billion by June 30, 1959.
FEDERAL FINANCES
Expenditures
Budget expenditures in the year ended June 30, 1958 amounted to $71.9
billion, $2.5 billion higher than in the preceding fiscal year. There were
increases in nearly all categories, with the largest increases in the major
national security and commerce and housing categories (Table C-18).

A further rise in budget expenditures, to $80.9 billion, is indicated for the
current fiscal year (1959), as increases in nearly all major categories are
expected. For each of the four categoriesâ€”agriculture and agricultural
resources, major national security, international affairs and finance, and
commerce and housingâ€”an increase of more than $1 billion is estimated*
The largest single increase is expected for agriculture and agricultural




114

resources, primarily because record crops have caused increased payments to
farmers under open-end commitments for price support. To a smaller extent, the increase results from additional soil bank payments for corn and
cotton acreage. Estimates for expenditures on agriculture and agricultural
resources in the fiscal year 1959 have been revised upward repeatedly, from
$4.6 billion in the January 1958 budget to $6.4 billion in the midyear review
and to $6.8 billion as of January 1959. Agricultural expenditures therefore
become the third largest category in the Federal budget, exceeded only by
expenditures for national security and interest payments on the public debt.
The increase estimated for national security expenditures in the current
fiscal year is attributable primarily to higher spending on research and
development, procurement of missiles, larger operating expenditures, and
higher expenditures for military construction. Expenditures of the Atomic
Energy Commission are expected to increase by over $300 million. An
estimated increase of more than $1 billion for research and development
(including testing and evaluation) will raise estimated expenditures by the
Department of Defense in this category to a level 50 percent higher than in
the fiscal year 1958. Increased expenditures for new weapons and more
modern equipment, on the other hand, will be more than offset by a reduction in expenditures for conventional weapons and equipment, resulting in
an estimated reduction of $600 million in total expenditures for procurement.
The estimated increase in expenditures for international affairs and
finance is due primarily to the recommended expenditure for the additional
United States quota in the International Monetary Fund.
The higher expenditures for commerce and housing in fiscal 1959 reflect
primarily the purchases of mortgages for low- and medium-priced housing
by the Federal National Mortgage Association, extension of the direct home
loan program of the Veterans Administration, larger expenditures for the
modernization of airway navigation facilities, and greater assistance to small
business by the Small Business Administration. Despite the rise in postal
rates, a significant increase is expected in the net deficit of the Post Office
Department, owing to the pay increase for postal workers enacted in May
1958 and to higher payments to railroads on account of the increase in rates
granted them by the ICG in the spring of 1958.
The increase of almost $1 billion estimated for labor and welfare is chiefly
the result of the program enacted in June 1958, which provides for temporary advances to States for the extension of unemployment compensation
benefits, and of recent legislation increasing the Federal share of payments
to States for public assistance grants.
Revenues
Federal budget receipts in the fiscal year 1958 were almost $2 billion
less than in the preceding year, reflecting the impact of the recession. Receipts from taxes on individual incomes declined by about $900 million, and
those from taxes on corporate incomes by $1.1 billion. Revenues from




"5

excise taxes declined by about $400 million. However, other receipts, including customs and miscellaneous receipts, rose by more than $500 million.
A further decline in revenues is expected in the fiscal year 1959. Receipts
from the corporate income tax are expected to fall by $3 billion as a result
of the decline in corporate profits during the calendar year 1958, which was
particularly sharp in the first half of the year. On the other hand, receipts
from the personal income tax, which is collected mainly on a current basis,
are expected to increase, reflecting the economic recovery and the rise in
personal incomes beginning in the spring of 1958. Small declines are
estimated for excise and other receipts, except customs. The net effect of
all these changes will be a decrease of approximately $1 billion from the fiscal
year 1958 in Federal revenues. (For details on Federal budget receipts by
source, see Table D-51.)
Upon recommendation of the President, the Congress extended for one
year the current rates of the corporate income tax and certain Federal
excise taxes which were to be reduced last June. It also repealed the taxes
on transportation of property (including coal, and oil by pipeline), effective
August 1, 1958, at a revenue loss estimated at $350 million for the remainder of the fiscal year 1959 and somewhat over $500 million for a full
year. In addition, it enacted a number of technical tax revisions, including changes aimed at aiding small business; the revisions from which small
business is expected to benefit are estimated as involving a loss of $260
million in revenue in the fiscal year 1959.
Consolidated Cash Statement
The consolidated cash statement, which presents information on the
total flow of money between the public and the Federal Government,
shiftedâ€”like the conventional budgetâ€”from a surplus in the fiscal year
1957 to a deficit in fiscal 1958. However, both the change from the fiscal
year 1957 to the fiscal year 1958, and the deficit in the fiscal year 1958,
were smaller than those shown by the conventional budget. In every fiscal
year from 1953 through 1958 (as well as in most prior years), the Federal
budget on a consolidated cash basis has shown smaller deficits or larger
surpluses than the conventional budget (Table C-19).
Trust funds, whose receipts and disbursements are included in the consolidated cash statement but not in the conventional budget, have shown
a surplus in recent years, including the fiscal year 1958. In addition,
accrued interest on savings bonds has exceeded the cash interest paid on
redeemed bonds and has contributed to a reduction in Federal cash payments relative to budget expenditures.
Through the fiscal year 1957, the largest of the trust fundsâ€”the Federal
Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fundâ€”showed a consistent and substantial excess of receipts over payments, although the amount
of the excess has been declining in recent years. Most of the other trust
funds also showed a consistent excess of receipts over payments during this

period. An occasional excess of payments over receipts in one trust fund,
such as the Unemployment Trust Fund in the fiscal years 1954 and 1955,
was more than offset by an excess of receipts over payments in other funds.
A change began, however, in the fiscal year 1958, when payments from
the OASI Trust Fund exceeded receipts for the first time. Substantial
net payments were also shown by the Unemployment Trust Fund in that
year. These net payments were more than offset in total by the net receipts of the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Employees Retirement Fund, and the Highway Trust Fund. In the fiscal year
1959,, however, payments of the Highway Trust Fund, as well as the OASI
Trust Fund and the Unemployment Trust Fund, are expected to be substantially in excess of current receipts; therefore, the current operations of
the trust funds are expected to show, for the first time in recent years, a
substantial net excess of expenditures over receipts, and the anticipated
Federal deficit on a consolidated cash basis is expected to exceed the estimated deficit on a conventional basis (Table C-19).
It is estimated that in the fiscal year 1960 the situation will be reversed
again and that the Federal surplus on a consolidated cash basis will be
117

489916 Oâ€”59

larger than the budget surplus on the conventional basis. Current operations of the trust funds are then expected to show again a small net accumulation, partly because of higher contributions to the OASI Trust Fund,
effective January 1, 1959, smaller net payments by the Unemployment
Trust Fund, and increased revenues for the Highway Trust Fund from the
recommended increase in the Federal gasoline tax.
Public Debt
The public debt increased by $5.8 billion, to $276.3 billion, during the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1958. By the end of the calendar year 1958,
it had increased to $282.9 billion, an increase of $8 billion for the year.
A further increase of approximately $2 billion by June 30, 1959 is now
estimated. The increase in the public debt during the fiscal year 1958 was
substantially in excess of either the conventional budget deficit or the cash
deficit for the same period, but the opposite result is expected for the fiscal
year 1959 (Table C-19). The major reason for this difference is that the
Treasury's cash balance was abnormally high on June 30, 1958.
Changes in the public debt do not necessarily measure the impact of Government debt operations on the economy in terms of withdrawals of funds
from, or additions of funds to, the public. Net receipts by trust accounts,
which are invested in United States Government securities, provide the
Treasury with funds that can be used to redeem securities held by the public
or to reduce the amount of borrowing from the public if there is a budget
deficit. On the other hand, net payments by trust accounts reduce the cash
position of the Treasury, and may lead to an increase in the debt held by the
public as Federal security holdings by these accounts are reduced. The relationships between the budget surplus or deficit, net cash receipts or payments,
and changes in the public debt are shown in Table C-19 for the fiscal years
1953 to 1959, inclusive.
FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL FINANCES
Data on the net results of the financial transactions of the Federal Government on a cash basis (Table C-20) show that the relationship between
Federal cash payments and receipts has fluctuated considerably in recent
years. A deficit of $5.3 billion in the fiscal year 1953 was practically eliminated in the following year. A deficit of $2.7 billion in 1955 was followed
by a substantial surplus in the fiscal year 1956 and a smaller surplus in the
fiscal year 1957. In the fiscal year 1958, there was a deficit of $1.5 billion.
By contrast, cash receipts and payments of State and local government
units show much smaller swings during this period, with both cash receipts
and payments increasing steadily. Since 1953, payments have consistently
exceeded receipts, with the largest deficit occurring in 1958. Except for
1953, therefore, the net effect of State and local cash transactions has been
to reduce the size of the cash surplus or to increase the size of the cash deficit
of all government units combined.

All major classes of State and local government expenditures increased
during the past year. Expenditures for educationâ€”more than one-third of
the totalâ€”continued to be by far the largest single outlay, followed by ex*
penditures for highways and public welfare. As in previous years, property
taxes and taxes on sales and gross receipts accounted for about three-fifths
of State and local revenues. Both these sources of receipts, and also revenue
from personal income taxes, have increased from year to year. Receipts
from taxes on corporate profitsâ€”not an important source of revenue for
State and local governmentsâ€”declined in 1958.
RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS: NATIONAL INCOME ACCOUNTS
Quarterly changes in Government receipts and expenditures, at seasonally adjusted annual rates, are shown in Table C-21 in terms of the national income accounts. The presentation of Government receipts and
expenditures in these accounts shows the contribution of Government
operations to the gross national product and the income of the economy
more directly than the piesentation in either the conventional budget or
the consolidated cash statement. A major difference between the national
income concept and the consolidated Government cash statement is that
the former excludes capital transactions, such as sales of Government
property, mortgage purchases by the Federal National Mortgage Association, and Government purchases of other existing assets. Adjustments are also made for other reasons, such as differences in timing between the recording of certain transactions in the national income accounts
and the actual outlay or receipt of cash by the Government. For fiscal 1958,




the major part of the difference between receipts in the national income
accounts and in the consolidated cash statement was due to the difference
in timing between the accrual and payment of corporate profits taxes. (For
a reconciliation between Federal Government receipts and payments on a
cash basis and on a national income basis, see Table D-54.)
As indicated in Table C-21, the surplus of Federal Government operations on income and product account in the third quarter of the calendar
year 1957 was wiped out in the fourth quarter when receipts and expenditures were nearly in balance; and in each quarter of the calendar year 1958,

Federal Government operations showed a large deficit, the largest being
recorded in the second quarter. Both a substantial decline in receipts and
an increase in expenditures contributed to the shift from a surplus in the third
quarter of 1957 to a deficit in the first quarter of 1958. Federal receipts
reached a low point in the first and second quarters of 1958; by the fourth
quarter, they had recovered all the loss since the third quarter of 1957. Expenditures, however, continued to rise in each quarter of 1958; and by the
third quarter, they were more than 10 percent above expenditures a year
earlier. All major types of Federal expenditures increased, with the largest
rise occurring in transfer payments.




120

Purchases of goods and services by the Federal Government in the first
quarter of 1958 were about the same as in the last two quarters of 1957,
but in the following three quarters they increased at an accelerating rate.
Payments for national defense, by far the largest component, account for
some of the increase during this period. Greater outlays for the support of
agricultural prices, as well as increased payments to Government employees,
contributed to the increase in nondefense purchases of goods and services.
The steady rise in transfer payments through the third quarter of 1958
reflects primarily higher unemployment insurance payments as well as increased benefit payments under the old-age, survivors, and disability system.
Likewise, benefit payments from other social insurance funds, and compensation and pension payments to veterans, have been increasing.
Grants-in-aid to State and local governments have been rising, particularly in the last three quarters of 1958. The two major items accounting
for the rise are the increase in Federal public assistance grants to States
and grants-in-aid under the highway program.
State and local receipts and expenditures during this period show a
steady upward trend. However, while the increases in expenditures in
the fourth quarter of 1957 and the first quarter of 1958 were more rapid
than the increases in receipts, the gap between receipts and expenditures
narrowed in subsequent quarters. State and local purchases of goods and
services rose steadily during this period; the most significant expenditures
were for education and for the construction of highways and other facilities.

VI. United States Foreign Trade and Payments
Changes during the past two years in the economic situation in the United
States and abroad inevitably affected this country's foreign trade and payments. While imports were well maintained, exports declined sharply after
mid-195 7; as a result, the United States surplus on transactions in goods and
services in the first half of 1958 was much below the high level attained a year
earlier and about the same as in 1956 (Table C-22). At the same time, the
net outflow of capital remained considerably above the early 1956 rate.
These changes resulted in substantial additions to foreign gold and liquid
dollar assets. Thus a movement which had proceeded for several years
before the Suez crisis was resumed, but at a higher rate.

The selection of periods is dictated by the behavior of certain major items in the balance of payments,
especially that of United States exports. Mid-1952 to mid-1956 provides a base period of more or less normal
development of trade and payments after the repercussions of the Korean conflict were over and before the
effects of the Suez crisis were felt; the first half of 1956 is given separately to show the levels prevailing at the
end of that period. The first half of 1957 shows United States exports and other transactions at their peak,
influenced by the general level of economic activity as well as by the Suez situation and other special forces.
The first half and third quarter of 1958 give the more current situation, affected by the recession and other
developments.

REASONS FOR DECLINE IN UNITED STATES EXPORTS
From the first half of 1957 to the first half of 1958, the value of United
States merchandise exports fell moreâ€”in relative as well as absolute termsâ€”
than those of all other countries combined (Table C-23; also Chart 11

in Chapter 2). The reduction in the value of exports of foreign countries
was due chiefly to a fall in export prices of the primary producing countries.
Exports of the industrially developed countries declined relatively little, and,
unlike those of the United States, remained significantly higher in the first
six months of 1958 than in the first half of 1956. Exports, adjusted for
seasonal variations, of these other industrial countries rose moderately again
in the third quarter of 1958; and exports of the United States were slightly
higher in that quarter than earlier in the year.
Examination of the export performance of the United States discloses
that by far the greater part of the recent decline, as well as much of the
sharp rise immediately preceding it, is attributable to developments in
a few products. Six major commodities or commodity groups, which
usually constitute only about 30 percent of total United States exports,
accounted for most of the rise from the first half of 1956 to the first
half of 1957 and for about three-fourths of the fall in the first half of 1958
(Table C-24).
Special circumstances dominated the movements of petroleum, cotton,
and wheat. Petroleum exports were temporarily swollen in the first half
of 1957 by the interruption of traffic through the Suez Canal. Cotton
exports, which had been abnormally low in the first half of 1956, pending

a revision of the United States export price, rose subsequently when foreign
stocks were being replenished, but later declined, although they still were
relatively high. Wheat shipments were exceptionally large for a time
because of the poor 1956 harvest in Europe and because of deliveries to
the Far East under special programs.
Two other export itemsâ€”metals and coalâ€”proved to be extremely
sensitive to changes in demandâ€”first when foreign production capacity
was strained during the boom and later when excess capacity emerged.
The effect of this changed world market situation on United States steel
exports has been aggravated by intensified price competition from foreign
suppliers. United States coal remains strongly competitive at its landed
price abroad, but it is encountering serious obstacles in Europe. There,
stocks have piled up at pithead because of continued high coal production
in the face of decreased demand as a result of reduced activity in the European steel industry, cuts in users' stocks, gains in coal-burning efficiency,
and further displacement by fuel oil.
Exports of automobiles, parts, and accessories have shown a general and
pronounced decline, after having failed to share in the over-all rise in




124

United States exports in 1957. The decline in 1958â€”especially that in
exports of motor trucks which had previously increasedâ€”is attributable in
considerable part to cyclical influences. Exports of passenger cars and of
chassis, however, have fallen over the last several years so much that they
now represent only a quarter of the total value of exports of this group.
Meanwhile, exports of foreign cars have risen rapidly; in the first half of
1958, their value was equivalent to five times the American exports of passenger cars and chassis. The growth in demand abroad for the small foreign models reflects the spread of the market to lower income groups, the
increase in traffic congestion in many cities, steeply graduated taxes on
large cars and high gasoline taxes in many countries, continued restrictions
on car imports in the producing countries, and, in some other countries,
preferential import treatment for small cars.
In addition to the influence of the shifts in the major export items just
discussed, United States exports have been affected by changes in the economic situation in certain countries. The annual rate of sales to Canada
alone in the first half of 1958 was $750 million below the rate a year earlier.
Half of this decline was in exports of products other than the six discussed
above (Table D-73). The decline in sales of machinery to Canada is especially noteworthy since it is in contrast to such sales to most other countries
and reflects a slower rate of industrial investment in Canada.
Much of the $400 million decline in the annual rate of exports to Western Europe (Table D-73) of items other than the six separately discussed
is directly attributable to changes in general business conditions or in agricultural production, though the effects of these changes have been felt by other
suppliers as well.
In summary, the relatively sharp decline in United States exports after
the middle of 1957 is accounted for by a combination of factors: the disappearance of certain special circumstances which had, for a time, raised
shipments of petroleum, cotton, and wheat to exceptionally high levels; and
cyclical shifts which had also lifted certain exports, such as steel and other
metals, to unusually high levels but which now leave them temporarily
depressed. Both sets of influences have affected United States exports with
particular force because of their broad commodity composition, which differs
from that of any other industrial country, and to some extent also because
of their country distribution. These reasons for the wide swings in United
States exports, however, do not diminish the importance of efforts to
strengthen the position of the United States in a more highly competitive
world market.
FACTORS OF STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS IN UNITED STATES IMPORTS
The total value of United States imports, on the other hand, has been
relatively well maintained. This comparative strength is attributable to
several forces, including particularly the maintenance of consumer demand.

As shown in Table C-25, the value of a substantial number of imported
commodities has either increased or changed very little. Imports of automobiles,, especially, continued to rise during the recession; imports of meat
and other foodstuffs, except coffee, were substantially greater in the first
half of 1958 than a year earlier, though largely because of temporary conditions affecting domestic supplies of some of these products; and petroleum
imports were also higher, but the increase was less than in the first half of
1957, when the rise from a year earlier was due to higher prices as well as
greater volume.
The value of imports of coffee in the first half of 1958 was sharply below
the value in the same period of 1956 and of 1957. The pressure of coffee
supplies on the market resulted in some weakening of prices and therefore
in increased caution in dealers' inventory policies; as a result, the volume as
well as the price of coffee imports declined.
The other main commodity imports shown in Table C-25 as decreasing
are all in the nature of industrial materials. This group as a whole declined
by an annual rate close to $800 million, or almost 20 percent, from the first
half of 1957 to the first half of 1958. Reductions in volume and in price
were of about equal importance.

These changes in United States imports affected different supplying
countries and areas according to the composition of their exports. Exports
from the Middle East to the United States increased because of petroleum;
those from Mexico and Cuba expanded chiefly because of meat and other
foodstuffs. On the other hand,, exports to the United States from the
coffee-supplying countries in Latin America were depressed, and also
those from Canada and Latin American countries for which nonferrous
metals and other industrial materials are important. Influenced by good
markets for cocoa and for African types of coffee, United States imports
from Africa were well maintained. Imports from Europe fluctuated very
little, as increases in automobiles offset decreases in steel and other metals.
Imports from Japan rose, but those from other areas in the Far East fell
because of smaller United States purchases of rubber and tin.
INCREASE IN UNITED STATES INVESTMENT ABROAD
Like receipts from exports, the net outflow of funds in the form of
capital investment and grants from the United States had risen to a peak
in the first half of 1957. The subsequent decline, however, was smaller
than the decrease in exports, and the net outflow of funds in the first six
months of 1958 still exceeded that in the corresponding period in 1956 or
earlier (Table C-22). The large outflow in 1957 included substantial payments for oil concessions (Table D-72) and related investment activities
in Venezuela. The net outflow of capital exclusive of these payments continued to increase during each of the last several years. Preliminary estimates indicate that the net outflow in the third quarter of 1958, adjusted
to correct for the usual summer lull, was about the same as in the first half
of the year, though with offsetting changes in the component items.
The largest increase over the first half of 1956â€”at least up to mid1958â€”was in new foreign security offerings; United States private direct investment abroad, after a considerable expansion in 1957, fell back to its earlier
level. (For details by type and area of investment, see Tables D-71 and
D-72.) Private short-term credits abroad and Government lending have
also risen, while the inflow of foreign redemption payments to American
bondholders and of foreign long-term investment in this country has
declined.
There may also have been some unrecorded capital outflow, following
the large shifts of funds to the United States during the Suez crisis and
the subsequent currency speculation in Europe. By their nature, such
shifts frequently do not appear in the recorded data on capital flows, and
the only evidence of these movements lies in the behavior of the residual
items (errors and omissions) in the United States global balance of payments (Tables C-22 and D-71). This item normally shows unidentified
receipts of several hundred million dollars annually, because of overestimates of certain payments or underestimates of certain receipts for
which precise records are not available. With due allowance for this dc-




127

ficiency in the estimates, the inflow of unrecorded capital during the 12
months from October 1956 through September 1957 seems to have reached
something like $1 billion. Any subsequent outflow of these funds has
been small, at most, or outweighed by other unrecorded receipts.
The high level of foreign security flotations in the United States during
the first half of 1958 is accounted for largely by bond offerings by the International bank for Reconstruction and Development to finance its growing lending operations abroad, and by Canadian issues. The spread
between interest rates in the United States and Canada in the early part of
the year gave a particular inducement to the flotation of Canadian issues
in the United States market. There has also been, especially in the latter
part of 1958, a noteworthy rise in securities offered by overseas countries.
Foreign bonds payable in United States dollars have again become an
attractive investment medium for security buyers, both in this country and
abroad.
The large outflow of public and private capital from the United States
since the end of the war has helped to achieve a rapid growth in the world
economy. It has also made possible a high volume of United States exports,
directly by providing funds which were spent on United States goods and
indirectly by leading to the strengthening of foreign reserves and helping to
remove obstacles to international trade and payments. When, as recently,
foreign purchases of American goods slacken for any reason, a continuing
strong flow of dollars for imports and for foreign investment and grants
results, for the time being in a faster increase in the gold and dollar holdings of other countries. At the same time, however, these movements
strengthen the basis for economic expansion and generate conditions favorable to the growth of United States exports. Such considerations are
pertinent to an appreciation of the foreign trade and payments position of
the United States in 1958.
RISE IN GOLD AND DOLLAR HOLDINGS OF INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES
Since the autumn of 1957, foreign countries and international institutions
have increased considerably their holdings of gold and liquid dollar assets
through transactions with the United States. During the year ended September 1958, their gains from this source totaled $0.8 billion in dollar funds
and $1.8 billion in gold. Inclusive of gold acquired from new foreign production or other sources outside the United States, the 12-month gain in
gold and dollar balances owned abroad amounted to $3.4 billion.
This gain, however, accrued almost exclusively to the industrially developed countries; the holdings of other countries decreased considerably. The
12-month changes in foreign gold and dollar holdings (in millions of dollars) were distributed as follows: United Kingdom, +1,380; Netherlands,
+ 421; Belgium, +326; Italy, +416; Federal Republic of Germany. +263;
Switzerland, +165; other Western Europe, +545; Canada, +149; Japan,
+ 312; Venezuela, â€”382; other Latin America, â€”226; all other countries,




128

â€” 311; international institutions, + 351 (see Table D-75 for further details).
The increases were primarily in reserves of countries which ordinarily hold
official reserves chiefly in gold, though some of them also added to their
dollar holdings on official or private account. Conversely, the decreases
were largely in countries (for example, most Latin American countries),
which usually keep most or much of their official reserves in dollars, in
addition to private funds held in this currency; however, some of them had
to reduce their gold holdings also.
INCREASE IN THE USE OF DOLLARS FOR MULTILATERAL SETTLEMENTS
The large increases in the gold and dollar holdings of the industrially advanced countriesâ€”Western Europe, Canada, and Japanâ€”resulted in considerable part from the strains in the foreign trade and payments of the less
developed countries and of certain others which are also exporters of primary
products. Domestic inflation, overimporting, and widespread declines in
the prices of export commodities and in export earnings in recent years
have caused sharp increases in the trade and payments deficits of the primary producing countries with third areas, chiefly Western Europe. (For
changes in trade flows, see Chart 11 and Table D-74.) As a regular
feature of the multilateral trade system, part of these deficits is usually
settled in dollars. Indirect evidence indicates that the amount of dollars
so employed recently has been much greater than in the years prior to 1957;
in this comparison, 1957 is disregarded because of the exceptionally large
deficits on trade or capital account of certain Western European countries
and Japan.
The data in Table C-26 (though subject to a considerable margin of
error) suggest that the net annual rate of gold and dollars used for multilateral settlements by the countries exporting primary goods was at least $1
billion or more higher in the first half of 1958 than in the first half of 1956,
and higher still in comparison with the 1952â€”56 average. The fact that
the net receipts of gold and dollars of Western Europe, Canada, and Japan
via multilateral settlements have risen by a still greater amount in the period
since 1956 reflects the increased activity of the International Monetary
Fundâ€”which has helped to relieve strains in international paymentsâ€”and
the increase in loans by the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.
The increase in multilateral settlements, far more than any change in
the net receipts of the industrial countries from the United States, accounts
for the recent large increases in the gold and dollar accumulations of this
group of countries.
By far the greater part of dollar settlements of the primary producing
countries with the industrial group has been covered by their net receipts
from the United States, as shown in Table C-26. These receipts, together
with the growing financial support given by the United States through
international institutions, have effectively assisted in rebuilding and

strengthening the framework of multilateral trade and payments and have
contributed much to the progress in overcoming restrictive forces in the
world economy.
For the remainder of their multilateral gold and dollar settlements, the
primary producing countries have drawn on their accumulated gold and
dollar holdings. In addition, they reduced their balances in other currencies; sterling balances alone were drawn down in the first half of 1958
at an annual rate of some $300 million, compared with no reduction two
years earlier.
Preliminary estimates indicate that in the third quarter of 1958 the
primary producing countries continued to make large settlements in gold
and dollars, covered partly by their net receipts from the United States
and partly by further drawings on their reserves. Canada also showed
net payments for the quarter, though perhaps for seasonal reasons. Western Europe's net gold and dollar receipts from third countries continued
at about the same rate as earlier in the year; these receipts, together with
a large surplus in transactions with the United States, caused Western
Europe's gold and dollar holdings to rise further.
UNITED STATES EXPORT PERFORMANCE AND
THE ADJUSTMENT PROBLEM
The increase in the foreign investment and other payments of the United
States in recent years has not been matched by an equally large growth in its
exports of goods and services. The annual rate of outflow through private
and public investments and grants, net of foreign long-term investment in
this country, was some $2.8 billion higher in the first three quarters of 1958
than in 1952-56 (Table C-22). Imports of goods and services together
with military expenditures abroad rose over the same period by $3.1 billion.
Thus, the total increase in these transactions was $5.9 billion.
Exports of goods and services have risen about $4.4 billion above the
1952-56 average, or at an annual rate of 6 percent. Most of this increase
had occurred by 1956, and was surpassed temporarily in 1957 because of
exceptional demand forces at that time. The level actually attained in
1958 can be regarded as a significant increase in relation to earlier years,
since foreign economic conditions last year were not favorable to the normal
development of United States exports. Some major shifts in international
trade were unavoidable, not only because of the cessation of certain conditions (such as those related to the Suez crisis) that had prevailed in the
early part of 1957, but also because various maladjustments had arisen during the previous period of rapid growth (see Chapter 2 ) . Contrasting developments during the two latest recessions illustrate the significance of sustained world economic growth for United States exports. While United
States imports slackened in the 1953-54 recession and remained weak for
some time, exports, after only a momentary pause, followed the upward
course of economic activity abroad (Charts 10 and 11) and contributed to
recovery in the United States.

These estimates represent an approximate conversion of the Department of Commerce series in 1954
prices. (See Tables D-4 and D 5.) This was done by major components, using the implicit price indexes
converted to a 1958 base. Although it would have been preferable to redeflate the series by minor components, this would not substantially change the results except possibly for the period of World War II, and
for the scries on change in business inventories.
For explanation of conversion of estimates in current prices to those in 1954 prices, see U. S. Income and
Output, A Supplement to the Surrey of Current Business, 1959. (The basic income and product series have
been revised beginning 1946.)
2 For 1929-45, net exports of goods and services and net foreign investment have been equated, since foreign
net transfers by government were negligible during that period.
3
Net of Government sales, which are not shown separately in this table. See Table D-1 for Government
sales in current prices.
* See Table D-1, footnote 4.
5
Not available separately.
6
Less than $50 million.

Gross national product less compensation of general government employees, i. e., gross product accruing
from domestic business, households, and institutions, and from the rest of the world.
2
See Survey of Current Business, October 1958, for description of series and estimates in current and constant prices and implicit deflators for 1910-57.
3
Includes compensation of general government employees and excludes compensation of employees in
government enterprises. Government enterprises are those agencies of government whose operating costs
are at least to a substantial extent covered by the sale of goods and services, in contrast to the general activities of government which are financed mainly by tax revenues and debt creation. Government enterprises, in other words, conduct operations essentially commercial in character, even though they perform
them under governmental auspices. The Post Office and public power systems are typical examples of
government enterprises. On the other hand, State universities and public parks, where the fees and admissions cover only a nominal part of operating costs, are part of general government activities.

National income is the total net income earned in production. It differs from gross national product
mainly in that it excludes depreciation charges and other allowances for business and institutional consumption of durable capital goods, and indirect business taxes. See Table D-10.
2
Wages and salaries and supplements to wages and salaries (employer contributions for social insurance;
employer contributions to private pension, health, and welfare funds; compensation for injuries; directors'
fees; pay of the military reserve; and a few other minor items).
3
Excludes income resulting from net reductions of farm inventories and gives credit in computing
income to net additions to farm inventories during the period. Data for 1929-45 differ from those shown in
Table D-64 because of revisions by the Department of Agriculture not yet incorporated into the national
income accounts.
4
See Table D-56 for corporate tax liability (Federal and State income and excess profits taxes) and
corporate profits after taxes.
5
Less than $50 million.
6
Preliminary; fourth quarter by Council of Economic Advisers.

1
Individuals' saving, in addition to personal holdings, covers saving of unincorporated business, trust
funds, and nonprofit institutions in the forms specified.
2
Includes currency, demand deposits, time and savings deposits, shares and deposits in credit unions,
and the postal savings system.
3
Includes armed forces leave bonds and other U. S. Government bonds (except savings bonds) and all
securities issued by State and local governments.
4
Includes insured pension reserves.
5
Includes Social Security funds, State and local retirement systems, etc.
6
Mortgage debt to institutions on one- to four-family nonfarm dwellings.
7
Consumer debt owed to corporations, largely attributable to purchases of automobiles and other dur
able consumer goods, although including some debt arising from purchases of consumption goods. Policy
loans on Government and private life insurance have been deducted from those items of saving.
* Change in bank loans made for the purpose of purchasing or carrying securities.
9
Less than $5 million.

NOTE.â€”In addition to the concept of saving shown above, there are other concepts of individuals'
saving, with varying degrees of coverage, currently in use. The series with the most complete coverage,
the personal saving estimates of the Department of Commerce, is derived as the difference between personal
income and expenditures. Conceptually, Commerce saving includes the following items not included in
Securities and Exchange Commission saving: Housing and farm and unincorporated business investment
in inventories and plant and equipment, net of depreciation and increase in debt. Government insurance
is excluded from the Commerce saving series. For a reconciliation of the two series, see Securities and Exchange Commission Statistical Bulletin, October 1958.
Revisions for 1957-58 in the consumer credit statistics of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System have not yet been incorporated into these estimates.
Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding.

Data for 1940-52 revised to include about 150,000 members of the armed forces who were outside the
continental United States in 1940 and who were, therefore, not enumerated in the 1940 Census and were
excluded from the 1940-52 estimates.

Not available.
NOTE.â€”Civilian labor force data beginning with May 1956 are based on a 330-area sample. For January
1954-April 1956 they are based on a 230-area sample; for 1946-53 on a 68-area sample; for 1940-45 on a smaller
sample; and for 1929-39 on sources other than direct enumeration.
Effective January 19--7. persons on layoff with definite instructions to return to work within 30 days
of layoff and persons waiting to start new wage and salary jobs within the foltowing 30 days are classified
as unemployed. Such persons had previously been classified as employed (with a job but not at work).
The combined total of the groups changing classification has averaged about 200,000 to 300,000 a month in
recent years. The small number of persons in school during the survey week and waiting to start new
jobs are classified as not in the labor force instead of employed as formerly. Persons waiting to open new
imsinesses or start new farms within 30 days continue to be classified as employed. (New definitions
series for periods prior to January 1957 are Census Bureau estimates under the old definitions adjusted by
Council of Economic Advisers to the new definitions.)
Beginnim: July 1955, monthly data are for the calendar week containing the 12th of the month; previously, for week containing the 8th. Annual data are averages of monthly figures.
For the years 1940-52, estimating procedures made use of 1940 Census data; for subsequent years, 1950
Census data were used. For the effects of this change on the historical comparability of the data, see
Annual Report on the Labor Force, 1954, Series P-50, No. 59, April 1955, p. 12.
Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding.

1 Includes all full- and part-time wage and salary workers in nonagricultural establishments who worked
during, or received pay for, any part of the pay period ending nearest the 15th of the month. Excludes
proprietors, self-employed persons, domestic servants, and unpaid family workers. Not comparable with
estimates of nonagricultural employment of the civilian labor force (Table D-17) which include proprietors,
self-employed persons, domestic servants, and unpaid family workers, which count persons as employed
when they are not at work because of industrial disputes, bad weather, etc., and which are based on a
sample survey of households, whereas the estimates in this table are based on reports from employing
establishments.
2
Beginning with 1939, data are not strictly comparable with data shown for earlier years because of the
shift of the automotive repair service industry from the trade to the service division.

Averages are based upon monthly data (exclusive of switching and terminal companies) summarized in
the M-300 report by the ICC and relate to all employees who received pay during the month, except executives, officials, and staff assistants (ICC group I). Beginning September 1949, data reflect a wage rate
increase and reduction in the basic workweek from 48 to 40 hours.
2
Prior to April 1945, data relate to all employees except executives; from April 1945 to May 1949, mainly to
employees subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act; and beginning June 1949, to nonsupervisory employees
only.

NOTE.â€”Data are for production workers in manufacturing and mining, construction workers in building
construction, and for nonsupervisory employees in other industries (except as noted). Data are for payroll periods ending nearest the 15th of the month.
The annual figures for 1958 are simple arithmetic averages of the monthly figures shown and are not
strictly comparable with the averages for earlier years, which have been weighted by data on man-hours.

Excludes agriculture.
Commercial and other includes trade, service, finance, communications, and construction.
3 Annual total is the sum of unadjusted quarterly expenditures; it does not necessarily coincide with the
average of seasonally adjusted figures. See footnote 4.
4
Estimates for fourth quarter 1958 and first quarter 1959 based on anticipated capital expenditures reported by business between late October and early December 1958. The quarterly anticipations include
adjustments, when necessary, for systematic tendencies in anticipatory data.
NOTE.â€”These figures do not agree precisely with the plant and equipment expenditures included in the
gross national product estimates of the Department of Commerce. The main difference lies in the inclusion
in the gross national product of investment by farmers, professionals, and institutions, and of certain outlays charged to current account.
This series is not available for years prior to 1939 and for 1940 to 1944.
Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding.

The series beginning in 1948 are not comparable with the previous years because of changes in definition
for the wholesale series. Beginning in 1951, the estimates of retail sales and inventories are based on a
new method cf estimation adopted by the Bureau of the Census.

Monthly average shown for year and total for month.

4
Inventory/sales ratio. For annual periods, ratio of weighted average inventories to average monthly
sales; for monthly data, ratio of aveiage end of current and previous months' inventories to sales for month.

Preliminary.
NOTE.â€”For a description of the series and their comparability, see Survey of Current Business, September
and November 1952, January 1954, and June 1957 for retail, and August 1957 for manufacturing and
wholesale.
The inventory figures in this table do not agree with the estimates of change in business inventories
included in the gross national product since these figures cover only manufacturing and trade rather
than all business, and show inventories in terms of current book value without adjustment for revaluation.

1 End-of-year, December 1957, June and December 1958 figures are for call dates. Other data (including
those for June 1957) are for the last Wednesday of the month.
2
Data are shown net, i. e., after deduction of valuation reserves. Includes commercial and industrial,
agricultural, security, real estate, bank, consumer, and other loans.
3
Beginning with 1948, data are shown gross of valuation reserves, instead of net as for previous years.
Prior to June 1947 and for months other than June and December, data are estimated on the basis of reported
data for all insured commercial banks and for weekly reporting member banks.
4
Figures in this table are based on book values and relate only to banks within the continental United
States. Therefore, they dp not agree with figures in Table D-49, which are on the basis of par values and
include holdings of banks in United States Territories and possessions.
3
June data are used because complete end-of-year data are not available prior to 1935 for U. S. Government obligations and other securities.
6
Not available.
7
Preliminary; December estimates by Council of Economic Advisers.
NOTE.â€”Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding.

Gross receipts less refunds of receipts and transfers of tax receipts to the Federal old-age and survivors
insurance trust fund, the Federal disability insurance trust fund, the railroad retirement account, and the
highway trust fund.
2
Excludes guaranteed obligations. The change in the public debt from year to year reflects not only
the budget surplus or deficit but also changes in the Treasury's cash balances, the effect of certain trust fund
transactions, and direct borrowing from the public by certain Government enterprises.
3 Estimate.
Â« Estimated by Council of Economic Advisers from data available as of January 15, 1959. May therefore
differ from figures in Treasury Department monthly statement of receipts and expenditures to be released
about January 20, 1959.

For derivation of Federal cash receipts and payments, see Budget of the United States Government for the
Fiscal Year ending June SO, 1960, and Table D-54.
2 Estimated by Council of Economic Advisers from receipts and expenditures in the national income
accounts. Cash receipts consist of personal tax and nontax receipts, indirect business tax and nontax
accruals, and corporate tax accruals adjusted to a collection basis. Cash payments are total expenditures
less Federal grants-in-aid and less contributions for social insurance. (Federal grants-in-aid are therefore
excluded from State and local receipts and payments and included only in Federal payments.) See
Table D-53.

These accounts, like the cash budget, include the transactions of the trust accounts. Unlike both the
conventional budget and the cash statement, they exclude certain capital and lending transactions. In
general, they do net use the cash basis for transactions with business. Instead, corporate profits taxes are
included in receipts on an accrual instead of a cash basis; expenditures are timed with the delivery instead
of the payment for goods and services; and CCC guaranteed price-support crop loans financed by banks are
counted as expenditures when the loans are made, not when CCC redeems them.

Seasonally adjusted annual rates.

Preliminary; fourth quarter estimates by Council of Economic Advisers.
NOTE.â€”Federal grants-in-aid to State and local governments are reflected in Federal expenditures and
State and local receipts and expenditures. Total government receipts and expenditures have been adjusted
to eliminate this duplication.

All corporations in the United States, excluding banks, savings and loan associations, and insurance
companies. Data for 1954-55 are based on Statistics of Income, covering virtually all corporations in the
United States. Statistics of Income data may not be strictly comparable from year to year because of changes
in the tax laws, basis for filing returns, and processing of data for compilation purposes. Data for 1956-58
are estimates based on data compiled from many different sources, including data on corporations registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As more complete data become available, estimates are
revised.
2
Receivables from and payables to U. S. Government do not include amounts offset against each other
on the corporation's books or amounts arising from subcontracting which are not directly due from or to
the U. S. Government. Wherever possible, adjustments have been made to include U. S. Government
advances offset against inventories on the corporation's books.
3
Includes marketable securities other than U. S. Government.

Farm population as denned by Department of Agriculture and Department of Commerce, i. e., civilian population living on farms, both urban and rural, regardless of occupation.
2
Total population as of July 1 including armed forces overseas.
3 Net change for year beginning in April, estimated by Department of Agriculture. For 1940 and subsequent years, includes inductions and enlistments into the armed forces, and persons returning from the
armed forces. For all years, includes persons who have not moved but who are in and out of the farm population because agricultural operations have begun or have ceased on the place where they are living.
4
Includes persons doing farm work on all farms. These data, published by the Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Marketing Service, differ from those on agricultural employment by the Department
of Commerce, Bureau of the Census (see Table D-17) because of differences in the method of approach, in
concepts of employment, and in time of month for which the data are collected. For further explanation,
see monthly reports on Farm Labor by the Department of Agriculture.
3
Weighted average of all farm wage rates on a per-hour basis.

Totals for each exporting area include amounts for which destinations are not specified in sources, and
therefore exceed sums of destination details.
2
Excludes U. S. military aid exports.
3
Excludes U. S. "special category" shipments for which destination details are withheld on security
grounds. Figures for 1956 and for 1956-57 changes are based upon the "special category" coverage in effect
until mid-1957, while 1957-58 changes are computed from revised data reflecting the more limited "special
category" coverage subsequently in effect.
4 Less than $500,000.
NOTE.â€”Data exclude exports of U. S. S. R. and Soviet bloc countries to each other.
Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding.
