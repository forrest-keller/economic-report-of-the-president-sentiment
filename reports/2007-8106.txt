ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT

To the Congress of the United States:

Economic growth in the United States has been above the historic
average and faster than any other major industrialized economy in the
world. January was the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth produced
by this economy, in an expansion that has thus far added more than
7.4 million new jobs. Unemployment is low, inflation is moderate, and real
wages are rising. Our economy is on the move and we can keep it that way
by continuing to pursue sound economic policy based on free-market
principles.
Sound economic policy begins with low taxes. We should work together
to spend the taxpayers’ money wisely and to tackle unfunded liabilities
inherent in entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and
Medicaid. I have laid out a detailed plan in my budget to restrain spending,
cut earmarks in half by the end of this session, and balance the budget by
2012 without raising taxes. The tax relief of the past few years has been a
key ingredient in growing our economy, and it should be made permanent.
Our growing economy is dynamic. The rise of new technologies, new
competition, and new markets abroad is changing how we do business. We
need to take action in four key areas to keep America’s economy flexible
and dynamic.
First, we must break down barriers to trade so our workers can sell more
goods and services to the 95 percent of the world’s customers who live
outside of our borders. Global trade talks like the Doha Round at the
World Trade Organization have the potential to level the playing field so
that we can compete on fair terms in foreign markets, while helping lift
millions of people out of poverty around the world.

Economic Report of the President

The only way we can complete the Doha Round and make headway on
other trade agreements is to extend Trade Promotion Authority, which is set
to expire on July 1st. This authority is essential to completing good trade
agreements. The Congress must renew it if we are to improve our
competitiveness in the global economy.
Second, we must work to make private health insurance more affordable
and to give patients more choices and control over their health care. One of
the most promising ways to do this is by reforming the tax code. We must
end the unfair bias against individuals who buy insurance on their own. I
propose creating a standard deduction for every American who buys health
insurance, whether they get it through their jobs or on their own. In a
changing economy, we need a health care system that is flexible and
consumer-oriented. With this reform, more than 100 million Americans
who are now covered by employer-provided insurance will benefit from
lower tax bills. Those who now purchase health insurance on their own
would save money on their taxes. Millions of others who now have no health
insurance at all would find basic private coverage within their reach. My
proposal also taps the innovation of States in making basic, affordable insurance available to all by creating Affordable Choices grants to help ensure the
poor and the sick have access to private health insurance.
Third, we must continue to diversify our energy supply to benefit our
economy, national security, and environment. In my State of the Union
Message, I set an ambitious goal of reducing gasoline usage in the United
States by 20 percent over the next 10 years. Meeting this goal will require
significant changes in supply and demand, but we should let the market
decide the best mix of technologies and fuels to most efficiently attain it. On
the supply side, I propose a higher and reformed fuel standard that would
include renewable and other alternative fuels. We should also allow environmentally friendly exploration of oil and natural gas. On the demand side, I
propose enhancing Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for cars and
extending the current rule for light trucks, so that we can reduce the amount
of gasoline that our passenger vehicles consume, and do so in a more
efficient way.

4 | Economic Report of the President

Fourth, a strong and vibrant education system is vital to maintaining our
Nation’s competitive edge in the world and extending economic opportunity
to every citizen here at home. Five years ago, we rose above partisan differences to enact the No Child Left Behind Act, preserving local control,
raising standards, holding schools accountable for results, and providing
more choice. This year, we must reauthorize and strengthen this good law
while preserving its core principles.
Strong productivity growth underlies much of the good economic news
from the past few years and the policies discussed above. Productivity
growth helps to increase our standards of living and improve our international competitiveness. To maintain this progress, we must pursue a variety
of pro-growth policies, including those contained in the American
Competitiveness Initiative and comprehensive immigration reform.
These and other issues are discussed in the 2007 Annual Report of the
Council of Economic Advisers. The Council has prepared this Report to put
into broader context the economic issues that underlie my Administration’s
policy decisions. I commend it to you.

Overview

T

he U.S. economy continues to exhibit robust growth, with a strong labor
market and moderate inflation (see Chapter 1). These accomplishments
are supported by rapid productivity growth that makes our economy one of
the most dynamic and resilient in the world. Productivity growth is a
common thread that ties nearly all positive economic news together and plays
a central role in our international competitiveness.
Much of this Report explores the role of productivity and productivityrelated issues in the continuing expansion of the U.S. economy. Policymakers
face a challenge: productivity growth is important for economic growth and
many of the underlying issues that they are trying to solve, but there is no
single cause of productivity and no single policy to spur its growth (see
Chapter 2). Tax policy can be structured to encourage productivity growth
(see Chapter 3). Entitlement programs, on the other hand, may indirectly
weigh on productivity growth if not reformed (see Chapter 4). Open
commerce and financial markets allow productivity to flourish (see Chapters
7-9). Economists discuss productivity growth using macroeconomic data, but
its result is most importantly seen in increases in individual Americans’
standards of living.

Chapter 1: The Year in Review and the Years Ahead
The economic expansion continued for the fifth consecutive year in 2006.
This economic growth comes despite numerous headwinds, and results from
inherent U.S. economic strengths and pro-growth policies. Chapter 1 reviews
the past year and discusses the Administration’s forecast for the years ahead.
The key points are:
• Real GDP posted above-average 3.4 percent growth in 2006. The
composition of growth changed, with more coming from exports and
business structures investment, while residential investment flipped from
contributing to GDP growth in 2005 to subtracting from it in 2006.
Consumer spending remained strong.
• Labor markets continued to strengthen, with the unemployment rate
dropping to 4.6 percent and payroll job growth averaging 187,000 per
month. Real average hourly earnings accelerated to a 1.7 percent increase
during the 12 months of 2006.
• Energy prices rose sharply in the first half of the year, but then declined
just as sharply in the second half.
17

Chapter 2: Productivity Growth
Productivity growth rarely makes the headlines, but is important to the
Nation because higher productivity growth improves the outlook for
economic issues such as standards of living, inflation, international competitiveness, and long-run demographic challenges. Chapter 2 reviews the sources
of the recent strength in productivity growth, highlighting the role that
flexible markets and entrepreneurship play in explaining cross-country differences. It also explains the benefits of productivity growth and discusses how
policymakers can further promote it. The key points are:
• Recent productivity growth has been primarily driven by efficiency
growth (growth in how well labor and capital inputs are used) and by
capital deepening (growth in the amount of capital that workers have
available for use).
• Openness to international trade and investment, and improvements in
the education and training of the U.S. workforce, will continue to be
important to long-run productivity growth.
• Policies that encourage capital accumulation, research and development,
and increases in the quality of our education system can boost productivity growth.

Chapter 3: Pro-Growth Tax Policy
Chapter 3 discusses the advantages of adopting a more pro-growth tax
system. It reviews recent changes that have reduced tax distortions on capital
investment decisions, and evaluates options to reduce such distortions further.
The key points are:
• The goal of pro-growth tax policy is to reduce tax distortions that
hamper economic growth. Most economists agree that lower taxes on
capital income stimulate greater investment, resulting in greater
economic growth, greater international competitiveness, and higher
standards of living.
• The tax code contains provisions that discourage investment and create
distortions that affect the level, distribution, and financing of capital
investment.
• Estimates from research suggest that removing these tax distortions to
investment decisions could increase real gross domestic product (GDP)
by as much as 8 percent in the long run.
• Since 2001, temporary changes in the tax code have reduced the tax on
investment. These pro-growth policies have stimulated short-run investment and economic growth. However, the temporary nature of the
provisions eliminates desirable long-run economic stimulus.

18 | Economic Report of the President

Chapter 4:
The Fiscal Challenges Facing Medicare
Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are three entitlement programs in
the United States that provide people with important economic security
against financial risk. However, the projected long-term growth in entitlement spending is unsustainable because of the pressure it puts on future
Federal budgets. It is crucial that reforms to these programs preserve the
protection against financial risk that these programs provide without having
negative effects on economic growth. Chapter 4 focuses on Medicare by
examining the main reasons for its projected financial pressures and by
discussing ways to improve the efficiency of the program and thus slow the
growth of Medicare spending. The key points are:
• Medicare spending is growing quickly, primarily because of the demographic shift to an older society and the increases in per-beneficiary
medical spending driven largely by new technologies.
• Rewarding providers for supplying higher-quality care and improving
incentives for patients to choose higher-value care can both increase the
efficiency and slow the growth of Medicare spending.

Chapter 5: Catastrophe Risk Insurance
Insuring economic losses arising from large-scale natural and manmade
catastrophes such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and terrorist attacks poses challenges for the insurance industry and for Federal and State governments.
Chapter 5 examines the economics of catastrophe risk insurance. The key
points are:
• In insurance markets, as in other markets, prices affect how people weigh
costs and benefits. Artificially low insurance prices can discourage people
from adequately protecting against future losses. For example, subsidized
property insurance prices may stimulate excessive building in high-risk
areas, potentially driving up future government disaster relief spending.
• Government intervention in insurance markets can have unintended
consequences, such as limiting the availability of insurance offered by
private firms.
• Insurers manage catastrophe losses by being selective about which risks
to insure, designing insurance contracts to provide incentives for riskreducing behavior, and charging prices that are high enough to enable
them to diversify risk over time or transfer risk to third parties. By
managing and pricing risk more effectively, government insurance
programs can reduce the burden they impose on taxpayers and minimize
negative effects on private insurance markets.

Chapter 6: The Transportation Sector:
Energy and Infrastructure Use
The transportation sector accounts for the majority of the petroleum consumed
in the United States and—whether plane, train, ship, or automobile—
almost all transportation is powered by petroleum. Understanding the
petroleum market, and the ways in which consumers and firms respond to
changes in world oil prices, is key to understanding the transportation sector.
In addition to petroleum, the transportation sector also relies heavily on
infrastructure. The key points of Chapter 6 are:
• Recent increases in the price of oil and the external costs of oil have led
to renewed interest by markets and governments in the development of
new alternatives. Government can play a role in ensuring that external
costs are taken into account by markets, but ultimately markets are best
suited to decide how to respond.
• Cars and light trucks are the largest users of petroleum. As a result, the
fuel economy of the vehicles purchased and the number of miles that
they are driven have a large effect on oil consumption.
• Congestion is a growing problem in American urban areas. Cities and States
have shown a growing interest in and capacity for setting prices for road use
during peak periods to reduce the full economic costs of congestion.

Chapter 7: Currency Markets
The need for international transactions provides the impetus for a huge,
well-functioning market that facilitates currency conversions and allows
global economic integration and trade to occur smoothly and quickly at low
cost. Both by volume of trade and ease of making transactions, currency
markets today are the world’s deepest, most liquid markets. Currency markets
range from common markets where parties simply exchange one currency for
another to sophisticated markets where parties buy and sell currencies far into
the future. The key points of Chapter 7 are:
• Foreign-exchange markets allow firms to trade goods and services across
borders, and to manage the risks they face from fluctuations in the price
of their domestic currency.
• As with any other good, the exchange value of a currency is determined by
its supply, as well as the demand for the country’s assets, goods, and services.
• Over much of the 20th century, countries tended to favor fixed exchange
rates, but in recent decades there has been a shift toward freely floating
exchange rates.
• Monetary and exchange-rate policies are tightly linked. A nation’s
government must decide between controlling its exchange rate and
controlling its domestic inflation rate.
20 | Economic Report of the President

Chapter 8: International Trade and Investment
The United States derives substantial benefits from open trade and investment flows. Over many decades, increased trade and investment liberalization
has been an important catalyst for greater productivity growth and rising
average living standards in the United States. The key points of Chapter 8 are:
• Looking ahead, international trade liberalization in services presents
significant opportunities for U.S. workers, firms, and consumers.
• Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into the United States benefit the
U.S. economy by stimulating growth, creating jobs, promoting research
and development that spurs innovation, and financing the current
account deficit.
• U.S. direct investment abroad is an important channel of global market
access for U.S. firms. U.S. multinational companies have contributed to
productivity growth, job creation, and rising average living standards in
the United States.

Chapter 9: Immigration
The United States is a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws, and we
value both historical legacies. Immigrants continue to make positive contributions to our Nation and our economy, yet our current immigration laws
have proven difficult to enforce and are not fully serving the needs of the
American economy. The key points of Chapter 9 are:
• International differences in economic opportunities and standards of
living create strong incentives for labor migration. Once established,
migration flows from a certain region tend to be self-perpetuating.
• Foreign-born workers make significant contributions to the American
economy, but not all Americans gain economically from immigration.
Foreign-born workers tend to be concentrated at the low end and the
high end of the educational spectrum relative to native-born workers.
• Immigration policy plays a key role in determining the volume and
composition of the foreign-born workforce. Comprehensive immigration reform can help ensure an orderly, lawful flow of foreign-born
workers whose presence continues to benefit the American economy.

The Year in Review and the Years Ahead

T

he expansion of the U.S economy continued for the fifth consecutive
year in 2006. Economic growth was strong, with real gross domestic
product (GDP) growing at 3.4 percent during the four quarters of 2006. This
strong economic growth comes in the face of numerous headwinds and
resulted from the inherent strengths of the U.S. economy and pro-growth
policies such as tax relief, regulatory restraint, and opening foreign markets to
U.S. goods and services. Growth in the first quarter rebounded from the
effects of the 2005 hurricanes, including a recovery in consumer confidence
and consumer spending, and the rebuilding of oil and natural gas infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico. Although growth slowed in the middle two
quarters of the year, the overall pace of real activity was strong in the face of
near-record inflation-adjusted prices of crude oil and a sharp decline in home
construction. On the inflation front, energy prices fell substantially towards
the end of the year, allowing overall consumer price inflation to moderate in
2006; however, price inflation increased for goods and services other than
food and energy. In response to these output and inflation developments, the
Federal Reserve continued raising the federal funds rate through June, and
then held it constant for the rest of the year. The Administration forecast calls
for the economic expansion to continue in 2007, but we must continue to
pursue pro-growth policies such as those designed to keep tax relief in place,
restrain government spending, slow the rate of health care inflation, enhance
national energy security, and expand free and fair trade.
This chapter reviews the economic developments of 2006 and discusses the
Administration’s forecast for the years ahead. The key points of this chapter are:
• Real GDP posted strong 3.4 percent growth in 2006, up from the
3.1 percent 2005 pace. The composition of aggregate demand changed
from preceding years. More growth came from exports and business
structures investment, while residential investment flipped from
contributing to GDP growth in 2005 to subtracting from it in 2006.
• Labor markets continued to strengthen, with the unemployment rate
descending to 41⁄2 percent in the fourth quarter , and payroll job growth
averaging 187,000 per month.
• Energy prices, which rose through August and then declined, dominated
the movement of overall inflation in the consumer price index. Core
inflation (which excludes food and energy inflation) moved up from
2.2 percent during the 12 months of 2005 to 2.6 percent in 2006, with
much of this upward trend due to an acceleration in the amount that
23

renters pay for apartments and other rental properties and the estimated
rent on owner-occupied housing. Energy prices fell sharply from September
through October, and core inflation fell toward the end of the year.
• Real average hourly earnings accelerated to a 1.7 percent increase during
the 12 months of 2006, reflecting solid labor markets combined with
tamer energy prices.
• The Administration’s forecast calls for the economic expansion to
continue in 2007 and beyond, although the pace of expansion is
projected to slow somewhat from the stronger growth of recent years.
The unemployment rate is projected to edge up slightly in 2007, while
remaining below 5 percent. Real GDP growth is projected to continue
at around 3 percent in 2008 and thereafter, while the unemployment
rate is projected to remain stable and below 5 percent.

Developments in 2006
and the Near-Term Outlook
The economy went through a period of rebalancing during 2006, with
faster growth in business structures investment and exports partially offsetting
pronounced declines in homebuilding. At the same time, consumer spending
continued to grow.

Consumer Spending and Saving
Consumer spending sustained its strong growth during the four quarters
of 2006 (rising 3.7 percent in real terms), continuing its 15-year pattern of
rising faster than disposable income. Several factors helped to keep spending
elevated, and as a result, kept saving down (according to the official definition
in the national income and product accounts (NIPA)). These factors included
rising energy costs (through the third quarter), rising wealth, and falling
unemployment rates. As a result, the personal saving rate fell to a negative
1.0 percent for the year as a whole—its lowest annual level during the postWorld War II era. Despite the negative saving rate, Americans continue to
build wealth in the form of capital gains (the rise in asset prices), which are
not included in the definition of saving in the NIPAs. The declining saving
rate continues a long-term trend which began in the 1980s.

Energy Expenditures
World demand for crude oil increased from 79.74 million barrels per day in
2003 to 84.18 million barrels per day during the first three quarters of 2006.
The United States accounted for about one-eighth (0.5 million barrels per day)
of this higher (4.4 million barrel per day) pace of crude oil consumption. Most
24 | Economic Report of the President

of this increase in world demand was accounted for by non-OECD countries
(up 4.1 million barrels per day). Consumption of the non-U.S. OECD countries fell 0.2 million barrels per day. In the face of this increase in world oil
demand, the supply available to U.S. consumers was restrained, and consumers
paid higher prices to maintain their consumption.
With the rise in energy prices, nominal energy purchases rose sharply. That
consumers altered their spending patterns only slightly contributed to the fall
in the saving rate. Consumer energy prices increased 29 percent relative to
nonenergy prices (according to the NIPA price indexes) from the fourth
quarter of 2003 to the fourth quarter of 2006, while real consumption of
energy per household fell only slightly, by 2.1 percent. Between 2004 and
2006, consumers appear to have maintained both energy and nonenergy
consumption by reducing their saving. Consumers’ response to persistently
high energy prices is likely to emerge gradually, as consumers economize on
energy consumption and possibly on nonenergy consumption.

Wealth Effects on Consumption and Saving
The rise in household wealth has also played a role in the decline of the
saving rate. During the late 1990s and again during the past 3 years, a strong
rise in household net worth coincided with a sizeable increase in consumer
spending relative to disposable personal income (see Chart 1-1).

Chapter 1

| 25

Despite the negative saving rate during 2006, Americans continued to build
wealth because of capital gains. During the four quarters ending in the third
quarter of 2006, the household wealth-to-income ratio increased 0.04 years,
to 5.63 years of income. (The units of the wealth-to-income ratio are years
because wealth is measured in dollars while income is measured in dollars per
year. That is, total household wealth in the third quarter of 2006 represents the
equivalent of 5.63 years of accumulated income.) More than half of the
increase during these four quarters was accounted for by an increase in stock
market wealth. Housing wealth (net of mortgage debt) also edged up relative
to income over these four quarters, but by much less than its increases during
the preceding 2 years. By the third quarter of 2006, the overall wealth-toincome ratio was well above the ratio over most of the past 50 years.

Personal and National Saving
Consumer responses to the rise in energy prices and increases in the wealthto-income ratio lowered the personal saving rate to negative 1.0 percent in
2006. The personal saving rate, the rate at which households save, has been
declining since the mid-1980s.
Corporate net saving takes the form of retained earnings which are not paid
out to shareholders. (Net saving excludes funds used to replace worn out
capital goods.) Retained earnings add to the wealth of corporate shareholders
and supply funds for new investment. Corporate net saving rose to
3.8 percent of gross domestic income (GDI) during the first three quarters of
2006, its highest level since the 1960s. (GDI is the economy-wide sum of all
sources of income and differs from GDP only by measurement error.) But
even with these high levels of net corporate saving, net private saving (the sum
of personal and corporate saving) was only 3.1 percent of GDI during the first
three quarters of 2006, near its lowest level in the post-war period.
A still broader measure of net saving—net national saving—is the sum of
government and private (personal plus corporate) net saving. When the
Federal government runs a deficit (spends more than it collects in tax
revenue), Federal saving is negative, as it was in 2006. Because the Federal
deficit declined substantially in 2006, and because corporate saving rose, net
national saving (which was negligible in 2005) rose to 2.0 percent of GDI
during the first three quarters of 2006, its highest level since early 2002. Gross
national saving, which includes funds for replacing worn out capital goods, is
higher than net saving (13.8 percent versus 2.0 percent during the first three
quarters of 2006), but shows similar historical fluctuations.

Projected Consumer Spending
Looking ahead, real consumer spending during the four quarters of 2007 is
expected to grow less than 3 percent, down from an average of 3.5 percent
during the past 3 years. This projected rate is slightly less than the projected
26 | Economic Report of the President

2007 growth of real disposable personal income (household income less taxes,
adjusted for inflation), and so the saving rate is forecasted to edge up. During
the longer term, real consumption is projected to increase at about the same
pace as real GDP and real income.

Housing Prices
Nationally, housing prices increased less in 2006 than in 2005. An inflationadjusted version of the housing price index (the nominal version of which is
compiled by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight from new
home sales and appraisals during refinancing) increased at an average annual
rate of 6.4 percent from 2000 to 2005, and then slowed to a 2.6 percent
annual rate of increase in the first three quarters of 2006. (These inflationadjusted prices are deflated by the consumer price index.) Looking back, the
cumulative increase in inflation-adjusted housing prices during the 6 years
from 1999 to 2005 is one of the largest on record, exceeded only by the
period immediately following the Second World War. Since 1929, periods of
rising real prices have been linked to increases in the share of the gross
national product allocated to home construction (see Chart 1-2). The
6.4 percent annual rate of increase in the relative price of housing from 2000
to 2005 was associated with an increase in the residential construction share
of GDP from 4.6 percent to 6.2 percent.

Chapter 1

| 27

Although relative housing prices (that is relative to the consumer price
index (CPI)) increased in almost all metropolitan areas during the 5 years
from 2000 to 2005, the increases were concentrated in a few high-profile
markets; increases in most areas were only modest. For example, real prices in
Los Angeles increased at a 14.3 percent annual rate, but real price increases in
71 percent of metropolitan areas were less than the 6.4 percent national
average. Most house price changes reflect local conditions (such as local
economic and population growth, tastes, and geographic and zoning limitations on construction). In areas with restricted supply, small changes in
demand may translate into large price changes.
Although house-price increases during these 5 years were concentrated in a
few markets, the decline in mortgage rates from 2000 to 2005 was one
common factor that may have helped raise home prices across the nation.
Because of the drop in mortgage rates, prices could increase 4.4 percent per
year during this period without raising the monthly mortgage payment.

Residential Investment
Every major measure of housing activity dropped sharply during 2006, and
the drop in real residential construction was steeper than anticipated in last
year’s Report. New home sales fell 27 percent from a peak in October 2005
through July 2006, a period when rates on conventional mortgages moved up
about 70 basis points. (A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage
point.) Sales then edged up during the 5 months from August through
December, when mortgage rates dipped lower. Builders reacted sharply to the
early-2006 drop in sales so that housing starts, which peaked at an annual rate
of 2.27 million units in the beginning of the year, fell to slightly more than
1.6 million units by the end of the year. The drop in home construction
activity subtracted roughly 0.7 percentage point from the annual rate of real
GDP growth in the second quarter, and 1.2 percentage points in the second
half of the year. Furthermore, even if housing starts level off at their current
pace, normal lags between the beginning and completion of a construction
project imply that residential investment will subtract from GDP growth
during the first half of 2007.
During 2006, employment in residential construction fell, as did production
of construction materials and products associated with new home sales (such
as furniture, large appliances, and carpeting). Yet despite these housing sector
declines, the overall economy continued to expand (see Box 1-1).

28 | Economic Report of the President

Box 1-1: Indirect Effects of the Housing Sector
Thus far, the sharp drop in homebuilding has had few consequences
for the rest of the economy. Employment fell in sectors related to new
home construction and housing sales. Despite these repercussions,
overall payroll employment continued to increase, the unemployment
rate continued to fall, and real consumer spending continued to move
upward through the end of 2006.
Although residential investment fell sharply, real GDP growth during
2006 was sustained by increases in other forms of investment. As can
be seen in the chart below, private nominal nonresidential construction
(that is, business construction of office buildings, shopping centers,
factories, and other business structures) grew rapidly in the first three
quarters of the year and moved up a bit further in the fourth quarter.
Nonresidential construction draws from some of the same resources
(such as construction labor and materials) as the residential construction sector. The high level of residential investment during the past
couple of years may have limited the growth of investment in nonresidential structures. While the case for housing crowding out other
sectors is strongest for nonresidential investment, residential investment competes with all other sectors of production in credit and labor
markets. A drop in the share of the economy engaged in housing could
provide some room for other sectors to grow.

| 29

Box 1-1 — continued
The housing market could also affect the rest of the economy
through the wealth channel. That is, declines in housing prices could
reduce household net worth and thereby reduce consumption. The
increase in housing prices during 2000–2005 contributed noticeably to
the gain in the ratio of household wealth to income (shown earlier in
chart 1-1) and supported growth in consumer spending. Some of this
support may have been facilitated by homeowners taking out larger
mortgages after their homes appreciated in value. In contrast, housing
wealth decelerated in the second and third quarters of 2006, while the
stock market accounted for most of the gain in the wealth-to-income
ratio. Thus far, national measures of housing prices have not declined,
and negative effects through the wealth channel have not occurred.

In addition to incomes and mortgage rates, the number of homes built is
underpinned by demographics. Homebuilding during 2004 and 2005 averaged about 2.0 million units per year, in excess of the roughly
1.8-to-1.9-million unit annual pace of starts that is consistent with the pace
of household formation implied by demographic models. As a result, the pace
of homebuilding will tend to be drawn below this level for long enough so
that the above-trend production of 2004 and 2005 will be offset by belowtrend production. The construction of new homes has fallen rapidly, however,
and this offset may well be complete sometime during 2007. Looking further
ahead, the residential sector is not expected to make noticeable positive
contributions to real GDP growth until 2008 and beyond.

Business Fixed Investment
During 2006, real business investment in equipment and software grew
5 percent, slower than the 7 percent average pace during the 3 previous years.
Its fastest-growing components included computers, as well as machinery
in the agricultural and service sectors. Investment in mining and oil field
machinery was also strong, likely in response to elevated crude oil prices, and
to the need to replace Gulf of Mexico facilities damaged by the 2005 hurricanes. Investment in heavy trucks has been solid throughout 2006 as trucking
firms have been buying in advance of new environmental regulations (on
particulate matter emissions issued in 2000 that became effective in 2007),
which will raise heavy truck prices in 2007. Aircraft investment, however,
declined sharply for the second consecutive year. Software investment posted
a strong 7.9 percent gain in 2006, but since 2000, it has grown at only a 3.7
percent annual rate, a noticeable deceleration from the roughly 16 percent
annual rate of growth during the 1990s.
30 | Economic Report of the President

The turnaround in investment in business structures (that is, nonresidential
construction) during 2006 has been dramatic, with growth at 12 percent, up
from an anemic 2 percent gain during 2005. Growth in 2006 was strongest
for office buildings, multi-merchandise centers, lodging facilities, and recreational structures. Investment in petroleum and natural gas structures also
grew rapidly, reflecting high petroleum and natural gas prices and the reconstruction of the Gulf of Mexico capacity. Investment continued to fall,
however, in air transportation structures and medical buildings.
Business investment growth is projected to remain strong in 2007, somewhere
in the neighborhood of the 9 percent annual rate of growth during the first
three quarters of 2006. Continued growth in output combined with a tight
labor market are expected to maintain strong demand for new capital equipment at the same time as corporations are flush with funds for these
investments. The financial environment for these investments is favorable.
Cash flow (the internally generated funds that are available for corporate
investment) was at a record 10.3 percent average share of GDP in the first
three quarters of 2006, while nonresidential investment (at 10.5 percent of
GDP) was close to its historical average. In the longer run, business investment is projected to grow only slightly above the growth rate of real GDP.

Business Inventories
Inventory investment was fairly steady during 2006, and had only a minor
influence on quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. Real nonfarm inventories grew
at an average $44 billion annual pace during 2006, a 3.0 percent rate of
growth that is roughly in line with the pace of real GDP growth over the same
period. Coming off a long-term decline, the inventory-to-sales ratio for
manufacturing and trade (in current dollars) remained relatively flat during
the first half of the year, but began to pick up in August.
Inventory investment is projected to be approximately stable during the
next several years, as is generally the case for periods of stable growth. The
overall inventory-to-sales ratio is expected to continue trending lower.

Government Purchases
Real Federal consumption and gross investment grew 2.4 percent during
2006. This was the third consecutive year of growth at roughly 2 percent.
Defense spending accounted for all of the increase during the four-quarter
period, while nondefense purchases fell. The quarterly pattern of these Federal
purchases has been volatile with sizeable increases in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Most of the first-quarter surge was in defense components.
Federal outlays (which include purchases, investment, and transfers such as
Social Security) were boosted by a $111 billion appropriation in fiscal year
Chapter 1

| 31

(FY) 2006 for reconstruction and relief efforts arising from the 2005
hurricanes. In addition, the supplemental defense spending package for ongoing operations in Afghanistan and Iraq was $70 billion for FY 2006 and
was passed in mid-June. An additional $70 billion emergency funding was
provided in the regular defense appropriation act passed at the end of
September 2006. Another supplemental appropriation for defense is likely for
FY 2007.
Nominal Federal revenues grew 15 percent in FY 2005 and 12 percent in
FY 2006. These rapid growth rates exceeded growth in outlays and GDP as a
whole, and the U.S. fiscal deficit as a share of GDP shrank from 3.6 percent
in FY 2004 to 2.6 percent in FY 2005 to 1.9 percent in FY 2006.
State and local government purchases rose 3 percent during 2006, up
noticeably from rates below 1 percent during each of the 3 previous years. In
the wake of the 2001 recession, this sector fell sharply into deficit in 2002.
Revenues began to recover in 2003, and by the first half of 2006 the sector
was out of deficit, allowing for an increase in state and local consumption and
investment. This pattern of delayed response to downturns resembles the past
several business-cycle recoveries.

Exports and Imports
Real exports of goods and services grew 9.2 percent during 2006, up from
the 6.7 percent export growth over the four quarters of 2005. This acceleration reflects rapid growth among our trading partners. Real GDP among our
OECD trading partners grew 2.9 percent during the four quarters of 2005,
and is estimated to have grown at the same pace in 2006. In addition, the
economies of some of our major non-OECD trading partners such as China,
Singapore, and India are growing at rates of 7 to 10 percent per year, although
these countries comprise only about 7 percent of our exports.
The fastest growth in U.S. goods and services exports was to India, but
exports to China, Africa, and Latin America also grew rapidly. Despite the
rapid export growth to these emerging economies, the European Union (EU)
remains the major export destination, consuming nearly 25 percent of our
exports. Within the EU, Great Britain’s imports of American goods and services grew at a notable 18 percent annual rate during the first three quarters
of 2006.
Real imports grew 3.1 percent in 2006, a slower pace than the 5.2 percent
increase over the four quarters of 2005. Petroleum imports, which grew
strongly in the fourth quarter of 2005 to replace production losses after
the hurricanes, declined 10 percent during the four quarters of 2006. Real
imports of nonpetroleum goods grew 5.3 percent over the same period, down
slightly from the year-earlier pace.

32 | Economic Report of the President

The current account deficit (the excess of imports and income flows to
foreigners over exports and foreign income of Americans) jumped to 7.0 percent
of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005, partly due to petroleum imports that
replaced lost Gulf of Mexico production. The current account deficit then
retraced some of its earlier increase in the first three quarters of 2006, when
oil imports declined. It appears to have fallen further in the fourth quarter,
reflecting the drop in prices of imported crude oil. Current account deficits
mean that domestic investment continues to exceed domestic saving, with
foreigners financing the gap between the two.

Employment
Nonfarm payroll employment increased 2.2 million during the 12 months
of 2006, an average pace of about 187,000 jobs per month. The unemployment rate declined by 0.4 percentage point during the 12 months of the year
to 4.5 percent. The average unemployment rate in 2006 (4.6 percent) was
below the averages of the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s.
Job gains were spread broadly across major sectors in 2006, with the natural
resource and mining sector (which includes oil and natural gas extraction)
experiencing the fastest growth rate (8.1 percent), likely due to increased
demand for energy products. The service-providing sector accounted for
95 percent of job growth during the 12 months of 2006, a slightly larger
contribution than would be suggested by its 83-percent share of overall
employment. Within the service-providing sector, 24 percent of job growth
was in professional and business service jobs. As noted, the service-providing
sector accounted for almost all of the 2006 job gains. The goods-producing
sector accounted for the remaining 5 percent of the gains (notably weaker than
its 17-percent share of overall employment), a continuation of the long-term
trend under which the goods-producing share of total employment has fallen
in each of the past five decades. Within the goods-producing sector, employment growth during 2006 was concentrated in mining and construction, while
manufacturing employment decreased for the ninth consecutive year.
Jobless rates fell among most major demographic segments of the population
during the 12 months of 2006. The unemployment rate dropped for each of the
four educational-attainment groups (less than high school, high school, some
college, and college graduates). For the second consecutive year, the drop in the
unemployment rate was most pronounced among those without a high school
degree. After falling 0.8 percentage point during 2005 (when the overall rate fell
0.5 percentage point), the jobless rate in this group fell another 0.7 percentage
point during the 12 months of 2006 (when the overall unemployment rate fell
0.4 percentage point). By race and ethnicity, the unemployment rate fell the

Chapter 1

| 33

most during 2006 among Asians, Hispanics and blacks (1.4, 1.1 and 0.9
percentage points), in contrast to 0.2 percentage point for whites. By age, the
jobless rate fell most among workers 25 to 34 years old. By sex, the jobless rate
fell more among adult women than adult men.
Furthermore, the median duration of unemployment, an indicator that
typically follows the business cycle with a substantial lag, declined from its
December 2005 level of 8.5 weeks to a December 2006 level of 7.3 weeks,
close to its historical average. The number of long-term unemployed (those
out of work for more than 26 weeks) fell by 263,000 during the year.
The Administration projects that employment will increase at a pace of
129,000 jobs per month on average during the four quarters of 2007. In the
long run the pace of employment growth will slow, reflecting the aging of the
population and the diminishing rates of labor force growth. The Administration
also projects the unemployment rate will average 4.6 percent over 2007, before
edging up to 4.8 percent in 2008 and beyond.

Productivity
Labor productivity growth usually increases during the early stage of a
business-cycle recovery but then falls somewhat as the cycle matures. Early in
this most recent expansion, productivity grew at a remarkable 3.9 percent
annual rate for the years 2002 and 2003 and then slowed to a 2.6 percent
annual rate for the years 2004 and 2005. Overall productivity has grown at a
vigorous 3.1 percent annual rate from the business-cycle peak in the first
quarter of 2001 until the third quarter of 2006.
Although 1995 has been regarded as a watershed year for productivity
because of the acceleration of productivity from a 1.5 percent to a 2.4 percent
annual rate of growth, the further acceleration to a 3.1 percent annual rate of
growth during 2001 to 2006 is striking, especially given a flat or diminished
contribution from capital deepening (the increase in capital services per hour
worked). (The time periods referred to are those shown in Table 1-2 later in this
chapter.) The 1995–2001 acceleration may be plausibly accounted for by a
pickup in capital deepening and by increases in organizational capital, the
investments businesses make to reorganize and restructure themselves, in this
instance in response to newly installed information technology. In contrast,
capital deepening does not explain any of the post-2001 increase in productivity
growth. The post-2001 acceleration in productivity therefore appears to be
accounted for by factors that are more difficult to measure than the quantity of
capital, such as continuing improvements in technology and business practices.
(See Chapter 2, Productivity Growth for an extended discussion of this.)

34 | Economic Report of the President

Rather than assuming that the recent remarkable pace of productivity
growth will continue, the Administration believes it is prudent to build a
budget based on a forecast somewhat lower that the 3.1-percent pace of
productivity growth since 2001. Productivity growth is projected to average
2.6 percent per year during the 6-year span of the budget projection—
roughly equal to the average annual pace during the past decade.

Prices and Wages
As measured by the consumer price index (CPI), overall inflation fell from
3.4 percent during the 12 months of 2005 to 2.5 percent during 2006
(Chart 1-3). The drop in overall CPI inflation was almost entirely due to the
deceleration of energy prices from a 17.1-percent increase in 2005 to a 2.9percent increase in 2006. Food prices increased 2.1 percent during 2006,
similar to the pace of the previous year. Core CPI prices (that is, excluding
food and energy) increased 2.6 percent during 2006, up from a 2.2-percent
increase a year earlier.

Chapter 1

| 35

After rising sharply during 2004 and 2005, prices of petroleum products
slowed to a 6.1 percent increase during the 12 months of 2006, as the sharp
rise through August was reversed later in the year. Prices of natural gas, which
had risen sharply during 2005, fell 14 percent during 2006. As of midJanuary 2007, prices in futures markets suggested that crude oil prices will rise
modestly during 2007, while natural gas prices will increase substantially.
The 0.4 percentage point acceleration of core CPI prices was accounted for
primarily by rent of shelter (which consists primarily of rent paid by renters
and by the rent on owner-occupied dwellings), which accelerated to a
4.3 percent rate of increase during the 12 months of 2006 from 2.7 percent
in 2005. Some of the acceleration in core CPI prices may also have been a
delayed reaction to the rapid increase in energy prices from mid-2003 to mid2006, as the higher energy prices were absorbed into the prices of every service
and commodity that requires inputs of energy or transportation. Econometric
estimates (although imprecise) suggest that perhaps a quarter of a percentage
point of the increases in the core CPI during the past year may be attributable to the past increases of these energy inputs. The Administration projects
that the CPI will increase at a 2.6 percent annual rate during 2007 and 2008,
about the same as the 2006 pace of the core CPI.
Hourly compensation (which is about 61 percent of nonfarm business
output) has increased a bit faster in 2006 than in 2005. Nominal hourly
compensation for workers in private industry increased 3.2 percent in 2006,
up from 2.9 percent during the 12 months of 2005 according to the
Employment Cost Index (ECI). All of this increase was from growth in wages
and salaries (3.2 percent in 2006 versus 2.5 percent during 2005) while
hourly benefits grew more slowly (3.1 percent versus 4.0 percent).
Another measure of hourly compensation published by the Department of
Labor and derived from the National Income and Product Accounts has
increased somewhat faster (at 4.3 percent) than the 3 percent increase in the
ECI during the four quarters through the third quarter of 2006.
Unit labor costs have put little—if any—upward pressure on inflation thus far,
and it appears unlikely that they will over the next year. Unit labor costs have
increased at the same pace as the GDP price index, a 2.9 percent rate during the
four quarters through the third quarter of 2006. The Administration expects the
growth rate of hourly compensation to increase during 2007, as this nation’s
rapid productivity gains are shared by workers. But even with this acceleration in
compensation, the expected strong pace of productivity growth will likely keep
unit labor costs from putting upward pressure on inflation during 2007.
Moderate growth of hourly compensation and solid growth of productivity
together with strong aggregate demand has driven the profit share of gross
domestic income to its highest level since 1966.
Non-supervisory production-worker wages (which cover 82 percent of the
private workforce) increased 4.2 percent (in nominal terms) during the
36 | Economic Report of the President

12 months through December 2006—an acceleration of 1.1 percentage points
from the pace a year earlier. Real hourly wages of production workers increased
1.7 percent, a 2.1-percentage point acceleration from the pace a year earlier.
The acceleration in real earnings reflects both the 1.1-percentage point increase
in nominal wages and a 1 percentage point deceleration in consumer prices.
Among the many available measures of inflation, the Administration forecast focuses on two: the CPI and the price index for the GDP. The CPI
measures prices for a fixed basket of consumer goods and services. It is widely
reported in the press, and is used to index Social Security, the individual
income tax, Federal pensions, and many private-sector contracts. The GDP
price index covers prices of goods and services produced in the United States
including consumption, investment, and government purchases. In contrast
to the CPI, its weights are not fixed but move to reflect changes in spending
patterns. Of the two indexes, the CPI tends to increase more rapidly in part
because it measures a fixed basket of goods; the GDP price index increases less
rapidly because it allows for households and businesses to shift their purchases
away from items with increasing relative prices and toward items with
decreasing relative prices. Among the differences, the GDP price index
(which includes investment goods) places a larger weight on computers,
which tend to decline in price (on a quality-adjusted basis). In contrast, the
CPI places a much larger weight on rent and energy.
The “wedge,” or difference between the CPI and the GDP measures of
inflation, has implications for Federal budget projections. A larger wedge
(with the CPI rising faster than the GDP price index) raises the Federal
budget deficit because Social Security and Federal pensions rise with the CPI,
while Federal revenue tends to increase with the GDP price index. For a given
level of nominal income, increases in the CPI also cut Federal revenue because
they raise the brackets at which higher income tax rates apply and affect other
inflation-indexed features of the tax code.
During the 25 years from 1981 to 2005, the wedge between inflation in the
CPI-U-RS (a historical CPI series designed to be consistent with current CPI
methods) and the rate of change in the GDP price index averaged 0.32
percent per year. The wedge was particularly high during 2005 when the CPI
increased 0.6 percentage point faster than the GDP price index. The wedge
during 2005 reflected the 35 percent increase in crude oil prices, which have
a larger weight in consumer prices (via their effect on refined-petroleum products) than in GDP as a whole. Because domestic production accounts for only
about 35 percent of U.S. oil consumption, the weight of oil prices in GDP is
roughly one-third of its weight in consumption. This effect unwound during
the fourth quarter of 2006 when oil prices declined, causing the wedge to
fall to -0.6 percentage point during the four quarters of 2006. From 2008
forward, the wedge is projected to average 0.3 percentage point.

Financial Markets
The Wilshire 5000 (a broad stock market index) increased 13.9 percent
during 2006, while the Standard and Poor 500 (an index of the 500 largest
corporations) increased 13.6 percent. This was the fourth consecutive year of
stock market gains following 3 years of declines. The market has now recovered most of its losses since the March 2000 peak, at least in nominal terms.
Despite increases in short-term rates, yields on 10-year notes remained low,
increasing only 9 basis points during the 12 months of 2006. The low level of
long-term interest rates was due in part to low and stable long-run inflation
expectations.
The Administration forecast of short term interest rates is roughly based
on financial market data as well as a survey of economic forecasters. As of
November 13, 2006, the date that the economic forecast was finalized,
trading in financial futures suggested that market participants expected shortterm rates to fall over the next several years, and the Administration’s interest
rate projections reflect those views. The Administration projects the rate on
91-day Treasury bills (5.1 percent on November 13 ) to remain flat in 2007
before edging down in 2008 and 2009. The short-term rate is projected to fall
to 4.1 percent by 2012. At that level, the real rate on 91-day Treasury bills
would be close to its historical average.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes on November 13 was 4.61 percent,
48 basis points below the discount rate on the 91-day Treasury bills—a
noticeable reversal of the usual pattern which shows higher rates for long-term
yields. The Administration expects the 10-year rate to increase above the
91-day rate during 2007, eventually reaching a more normal spread of about
1.2 percentage points by 2010. An increase of a similar magnitude appears to
be expected by market participants (as evidenced by higher rates on 20- and
30-year Treasury notes than on notes with 10-year maturities). As a result,
yields on 10-year notes are expected to increase somewhat further, reaching a
plateau at 5.3 percent from 2010 onward.

The Long-Term Outlook Through 2012
Coming off a fifth year of expansion, the U.S. economy is settling into a
period of steady growth. Having reached a high level of resource utilization
by year-end 2006, growth is likely to slow in 2007 and then will expand
through 2012 at around 3.0 percent. Inflation will remain low and is expected
to edge a bit lower, and the labor market will remain firm (Table 1-1). The
forecast is based on conservative economic assumptions that are close to
the consensus of professional forecasters. These assumptions provide a sound
basis for the Administration’s budget projections.

As can be seen in the fourth column of the table, the mix of supply-side
factors determining real GDP growth has been unusual since the businesscycle peak at the beginning of 2001. The high rate of productivity growth
(3.1 percent at an annual rate, shown in line 10) has been partially offset by
the decline in the participation rate (line 2) and the workweek (line 8). Also
notable is the large and puzzling decline in the ratio of nonfarm business
employment to household employment (line 6). This unusual decline reflects
the slow growth of employment as measured by the payroll survey (which asks
employers to report the number of jobs) relative to the more rapid growth of
employment as measured by the household survey (which estimates the
number of employed persons through a sample of households). This disparity
40 | Economic Report of the President

has been reduced somewhat by the just-issued benchmark revision to payroll
employment, but has yet to be satisfactorily explained.
The participation rate fell, on net, from 2001 to 2006 (although it ticked
up in 2006), and is projected to trend lower through 2012. The recent
behavior stands in contrast to the long period of increase from 1960 through
1996. Looking ahead, the participation rate is projected to decline, reflecting
the aging of the baby-boom cohorts, leading to more retirements and a likely
increase in the share of people on disability pensions (see Box 1-2).
Box 1-2: Long-Term Prospects for Labor Force Participation
The overall rate of labor force participation is projected to decline as
the baby-boom cohorts advance into age brackets with much lower
participation rates. Participation in the labor force (by working or by
looking for a job) declines as people age through their 50s and 60s, as
can be seen in the following chart.

This chart shows the estimated average lifetime age-participation
profile for the 13 cohorts born from 1928 to 1940. Men’s participation is
high (exceeding 90 percent) from age 24 through age 50, but then
declines thereafter, dropping to 83 percent by age 55 and 36 percent by
age 65. The rate of labor force exit is particularly rapid around 62, the

Box 1-2 — continued
age at which one becomes eligible for early Social Security retirement
benefits. In fact, about 40 percent of those eligible elect to begin
collecting Social Security annuities at age 62, although this does not
necessarily mean that they exit the workforce.
The difference between the age-participation profile of this 1946
cohort (the dotted lines) and those of its elders illustrates how participation rates have evolved over time. Female participation rates have
moved sharply upward—in a roughly parallel shift. In contrast, male
participation rates have changed little over time, moving down only
slightly.
The current age distribution of the U.S. population is shown by the
bars in the following chart, and the black line shows an estimate of the
age distribution of the population in 2012. The large baby-boom cohorts
(who were born between 1946 and 1964) are now 42 to 60 years old,
and their aging will shift a sizeable fraction of the population into age
brackets with lower participation rates, thus decreasing the share of the
population in the high-participation ages.

42 | Economic Report of the President

An extrapolation that moves the participation rate of each cohort
along a path that parallels the 1928–1940 reference cohort and projects
how the aging of the population translates into participation rates
suggests an average participation rate decline of roughly 0.3 percent
per year. A decline of this magnitude would alter a wide range of labormarket behaviors. In response to the emerging shortage of experienced
workers, real wages are likely to increase and workweeks are likely to
lengthen. Labor productivity is likely to increase as employers invest in
labor-saving capital. And more immigrants may enter the U.S. labor
force. The largest effect of the baby–boom retirements, however, is
likely to be an endogenous effect on the labor force participation rate
itself as developments in pay and pension arrangements evolve to
induce higher participation rates among experienced workers than our
extrapolation would suggest.

The Composition of Income over the Long Term
The Administration’s economic forecast is used to estimate future government revenues, a purpose that requires a projection of the components of
taxable income. The income-side projection is based on the historical stability
of labor compensation as a share of gross domestic income (GDI). During the
first half of 2006, the labor compensation share of GDI was 56.7 percent
(according to the preliminary data available when the projection was finalized),
slightly below its 1963–2005 average of 58.1 percent. From this jump-off
point, the labor share is projected to slowly rise to 57.8 percent by 2012.
The labor compensation share of GDI consists of wages and salaries (which
are taxable), non-wage compensation (employer contributions to employee
pension and insurance funds—which are not taxable), and employer contributions for social insurance (which are not taxable). The Administration forecasts
that the wage and salary share of compensation will be approximately flat
between 2007 and 2012. Employer contributions to defined-benefit pension
plans rose by almost 1 percentage point of total compensation between 2001
and 2002, boosting the growth of non-wage compensation. Contributions
leveled off and then edged lower in subsequent years.
The capital share of GDI is expected to edge down from its currently high
level before eventually reaching its historical average in 2012. Within the
capital share, private depreciation is expected to increase (as a result of the
strong growth of investment during the past 3 years). Profits during the first

Chapter 1

| 43

three quarters of 2006 were about 12.2 percent of GDI, well above their post1959 average of roughly 9 percent. Book profits (also known in the national
income accounts as profits before tax) are expected to decline as a share of GDI.
The GDI share of other taxable income (rent, dividends, proprietors’
income, and personal interest income) is projected to edge up slightly over the
next 2 years.

Conclusion
With the rapid-growth period of the expansion fading into the past, the
economy is currently going through a period of rebalancing, where higher
growth of nonresidential investment and exports are offsetting the lower rates
of housing investment. The economy is projected to settle into a steady state
in which real GDP grows at about 3 percent per year, the unemployment rate
creeps up towards a noninflationary level (of 4.8 percent) and inflation
remains moderate and stable (about 2.2 to 2.6 percent on the CPI).
Consumer spending is projected to grow in line with disposable income, and
business investment and exports are projected to grow a bit faster than GDP
as a whole. Economic forecasts are subject to error, and unforeseen positive
and negative developments will affect the course of the economy over the next
several years. Given the economy’s fundamental strengths, however, prospects
for continued growth in the years ahead remain good. Nonetheless, much
work remains in making our economy as productive as possible. Later chapters of this Report explore how pro-growth policies such as tax reform, fiscal
restraint, open commerce, and enhancing our energy security can enhance
our economic performance.

Productivity Growth

N

ews about economic issues focuses on topics such as inflation,
international competitiveness, standards of living, and long-run demographic challenges. Productivity growth rarely makes the headlines. Why is
productivity growth important to the nation? Because higher productivity
growth improves the outlook for all of these issues. It helps keep inflation in
check, makes it easier for American businesses and workers to compete, raises
standards of living, and reduces the difficulty of meeting long-run
demographic challenges by increasing the total amount of resources available.
Over the past 10 years, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has grown
faster in the United States than in almost every other advanced industrialized
country. The United States owes its recent strong per capita growth in large
part to strong labor productivity growth. A continuation of this productivity
growth is essential to increasing real wages and maintaining the high standard
of living in the United States.
To remain competitive, U.S. businesses must hold costs down by getting
the most out of the inputs they use—that is, they must increase labor productivity. Similarly, for U.S. workers to earn higher wages than workers in other
countries while competing in a global economy, U.S. labor productivity must
exceed that of lower-wage countries.
Labor productivity growth also holds the key to dealing with the economic
and fiscal challenges of a rapidly aging population. The total amount of goods
and services produced in a country, measured by GDP, can grow only if
productivity or hours of work increase. As the baby boomers (those born
between 1946 and 1964) reach retirement, growth in total hours of work
across the U.S. economy will slow, and the United States will have to depend
increasingly on productivity growth to drive increases in GDP. While labor
force growth will slow, the elderly population will expand relatively quickly.
Strong GDP growth must continue in order to maintain the standards of
living for both the working age and the dependent populations.
The amount that U.S. workers produce has grown at remarkable rates in
recent years. Since 1995, productivity growth has averaged over 2.5 percent
per year, compared to an average growth rate of about 1.4 percent per year
over the preceding 20 years. Most other major industrialized countries
suffered a slowdown in productivity growth between 2000 and 2005, but in
the United States, growth accelerated to about 3 percent, the fastest productivity growth of any G7 country—Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the

45

United Kingdom, and the United States—over that period. Given that the
United States’ productivity was already among the highest and that these
countries have similar access to technological improvements and financial
markets, the sudden increase in U.S. productivity growth relative to other
developed countries is especially impressive.
Table 2-1 illustrates how small differences in productivity growth rates can,
over time, have large effects on the level of productivity and hence on the
standard of living. When productivity doubles, twice as much output can be
produced using the same level of labor. The table lists four different productivity growth rates that correspond to averages for different U.S. historical
time periods, along with the number of years it would take to double the standard of living at that rate of growth. If productivity continues to grow at the
rate from the most recent period (3.1 percent), the U.S. standard of living will
double in about 23 years; at the slower productivity growth rate experienced
during the 1973–1995 period (1.4 percent), doubling would take more than
twice as long.

This chapter reviews the sources of the recent strength in productivity
growth, highlighting the role that flexible markets and entrepreneurship play
in explaining cross-country differences. It also explains the benefits of productivity growth and discusses how policymakers can further promote it. Key
points are:
• Recent productivity growth has been primarily driven by efficiency
growth (growth in how well labor and capital inputs are used) and by
capital deepening (growth in the amount of capital that workers have
available for use).
• Efficiency growth comes from developing new methods of production
and new products. Entrepreneurship and competition make key contributions to such innovation.
• Investment in information technology (IT) capital and innovative new
ways of using it have been important sources of productivity growth in
many industries with particularly high growth rates.

• Openness to international trade and investment is especially important
for fostering competition and thus productivity growth.
• Increases in the education and training of the U.S. workforce have been
and will continue to be important to long-run productivity growth.
• Policies that encourage capital accumulation, research and development,
and increases in the quality of our educational system can boost productivity growth over the long run.

The Basics of Productivity Growth:
Framework and Recent Facts
Labor productivity measures the goods and services produced per hour of
work. In the United States, the most commonly used measure of labor
productivity is that for the nonfarm business sector, which excludes all levels
of government, nonprofit institutions, households, and farms. Because output
from nonbusiness entities is particularly difficult to measure, nonfarm business labor productivity is thought to best measure how labor productivity
varies over time. For international comparisons of productivity, total output
per hour worked is often used because data on hours by sector are not always
readily available.

Factors That Increase Labor Productivity
What increases labor productivity? Research on this question usually
divides changes in labor productivity into three sources: capital deepening,
increases in skill, and efficiency gains.

Capital Deepening
Capital deepening happens when businesses invest in more or better
machinery, equipment, and structures, all of which make it possible for their
employees to produce more. Matching employees with better capital increases
the number of goods employees produce in each hour they work. Examples
of capital deepening include the purchase of more sophisticated machine tools
for workers in the manufacturing sector, or a faster computer system for a
travel agent. A business may add capital when it increases its workforce—for
example, a travel agency might buy additional computers when increasing the
number of travel agents it employs—but that does not constitute capital
deepening if the amount of capital available per worker does not increase.
Farming provides a classic example of the benefits of using more and
better capital. In 1830, it took a farmer 250 to 300 hours of work to produce
100 bushels of wheat; in 1890, with the help of a horse-drawn machine, the
Chapter 2

| 47

time dropped to between 40 and 50 hours; in 1975, with the use of large
tractors and combines, the 100 bushels could be produced in just 3 to 4
hours. While it is most likely that farmers were more educated in 1975 than
they were in the 1830s, the change in the farmers’ skills alone could not be
the source of this dramatic efficiency gain; an important source is the use of
better capital. Changing from a hoe to the tractor would be categorized as
capital deepening, and the resulting increase in output is capital deepening’s
contribution to productivity growth.

Increases in Skill
Just as a worker who is paired with a better machine can produce more
goods, a worker who learns a skill needed for production can produce more
output in less time. For example, a worker who takes a class on how to use a
computer increases the skill with which she uses the computer; the computer
is no faster, but the worker’s increased skill increases her output per hour
worked and hence boosts her productivity. Workers increase their skills
through additional education, training, on-the-job experience, and so on.

Efficiency Gains
Businesses achieve efficiency gains—more output with the same amount of
input—when they devise better ways of organizing and using the equipment
they own and the people they employ. Efficiency gains include both process
innovations, which increase productivity by reducing the capital or labor
needed to produce a unit of output, and product innovations, which increase
productivity by increasing the value of output. For example, when Henry
Ford began mass-producing Model T’s, the Model T itself was a product
innovation, while the moving assembly line was a process innovation. The
combination of improved process and product allowed the Ford Motor
Company to reduce its production costs and become more competitive.
A more recent example of process improvements that led to direct efficiency
gains may also be helpful in illustrating this concept. Managers at a 3M tapemanufacturing plant increased productivity by reorganizing part of their
production process. By moving machines such as glue coaters and tape slitters
closer to the packing equipment and robotic transporters, 3M substantially
increased labor productivity at its plant. The reorganization reduced the need
to move output around the plant, and cut the length of the production cycle.
In addition, with all the packing supplies located in one place, managers could
see when they had more than they needed and could cut costs by reducing
excess inventories of supplies. This improvement is an efficiency gain because
the plant produced more output without increasing capital or labor. This
example is typical of the innovative process: companies purchase and install
new machines—from computers to conveyor belts—but it takes time and
further innovation to learn how to take full advantage of the new machines.
48 | Economic Report of the President

Entrepreneurship (developing new ways of doing business and making risky
investments to implement them) and competition partially determine the
degree to which innovation contributes to labor productivity. If a business
comes up with a new product or a new way of organizing production and
spends the resources to try it out, and if the new way improves on the old, the
business ends up with a higher level of profit and an incentive to expand.
Innovation by one business is likely to have little direct effect on a nation’s
productivity growth, but competition forces other businesses to either come
up with innovations of their own or to cede market share. When this happens,
capital investment and labor flow to businesses with better methods of
production, and productivity increases as a result.
Entrepreneurship occurs on both small and large scales; many large multinationals spend large sums on research and development in order to innovate
and expand, but individual entrepreneurs who operate on a small scale may
also innovate. The entry and growth of new businesses, combined with the
exit of older, less productive businesses, has been found to be responsible for
a substantial share of efficiency growth.

Productivity Growth in Recent Years
Chart 2-1 illustrates how increases in skill, capital deepening, and efficiency
gains have contributed to productivity growth in recent years. It is important
to note that the relative sizes of these contributions are only approximate and
that some increases in the quality of labor and capital may be counted as efficiency gains. For example, economists can accurately measure education levels
of the labor force, but on-the-job training is also commonplace and measuring
the impact of this training on skill levels is difficult. Similar issues arise in
adjusting for the quality of capital, particularly during periods of rapid technological changes. The net result is likely an understatement of skill increases and
capital deepening, and a resulting overstatement of efficiency gains.
Chart 2-1 contrasts three periods, 1990–1995 (when U.S. productivity
growth was relatively slow), 1995–2000 (when the pace of productivity
growth quickened), and 2000–2005 (shows the most recent growth rate).
Over these 15 years, skill increased at a fairly steady pace of about 0.3 percent
to 0.4 percent per year. The sources of this increase are increased rates of
college attendance and the increased experience of the workforce. Increases in
skill have been an important source of long-run increases in labor productivity, and help explain why the United States has high income levels relative
to other countries. Continuing a steady increase in skill is vital to maintaining
solid productivity growth into the future, a topic discussed at more length in
Chapter 2 of the 2006 Economic Report of the President.
But even when educational attainment among the young rises substantially,
the skill level of the workforce as a whole evolves slowly. Because skill has
Chapter 2

| 49

increased at a relatively steady rate, it cannot be the source of the recent
acceleration in productivity growth. Instead, capital deepening and efficiency
gains have been the key productivity-raising factors. Between 1995 and 2005,
increases in the quality and quantity of the U.S. capital stock accounted for
1.1 percent per year in productivity growth in the United States, more than
doubling the contribution of capital to productivity growth relative to the
1990 to 1995 period. The surge in productivity in the late 1990s resulted not
just from a rapid increase in the number of machines used in U.S. production, but also from large quality improvements to the capital stock. Many of
these improvements came from the revolution in information technology,
which is commonly accepted as the initiating force behind the acceleration.
But investment in IT capital alone was not the whole story. Firms needed to
develop processes that best used the new capital. In many ways, the first
increase in productivity growth (the higher growth rate between 1995 and
2000) was due to increased capital, while the second boost (in the period
between 2000 and 2005) occurred as firms became better and better at using
the new technology.

Productivity Growth and Worker Earnings
The previous section looked at the sources of recent productivity gains, but
did not discuss what productivity gains mean for a worker’s paycheck. This
section examines how productivity growth affects average compensation and
which groups have gained the most over time.

Productivity and Average Earnings
The economic gains from productivity growth reach workers directly
through growth in employee compensation, where compensation includes
wages and the contributions that employers make for benefits such as health
insurance and for government programs such as unemployment insurance
and Social Security. Chart 2-2 shows that over long periods of time, productivity and real compensation grow at about the same rate. Real wages have
grown somewhat more slowly than compensation and thus productivity over
the last 20 years. The reason for this difference is that non-wage compensation, particularly employer contributions for health insurance, has accounted
for an increasing share of compensation over this time period.

Chapter 2

| 51

Productivity growth is not a smooth process. Chart 2-2 shows that even in
the recent time period, 1995 to 2005, when average productivity growth has
been high, there are short periods of time where productivity growth appears
to slow sharply or accelerate rapidly. Such changes in productivity growth are
not uncommon. In addition, productivity sometimes grows faster than
compensation, while sometimes compensation grows faster. Such short-term
divergence in growth rates follows regular patterns and has been repeated many
times. At times when productivity growth is particularly high, compensation
growth tends to lag behind for a period of time before catching back up.
Why does compensation tend to lag behind productivity growth? When
productivity growth is high, economic growth can happen without substantial employment growth. In other words, as productivity grows, businesses are
able to expand output in response to increased demand without hiring more
workers; the efficiency gains imply that each individual worker produces more
output in the same amount of time. As the economy continues to expand,
businesses once again begin to hire new employees, and the increased demand
for workers begins to push up wages and compensation. Increased demand for
workers leads to a period in which compensation growth exceeds productivity
growth, and the two variables then converge for a while.
When productivity grows faster than compensation, businesses’ profits
tend to rise because the value of the goods and services they sell rises faster
than their payroll costs. As a result, profits tend to rise during periods of rapid
productivity growth. As tight labor markets bid up employee compensation,
the increase in labor costs cuts into profits, and profits return to normal levels.
In this process, profits vary more dramatically than employee compensation,
falling much more sharply during recessions and then growing much more
quickly in the early parts of the recovery. Because profits represent returns to
earlier investments, very high profits in some years may not represent unusually large returns on investment because they may be offset by years of losses
or unusually small profits.

Productivity and Income Differences
The productivity and compensation numbers used in this chapter describe
averages, but over the last 30 years, the economic gains for some groups have
not kept up with those averages, while the gains for other groups have been
well above the average. These uneven gains have led to growing disparity (or
inequality) in compensation and wages. The same competition for workers
that makes average employee compensation track productivity growth over
the long term will occur for particular groups of employees within the overall
labor force. The compensation for groups whose productivity has increased
relative to the rest of the labor force will increase relative to average compensation. A number of studies have shown that factors associated with higher
52 | Economic Report of the President

productivity—such as education and work experience—have also been
increasingly associated with higher wages. This is consistent with the view
that growing compensation disparity has been driven by faster growth in
productivity for skilled workers than for the less skilled.
In the 1980s, the increase in disparity was seen both in falling wages at the
bottom of the wage distribution and rising wages at the top. Since then, wages
in the bottom half of the distribution have either been flat or have grown
modestly while disparity has continued to increase in the upper part of the
distribution. For example, between 1990 and 2005 the wage at the 10th
percentile grew 13 percent while the median wage grew 10 percent, so the
difference between them narrowed somewhat. The wage at the 90th
percentile of the distribution grew 18 percent over that period, widening the
gap between the upper tail of the distribution and the median.
Why have wage levels grown increasingly disparate? Changes in technology
that increase the productivity advantages associated with skill—often termed
skill-biased technical change—appear to be the most likely cause. That is,
technological advances increased the productivity of skilled workers more
than the productivity of the less skilled, leading employers to want to hire
more skilled workers. In doing so, employers bid up the wages of skilled
workers, widening the difference in pay associated with skill.
Why does skill-biased technical change appear to be the most reasonable
explanation for this trend? The main reason is that the price that employers
pay for skilled workers trended upward even while the supply of skilled
workers continued to grow. For example, although the fraction of the workforce that is college educated has grown consistently over the past 30 years (an
increase in supply), the additional wages needed for an employer to hire a
college-educated worker have also grown (an increase in price). Absent a shift
in demand, increases in supply should drive down prices, so a price increase
implies that demand has shifted toward skilled workers as well.
Do improvements in the way goods and services are produced necessarily
lead to greater disparity in pay? If changes in technology have increased
disparity, does that mean that technological change is always bad for those
who are in the lower portion of the wage distribution? There are two reasons
to doubt that this is true. First, economists studying earlier periods have
found that wage disparity actually narrowed in the first half of the 20th
century, providing evidence that, in some periods, change has favored less
skilled workers as opposed to skilled workers.
A second and more fundamental reason that productivity growth does not
leave a whole class of workers behind in the long run is that if changes in technology raise the pay of relatively skilled workers, they also increase people’s
incentives to invest in acquiring skills. Many of the factors that increase an
individual worker’s productivity depend on the worker’s decisions to invest in

Chapter 2

| 53

developing new skills. When the rewards to gaining skills increase, workers
have increased incentive to acquire additional skills. For example, over the
past 30 years, there has been a substantial widening in the difference between
pay for workers with a bachelor’s degree and pay for those with only a high
school diploma. For men, this difference grew from 50 percent in 1975 to
87 percent in 2004.
If this widening in pay differences represents an increase in the amount a
worker gains by getting a college education, then it gives individuals a greater
incentive to make such an investment in education. Over the last 10 years,
there has been an increase in the percentage of people who choose to go to
college rather than enter the workforce directly out of high school. In 1992,
the size of the workforce with some college education was roughly the same
as the size of the workforce with a high school diploma or less. By 2006, the
workforce with at least some college had become 50 percent larger than the
workforce with no college. Other levels of education, such as master’s and
doctoral degrees, have shown similar increases in the rewards for obtaining
such a degree and in the number of people choosing to make that investment.
From 1987 to 2003, wages for those with an advanced degree increased faster
than for those of any other education group, and since the mid-1990s, the
share of people age 30–39 with an advanced degree has increased by
38 percent. Thus increased demand for skilled workers has been followed by
an increase in supply, which raises the average skill level in the economy and
leads to higher average productivity.

Understanding the Acceleration in
U.S. Productivity: Industry Analysis
Understanding why productivity growth in the United States has increased
requires knowing what factors in the economy have changed. Chart 2-1
demonstrated that most of the recent increase came about through greater
capital deepening and efficiency gains. What the chart did not tell us is why
businesses increased their rates of capital investment to bring about capital
deepening and why efficiency gains have been higher in the past decade than
they were for much of the previous two decades.
Productivity growth for the economy as a whole comes from investment
and innovation in a wide variety of businesses. A lot can be learned about the
sources of growth by looking at which kinds of investments have grown most
quickly, as well as which industries have had the fastest productivity growth.
The average rate of productivity growth hides substantial differences across
industries. In particular, the surge in productivity in the late 1990s appears to
be a story of growth in industries making and using IT capital. Chart 2-3
54 | Economic Report of the President

illustrates that efficiency growth since 2000 has been particularly strong in the
high-tech sector, but that it has also been strong in the distribution sector,
which includes retail and wholesale trade, transportation, and warehousing.
Finance and business services also showed strong efficiency growth and hence
strong productivity growth. Manufacturing, which has made small investments in IT capital compared to the other sectors shown, has had the slowest
recent growth in efficiency.
The strong productivity growth in the distribution and financial services
sectors highlights one of the most striking differences between the pre- and
post-1995 periods. From the 1970s through 1995, productivity growth in
goods-producing industries was generally greater than that in service-providing
industries. However, since 1995, productivity growth in service-providing
industries has exceeded the growth in goods-producing industries (such as
manufacturing).
Given this difference, one of the most important insights into the recent
period of productivity growth comes from understanding why service-sector
productivity growth accelerated after a long period of slow growth. As
discussed above, capital deepening and efficiency growth accounted for most
of the acceleration of productivity growth for the U.S. economy as a whole
over the last decade.

Chapter 2

In examining productivity growth rates over the recent period, researchers
have found it useful to characterize investments by whether they involve a
purchase of IT equipment, which is usually defined as computer hardware,
software, and telecommunications equipment. Box 2-1 discusses some of the
potential mechanisms, such as intangible capital accumulation, through
which IT capital leads to productivity improvements.

Box 2-1: Intangible Capital and IT Investment
While information technology clearly accounts for a sizable share of
productivity growth since 2000, the mechanisms through which it
induced this growth are not as clear. The assumption has been that
since efficiency growth has been the largest contributor to productivity
in this recent period, IT gains are embedded in this growing efficiency.
However, hidden within these increases in efficiency may also be
capital growth not captured in official measures.
Standard measures of capital primarily count physical capital, but
businesses expend resources on many other activities that aim to increase
the value of future output. Some examples are research and development
spending, revamping a business’s organization, advertising aimed at
improving consumers’ perceptions of a business’s brand, or developing a
secret recipe. These kinds of activities are often called intangible investment because they build up assets that are valuable to firms but are not
easily measured.
Conceptually, these activities qualify as capital investment, but they
are not currently included in official capital measures because they are
hard to measure. Why does this matter when discussing productivity?
Expanding the definition of capital by including intangibles would
change the shares of the factors contributing to labor productivity
growth, increasing the share attributed to capital deepening and
reducing the share attributed to efficiency gains. This shift would not
only call into question the finding that IT investment contributed to
productivity mainly through efficiency gains, but would also help
explain why productivity did not accelerate with early waves of IT
investments. Indeed, it is consistent with the hypothesis that for businesses to take full advantage of their IT investments, they needed to
develop innovative business practices. Only when they made intangible investments to complement their IT investments did productivity
growth really take off.

56 | Economic Report of the President

The industries that produce IT equipment had particularly rapid efficiency
growth, resulting in falling prices accompanied by rapid increases in the speed
and power of IT equipment. These industries directly brought up the average
rate of productivity growth for the economy, but their advances also had
significant indirect effects by driving a surge in IT equipment investment in
other industries. The increase in capital deepening in the 1990s was led by
large investments in IT equipment, but productivity gains from these investments did not immediately emerge.
In the 1995 to 2000 period, industries with above-average investment in IT
equipment had significantly larger increases in their productivity growth rates
than did other industries. For example, the retail trade and financial services
industries had much higher productivity growth over the 1995 to 2000
period than in the preceding period, and had well-above-average investment
in IT equipment. Box 2-2 indicates that much of the retail trade productivity
gains occurred because of supply chain improvements made possible by information technology. Research estimating the contribution of IT-related
forces—including both productivity growth in IT-producing industries and
the share of productivity growth accounted for by IT investment in other
industries—shows that information technology accounted for more than half
of productivity growth from 1995 to 2000.

Box 2-2: Information Technology, the Supply Chain,
and Productivity Growth in Retail Trade
The retail trade sector shows how IT investment, innovation,
competition, and flexible markets interact to affect productivity growth.
Retailers have made heavy investments in information technology and
have had rapid productivity growth, but changes in the way that
retailers use information technology—both in their stores and with their
suppliers—were necessary to generate this surge in productivity
growth. The focus here is on two types of innovations: changes in the
organization of the supply chain of consumer goods and changes in the
way retailers organize store operations.
Manufacturers and retailers of consumer goods have increased their
use of electronic data interchange, allowing manufacturers to help
retailers manage inventories and avoid stockpiling and shortfalls.
Electronic data interchange also allows for automatic ordering, billing,
and payment. Retailers benefit from lower costs of carrying inventory
and reduced resources spent managing it, and manufacturers benefit

Box 2-2 — continued
from being able to smooth out production. Because these changes have
enabled retailers to more reliably stock a wide variety of goods,
consumers have benefited from increased product variety. Making
these changes required an investment in IT equipment by manufacturers and retailers, and required them to change the way they
exchanged information and interacted.
Large retailers also made internal changes that significantly increased
productivity. One change was an increase in the scale of stores. Other
important changes involved the use of information technology and
improved management practices. Examples include an increased use of
software to manage the flow of goods and staffing levels in stores, and
more cross-training of employees to make better use of store labor.
Rapid expansion of the largest firm put competitive pressure on other
retailers, leading them to cut costs and, in many cases, to emulate the
process improvements introduced by the industry leader.

Why Has Productivity Growth Accelerated in
the U.S. While Slowing in Other Countries?
The United States has experienced the fastest acceleration of productivity
growth among major industrialized countries since the early 1990s. Chart 2-4
shows that, after lagging behind most of the countries in the G7 between
1990 and 1995, the United States has been the country with the fastest
growth in GDP per hour worked in the G7 between 2000 and 2005. Only
the United States and Japan had faster productivity growth in the most recent
period than they did in the early 1990s, and only the United States has shown
consistent acceleration over this time period.
Since all of these countries have, in principle, approximately the same
access to information and global markets, why have the other major industrialized countries not been able to post productivity gains as large as those in
the United States and Japan? The major advances in this period appear to
have come from opportunities that developed from the rapid advancement in
information technology. While all developed countries had access to IT
capital, the existing economic environment in the United States put it in position to quickly make the most of these opportunities. International openness
to investment and trade combined with highly flexible and lightly regulated
markets and an environment that fosters innovation appear to be at least part
of the answer.
58 | Economic Report of the President

International Openness
As discussed earlier, capital deepening has played a significant role in U.S.
productivity growth. Over the past 10 years, the United States is second only
to Canada in its annual growth rate of real private investment. Real investment in the United States over this period increased at an annual rate of
5.1 percent, nearly double the average rate of the other G7 countries
(excluding Canada). The United States has been able to accomplish this level
of investment because of its open and transparent investment environment.
While capital deepening played an important role in the productivity gains
experienced in the late 1990s, so did advances in information technology. To
benefit from the IT boom, firms had to invest large amounts in computers,
software, and employee training. From 1995 through 1999, U.S. investment
in information-processing equipment and software increased at an average
rate of around 20 percent per year, and total investment grew faster than in
any other country in the G7. To help fund these investments, the United
States received substantial flows of financial capital from abroad during this
period. While the United States might have invested in IT capital without
access to international financial markets, and while Europe may not have
invested more even if it was more open to international capital flows, it is

Chapter 2

| 59

almost certain that the United States was able to use its open investment
environment to finance the increase in IT capital.
Access to international financial markets tends to lower borrowing costs
and enable a country to increase capital investment rates without increasing
domestic savings. This outcome would not be possible if businesses had access
only to domestic financing.
International openness has also contributed in other ways to recent
efficiency gains in the United States. Since the early 1990s, the United States
has increased its openness to international trade. From the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (signed into law in 1993) to the Trade Act
of 2002 and the renewal of Trade Promotion Authority in the same year, the
United States has worked to break down trade barriers. Lower trade barriers
have in turn increased the level of international competition in product
markets. Some U.S. companies have suffered from the increased competition;
some have benefited. The increased competition forces firms to seek new ways
of doing business to remain competitive, and because of this, international
trade may contribute to growth in innovation.

Flexible Labor Markets
Efficiency gains resulting from more flexible and competitive labor markets
have been another important reason why the United States was able to benefit
from recent shifts in technology. The United States ranks first among
G7 countries in the World Bank’s Rigidity of Employment Index, indicating
very flexible labor markets relative to other G7 countries. Japan, for example,
ranks fourth among G7 countries, while France ranks last. The index averages
measures of the difficulty of hiring a new worker, restrictions on expanding or
contracting the number of working hours, and the difficulty and expense of
dismissing a worker. While other countries are tied with the United States on
the latter two measures, the United States owes its first place rank to the ease
with which American employers can hire new employees.
Flexible labor markets allow workers to flow to high-productivity and highwage industries. Hiring and severance costs tend to increase unemployment
by making firms reluctant to hire new workers. They encourage labor
hoarding, a practice in which firms hold on to workers not currently needed
for production in order to avoid the costs of hiring new workers when the
firm’s workforce needs to expand. Labor hoarding lowers the level of productivity and reduces the average growth rate of productivity, as firms find it
more difficult to respond to innovations and shifts in demand.
Flexible labor markets improve productivity growth because they allow
firms to more easily adjust the size and scope of their operations in response
to economic developments. For example, after an increase in efficiency, a firm
may become more competitive and decide to expand output and so need to
60 | Economic Report of the President

hire more workers. The firm may also wish to change the mix of workers it
employs. Flexible labor markets allow these transitions to occur at a low cost.

Low Costs of Starting a Business
Low costs of business entry with relatively few administrative hurdles have
also contributed to greater efficiency gains in the United States. A recent
study by the World Bank shows that the United States, at 5 days, ranks
behind only Canada and Australia in terms of the number of days required to
start a business, and has the fourth lowest administrative costs to start a new
business. New businesses provide both a ready supply of new ideas and a
source of competition that forces larger businesses to innovate. Both of these
factors have likely given the United States an edge in taking advantage of new
opportunities made possible by IT advances. As with flexible labor markets,
the ease of starting a new business helps with the level and the growth rate of
productivity. Over long periods of time, starting new businesses keeps the
economic environment competitive, which spurs innovation and helps push
inefficient firms out of the market place.

Policy Implications
What can the United States do to promote further productivity growth?
First, the most important way to encourage capital deepening is to maintain
the smallest possible difference between the before-tax and the after-tax rates
of return to investments. Capital deepening makes workers more productive
and leads to higher wages in the long run. Making the tax cuts on capital gains
and dividends permanent would help in this regard. Chapter 3 of this report
discusses policy options affecting the taxation of capital.
Second, policies must encourage investment in skills. One way to do this is
to keep the tax rates on wage income low. If individuals see little return to
going to college, vocational school, or graduate school because of high tax
rates on moderate- to high-wage earners, their incentives to invest in skill will
be dampened. Chapter 3 further discusses how tax policy affects investment
in skill. Strengthening K-12 education, reducing our dropout rates, and
ensuring that all children receive high-quality education will increase the skills
of our workforce and better prepare our citizens for further skill investment
as adults. The President’s efforts over the past several years to improve education and training with the No Child Left Behind Act, community college
initiatives, and job training reforms will help. Furthermore, because learning
begets learning, the returns should continue into the distant future.
Third, we must remain open to foreign investment. Openness to foreign
capital has given the United States the flexibility it needs to deepen its capital
Chapter 2

| 61

stock and improve its productivity without necessitating a corresponding
increase in domestic savings. To maintain current growth rates we must keep
pushing for freer trade, especially in the area of services, which has become a
significant part of our economy. Chapter 8 of this report discusses policies to
increase our international openness.
Fourth, we must encourage innovation and entrepreneurship. The President
has outlined a competitiveness initiative that increases public investment in
basic research—an important complement to private sector innovation—and
strengthens math and science education to provide the skills needed for
technological innovation.

Conclusion
Maintaining a solid productivity growth rate is of great importance to maintaining and increasing U.S. standards of living. The surge in productivity
growth since about 1995 has come from heavy business investment in information technology, accompanied by large efficiency gains from innovation and
competition. The United States has gained more from rapid advances in information technology than the other major industrialized countries because its
culture of entrepreneurship and its flexible markets for products, capital, and
labor have allowed American businesses to make the most of these changes.

he word “investment” has different meanings to different people. In
finance, investment means the purchase of financial products or other
assets, such as mutual funds or gold, with an expectation of favorable future
returns. For businesses, it can mean the purchase of a physical good, such as
a durable machine or inventory, with the hope of improving future business.
In economics, investment is defined as any use of resources intended to
increase future production output or income. In particular, capital investment
is money spent on physical capital such as buildings, equipment, or
machinery, or on human capital such as education or job training. Because a
larger capital stock makes labor more productive, investment is a primary
driver of greater economic growth and higher standards of living.
If governments pursue policies that involve the least amount of government
interference necessary for a well-functioning capital investment market, this
will encourage an efficient amount of investment. One type of policy that is
key to encouraging an efficient level of investment is pro-growth tax policy.
One of the goals of pro-growth tax policy is to finance government services in
a way that minimizes the effect of taxes on the capital investment decisions of
households or businesses. By taxing investment returns too heavily or by
providing tax advantages to certain types of investment, a tax system can
discourage overall investment, as well as prevent capital from being used efficiently. A tax system that affects investment decisions in these ways is called
“distortionary” because it creates incentives for people to base their saving and
investment decisions on taxes, rather than making those decisions based solely
on where they can use their resources most productively.
This chapter discusses the advantages of adopting a more pro-growth tax
system. It reviews recent changes that have reduced tax distortions on capital
investment decisions, and evaluates options to further reduce such distortions.
It draws the following four main conclusions.
• The goal of pro-growth tax policy is to reduce tax distortions that
hamper economic growth. Most economists agree that lower taxes on
capital income stimulate greater investment, resulting in greater
economic growth, greater international competitiveness, and higher
standards of living.
• The current tax code contains provisions that discourage investment and
create distortions that affect the level, structure, and financing of capital
investment. These distortions dampen capital investment and contribute
to an inefficient allocation of capital throughout the economy.
63

• Estimates from research suggest that removing these tax distortions to
investment decisions could increase real gross domestic product (GDP)
by as much as 8 percent in the long run.
• Since 2001, temporary changes in the tax code have reduced the tax
on investment. These pro-growth policies have stimulated short-run
investment and economic growth. However, the temporary nature of the
provisions eliminates desirable long-run economic stimulus.

Rationale for Pro-Growth Tax Policy
All societies must decide on the amount of government services that best
provides for the welfare of the citizenry. When deciding how to finance a
given amount of government services, two features of the tax system must be
determined—the appropriate tax base and the appropriate tax rate. The goal
of pro-growth tax policy is to define a tax base and choose tax rates that
finance government expenditures with the least distortionary effect on the
economy. A tax system is distortionary when it creates incentives for people
to make spending, saving, or investment decisions that are different from the
decisions they would make in the absence of taxes. For example, by taxing the
sale of apples and not oranges, a tax system would encourage people to
consume more oranges and fewer apples than they otherwise would. Similarly,
by taxing a family’s out-of-pocket health spending but not employer-paid
health insurance premiums, the tax system encourages inefficient consumption of health care by households. (See Box 4-1 in Chapter 4, The Fiscal
Challenges Facing Medicare, for a discussion of the President’s proposal to
reform the tax treatment of health insurance.) By comparison, a tax system
that taxes investment can create incentives that favor consumption over
saving, investment in certain types of capital over others, or certain methods
of financing capital investment. In the absence of distortionary taxes,
people would have made those decisions based solely on the best and most
productive use of those resources.

Defining the Tax Base
Most economists agree that the choice of the appropriate tax base is between
taxing some measure of income or taxing some measure of consumption.
Broadly defined, income is the increase in an individual’s ability to consume
during a period of time. Income can include labor earnings (both cash and
benefits), interest payments, rents, royalties, dividends, increases in asset
values, alimony, and pension payments. An important dimension of income
taxation is that saving and investment are included in the tax base. Using
income as the tax base is equivalent to taxing potential consumption. In effect,
64 | Economic Report of the President

this taxes all resources that people put into the economy. A tax system with an
income base is distortionary because taxes affect decisions on when, how, and
how much to save and invest. For example, in taxing household saving, future
consumption (financed by saving) becomes relatively more expensive
compared to current consumption. As a result, households tend to consume
more and save less than they otherwise would if saving were not taxed.
By contrast, consumption is defined as the actual amount that people and
businesses spend buying goods and services today. When a tax system has a
consumption base, it only taxes what people take out of the economy. While
there are several possible measures of a consumption tax base—retail sales,
value-added, and consumed income, among others—all of these measures
share the attribute of excluding saving and investment from the tax base. Such
a tax system is considered “neutral” and efficient because it neither encourages
nor discourages savings and investment decisions; it allows people to decide
whether to consume now or to invest in the future based on market prices
instead of on how to avoid paying taxes. Relative to an income tax, the
consumption tax base results in a larger, more efficient stock of capital, which
in turn makes workers more productive. Output and wages rise, resulting in
higher standards of living. As a result, many economists feel that consumption is a better base for pro-growth tax policy.
Our current tax system has a hybrid tax base, with elements of both income
and consumption tax bases. Some, but not all, of the return to saving and
investment is excluded from the tax base through various provisions. For
example, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), employer-sponsored retirement savings plans, lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends, and
accelerated depreciation for certain types of investment are some of the provisions in the current tax code that provide at least a partial consumption tax
base. Recent estimates suggest that about 65 percent of the return to household financial assets is taxed under an income tax base, with the remainder
receiving consumption tax treatment.

Choosing the Tax Rates
A marginal tax rate tells how much tax is paid on an additional, or
marginal, dollar of income. When assessing the effect of marginal tax rates on
investment, it is the effective tax rate rather than the statutory tax rate that
matters. A statutory marginal tax rate is a legal definition of the amount of
extra income needed to pay taxes due from an additional dollar of taxable
income in any year. By contrast, an effective marginal tax rate estimates the
extra share of the total return from an investment needed to cover tax liabilities over an investment’s useful life. A tax system with high effective tax rates
on labor and capital income will dampen economic growth by reducing
incentives to work and invest in capital formation.
Chapter 3

| 65

Pro-growth tax policy, whether through adopting a consumption base,
lowering statutory tax rates on saving and investment, or allowing individuals
to fully deduct the cost of investment from taxable income, stimulates new
investment by lowering the effective tax rate on investment income.
Individuals and businesses will undertake more projects because lowering the
effective marginal tax rate reduces the pretax rate of return necessary to make
new projects profitable. In addition, lowering the effective tax rate on the
return to capital investment enhances the competitive position of the United
States in today’s increasingly global economy. This is because a lower effective
tax rate raises the after-tax return to U.S.-based investment relative to foreign
investment, making U.S. investment relatively more attractive to both
domestic and foreign investors.

The U.S. Tax System—
Previous Distortions and Recent Reforms
The United States tax system has become increasingly distortionary and
inefficient, with hundreds of highly targeted tax provisions that erode the
potential for tax system neutrality and greater economic growth. A major
source of inefficiency is the treatment of capital investment, both for physical
capital and for human capital. The profusion of provisions has resulted in a
system where taxes can be the primary determinant in whether to undertake
new investment, what form the investment should take, and how to finance
the investment.
Since 2001, several pro-growth tax policy changes have been enacted which
have reduced the distortionary effect of taxes on investment decisions. This
section discusses investment distortions in the tax system prior to 2001 and
analyzes how changes since that time have reduced distortions and stimulated
economic growth. Overall, the pro-growth policies enacted since 2001 have
helped lessen the impact of the recession and have led to greater investment
and overall economic growth.

Tax Treatment of Physical Capital Investment
This section discusses how two features of the tax system result in “tax
wedge” distortions that contribute to physical capital investment inefficiency:
depreciation schedules that result in an inefficient level and allocation of
capital, and the double taxation of corporate profits that affects the level,
form, and financing of business investment.

66 | Economic Report of the President

The Tax Wedge
The tax system creates a “tax wedge” for investment, making the pretax return
on investment higher than the after-tax return on investment. This is important
because investors require the pretax return to cover both the opportunity cost
and the tax cost of investment. If the tax wedge is large, fewer projects will be
undertaken because the after-tax return for some projects will be below the
opportunity cost of investment. For example, consider an investment with a
pretax return of 10 percent and an after-tax return of 7.5 percent, meaning the
tax wedge is equal to 25 percent of the pre-tax return. If investors decide they
require an 8 percent after-tax return in order to cover the opportunity cost of
the investment, taxes will stop the otherwise profitable project from being
undertaken. By lowering the effective tax rate on investment, the pretax return
is unaffected but the after-tax return will rise. For example, if the effective tax
rate is reduced to zero, then the tax wedge is eliminated and the after-tax return
rises to 10 percent. Note that the tax wedge does not need to be eliminated for
our hypothetical project to be financed—the effective tax rate only needs to be
reduced to the point where the after-tax return is 8 percent. However,
completely eliminating the tax wedge removes taxes from the investment
decision. Two main contributors to the tax wedge on investment returns are
depreciation schedules and the double tax on corporate profits.

Depreciation Schedules
A primary source of the inefficiency created by the tax wedge is the
depreciation schedules that treat investments very differently depending on
their business sector, asset life, and source of financing. Depreciation schedules
tell how much of an investment’s acquisition cost can be deducted from the
taxpayer’s taxable investment income in any year. There are two distortions
associated with the tax depreciation system. First, spreading the deduction for
the acquisition cost over a number of years lowers the present value of the total
tax deduction relative to fully deducting the cost in the year purchased. By
lowering the present value of the deduction, the depreciation system raises the
tax cost and the total effective cost of investment. This makes some projects
unprofitable and reduces the economy-wide level of investment. Second, the
depreciation system distorts the allocation of investment among various sectors
of the economy because the depreciation schedules lead to sectoral differences
in effective marginal tax rates. Under an income tax system, the amount of
investment cost counted each year should ideally equal the true economic
depreciation of the asset. For example, if an asset loses 10 percent of its useful
value per year, then an ideal income tax depreciation schedule would allow
10 percent of the cost to be excluded from income each year. When tax

Chapter 3

| 67

depreciation is not the same as economic depreciation, the tax system distorts
investment decisions regarding the allocation of capital investment.
A common method of measuring the relative distortions caused by the
depreciation system is to calculate the effective marginal tax rates on different
types of investment. Under current law, different types of investments are
depreciated under various depreciation schedules ranging from 3 to 39 years.
Because acquisition costs are deducted from taxable income at different rates,
the amount of tax paid—and the effective marginal tax rate—varies by depreciation class. Table 3-1 shows the effective tax rates on different assets for
different types of investments, with computer investment facing the highest
effective marginal tax rate and petroleum infrastructure investment facing the
lowest. Because marginal investments should provide the same after-tax rate
of return, the depreciation schedule distorts the allocation of capital by
discouraging investment in assets with high effective marginal tax rates.
Even if we adopted a tax system with tax depreciation equal to economic
depreciation, there would still be a notable tax wedge that would distort
investment decisions. To completely remove the investment distortions of
depreciation schedules would require adopting a consumption tax base. With
a consumption tax, all investment costs are fully deducted (fully expensed)
from taxable income in the period in which the acquisition occurs. This has
the effect of reducing the tax wedge to zero if there are no other taxes on
investment returns. This means that the tax system is neutral to the level and
allocation of capital investment because taxes do not affect the decision to
invest and all types of investment are treated equally.

The Double Tax on Corporation Profits
The double tax on corporate profits—which is inconsistent with either an
income tax or a consumption tax—also has a pronounced effect on investment

decisions. First, corporations pay tax on net corporate earnings at a maximum
marginal rate up to 35 percent. Second, individual investors are taxed on the
returns they earn on corporate equity. These returns can take the form of a
capital gain, the difference between the purchase price and the sale price of an
asset, or a dividend, which is a share of corporate profits distributed to shareholders after corporate income tax has been paid.
The total tax on corporate income is calculated by combining these two
layers of tax. Prior to 2001, the tax on individual investment returns (capital
gains and dividends) created incentives for investors to favor projects that
paid returns in the form of capital gains or interest payments instead of dividends because long-term capital gains were taxed at a maximum statutory rate
of 20 percent, while dividend payments were subject to a maximum individual statutory rate of 39.6 percent (both tax rates do not take state and local
taxes into account).
For corporate income distributed to shareholders as dividends, the double
tax on corporate profits could approach the level of confiscation. For example,
given a maximum statutory marginal tax rate of 35 percent for corporations
and 39.6 percent for individuals, the combined effective marginal tax rate on
distributed corporate profits could have been as high as 61 percent! Instead of
paying out corporate profits as dividends, a corporation could retain and reinvest the after-tax profit, leading to an increase in its stock value. Prior to 2001,
when a long-term capital gain was realized, the combined effective tax rate on
corporate profits was about 42 percent, after accounting for the deferral of tax
on the accrued gains. All else equal, investors tended to favor investment
returns in the form of capital gains.
The high effective tax rate on equity-financed investment also created
incentives that favored debt (taking out loans or issuing bonds) when
financing new projects. As shown in Chart 3-1, while the economy-wide
effective tax rate prior to 2001 was 20.4 percent, the effective tax rate on business sector investment was 29.8 percent. Chart 3-2 shows that the effective
tax rate on equity-financed investment was 45.2 percent and the effective tax
rate on debt-financed investment was almost zero. The reason for this large
difference in effective rates is that corporations can deduct interest payments
for loan and bond payments from taxable income, but must include dividend
payments and retained earnings in taxable income. Individual investors then
must pay taxes on the interest payments from their debt holdings and the
investment returns (capital gains and dividends) from their equity holdings.
This tax treatment results in a system where the return to corporate debt is
taxed once but the return to corporate equity is taxed twice. The resulting
overreliance on debt-financed investment could lead to greater bankruptcy
risk during temporary industry or economy-wide downturns, as well as to a
misallocation of resources in the economy.

Tax Treatment of Human Capital Investment
Human capital investment (such as education and worker training) is an
important input in the production of final goods and services, and investing
in human capital is a cost of earning income. Prior to 2001, the tax treatment
of education and training expenses was mixed. Some costs were fully deducted
against taxable income, while others were subject to varying degrees of taxation. In addition, the treatment varied depending on whether the investment
was paid for by businesses or households.
At the household level, most human capital investment was fully deducted
because the tax system does not tax the opportunity cost of education—the
foregone wages of working instead of attending school. For other human
capital investment costs, there was a complicated set of rules, with the tax
treatment primarily determined by the income of the individual taxpayer
undertaking the investment. Some costs could also be deducted under both
income and payroll (Social Security and Medicare) taxes.
The opportunity cost of working was fully deductible under both the
income and payroll tax. Other costs fully deductible under both taxes were
scholarships, fellowships, and reduced tuition. Costs that were fully
deductible under just the income tax included education costs paid through
Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (Coverdell ESAs), interest payments
on student loans, and Treasury bond interest. These costs were excluded from
income tax so long as they were used for tuition and related expenses such as
fees, books, supplies, and the equipment required for courses of instruction.
At the firm level, human capital investment received more efficient tax
treatment than physical capital investment. Consider a $50,000 investment
in office equipment. For many businesses, this cost was not fully deductible.
Instead, the cost was recovered through depreciation provisions, with a fraction of the cost deducted from taxable income over a 7-year period.
Alternatively, the firm and workers could have agreed to reduce cash compensation by $50,000 and invest the money in job training. In this case, the firm
would have deducted the cost of training from taxable income as an ordinary
business expense and workers would not have claimed the cost as taxable
income for income or payroll taxes. In this way, the investment cost was fully
deductible in the year the training occurred, resulting in no tax distortions to
the firm’s human capital investment decision.
In addition to allowing partial deductibility of human capital investment,
the tax system had two human capital investment tax credits available for use
by households. In 2000, the Hope credit provided a tax credit of up to
$1,500 per eligible student for the first 2 years of post-secondary education. To
qualify for this credit the student had to be pursuing a degree or other recognized educational credential. The Lifetime Learning credit provided a tax
credit of 20 percent of the first $5,000 in household education expenses per
Chapter 3

| 71

year. This credit was available for any post-secondary education investment for
an unlimited number of years, regardless of whether the student was pursuing
a degree or educational credential.
Tax credits differ somewhat from tax deductions. A tax credit directly
reduces the amount of tax you have to pay. By contrast, tax deductions reduce
the amount of income subject to tax. Tax credits can provide investment
incentives that are equivalent to partial or full deductions and can also be
more generous than full deductions. For example, consider a person who has
qualified education expenses of $5,000 and receives a $1,000 Lifetime
Learning credit. If this person is paying taxes at a 20 percent effective
marginal tax rate, then the credit is equivalent to being able to fully deduct
the education cost from taxable income. If the person is paying taxes at a
higher marginal tax rate, then the credit is equivalent to a partial deduction.
For example, if the student is paying tax at a 31 percent marginal tax rate,
then the credit is equivalent to being able to deduct about $3,200 of the
investment cost. Similarly, if the student is paying tax at less than 20 percent,
then the credit provides more than a full deduction (i.e., a tax subsidy).
Overall, the tax system in place prior to 2001 can be characterized as
relatively inefficient with respect to investment in physical and human capital.
Changes to this system were and are still necessary to eliminate distortions
that keep the economy from reaching its full potential.

Pro-Growth Changes Since 2001
A number of pro-growth tax initiatives have been proposed and signed into
law by President Bush since 2001. The initiatives enacted include provisions
aimed at reducing the double taxation of corporate profits by lowering the tax
rate on dividends and capital gains; temporary bonus depreciation; expansion
of deductibility of higher education costs; and several smaller provisions
aimed at encouraging investment. Taken together, these reforms reduced the
effect of taxes on investment decisions.

Reducing the Double Tax on Corporate Profits
The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA),
proposed and signed by President Bush, reduced the double tax on corporate
profits by lowering the top individual tax rate on dividends and capital gains
to 15 percent through 2008. These changes promoted economic growth by
increasing capital in the corporate sector and improving the allocation of
capital throughout the economy. As shown in Chart 3-3, in the 9 quarters
preceding JGTRRA, real private nonresidential investment fell at an average
annual rate of about 7.5 percent and annual real GDP growth averaged
1.1 percent. In the 13 quarters after JGTRRA was enacted, real private
nonresidential investment grew at an average annual rate of about
72 | Economic Report of the President

6.9 percent, with annual real GDP growth averaging 3.6 percent. While it is
too early to estimate the full effect of pro-growth tax policy on GDP, recent
estimates suggest that without the tax cuts the economy would have had as
many as 3 million fewer jobs and real GDP would have been as much as
3.5 to 4 percent lower by the end of 2004.
Several studies indicate that prior to JGTRRA, corporations had been
steadily reducing dividend payments. The reason is that the tax system
resulted in a strong tax bias in favor of retained earnings and capital gains.
Since passage of JGTRRA, there has been an increase both in the average
amount of corporate dividend payments (Chart 3-4) and in the percent of
firms paying dividends (Chart 3-5). Reducing the double tax on corporate
profits also slightly reduced tax-motivated incentives for debt finance because
it reduced the effective marginal tax rate on equity finance. As seen in Chart
3-2, the effective marginal tax rate on equity-financed corporate investment
is now about 40 percent, a drop of about 12 percent from the pre-2001 effective tax rate. While this rate is still substantially higher than the effective tax
rate on debt-financed corporate investment, the relative reduction reduced
the distortion between debt and equity finance.
A major challenge facing this pro-growth change is the impermanence of the
capital gains and dividend tax reductions. Originally scheduled to expire at the
end of 2008, both provisions were recently extended until the end of 2010 in
the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 (TIPRA). For

Chapter 3

| 73

these changes to have lasting effects on investment and economic growth, these
pro-growth policies should be made permanent.

74 | Economic Report of the President

Increasing the Deductibility of Capital Investment
Another pro-growth change proposed and signed into law by President
Bush was the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 (JCWAA).
This act included a provision for temporary bonus depreciation, which allowed
taxpayers an additional first-year depreciation deduction of 30 percent from
taxable income. In 2003, JGTRRA included a modification to the JCWAA
bonus depreciation provision, allowing taxpayers to take a first-year depreciation deduction of 50 percent from taxable income. Both provisions were
temporary and expired at the end of 2004 because the purpose of these provisions was to provide a temporary investment stimulus to speed economic
recovery and promote short-term economic growth. By allowing investors to
deduct more of the cost of investment from taxable income in the year of
acquisition, these provisions had the effect of lowering by one-half or more
the effective marginal tax rate on qualifying investment.

Removing Distortions to Human Capital Investment
President Bush proposed and signed into law a number of provisions that
reduced tax distortions affecting human capital investment decisions. Among
these provisions were statutory changes that allow households to deduct
(within limits) higher education costs; an expansion of the deductibility of
student loan interest payments; and an expansion of the full deductibility of
employer-provided education expenses to include workers pursuing graduate
school education. Other changes include an increase in the amount of money
a household can contribute to a Coverdell ESA; the removal of tax considerations from higher education costs paid through qualified tuition programs
(Section 529 plans); an increase in the amount of costs eligible for the
Lifetime Learning credit; and an expansion of eligibility for these various
education provisions.

Other Changes
Other changes that have been signed into law by President Bush over the past
5 years are tax credits aimed at encouraging research investment; an expansion
of full deductibility of the acquisition cost of tangible property for small business (called Section 179 expensing); full deductibility of brownfields projects;
and full deductibility of certain oil exploration costs. Some of these changes
stimulated investment and greater short-run economic growth. Unfortunately,
the temporary nature of many of these provisions reduces their potential to
stimulate long-run efficiency gains to investment and economic growth.

Chapter 3

Incremental Approaches to a
More Pro-Growth Tax System
Many economists agree that adopting a broad-based consumption tax
would benefit the economy. There is a substantial body of research that estimates the economy-wide growth effects of this broad pro-growth tax reform.
The estimated effects can vary widely depending on the type of model used
and the policy change considered. For example, when considering the transition to a pro-growth consumption tax, estimates of the short-run increase in
the capital stock range from about 1 percent to about 14 percent, with
estimates of the long-run increase in the capital stock ranging from about
0 percent to about 32 percent. As a result of capital deepening (the increase in
capital per worker), the long-run increase in real gross domestic product
is estimated in the range of about 2 percent to about 8 percent (about
$260 billion to about $1.1 trillion in 2006 GDP).
In the absence of such broad reform and the transition to a consumption
tax base, there are two primary alternatives for adopting a more pro-growth
tax system. One is to allow investors to completely deduct (fully expense) or
substantially deduct (partially expense) the cost of their investments in the
year in which the investments are made. The other alternative is to lower the
statutory tax rate on investment income by reducing or eliminating the tax
rate on corporate income, capital gains and dividends, or a mixture of both.
Both of these approaches would reduce the amount of tax paid on an investment return, lowering the pretax rate of return necessary to undertake new
investment. If one of the objectives of pro-growth tax policy is to move incrementally to a more efficient, consumption-based tax system, then expensing
does a better job than rate reductions of meeting this objective. Indeed, full
expensing of investment is a necessary component of a consumption tax base.
By contrast, reducing the statutory corporate tax rate or eliminating the tax
on capital gains and dividends could be accomplished under the existing
hybrid tax system.
There are a number of reform options that contain elements of these
approaches. One option is a value-added tax (VAT) that replaces all or part of
the corporate income tax; another, the Growth and Income Tax (GIT),
proposed by the President’s Tax Reform Panel, would lower effective marginal
tax rates on new investment. Other options focus on household saving as a
means to remove investment distortions. However, compared to a VAT or the
GIT, these options would provide relatively less stimulus for domestic growth
within a rapidly expanding global market. The reason is that focusing
on savings incentives tends to ignore the full effects that capital has on
the economy. By reducing taxes on investment, the economy develops
more capital, increasing labor productivity and wages. In addition, reducing
76 | Economic Report of the President

effective tax rates on investment attracts more foreign investment because
U.S.-based investment would offer relatively higher after-tax rates of return.
(See Chapter 8, International Trade and Investment, for a discussion of the
benefits to the U.S. of foreign investment.) Expanding savings incentives can
provide capital deepening, but it will not encourage greater investment by
foreign investors who do not receive the benefits of the reform. This section
focuses on pro-growth options that would have the greatest impact on
economic growth.

Expensing of Investment
Allowing investors to fully deduct the cost of an investment from taxable
income is called full expensing of investment. As shown in Box 3-1, in the
absence of other taxes, full expensing reduces the tax paid on the normal
return to capital investment to zero, completely removing taxes from the
investment decision. This happens for two reasons. First, all assets face the
same effective tax rate—zero—so that taxes no longer influence the decision
about where or in what to invest. This results in a more efficient allocation of
capital. Second, with full expensing there is no difference between the pretax
and after-tax rates of return to investment. As a result, taxes do not discourage
capital formation.
It is important to note that full expensing is equivalent to not taxing the
ordinary, normal return (or opportunity cost) of new investment. As shown
in Box 3-1, the reason is that full expensing is equivalent to an interest-free
loan on the value of foregone tax liability. To see this result, consider the
example in Box 3-1. Under the income tax, the firm pays $35 in tax on the
cost of the investment, whereas under full expensing the tax liability on the
cost of the investment is zero. Assuming that the pretax return of 10 percent
equals the normal opportunity cost of funds, the deferral of tax liability is
worth $3.50 to the firm, which is exactly equal to the tax on the investment
return. Because the opportunity cost of this loan is equal to the normal return
to the investment, full expensing of investment costs is equivalent to
excluding the normal return portion of capital income from taxation.
However, returns in excess of the opportunity cost (called supra-normal
returns) are still subject to taxation. For our example, if the total return of
10 percent is composed as a normal return of 6 percent and a supra-normal
return of 4 percent, then the deferral of tax liability is worth $2.10 to the firm.
This is equivalent to the firm paying $1.40 in tax, which is a tax of exactly
35 percent on the $4.00 supra-normal return.
Partial expensing of investment occurs when something less than
100 percent of an asset’s purchase price is excluded from taxable income in
the year the asset is purchased. Partial expensing reduces, but does not eliminate, the amount of tax paid on the return to capital investment because costs

Box 3-1: Investment Returns Under Different Tax Systems:
A Numerical Example
Suppose a firm undertakes an investment in a new machine that
costs $100 and that earns a pretax rate of return of 10 percent. Assume
that the machine does not depreciate in value and that the firm sells the
machine for $110 after 1 year. Under a system with a corporate income
tax and no expensing, the after-tax cost of the machine is $100 because
the firm receives no deduction from taxable income when it purchases
the machine. At the end of the year the firm deducts the cost of the
machine from the firm’s total income and has a net income of $10. With
a corporate tax rate of 35 percent, the firm pays $3.50 (35 percent of
$10) in tax to the government. This leaves the firm with $6.50 in after-tax
income, and results in an after-tax rate of return of 6.5 percent on its
investment of $100. The corporate income tax creates a 3.5 percentage
point tax wedge between the pretax rate of return (10 percent) and the
after-tax rate of return (6.5 percent) on the investment.
With full expensing, the firm deducts the cost of the machine from
taxable income at the time of purchase. This means the firm’s after-tax
cost of the machine is only $65. As before, the firm then sells the
machine at the end of the year for $110. Under full expensing, the entire
$110 is included in taxable income because the firm deducted the cost
of the machine when it was purchased. This means the firm pays $38.50
(35 percent of $110) in taxes and makes an after-tax profit of $6.50. The
firm earns an after-tax rate of return of 10 percent on the $65 investment, which equals the pretax rate of return. Because the firm is not
taxed on the investment’s return, the result is an effective marginal tax
rate of zero.
In contrast, consider what happens when the government lowers the
corporate tax rate to 25 percent but allows no expensing. The firm sells
the machine at the end of the year for $110 and pays tax of $2.50 (25
percent of $10). As such, the firm’s after-tax rate of return is 7 percent
.5
and the tax wedge between the pretax and after-tax rate of return is 2.5
percentage points. Lowering the corporate tax rate reduces the disincentive to invest but does not eliminate it unless the statutory tax rate is
reduced to zero. By comparison, reducing the statutory corporate
marginal tax rate to 25 percent would be equivalent, in terms of the effective tax rate, to about 38 percent partial expensing of investment costs.

in excess of those expensed are still subject to the tax depreciation schedules,
resulting in an inefficient allocation of capital.
There are several advantages to adopting full expensing as part of the
current tax system. First, full expensing reduces the tax wedge between the
pretax and the after-tax rates of return on investments, resulting in a more
efficient level and allocation of capital throughout the economy. Second, if
coupled with the repeal of capital gains and dividends taxes, full expensing
completely removes taxes from equity-financed investment decisions. Third,
full expensing reduces distortions that affect the financing of new investment
by reducing incentives to debt-finance investment. Fourth, expensing is an
integral part of many major tax reform proposals, such as a transition to a
VAT, a consumed income tax, or the GIT. Overall, full expensing greatly
simplifies the tax system and is an important step in the transition to a full
consumption tax.
There are two important issues that must be resolved when adopting
expensing as part of the tax system. The first issue is transition costs, which
pertain to how the tax system will treat existing capital, called “old capital,” at
the time of the change. This is important because expensing can place a
potentially heavy tax burden on the owners of existing capital. This tax
burden arises because of the difference in the treatment of new capital (which
can be expensed) and old capital (which does not benefit from expensing). As
shown in Box 3-1, the after-tax rate of return on new investment rises with
full expensing. The increase makes new investment projects relatively more
attractive to investors than purchasing existing capital projects. Consequently,
the relative value of the existing capital at the date of the change must fall in
order for old capital to earn the same after-tax rate of return as an investment
in new capital. The decline in value is equivalent to an unavoidable tax on
existing capital and is considered a transition cost of full expensing.
The second issue is the treatment of interest payments under full or partial
expensing. If expensing is to result in taxes being neutral in investment decisions, interest payments must be taken out of the tax system. Otherwise
expensing could result in negative tax rates and overinvestment in capital.
Removing interest from the tax base means that borrowers cannot deduct
interest payments from taxable income. Similarly, lenders would not include
interest payments in taxable income. The elimination of interest deductibility
would help to equalize the tax treatment of different types of financing and
would reduce tax distortions in investment decisions. However, excluding
financial transactions from taxation could create difficulties for financial services businesses and result in opportunities for tax arbitrage—forming or
consolidating businesses to take advantage of the difference in tax rates as the
basis for profit. The taxation of financial services under a consumption tax is
a perennially thorny problem that has yet to admit of an easy solution.
80 | Economic Report of the President

Reducing Statutory Tax Rates
An alternative to expensing of investment is to reduce statutory tax rates on
investment income. Unless the tax rate is reduced to zero, however, lowering the
statutory tax rate will not completely eliminate distortions affecting capital
investment decisions. As discussed in Box 3-1, the effect of lower statutory rates
on investment is similar to that of partial expensing of investment. Lowering the
statutory tax rate on investment can take many forms—lowering the corporate
tax rate, lowering individual tax rates, reducing or eliminating the tax rate on
capital gains and dividends, or some combination of these. All of these alternatives have the effect of reducing tax distortions on investment decisions, but the
economic effects will differ according to which tax rates are reduced.
One of the biggest misconceptions about pro-growth tax policy is that
reducing the statutory corporate tax rate only benefits corporations. The main
problem with this argument is that corporations are pure legal entities that
cannot themselves bear the burden of taxes. It is households, in their role as
owners and users of corporate capital, who benefit from the reduction in
corporate tax rates. As discussed in Box 3-2, corporate tax burdens are distributed across all households. The long-run effect of reducing the corporate tax
rate is to increase the capital stock, making labor more productive. Ultimately,
reducing corporate taxes benefits labor through higher wages and benefits
capital owners through higher after-tax returns.
An important goal of pro-growth tax policy is to promote a tax system that
does not create distortions that affect the structure of business formation or
business investment. By reducing statutory tax rates for corporations or
households in an uncoordinated way, the tax system can create incentives that
favor certain forms of business. For example, consider reducing the maximum
effective corporate tax rate below the maximum effective individual tax rate.
This would make it relatively more attractive for businesses to incorporate
rather than form as a sole proprietorship or partnership (which pay tax using
individual rate schedules). Consolidating the business and individual tax
bases would reduce or remove taxes from consideration in business decisions.
Reducing individual tax rates can also reduce tax considerations from
capital investment decisions. Perhaps the most direct way to stimulate greater
individual saving and investment is to reduce or eliminate the tax rate on
capital gains and dividends. This is important because even with full
expensing, the effective tax rate on investment is positive as long as there are
taxes on capital gains and investment income. Consider two effects from the
recent reduction in taxes on capital gains and dividends. First, there was an
overall reduction in taxes on corporate income, which stimulated greater
investment. Second, the changes reduced the tax distortion that favored
returns in the form of capital gains. Prior to JGTRRA, the double tax on
corporate income was as high as 42 percent and 61 percent for corporate
Chapter 3

| 81

Box 3-2: Who Bears the Burden of Corporate Taxes?
One key tenet of public economics is that businesses do not pay
taxes, people do. Businesses organize capital and labor to produce
goods and services used throughout the economy and consumed by
households. But businesses are owned by individuals, hire individuals
as workers, and sell to individual consumers. While firms remit business taxes to the government, it is individuals who bear the burden (or
incidence) of business taxes. Investors may bear the burden through
lower after-tax returns to investment, workers through lower wages,
and consumers through higher prices.
Tax law provides no insight as to who bears the burden of the corporate tax. A corporation can be viewed as an institution comprised of its
owners and creditors, wage earners, and customers. In this sense,
everyone belongs to the institution, so everyone consequentially bears
some portion of the tax burden. An important question is whether the
tax burden is primarily borne by owners of capital or by labor. In
analyzing the incidence of the corporate tax between capital and labor,
it is important to distinguish between the short-run versus the long-run
burdens. In the short run, increases in the corporate tax are borne by
current owners of corporate capital through a drop in asset values and
by investors through lower after-tax rates of return. In the long run,
labor bears most of the burden of the corporate tax. This is because for
taxes on capital income, an increase in the effective tax rate on new
saving and investment leads to a reduction in capital accumulation. The
resulting decline in the capital-to-labor ratio decreases labor productivity and leads to a fall in wages.

income distributed as capital gains and dividends, respectively. After
JGTRRA, the double tax on corporate income fell to about 40 percent and
45 percent for capital gains and dividends, respectively. As shown in Charts
3-3 to 3-5, following JGTRRA, real private nonresidential investment rose
substantially, and there was an increase in the average amount of dividend
payments and the percent of firms paying dividends.

Comparison of Effects of Different Pro-Growth Policies
The primary objective of pro-growth tax policy is to stimulate new investment. New investment leads to a larger capital stock, increases in productivity,
higher wages, and economic growth. Full expensing of investment does a

82 | Economic Report of the President

better job than rate cuts in meeting this objective. As noted above, rate cuts
reduce but do not eliminate the effect of taxes on new investment decisions.
In addition, a tax rate reduction applies to all investments, new and old alike.
By contrast, full expensing is carefully targeted towards removing tax
considerations from new investment decisions.
One method of comparing policies is to estimate “bang for the buck”
measures that show the amount of investment stimulus per dollar of tax cost.
These measures are derived by using sophisticated macroeconomic models to
simulate the effect of pro-growth policy changes, assuming that each policy
change has the same budget effect. As shown in Table 3-2, full expensing
provides investment incentives that are 3.5 times as large per dollar of revenue

Conclusion
The goal of pro-growth tax policy is to finance a given level of government
services in a way that minimizes the drag imposed on the economy by tax
distortions on investment decisions of households and businesses. Of particular importance is the effect a tax system may have on capital investment
decisions. Taxing capital in a way that distorts investment decisions can affect
the level, allocation, and financing of new projects. Reducing the tax on capital
income will lead to a larger capital stock and higher standards of living. With
more capital available, labor becomes more productive and real wages rise.
An incremental approach to pro-growth tax policy would be a transition to
a tax system that allows full expensing of capital investment. Research indicates that we could expect up to a 8-percent increase in long-run real GDP
from adopting the pro-growth policy of full expensing. Full expensing
provides relatively more bang for the buck because it targets new investment,
whereas rate cuts benefit old and new capital alike.
Reducing or eliminating distortionary capital taxation leads to a more efficient level and allocation of capital throughout the economy. This increase in
efficiency in turn results in higher productivity, GDP, and standards of living.
While there have been recent changes to a more pro-growth tax system, the
temporary nature of the provisions reduces the long-run impact of these policy
changes on investment and economic growth. Making these changes permanent would ensure a tax system that minimizes tax distortions to investment
decisions that can keep the economy from reaching its long-run potential.

The Fiscal Challenges Facing Medicare

S

ocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are three vital entitlement
programs in the United States that provide people with important
economic security against the financial risk associated with retirement,
disability, and medical expenses. In 2006, the Federal Government spent
$1.1 trillion on these entitlement programs; this amount is projected to grow
to $1.5 trillion by 2012. In the absence of reforms to either raise more
revenue or restrain future spending, excess growth in entitlement spending
will need to be offset by reductions in discretionary spending, putting significant pressure on other important programs. As history has shown, there is no
uncontroversial way to reform these entitlement programs. Reforms to
increase tax revenue will have negative effects on the economy. At the same
time, it is crucial that any spending reforms preserve the protection against
financial risk that these programs provide. Thus, improving the efficiency of
these programs is crucial to slowing the growth of entitlement spending.
This chapter focuses on Medicare. It begins with a brief overview of the
program and then examines the main reasons for the projected financial pressures facing Medicare. It concludes with a discussion of ways to improve the
efficiency of Medicare spending and thus the long-term financial outlook of
this important program. The key points in this chapter are:
• The projected long-term growth in entitlement spending, including
Medicare, is unsustainable because of the pressures it places on future
Federal budgets and by implication, on the economy.
• Medicare spending is growing quickly, primarily because of the demographic shift to an older society and the increases in per-beneficiary
medical spending driven largely by new technologies.
• Rewarding providers for supplying higher quality care and improving
incentives for patients to choose higher value care can both increase the
efficiency and slow the growth of Medicare spending.

Entitlement Spending and Medicare
Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are entitlement programs; that is,
individuals who are eligible for these programs are entitled to particular benefits. Social Security provides income to seniors, the disabled, and surviving
spouses and dependents. Medicare provides health insurance to retirees and
the disabled. Medicaid provides health insurance to certain lower income
85

groups. Workers and their spouses are entitled to receive Social Security and
Medicare benefits if they make sufficient payroll contributions while working,
and citizens and qualified aliens are entitled to Medicaid benefits if they meet
certain income and other demographic criteria.
Chart 4-1 shows spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid in
2006 as a percent of the total Federal budget. The $549 billion in Federal
spending on Social Security benefits was 21 percent of total Federal outlays.
The $330 billion in federal spending on Medicare benefits was 12 percent of
outlays. The $191 billion in federal spending on Medicaid was 7 percent
of outlays. Because Medicaid is jointly funded by the Federal and State
governments, State governments also spent about $139 billion on Medicaid.
For those not covered by Medicare or Medicaid, the federal government
also helps with the purchase of private health insurance coverage in a variety
of ways, including the exclusion of employer contributions towards health
insurance premiums from personal income taxes. These tax expenditures are
included in the Federal budget and are estimated to equal $133 billion in
2006. The President’s 2008 budget includes a proposal to replace the existing
exclusion for employer-provided health insurance with a flat standard deduction to all families who purchase health insurance that meets minimum
requirements for catastrophic coverage, in order to improve the efficiency and
equity of these tax expenditures. The President’s policy proposal is described
in Box 4-1.

86 | Economic Report of the President

Box 4-1: The President’s Proposal to Improve the Tax Treatment
of Private Health Insurance
The current tax treatment of private health insurance coverage is
both inequitable and inefficient. Employer contributions (and in most
cases, employee contributions) toward private health insurance
coverage are exempt from income and payroll taxes. This is inequitable
because it does not offer the same tax break to families that do not have
access to employment-based insurance and instead purchase a private
plan in the individual health insurance market. It is also inefficient
because it provides a larger tax break to families with more generous
health insurance policies, which in turn can drive the inefficient use of
medical care of low value. For more detail about these inefficiencies,
see Chapter 4 of the 2006 Economic Report of the President.
The President’s 2008 Budget has proposed reforming the current
open-ended tax exclusion for employment-based health insurance
coverage, effective in 2009, with a flat $15,000 standard deduction for
health insurance to all families (or $7,500 for individuals), whether that
insurance was obtained through their employer or on their own. The
amount of this standard deduction would be independent of the actual
amount spent on the premium, so families who obtain insurance policies for less than $15,000 (but satisfying a set of minimum
requirements for catastrophic coverage) would still be able to exempt
the full $15,000 of compensation from income and payroll taxes. The
annual increase in the standard deduction for health insurance would
be linked to the Consumer Price Index, and the policy would be roughly
budget neutral.
This policy would reduce inequity in the tax code by providing the
same tax treatment of health insurance purchases to families with or
without access to employment-based health insurance. Those who are
currently insured in the individual health insurance market would see a
reduction in taxes commensurate with those insured in the group
market, and those who are currently uninsured would be given a strong
incentive to purchase coverage. For instance, for an uninsured family of
four with $50,000 in income facing a 15 percent marginal income tax
rate and a 15.3 percent total combined payroll tax, the value of the
$15,000 exclusion would be worth about $4,500, and would thus offset
the cost of roughly half of a health insurance plan costing $9,000.
This policy would also reduce the inefficiency of the current tax treatment of employment-based health insurance. An insured wage-earning
family of four with $50,000 in income currently receives a tax break of
about $3,000 toward a $10,000 policy but about $6,000 toward a
continued on the next page

Chapter 4

| 87

Box 4-1 — continued
$20,000 policy, because the current value of their exemption equals
their roughly 30.3 percent marginal tax rate times the actual amount of
the premium. The advantage of the standard deduction policy is that it
provides the same tax treatment to all types of health insurance plans.
While it would provide a strong incentive to obtain at least some basic
level of coverage, it would not encourage families to obtain inefficiently
expensive health insurance that covers low-value services.

Spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is projected to
increase and claim an even more significant share of the federal budget in the
future. Examining total spending as a fraction of gross domestic product
(GDP) is especially relevant because this measures the portion of the overall
economy devoted to each particular program. For instance, Social Security
spending was 4.2 percent of GDP in 2005 and is projected to be 6.3 percent
of GDP in 2080. Total Medicare spending was 2.7 percent of GDP in 2005
and is projected to be 11.0 percent of GDP in 2080. Total health care
spending in the United States by private and public sources combined was
16.0 percent of GDP in 2005, equaling almost $2.0 trillion or $6,697 per
person. Although national health expenditures have grown at a slower
rate than the previous year for the prior 3 years, health spending has still
consistently grown at a faster rate than general inflation.
While Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid share some common
features, each also poses its own opportunities and challenges, warranting
detailed specific analysis. Chapter 5 of the 2002 Economic Report of the
President examined Medicaid coverage for low-income families, Chapter 6 of
the 2004 Economic Report of the President examined Social Security, and
Chapter 4 of the 2006 Economic Report of the President examined health care
spending generally. This chapter focuses primarily on Medicare.

The Basics of Medicare
A primary motivation behind the passage of Medicare in 1965 was that
many of the elderly at the time had no health insurance. Medicare was structured to mimic the prevalent form of private health insurance at the time,
Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Blue Cross plans covered inpatient hospital services, and Blue Shield plans covered physician and hospital outpatient services.
The “Blues” were the basis for separate Part A and Part B plans that reimburse
hospitals and physicians on a fee-for-service basis, respectively. Seniors who
have worked at least 40 quarters in qualified employment are automatically
88 | Economic Report of the President

enrolled in Part A at age 65. Seniors who lack 40 quarters of employment can
buy into Part A by paying a monthly premium. People under the age of 65
with certain disabilities or end-stage renal disease are also eligible for
Medicare. Enrollment in Part B is optional and requires a premium contribution, although there is a penalty for not immediately enrolling and the
amount is higher for individuals making more than $80,000 per year. The
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administers the Medicare
program by implementing the statutes that determine the form of payments
to hospitals, physicians, and outpatient providers.
Most outpatient prescription drugs were not covered by Medicare until the
implementation of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003, which
created Part D of Medicare. Like Part B, Part D is optional, requires a
premium contribution, and has a penalty for late enrollment. Unlike Part B,
however, Part D is administered by private health insurance plan sponsors.
Seniors have the alternative option of enrolling in a private Medicare
Advantage insurance plan if one exists in their region. These are private health
insurance plans that provide Part A, Part B, and, in most cases, Part D services. These plans often provide additional benefits to seniors at lower costs.
The Medicare Advantage program is described in more detail in Box 4-2.

Box 4-2: The Medicare Advantage Program
Approximately 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in
private managed-care health plans, including primarily health maintenance organizations (HMOs) but also preferred provider organizations
(PPOs) and private fee-for-service plans. These Medicare Advantage plans
contract with Medicare to provide the services covered by Part A and Part
B and usually offer additional benefits such as relatively lower cost
sharing and additional covered services. Enrollment into these plans is
voluntary but requires that a local plan is available. As of 2006, all
Medicare beneficiaries had the option of enrolling in a Medicare
Advantage plan, including plans that provide prescription drug coverage.
Prior to 1997, Medicare HMOs received a capitated payment based on
95 percent of the average Medicare beneficiary spending in the county,
adjusted only for age, gender, Medicaid enrollment, and disability
status. Studies suggest that healthier beneficiaries were more willing to
enroll in these plans, because HMOs typically place restrictions on care.
As a result, the program increased total Medicare expenditures
because the payments to the HMOs were generally higher than the
actual costs of their enrollees in the fee-for-service program.
continued on the next page

Chapter 4

| 89

Box 4-2 — continued
The 1997 Balanced Budget Act eliminated the direct link between
plan payment rates and local fee-for-service expenditures and sought to
expand the types of plans available to beneficiaries beyond the urban
areas where they had generally been available. The 1997 Balanced
Budget Act also mandated the use of risk adjustment to vary the
payments to insurers based upon the health status of its enrollees by
2000. As a result, incentives to engage in wasteful competition for relatively healthier enrollees were mitigated so that insurers would instead
engage in competition to provide higher value care at a lower cost for
all enrollees. Because of some of the limits on the growth in payments
in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, many private insurers withdrew from
the Medicare market. Enrollment declined by about 25 percent from
1999 to 2003.
The 2003 Medicare Modernization Act expanded the Medicare
Advantage program in two important ways (in addition to changing the
name from “Medicare+Choice” to “Medicare Advantage”). First, the 2003
Medicare Modernization Act increased the payment levels to the plans to
encourage participation across all Medicare Advantage plans. Second,
the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act created new regional preferred
provider organizations that offer a uniform deductible and an upper limit
on out-of-pocket spending to increase both the number of choices available to Medicare beneficiaries (especially in rural areas) and special
needs plans to target certain beneficiaries (such as those with dual
eligibility, those with chronic conditions, and the institutionalized).

Medicare spending is financed by a combination of payroll taxes, general
revenue, and premiums paid by beneficiaries. Part A of Medicare is financed
by a Hospital Insurance (HI) payroll tax of 2.9 percent. The HI payroll tax is
split evenly between employees and employers, but economists generally
believe the employer tax is ultimately paid by workers in the form of relatively
lower wages. Part A is a pay-as-you-go system in which payroll taxes on current
workers’ wages finance the benefits of those currently retired. If the payroll tax
revenues exceed spending for the year, the difference is placed into the HI Trust
Fund. If taxes are lower than spending, money is withdrawn from the HI Trust
Fund. Parts B and D constitute the Supplementary Medical Insurance component of Medicare and are financed by general Federal government revenues
and beneficiary premiums, which are set to equal approximately 25 percent of
total Part B and Part D spending, respectively.
90 | Economic Report of the President

Nations around the world provide various forms of social insurance for
their elderly populations. One of the purposes of health insurance is to ensure
that people are protected against the financial risk associated with uncertain
medical spending. Economists generally attempt to justify government intervention into private market outcomes by suggesting potential market failures
that may exist in the absence of any government intervention. Many economists would justify the existence of Medicare (and its government provision
of health insurance for the elderly and disabled) with three potential explanations. The first potential explanation is that many people may lack sufficient
information to plan properly for the financial hardships that would otherwise
arise from expensive medical treatment when they age or become disabled.
Medicare requires workers to pay a premium during their working years
toward future costs and thus the program can be considered a form of forced
savings. In this way, Medicare is similar to Social Security, which requires
people to set aside some of their wages now in exchange for a promise of
income at retirement. But this reason alone is insufficient to explain the
provision of health insurance as opposed to additional income.
A second potential explanation for government intervention in the
provision of health insurance for seniors is to avoid having seniors in poor
health pay considerably more toward their health care. In the United States,
most people participate in health insurance plans through their place of
employment. Most people lose these plans upon retirement. (Private retiree
health insurance plans only cover what Medicare does not.) Because about
40 percent of people at age 65 have at least one serious preexisting chronic
health condition, initiating coverage in a private individual health insurance
market after retirement (under the assumption that the Medicare program did
not exist) would force insurers to charge higher premiums to those in poor
health. Younger people face uncertainty that they may develop a chronic
condition in the future (and thus they would face variable premiums in the
absence of Medicare). This suggests that there may be efficiency gains from
providing future insurance coverage with pooled contributions. (Private
health insurance markets handle this intertemporal uncertainty of developing
a chronic health condition with “guaranteed renewal at class average rates”
provisions that ensure that premiums do not vary with the onset of illness for
those with coverage.)
A third potential explanation for government intervention in the provision
of health insurance is related to the redistribution of resources toward lowincome people. Economic theory suggests that unconditional transfers of
wealth are generally more efficient than in-kind transfers of goods or services
for achieving any desired redistribution. In an ideal world, the poor would use
some of this transferred wealth to purchase health insurance. However, if the
poor believe that society will provide them with additional resources in the

Chapter 4

| 91

event of an uninsured loss, they may have an incentive to forego buying
insurance. This precommitment problem, sometimes called the “Samaritan’s
Dilemma,” has been demonstrated to be alleviated by the direct provision of
health insurance rather than a direct transfer of wealth. This economic argument, however, justifies the subsidization of, or requirement for, insurance
but does not justify a government-run plan.

Since Medicare was created in 1965, total spending on all of its programs
has grown steadily. As noted above, total Medicare spending was 2.7 percent
of GDP in 2005 and is projected to be 11.0 percent of GDP in 2080. These
values for Medicare spending, however, actually understate the total spending
for Medicare beneficiaries because the private payments for cost sharing are
not included. For instance, in 2006, Part A requires individuals to pay $952
of the cost of each hospitalization (this $952 is called a deductible), and Part
B generally requires them to pay 20 percent of the Medicare-approved
payment (this 20 percent is called coinsurance) in addition to a deductible.
Some beneficiaries pay Medicare deductibles and coinsurance amounts from
their own pockets, while others obtain private insurance to cover these costs.
Some of this private coverage is included in employer-sponsored retirement
benefits, while some is provided by directly purchased Medigap plans. Some
low-income Medicare beneficiaries are also eligible for Medicaid. For these
dually eligible people, Medicaid covers most of these cost-sharing amounts
required by Medicare.
Chart 4-2 shows historical and projected private and public spending for
Medicare-covered services as a percentage of GDP for 1966 through 2050.
Including private spending by Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid spending
on Medicare beneficiaries presents a more complete picture of beneficiaries’
total consumption. In 2006, beneficiaries bore about 37 percent of Medicarerelated spending, and about 63 percent was financed by payroll taxes and
general revenues. However, these amounts shown here do not include the
portion of Medicaid spending on long-term care services, such as nursing
homes, because this type of care is not covered by Medicare. More detail
about coverage of long-term care is provided in Box 4-3.

Medicare Solvency
The Medicare program does not have enough projected revenue to cover
projected future spending. Under current projections made by the Medicare
Actuaries and presented in the 2006 Medicare Trustees Report, the Medicare
HI Trust Fund is projected to be exhausted in 2018. The projected 75-year
deficit for the Medicare HI Trust Fund is 3.51 percent of taxable payroll. That
is, the Medicare HI payroll tax would have to be immediately increased from
2.90 percent to 6.41 percent to cover all projected spending over the next
75 years. Alternatively, a reduction in Medicare Part A expenditures by
51 percent would be necessary to make the Medicare Trust Fund solvent. As
a comparison, this Medicare deficit is relatively larger in magnitude than the
Social Security Trust Fund deficit. An increase in the Old Age, Survivors, and
Disability Insurance (OASDI) payroll tax from 12.4 percent to 14.4 percent
or a reduction in Social Security benefits by 13 percent is projected to make
the Social Security program solvent over 75 years.
The Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) program is
considered to be solvent by the Medicare Trustees only because Part B and
Part D spending is required by law to be financed by general revenues.
However, the consequences of increased spending on Medicare SMI may be

Box 4-3: Long-Term Care
Nine million people use long-term care (LTC) to alleviate the
hardships accompanying old age or disability. LTC is medical care
required over a long period of time by someone with a chronic illness
or disability. An estimated 70 percent of people who reach the age of 65
will need some form of LTC before they die. Medicare does not have a
large LTC component, as it only covers post-acute care in skilled
nursing facilities and some home health care, which total less than
20 percent of all LTC. Private, noninsured spending covers about
25 percent of LTC expenditures, while private insurance pays for less
than 10 percent. Many Medicare beneficiaries obtain LTC after they
have depleted their assets and become eligible for Medicaid. Medicaid
LTC eligibility is often tied to receiving Supplemental Security Income
and having very few assets, but states have the discretion of easing
eligibility criteria. Medicaid covers over 45 percent of all LTC expenditures. About one-third of Medicaid expenditures go to LTC.
The average price for 1 year in a nursing home is $70,000. This cost
is high enough to strain even middle-income families, yet few people
prepare financially for potential LTC expenses. Studies generally
attribute failure to purchase LTC insurance to a lack of awareness about
the potential costs of LTC, the benefits of coverage, and a misperception that Medicare covers all LTC. Adverse selection in the market (by
those who expect to use long-term care being more likely to purchase
insurance) results in very high premiums and relatively fewer insurance
companies offering LTC policies. Many seniors forgo obtaining private
coverage and instead become Medicaid-eligible by sheltering their
assets through income annuities, trusts for their children, and asset
transfers to family members. In response to these loopholes, States
and the Federal government have tightened Medicaid eligibility.
Because of the pressure LTC places on State budgets, many policymakers believe that changes should be made to LTC administration.
Encouraging the purchase of private long-term care insurance may
be a valuable step in reducing Medicaid spending on LTC while
protecting seniors from poverty. For example, New York currently has a
20 percent tax credit available toward the purchase of LTC insurance.
Such a subsidy should generally make LTC insurance more attractive to
middle-aged people. Medicaid spend-down insurance, which permits
people who purchased and used LTC insurance to keep some assets
and still qualify for Medicaid, could also increase the attractiveness of
private LTC coverage.

94 | Economic Report of the President

just as dire. Without large reductions in Medicare SMI spending or increases
in taxes, either Federal budget deficits will grow rapidly or dramatic reductions in spending for other Federal programs will have to be made.
Spending on Medicaid is also funded by general revenues. The elderly and
disabled covered by Medicare account for about one-quarter of Medicaid
enrollees, but they account for about two-thirds of Medicaid spending,
mainly because of spending on acute and long-term care. An additional challenge for funding Medicaid is the inverse relationship between the proportion
of the population eligible for benefits and the tax base available to fund the
program. During economic downturns, lower personal income causes State
governments with balanced-budget requirements to face the strain of both a
decrease in tax revenue and a higher number of residents who meet the
low-income eligibility threshold and are thus in need of assistance.

Implications for Reform
In light of the mounting fiscal pressures on entitlement spending, it is
critical to increase the efficiency of spending on benefits. Reforms of the
Medicare program should aim to reduce the growth of spending by redirecting resources toward the highest value uses and away from inefficient care
of low value. Controlling cost growth while preserving the vital financial and
health protections offered by the program is particularly important in light of
the large negative consequences of raising taxes. An increase in the payroll tax
rate would decrease incentives to work, increase efforts to receive compensation in forms not subject to taxation, and be a drag on economic growth.
As noted above, Medicare taxes on current workers’ wages essentially fund
an insurance pool from which benefits are paid on behalf of retired or
disabled workers. A pay-as-you-go system of intergenerational transfers is
consistent with the basic idea behind insurance if the aggregate amount paid
into the pool (in the form of taxes on workers) equals the aggregate amount
of expected benefits to be paid from the pool. In private insurance markets,
policyholders must have confidence that future claims will be covered by the
insurer. To help alleviate consumer concerns, government regulations often
place solvency requirements on insurers that require them to have enough
assets to cover their liabilities. Thus, for Medicare’s pay-as-you-go financing
mechanism to function as a social insurance program, younger generations
must have confidence that the government will indeed meet its future insurance obligations to them. The rapid increase in Medicare spending over time
clearly threatens the confidence that younger generations have in the solvency
of the program. Indeed, a recent survey found that almost two-thirds of
workers are “not too confident” or “not at all confident” that Medicare “will
continue to provide benefits of at least equal value to the benefits received by
retirees today”.

Chapter 4

The next section of this chapter examines the reasons behind this projected
growth in Medicare spending. The average annual growth rate of Medicare
spending is projected to be 2.8 percentage points higher than GDP growth
per year between 2006 and 2040. Part of this increase in spending is due to
growth in the number of Medicare beneficiaries, and part of this increase in
spending is due to growth in real (inflation adjusted) Medicare spending
per beneficiary.

Reasons for the Changes in
Medicare Spending over Time
Increases in the Number of Medicare Beneficiaries
The proportion of the United States population covered by Medicare has
increased over time. This has resulted from the normal eligibility age remaining
fixed at 65 combined with the aging of the population. The aging of the population is due to both increased life expectancy and decreased fertility. In 1965,
65-year-old retirees could expect to live for 14.7 more years; by 2006, they
could expect to live for 18.6 more years. In 1965, the fertility rate was 96.3
births per 1,000 females aged 15 to 44; by 2004, it had fallen to 60.7 births.
(These changes in demographics have a similar effect on Social Security.)
The worker-per-beneficiary ratio illustrates the portion of the population
which provides revenue to cover the needed spending on Medicare beneficiaries. In 1965, there were about 4.6 workers for each Medicare beneficiary. In
2005, there were about 3.8 workers for each Medicare beneficiary. In 2050,
there are projected to be only 2.2 workers for each Medicare beneficiary.
In addition to being affected by long-term increases in longevity and
decreases in fertility, the worker-per-beneficiary ratio during the upcoming
years is also affected by the aging of the baby boom generation, which is made
up of those born between 1946 and 1964. (The baby boom generation can
be viewed as a temporary change in fertility rates.) The baby boom generation
explains the relatively steady worker-per-beneficiary ratio between 1975 and
2005 and the dramatically decreasing ratio between 2010 and 2040. After
2050, most benefits owed to the baby boom generation will have been paid,
and the worker-per-beneficiary ratio is projected to be relatively steady
though 2080 as long as current assumptions hold.
Unlike Medicare, the full retirement age for Social Security is 65 for those
born in 1937 and earlier, and will rise slowly to 67 for those born in 1960 or
later. However, the effect of increasing the eligibility age for Medicare would
not have a very large effect on total Medicare spending, because Medicare
96 | Economic Report of the President

spending increases with age as people become less healthy. For instance, while
people ages 65 and 66 represent about 9 percent of the Medicare population,
they are the recipients of only about 4 percent of total Medicare spending.

Increases in Spending per Beneficiary
Real growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary has averaged about
4 percent per year between 1996 and 2006, roughly 2 percentage points
greater than real per capita growth in GDP. For the Medicare Trustees Report,
the Medicare actuaries assume that the annual growth rate of Medicare
spending per beneficiary during the period between 25 and 75 years from
now will decrease to equal the growth rate of GDP per capita plus an average
of 1 percentage point. In addition to this so-called “intermediate” assumption, these actuaries also consider a “low-cost” assumption, in which annual
Medicare spending growth equals per capita GDP growth and a “high-cost”
assumption, in which annual Medicare spending growth equals per capita
GDP growth plus 2 percentage points.
One way to evaluate the affordability of these projected increases in
Medicare spending is to consider the effect of applying this growth rate to
overall medical spending in the United States and examine the resulting
growth in consumption of all other goods and services in the future economy
(that is, nonmedical consumption). One study estimated that applying the
intermediate assumption of long-term medical spending growth, equal to the
growth rate of per capita GDP plus 1 percentage point, would still result in
positive real growth in the level of nonmedical consumption over the next
75 years. However, the high-cost assumption of long-term medical spending
growth, equal to the growth rate of per capita GDP plus 2 percentage points
(and, as noted above, roughly equal to the growth rate of Medicare spending
in recent history), would cause the level of real nonmedical consumption to
increase only until year 2040 and decrease thereafter. During the period
between 2010 and 2040, an average of over 60 percent of the annual increase
in income would be allocated toward health care spending.
Research suggests that most of the increase in medical spending over time
has been driven by the advent of new technologies. New technologies make
available new treatments, some of which are more effective than others.
Research also suggests that the increased medical spending has, on average,
resulted in improvements in health with additional value exceeding the additional costs. For instance, the real cost of treating heart attacks increased by
about $10,000 for Medicare beneficiaries between 1984 and 1998, driven
by technological advances such as catheterization and angioplasty. Life
expectancy for heart-attack patients increased by about 1 year during this
same period. Although it is difficult to measure the value of human life and

Chapter 4

| 97

it is not clear that this relationship is causal, an estimate of the value of these
added health benefits is about $70,000, far in excess of the added costs.
Economists have suggested that an increase in medical spending over time
is not necessarily problematic, in and of itself, so long as the marginal benefits exceed the marginal costs. A simple cross-national comparison of the
fraction of GDP devoted to health care spending suggests that the United
States is a high-expense outlier relative to other developed countries.
However, it is plausible that the marginal benefits of improved health are
dependent on income, so that as a country’s GDP increases, it may be rational
for that country to devote a relatively higher share of its GDP to health care.
This perspective suggests that it may make sense for the United States to
spend more than other countries because it has higher per capita income and
health care can be a valued use of those higher resources.

Improving the Efficient Allocation
of Resources in Medicare
The remainder of this chapter considers ways to improve the efficiency of
spending in the Medicare program, in order to slow the projected growth in
spending. Policymakers face the challenge of enacting policies that limit inefficient health care spending but do not limit efficient health care spending or
the development of beneficial new technologies. This section begins by
providing several examples of sources of inefficiency in health care spending
and concludes by suggesting several ways to improve the incentives that
providers and Medicare beneficiaries face. Improving the efficiency of health
care spending is critical to improving both the long-term fiscal strain on the
Medicare program and the quality of care to patients, and it is likely that a
multipronged approach will be necessary.

Inefficient Health Care Spending
While some of the greater health care spending may be attributed to
technological improvements that enhance the quality of care and to increases
in national wealth, there are also many findings that are consistent with some
degree of inefficiency associated with relatively higher health care spending.
Health outcomes in the United States are often not substantially better than
those in other developed countries that spend far less on health care. The
Rand Health Insurance Experiment found that increased medical spending
led to only limited health improvements. The Dartmouth Atlas of Health
Care shows wide variations in Medicare spending within the United States
without associated variation in health or health outcomes.
98 | Economic Report of the President

It may, at first, appear to be difficult to reconcile the research findings that
new technologies over time produce valuable health benefits with the research
findings that higher spending does not yield better outcomes. It is likely that
there is significant overconsumption of health care that provides little
marginal benefit. Consider a costly new technology that provides very large
health benefits to specific patients in need. Suppose, however, that it is also
consumed by patients who benefit very little from the treatment. If the benefits to “appropriate” patients are very large, the increase in spending over time
on both “appropriate” and “inappropriate” patients combined can still imply
that the new technology is cost effective. However, because some “inappropriate” patients also receive the treatment, some of the variation in spending
is due to inefficiency. If this characterization is accurate, the technology is not
as cost effective as it should be.
This overconsumption of health care is frequently thought of as being
caused by poor incentives such as overly generous health insurance coverage.
That is, patients often face marginal prices for costly treatments that, due to
insurance coverage, are lower than the true marginal costs of treatment. (More
detail on optimal forms of private health insurance and the effect of increasing
cost sharing by consumers is provided in Chapter 4 of the 2006 Economic
Report of the President.) The presence of generous health insurance may
also influence the research and development of certain technologies with
questionable cost effectiveness.
There is also evidence of significant underuse of valued health care. For
example, there is a large body of medical literature demonstrating the cost
effectiveness of beta blockers for patients recovering from a heart attack. Due
to their effectiveness, they are prescribed in over 90 percent of cases. However,
studies have shown that persistence in use of beta blockers declines rapidly
even in the first year of treatment. Moreover, the U.S. Preventive Services
Task Force recommends that all women over 40 receive mammograms every
1 to 2 years, that all adults over 50 receive regular colorectal screenings to
detect colon cancer, and that all adults over 50 receive annual immunizations
against influenza. Compliance, however, is low: 68 percent of women receive
recommended mammograms, 35 percent of adults receive recommended
colorectal cancer screenings, and 65 percent of adults over 65 receive annual
influenza vaccines.
These data suggest that there are two main ways in which the efficiency of
Medicare spending could be improved, because there is both a relationship
between the insurer and beneficiaries and a relationship between the insurer
and providers. One is to encourage the use of cost-effective care that is
currently underconsumed. Medicare now covers an initial preventive physical
examination and many preventive screenings, but there are still potential
improvements to be made. Policies to achieve this goal should aim to improve

Chapter 4

| 99

the incentives for health care providers and insurers to provide high-quality
care. A second way to improve the efficiency of Medicare spending is to
discourage the use of ineffective care that is currently overconsumed. Policies
to achieve this goal should aim to improve the incentives that Medicare beneficiaries face regarding their consumption of care. More detail on these
policies is provided in the next two sections.

Better Incentives for Health Care Providers and Insurers
Medicare generally pays providers of the same service the same fee, regardless of the quality of care. If hospitals and physicians were paid amounts that
reflected objective measures of the quality of care provided, with differential
payments tied to higher quality and more efficient care, ideally many problems of underuse and misuse of care could be reduced. In practice, while “pay
for performance” holds a great deal of promise, it may be difficult to fully
implement because of the complexity of producing objective measures of
quality. For instance, tying payments to process measures—such as rewarding
cardiac physicians based on the proportion of their heart attack patients using
beta blockers—may cause providers to place too much emphasis on limited
aspects of providing high-quality care. Alternatively, tying payments to
outcomes measures—such as rewarding cardiac surgeons whose patients have
lower post-discharge mortality rates—may cause providers to face perverse
incentives to avoid treating high-risk patients most in need. Adequate payfor-performance measures will require sophisticated techniques to control for
underlying differences in patient health, which highlights the importance of
developing systems to collect detailed information about the kind of care that
patients receive. With the advent and adoption of better health information
technology and the development of rigorous and well-tested measures, using
pay-for-performance techniques to reimburse providers may become a vital
contributor toward higher quality and more efficient care.
High-quality health care may also be encouraged by providing patients
with valuable information so they may compare various providers to one
another. Competition among health care providers may improve incentives to
provide high-value care in two ways: higher quality and lower price. If
patients have access to the providers’ price and quality information, they will
have incentives to choose those providers with the highest value of care, and
physicians and hospitals will have strong incentives to reduce their fees and
improve the quality of care to attract more patients. There are two parts of
Medicare where this kind of information is available and these incentives are
in place. Private Medicare Advantage plans have strong incentives to offer
higher quality care at lower beneficiary premiums to encourage enrollment.
The new Part D prescription drug benefit provides information about the

100 | Economic Report of the President

price of prescriptions by plan and by pharmacy, provides access to customer
service information by plan, and also benefits from price competition among
insurers. More detail on the structure of and experience with the new
Medicare Part D benefit is provided in Box 4-4.

Box 4-4: Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Benefit
The Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit went into effect
January 1, 2006, as a result of the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act.
Prior to that date there was almost no coverage for outpatient prescription drugs in Medicare, except in Medicare Advantage plans. (Part B
does cover drugs in certain instances.) Part D beneficiaries may now
enroll in their choice of plans in their region. In 2007, the 34 regions will
offer between 45 and 66 standalone prescription drug plans at different
prices with varying levels of coverage at or above the minimum benefit
package. If an individual seeks greater benefits, they will generally pay
a higher premium. Individuals with incomes below 150 percent of the
Federal Poverty Level who meet eligibility requirements receive additional assistance in the form of reduced premiums, deductibles, and
coinsurance. The premium subsidies are on a sliding scale to better
target those with the lowest incomes. By June of 2006, over 38 million
Medicare beneficiaries had some form of prescription drug coverage.
One important feature of the Part D program is the competitive
premium bidding process by insurers. Each year insurers submit
premium bids for the following year to Medicare. These premium bids
are weighted by enrollment to determine the weighted average bid; this
amount is referred to as the benchmark premium. The basic premium
that nonpoor Medicare beneficiaries pay for a specific plan is the difference between the plan’s bid and 75 percent of the weighted average bid
(that is, the federal direct subsidy). Some low-income beneficiaries are
automatically enrolled in plans whose premiums are at or below the
regional enrollment-weighted average. Thus, there are significant
incentives for insurers to submit low bids. Early projections suggested
that the average premium in 2006 would be $37 per month, but
premiums ultimately averaged $24 per month. In 2007, the average
premium is expected to remain about the same.
Competitive bidding appears to be a successful model for providing
low costs to both beneficiaries and the government without government interference in determining drug prices. Satisfaction with the Part
D program is high. Several surveys have shown that at least 75 percent
of enrollees are pleased with the Part D benefit.

Chapter 4

| 101

Better Incentives for Medicare Beneficiaries
In addition to the competition induced by the new Part D benefit, its
pricing structure and associated subsidy for premiums provide good incentives for Medicare beneficiaries to obtain relatively more efficient forms of
insurance coverage. Because the Federal subsidy toward the prescription drug
plan is generally a fixed proportion of the average premium bid each year,
beneficiaries receive the additional benefits of choosing plans that are less
generous than the average benchmark plan. Thus, beneficiaries appropriately
receive the full marginal benefits from either a higher amount of cost sharing
or a more restrictive list of covered medicines. This mechanism for having
Medicare beneficiaries pay lower amounts for less generous coverage therefore
improves the incentives for insurers to design more optimal products.
A potential downside to this mechanism for determining beneficiary
premiums, however, is that it could lead to relatively higher premiums for
people with higher expected expenses due to chronic health conditions if
these high-risk people gravitate toward plans with relatively more generous
benefits. As a result, these plans’ higher premiums would reflect a relatively
sicker pool of people covered by the plan, in addition to the underlying value
of more generous benefits. However, these potential problems can be alleviated by the use of risk-adjusted payments to plans, as described in Box 4-2.
This mechanism for determining the premium contribution toward
different plans, currently in place for Part D, could potentially be applied to
the entire Medicare program. Providing beneficiaries with a choice of comprehensive plans and having the premium contribution for each plan vary in
relation to a benchmark plan has potential for improving the efficiency of
overall Medicare spending. A key difference between Medicare Part D and the
entire Medicare program, however, is the combination of the government-run
fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage components of the latter. This benchmark mechanism is likely to be successful only if the same premium
contribution is made toward both the fee-for-service component of Medicare
and the private Medicare Advantage plans, putting them on equal footing.
Just as described above, this mechanism for determining premium contributions would cause beneficiaries to receive the appropriate marginal benefits
when choosing plans with levels of coverage that are less generous than the
benchmark plan. It could therefore help to allow beneficiaries to determine
the optimal forms of out-of-pocket cost sharing and the optimal adoption of
new technologies over time. These two specific issues are explored below.

Premiums versus Out-of-Pocket Payments
The level of out-of-pocket cost sharing that would induce beneficiaries to
consume the optimal level of care is difficult to determine. The share of outof-pocket spending that will lead to an efficient amount of care would be set
102 | Economic Report of the President

at the level at which the marginal cost of being exposed to more financial risk
through relatively more cost sharing is less than the marginal benefits from
reducing the overconsumption of medical care resulting from relatively more
cost sharing. In practice, it is difficult to quantify these competing interests.
Nevertheless, Medicare currently may be missing this balance at both the
high-cost and low-cost extremes. Medicare currently does not provide protection against certain catastrophic health care costs (except in some Medicare
Advantage plans). For example, there is increased beneficiary cost sharing
after a hospitalization exceeds 60 days, and a cessation of benefits after
120 days. While these upper limits on benefits presumably have the advantage of reducing incentives to over consume, they appear to expose
beneficiaries to excessively high levels of financial risk.
While many seniors have private retiree health or Medigap plans to cover
Medicare’s gaps in catastrophic coverage, these plans also frequently cover
the first-dollar cost sharing, such as the hospitalization deductible and the
20 percent of physician fees. These plans limit the cost-consciousness of
consumers and therefore increase total spending. However, neither insurers
nor consumers bear the full marginal costs of the increased spending induced
by these generous Medigap plans, because Medicare covers most of the
increased spending.
If beneficiaries were to receive the marginal benefits of less generous
coverage in a way that puts the fee-for-service component and the Medicare
Advantage component on equal footing, there would be improved incentives
for private plans to offer and beneficiaries to select plans with more efficient
levels and forms of cost sharing. Beneficiaries, rather than Medicare administrators, should be the ones to decide the optimal mix of deductibles,
coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximums that best meets their needs and
preferences under neutral incentives.

Appropriate Levels of Spending Over Time
If Medicare beneficiaries were to receive the marginal benefits of choosing
a more efficient plan, the incentives to adopt costly new technologies would
be improved over time. As noted earlier, costly new technologies are efficient
if the value of the additional benefits from improved health exceed the
additional costs of that technology. People may not be willing to spend a great
deal of money on new treatments with very minor benefits. If Medicare beneficiaries were to receive the marginal benefits when selecting less
technology-intensive plans that delivered higher value care at lower cost, the
adoption of new technologies by health plans over time would be driven
by whether new technology delivers substantial enough health benefits. As a
result, consumers, rather than the government, would decide the extent to
which health care spending should increase over time.

Chapter 4

| 103

Conclusion
Medicare has significant long-term unfunded obligations. Although Social
Security spending is currently much greater than Medicare spending, the
unfunded obligation for Medicare is much greater than that for Social Security.
Eliminating the projected 75-year actuarial deficit for Medicare Part A would
require an immediate 3.51 percent increase in the HI payroll tax or a reduction in projected Medicare expenditures by 51 percent. Projected increases in
Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) funding may appear less
transparent because they are funded out of general revenues, but the economic
significance of these obligations for Medicare SMI is just as great.
Policymakers face the challenge of reducing the growth of Medicare
spending while preserving access to life-saving health care and the important
financial protections that Medicare provides, and they cannot do so without
ensuring that Medicare funds are spent more efficiently. Increases in Medicare
spending over time are driven by an increasing population of aged Americans
and increasing per-beneficiary spending on health care. While much of the
increase in medical spending over time is driven by valuable new technologies,
there also appear to be significant inefficiencies in the system. Therefore,
future policies to control the growth in Medicare spending should target the
sources of inefficient spending but not discourage the use medical care that is
costly but delivers greater health benefits. This tension is the primary
dilemma that policymakers face.
Policymakers may want to consider restructuring Medicare so that the
direct spending by Medicare beneficiaries, in the form of premium contributions and out-of-pocket spending for medical care, yields a more efficient
allocation of resources. Revising the Medicare fee-for-service program and the
Medicare Advantage program to be more like Part D with a fixed-dollar
subsidy provided toward the premium, has the potential for improving incentives for Medicare beneficiaries to consume optimal levels of care. When
individuals receive the full benefits of selecting less expensive coverage, they
will be more likely to select plans with optimal arrangements that balance
both financial protection and technological adoption.

Catastrophe Risk Insurance

I

nsurance plays a vital role in America’s economy by helping households and
businesses manage risks. Individuals purchase insurance so they can sleep
well at night; they gain comfort from the knowledge that they and their families are protected from some of the adverse effects of future events beyond their
control. Businesses purchase insurance for much the same reason. It allows
them to reduce the uncertainty associated with future costs and revenues,
which enables them to plan for the future more effectively. Today, one can
purchase insurance protection against a myriad of economic hazards, from
poor health to motor vehicle accidents to legal liability to lightning strikes.
Insuring economic losses arising from large-scale natural and manmade
catastrophes such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and terrorist attacks poses
special challenges for the insurance industry and for Federal and State governments. This chapter examines the economics of catastrophe risk insurance. It
draws the following main conclusions.
• In insurance markets, as in other markets, prices affect the way people
weigh costs and benefits. Insurance prices that are artificially low can
discourage people from adequately protecting against future losses. For
example, subsidized property insurance prices may stimulate excessive
building in high-risk areas, potentially driving up future government
disaster relief spending.
• Government intervention in insurance markets can have unintended
consequences such as limiting the availability of insurance offered by
private firms.
• Private insurers manage catastrophe losses by being selective about which
risks to insure, by designing insurance contracts to provide incentives for
risk-reducing behavior, and by charging prices that are high enough to
enable them to diversify risk over time or transfer risk to third parties.
By adopting private sector risk management and pricing practices,
government insurance programs could reduce the burden they impose
on taxpayers and minimize negative effects on private insurance markets.

The Economics of Catastrophe Risk Insurance
In the United States, insurance is provided through a variety of private and
public entities. Insurance companies owned by investors or policyholders
sell insurance in the private sector. State-sponsored insurance pools have
105

characteristics of both private and public entities. They are typically owned by
a group of private insurers, but they are governed under charters that grant
them special rights and impose responsibilities not required of private
insurers. Finally, the Federal Government operates at least 135 different
programs that provide insurance-like benefits to individuals and businesses.
To understand how insurance works, imagine a large group of homeowners
scattered throughout the country, each of whom faces a risk of property
damage from a variety of identified hazards such as fire or severe weather. The
likelihood that any particular member of the group will experience a loss is
low, but the economic costs to that individual, should a loss occur, are significant. Each member of the group can reduce uncertainty about future
economic losses by agreeing to pool risk with other members. One way of
accomplishing this is through a mutual insurance agreement. At the beginning of the year, each member agrees to make a payment, called an insurance
premium, into the pool. In exchange for their premiums, members are allowed
to file claims with the pool should their houses incur damage from a covered
hazard. Even if the insurance pool has no other resources, as long as the total
value of premiums paid into the pool is at least as large as the value of insured
losses over the year, all property damage will be fully covered. In this way,
members of the pool gain security through diversification. Because any
member’s losses are paid for with premiums collected by all members, no
member faces uncertainty about how much he will have to pay to cover
property damage in the coming year.
The process of evaluating a risk exposure, determining whether or not to
insure it, and setting terms and conditions for any insurance provided is called
underwriting. Through underwriting, insurance providers seek to tie the
premiums charged for insurance policies to the risks those policies cover.
Effective underwriting serves an important social function, because when
insurance prices accurately reflect underlying economic costs they can
encourage a more efficient allocation of scarce resources. For example,
suppose a member of a coastal community must decide where to build a new
home. She may prefer to live as close to the ocean as possible, but a home
located nearer the ocean may be exposed to a higher risk of damage from
windstorms and flooding. If homeowners’ insurance premiums are appropriately risk sensitive, then she will need to determine whether the benefits of
living closer to the ocean are worth the cost of higher insurance premiums.
Underwriting is critical to the efficient functioning of insurance markets.
In general, insurance markets function best under the following conditions:
1. Either all members of a pool face similar risks, or differences in risks
can be observed and incorporated in insurance premiums.
2. Insurance does not dissuade those who are insured from avoiding risks.
3. The total value of insured losses for a pool can be forecast with precision.
106 | Economic Report of the President

In many insurance markets, one or both of the first two conditions may not
hold. Violations of the third condition are a particular feature of catastrophe-risk
insurance markets. Through effective underwriting, insurers can reduce, though
perhaps not eliminate, problems that arise when these conditions fail to hold.

Effective Underwriting Reduces Information Problems
Insurance markets may fail to work effectively when differences in the risks
faced by policyholders cannot be incorporated in insurance premiums. To see
why, consider again the example of homeowners pooling risk. Suppose now
that there are two types of homeowners: those who live in coastal areas that
are at relatively high risk for windstorms and floods, and those who live in
inland areas at lower risk for these hazards. If all homeowners were charged
the same insurance premium, and if premiums were set equal to the average
loss rate for all homes, then homeowners in inland regions would rightly feel
that they were being overcharged. They face less risk from windstorms and
floods than owners in coastal regions, yet they are asked to pay a premium
equal to average losses for a pool that includes houses in both regions. Owners
living in coastal areas would be attracted to the pool because it offers insurance at a premium that does not reflect their homes’ higher risk. If the
insurance policy were offered to all homeowners, a disproportionate share of
those in coastal regions would accept the policy, while a disproportionate
share of those living inland would seek insurance elsewhere or would choose
to go without insurance. As a result, the average loss for those who chose to
participate in the pool would be higher than the premium charged.
This example illustrates a general property of insurance contracts which
economists call adverse selection. When premiums do not reflect differences in
risk that are known to potential policyholders, insurance pools tend to attract
members who are at greatest risk for the hazards covered. The solution to this
problem is to charge policyholders with different risk exposures different
premiums. In the example above, adverse selection could be avoided if homeowners in inland areas were charged lower premiums than those in coastal
regions. Insurance providers generally try to set premiums commensurate with
risk, but this is not always possible. In some cases it may simply be too costly
for an insurance provider to identify differences in risk, but, as discussed later
in this chapter, efforts by policymakers and insurance regulators to keep
premiums for some high-risk policyholders low can also play a role.
Inefficiencies can also arise when insurance discourages those who are
insured from taking actions to reduce potential losses. Consider the incentives
faced by a homeowner thinking about how best to prepare for future windstorms. Many homeowners can reduce the damage caused by windstorms by
installing storm shutters, but storm shutters are costly. If a homeowner is fully
insured against the economic losses arising from future windstorms, she may
Chapter 5

| 107

be less likely to purchase shutters. The tendency of those who are insured to
work less hard to avoid losses is called moral hazard.
Insurance providers are well aware of the potential for moral hazard, and they
attempt to address it through effective underwriting. Many insurance policies
only cover losses in excess of a specified amount called a deductible, or they
require that policyholders pay a fixed share of any losses incurred. By insuring
some, but not all, economic losses, these types of policies strengthen policyholders’ incentives to work to reduce the risks they face. Insurers may also
require that specific action be taken as a precondition for receiving coverage,
or they might provide pricing incentives for risk-reducing investments. For
example, an insurer might refuse to cover windstorm risks for homes without
storm shutters, or it might charge those homeowners a higher premium.

Catastrophe Losses Are Difficult to Forecast
Adverse selection and moral hazard problems are common in many insurance markets. Catastrophe risk insurers face an additional challenge, which
arises from the fact that the total value of losses for a pool of insured properties or individuals is often exceptionally difficult to predict.
Forecasting annual losses from hazards like automobile accidents that only
affect one or two members of a pool at a time is much easier than forecasting
losses from large-scale catastrophes such as floods, hurricanes, or terrorist
attacks. When the losses incurred by individual members of an insurance pool
are more or less independent of one another, the average loss rate per policy
is likely to be stable over time. Chart 5-1 illustrates this point by showing the
annual nationwide accident rate per 100,000 registered passenger cars. While
the accident rate has gradually declined over the past 15 years, it changes relatively little from year to year. It is difficult to predict whether any particular
vehicle will be involved in an accident, but based on the data presented we
can forecast with high confidence that about 4.5 percent of all passenger cars
will be involved in some kind of accident over the next year. Because largescale catastrophes have the potential to affect many members of an insurance
pool simultaneously, spreading risk across a large number of members may
not be sufficient to ensure that average losses per policy are stable over time.
Compare Chart 5-1 with Chart 5-2. Chart 5-2 reports the number of loss
claims filed per 100,000 homes and businesses insured for flood losses under
the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP). Flood losses are not independent of one another; a single
flood event can damage hundreds or even thousands of properties. Even
though the NFIP insures a pool of millions of properties, the average loss rate
per policy varies considerably from year to year.

108 | Economic Report of the President

Chapter 5

| 109

In some catastrophe-risk insurance markets, forecast accuracy also suffers
from a lack of relevant historical data and experience. This is a particular
problem when catastrophes are rare, and when the character of those events is
likely to change over time. For example, U.S. commercial property and casualty insurers had almost no experience forecasting losses from large-scale
terrorist attacks prior to September 11, 2001. A recent report by the
President’s Working Group on Financial Markets on the availability and
affordability of insurance for terrorism risk found that while modeling of
terrorism risk has improved since 2001, insurers continue to have limited
confidence in the models they use for evaluating this risk exposure.
When annual losses for a pool can be forecast with reasonably high
precision, it is relatively easy for an insurance provider to manage risk. As long
as its underwriting procedures ensure that the average premium paid by
members of the pool is at least as large as the average loss rate per member, it
is likely that in any given year total premium revenues for the pool will be
sufficient to pay all claims. If, as in our automobile accident example, losses
are independent across members of a pool, increasing the size of the pool
actually makes it easier for an insurer to manage risk, because the more
members that are included in the pool, the more stable will be the average loss
rate per member.
Losses from catastrophes are not independent across exposures, and therefore
they are much more difficult to manage. A severe hurricane, for example, can
cause damage over tens of thousands of square miles, so even if an insurer
provides windstorm coverage for properties scattered throughout a state, average
losses per property are likely to be exceptionally high in hurricane years. Since
catastrophes are infrequent but costly, annual premium revenues for a pool of
exposures that exceed the value of claims in most years may not be sufficient to
pay all claims in those rare years when a severe event occurs. Insurance providers
work to address this problem by pooling risk across time or by diversifying the
risk exposure more broadly by sharing it with other insurers.

Managing Catastrophe Losses
One way to manage the financial risk of insuring catastrophe hazards is to
retain a portion of excess premium revenues collected in years when losses are
low to pay claims in years when catastrophes generate large losses. Equity
capital set aside to pay potential claims is called surplus. In practice, building
surplus large enough to pay catastrophe losses can be difficult for private
insurance companies. Owners of insurance companies expect to earn a market
rate of return on their equity investments, including equity held as surplus to
cover future claims. Moreover, income flowing from insurance company
assets is subject to corporate income tax that effectively adds to the cost of
accumulating and holding surplus.
110 | Economic Report of the President

An alternative to using surplus to cover catastrophe losses is to transfer risk
to third parties. Some insurers transfer risk directly to capital market participants such as hedge funds and institutional investors (Box 5-1). More
commonly, insurers negotiate risk-sharing agreements with specialized insurance companies called reinsurers. Reinsurers are internationally diversified
companies that make a business of selling insurance to primary insurers. In a
typical reinsurance arrangement, a primary insurer pays a fee to a reinsurance
company that agrees to cover some of the insurer’s costs in the event that
claims exceed a prespecified threshold. In essence, reinsurance arrangements
work much like other types of insurance. Through reinsurance a primary
insurer subject to the risk of high claims caused by a catastrophe can pool its
risk with other primary insurers that are exposed to different hazards. As with
other types of insurance, problems of adverse selection and moral hazard can
impede the efficient functioning of reinsurance markets.

Box 5-1: Catastrophe Bonds and Sidecars—Accessing Financial
Markets to Better Manage Catastrophe Risks
Though reinsurance agreements between primary insurers and
specialized reinsurance companies remain the most popular method
for transferring and pooling risks posed by large-scale catastrophes, the
capital available to reinsurers is only a tiny fraction of the total capital
invested in financial markets. By one estimate, reinsurance companies
worldwide had accumulated about $400 billion in shareholder funds by
year-end 2005, which is only about 1 percent of the market capitalization of the world’s public equity markets. To spread catastrophe risks
more broadly, financial markets have developed mechanisms to allow
investors who do not directly hold shares in insurance companies to
assume some of the catastrophe risk exposure of primary insurers or
reinsurers in exchange for an appropriate investment return. Two
notable examples are catastrophe bonds and “sidecars.
”
Catastrophe bonds (CAT bonds), also called “acts of God” bonds, are
risk-linked securities that offer a return to investors similar to that on
high-yield corporate junk bonds. In a typical CAT bond transaction, a
firm that wants to transfer some risk to outside investors issues a bond
and invests the proceeds in safe securities. If a specified catastrophe
event occurs, the proceeds from the bond issue are released to the
issuer. If no event occurs during the term of the bond, the principal is
returned to investors. Payouts from CAT bonds are often tied to
industry-wide loss estimates or defined catastrophe events such as
whether or not a hurricane makes landfall on a particular stretch of
coastline. Because these types of events are presumably beyond the
continued on the next page

Chapter 5

| 111

Box 5-1 — continued
control of the bond issuer, investors are protected from moral hazard.
A drawback of these types of CAT bonds, however, is that they do not
protect the issuer against all possible catastrophe losses. For example,
an insurer that issues a bond with a payout tied to a hurricane event
could be exposed to large losses from a tropical storm that does not
meet the definition of a hurricane. The market for CAT bonds has grown
rapidly over the past decade, though the value of bonds outstanding
remains small relative to the value of insured losses in recent catastrophe events. About $4.9 billion in CAT bond capital was outstanding
as of year-end 2005, a 21 percent increase over the 2004 level.
Sidecars provide an increasingly popular alternative to CAT bonds.
A sidecar is a special-purpose financial entity, usually designed to last
2 to 3 years. Under a sidecar arrangement, a group of investors partners with an existing reinsurance company: the investors provide the
necessary funds for deployment and the reinsurance company
contributes its infrastructure, business relationships, and the skills of its
staff. Sidecar investors receive a portion of the reinsurance company’s
premium revenue from a particular reinsurance contract or line of business, and the reinsurer gains access to the investors’ capital to cover
potential catastrophe losses. Through sidecars, investors can decide to
assume particular catastrophe risks without being exposed to all of the
risks covered by a given reinsurance company. Sidecars have helped
Bermuda-based reinsurance companies to expand their capacity to
cover catastrophe risk exposures in the United States despite incurring
significant losses in 2005. About $2.5 billion in capital was reportedly
raised through sidecars organized with Bermuda reinsurers from
December 2005 to June 2006.
Through CAT bonds, sidecars, and other innovative financing
mechanisms, insurers and private investors are finding new ways to
spread the risks posed by large-scale catastrophes. These financing
mechanisms currently contribute only a relatively small share of the
total capital available to cover catastrophe losses, but the volume of
capital they have raised has grown rapidly in recent years. It is likely
that as these markets mature, the base of investors willing to bear
some catastrophe risk will continue to expand, ultimately lowering the
cost of insuring catastrophe risks.

112 | Economic Report of the President

What happens if an insurance provider lacks the resources to pay claims
following a catastrophe? Private-sector insurance companies that cannot
afford to pay claims are usually forced into receivership. In contrast, many
government-sponsored insurers can raise additional funds to pay claims after
an event has occurred. Government-sponsored insurance programs often do
not face the same financial constraints as private insurers because they have
special rights to compel third parties such as taxpayers or private insurers to
bear a portion of their financial risk. The NFIP, for example, is authorized by
Congress to borrow from the U.S. Treasury, which increases taxpayer liabilities, and the Federal Government’s terrorism-risk insurance program and
several State-sponsored catastrophe insurance providers are empowered to
levy surcharges on policies sold by private insurers.

Federal Catastrophe Insurance Programs
In 1803, Congress passed a law granting the victims of a fire in Portsmouth,
New Hampshire, extra time to repay certain debts owed to the Federal
Government. Though the Federal Government has assisted Americans
harmed by disasters throughout the Nation’s history, prior to the midtwentieth century aid was generally provided on an ad hoc basis; a disaster
would strike and Congress would then determine whether and to what extent
Federal aid would be provided. Acts of Congress passed in 1947 and 1950
regularized the process by which the Federal Government extends assistance
to disaster-affected communities and additional legislation enacted since then
has clarified and expanded the Government’s role in disaster relief.
One problem with a variety of government relief efforts is that they can
make it more difficult for private insurers to sell policies for some catastrophe
hazards at prices commensurate with underlying risks. People have less incentive to pay sometimes high insurance premiums if they expect to receive aid
from the government when a catastrophe strikes. Policymakers have sought to
address this moral hazard problem in several different ways. The Federal
Government provides insurance coverage for certain catastrophe hazards,
often at prices lower than those that would be charged by private insurers. In
addition, in some cases the Government requires that individuals purchase
insurance policies or mandates that private insurers offer policies for sale.

The National Flood Insurance Program
The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) was established in 1968 to
make flood insurance more widely available to homeowners and businesses,
to encourage local communities to prepare better for flood hazards, and to
reduce reliance on direct Federal disaster relief following floods. The NFIP
Chapter 5

| 113

currently provides flood insurance for 5.3 million policyholders nationwide,
many of whom might not be able to obtain coverage without the program.
Residential and commercial property owners in some 20,000 participating
communities are eligible to purchase flood insurance policies under the
program. Homeowners with mortgages issued by federally regulated lenders
on property in communities identified to be in flood hazard areas are required
to purchase flood insurance on their dwellings. Property owners can purchase
policies either directly from the Federal Government or, more commonly,
through local insurance companies who sell NFIP policies under their own
name but pass their risk on to the Government. Whether policies are sold
directly by the Federal Government or by insurance companies, the NFIP
receives premium payments for the policies and bears all financial risks associated with the insurance they provide. The program is administered by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
FEMA relies on Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) when underwriting
flood insurance. These maps identify areas within a community that have at
least a 1-percent chance per year of being inundated by high water. These
areas are called 100-year floodplains. Federal flood insurance is only made
available in local communities that agree to adopt zoning ordinances,
building codes, and other planning measures designed to reduce future
damage caused by floods. For example, communities must require that new
buildings be elevated above the level that flood waters are expected to reach
on average once per 100 years. According to FEMA, buildings that meet its
floodplain management standards suffer 80 percent less damage from floods
each year than those that do not. Not all structures insured under the NFIP
meet these standards, however; structures completed prior to a community’s
decision to participate in the program or prior to the publication of a community’s FIRM are eligible for insurance under the program even if they do not
meet FEMA standards.
The NFIP charges different premiums for different properties. A structure
built or substantially renovated after 1974 or after a community’s FIRM was
completed (whichever is later) is charged an actuarially fair annual premium
equal to an estimate of expected annual claims under the property’s flood
insurance policy. Policyholders who pay actuarially fair premiums year after
year should, in the long run, end up paying premiums that are just sufficient
to cover their claims on average. About one-quarter of NFIP policies cover
properties built prior to 1974 or prior to the publication of a community’s
FIRM. By law, these “pre-FIRM” properties are charged subsidized
premiums. Pre-FIRM properties are much less likely to comply with modern
flood risk mitigation standards since most were built before such standards
were widely applied. Because of their higher risk, pre-FIRM properties are
assessed higher premiums on average than newer properties, but even these
114 | Economic Report of the President

higher premiums are not adequate to cover expected losses. On average,
premiums for pre-FIRM properties represent only about 40 percent of those
properties’ actuarially fair rates.
Not surprisingly, the NFIP pricing scheme has led to serious adverse
selection and moral hazard problems. On the one hand, FEMA estimates that
one-half to two-thirds of structures in floodplains do not carry flood insurance. On the other hand, some exceptionally high-risk properties continue to
receive NFIP coverage at subsidized rates even though they have been
damaged by floods multiple times since entering the program. Some 50,644
properties insured by the NFIP as of September 30, 2004 had incurred flood
damage resulting in claims of at least $1,000 more than once during a 10-year
period. While these properties only represented about 1 percent of all structures then insured under the program, repetitive-loss properties have
historically accounted for 38 percent of all program claims payments.
Amendments to the Flood Insurance Act passed in 2004 authorized a pilot
program to remove some of the most severe repetitive-loss properties from the
NFIP insurance roll by allowing FEMA to fund work to elevate or relocate
some of them or, in extreme cases, to purchase and demolish them.
The NFIP illustrates how underwriting standards can either enhance or
impede loss mitigation. By providing coverage only in communities that agree
to adopt flood-risk mitigation measures, the NFIP may have induced some
communities to take steps that FEMA credits with reducing flood damage by
an average $1.2 billion annually. At the same time, by providing insurance to
pre-FIRM properties at less than actuarially fair rates, the program may have
discouraged some policyholders from relocating or renovating structures at
high risk for flood damage. The availability of flood insurance has lowered the
risk to banks of financing real-estate investment in locations vulnerable to
flood losses. As a result, it is not clear whether the NFIP has reduced the size
of Federal appropriations for flood disaster relief as intended. Demand for
Federal disaster aid may arguably be higher than it would have been had the
NFIP not facilitated development in high-risk areas.
Chart 5-3 shows that since 1986 NFIP premiums exceeded annual losses in
most years, but were woefully inadequate to cover losses from Hurricanes
Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in 2005. The 2005 hurricanes resulted in about
$16.3 billion in NFIP program claims, some of which were not paid until
2006. Even so, claims paid in 2005 exceeded premiums collected in that year
by a factor of nearly six to one. Unlike private sector insurers, who would
need to accumulate surplus or purchase reinsurance to pay claims in excess of
premiums, the NFIP is permitted to borrow from the Federal Government.
As of August 2005, just before Hurricane Katrina struck, the NFIP had accumulated a relatively modest $300 million in debt owed to the U.S. Treasury,
but the program will need to borrow an additional $21.2 billion to pay claims

Chapter 5

| 115

filed in 2005. Though the NFIP is supposed to repay this debt using future
premium revenue, it is unlikely that this will be possible. The Congressional
Budget Office estimates that by 2007 the interest on NFIP debt will grow to
about $1 billion annually, which is about 40 percent of the projected annual
premium revenue. Even if future hurricane seasons are milder than those
experienced in recent years, projected premiums are not expected to be large
enough to cover both the interest on the outstanding debt and the projected
future claims. The NFIP’s current dire financial situation amply demonstrates
that in insurance, as elsewhere, there is no free lunch. Annual premium
revenue from the NFIP was able to cover losses in most of the program’s
recent history, but the subsidized insurance program exposed the American
taxpayers to a huge potential financial liability which became an actual
liability in 2005.

Terrorism and War-Risk Insurance Programs
The Federal Government provided billions of dollars in disaster assistance
following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and
Washington, DC, including about $4 billion in aid to the airline industry and
about $20 billion in aid to the New York City area. To date, about $36 billion

116 | Economic Report of the President

in loss claims have been paid by private insurers. Though insured losses
represented only a fraction of the total economic costs of the September 11
attacks, they were far greater than those arising from any prior terrorist event.
Following September 11, commercial property and casualty insurers reevaluated their policyholders’ exposure to risk from possible future attacks. Many
insurers canceled policies, began explicitly excluding coverage for terrorist
attacks from new policies, or increased premiums charged to policyholders. In
response to what was believed to be a temporary contraction in the supply of
insurance available for terrorism risk, the Administration and Congress
undertook measures to ensure that the airline and commercial real estate
sectors would not be adversely affected.
Less than two weeks after the September 11 attacks, the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) began selling insurance policies directly to U.S. airlines
to cover third-party liability (e.g., harm to individuals or property on the
ground) arising from acts of war or terrorism, and in November of 2002 the
Homeland Security Act expanded this program to provide insurance coverage
for loss of aircraft and airline passenger liability as well. The program has been
reauthorized several times since its inception and it remains in effect today.
As of October 1, 2006, policies under this program provided 75 airlines
with insurance coverage for potential losses ranging from $100 million to
$4 billion each.
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) passed in November of 2002
established a second, much broader, Federal program to encourage privatesector commercial property and casualty insurers to provide terrorism risk
coverage. The program was originally designed to expire after three years, but
in 2005 Congress elected to extend the program with some modifications
through 2007.
TRIA has two main components. First, it mandates that insurance companies
that sell commercial property and casualty insurance make available to
customers policies that do not explicitly exclude coverage for losses caused by
acts of terrorism. Insurers may exclude losses on other grounds, however, so
not all losses arising from terrorist attacks must be covered. According to the
President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, commercial insurance policies generally do not cover losses arising from chemical, nuclear, biological,
and radiological events, whether or not these events are caused by acts of
terrorism. Second, TRIA authorizes the Treasury Department to provide reinsurance to cover a portion of insurance loss claims arising from certified acts
of international terrorism against U.S. targets. Under the reinsurance
program, a primary insurer must cover 100 percent of its loss claims up to a
specified deductible. The Federal Government then pays a fixed share of losses
in excess of the deductible. For 2007 an insurance company is required to
cover all losses up to 20 percent of its prior year’s premiums on qualifying

Chapter 5

| 117

lines of business and 15 percent of losses above this deductible. TRIA imposes
a cap of $100 billion on total insurer losses from terrorist attacks. Under the
statute, Congress would determine the procedures to govern any payments for
losses beyond $100 billion in separate legislation.
Since 2001, no claims have been filed under either the FAA’s aviation
war-risk insurance program or the Treasury Department’s terrorism-risk
reinsurance program, but, like the NFIP, both of these programs expose U.S.
taxpayers to large potential losses. Because they were intended to be temporary,
neither program is designed to ensure that premiums will be sufficient to pay
future claims. Premium revenue collected under the aviation war-risk program
is subject to a cap mandated by Congress. As a result, premiums charged by
the FAA are significantly lower than those that would be charged for comparable policies sold by private-sector aviation insurers. Airlines pay a total of
about $160 million in premiums to the FAA each year; by one estimate,
without the program these airlines would need to pay $500 million annually
in premiums to private insurers. TRIA does not require property and casualty
insurers to pay any premiums for the reinsurance protection they receive.
Instead, claims under the program are expected to be paid with Federal outlays
and then recouped, after the fact, through surcharges levied on future
premiums for property and casualty insurance policies. Given that the program
was established in part to address problems arising from high insurance
premiums following the September 11, 2001 attacks, there are real questions
as to whether surcharges would be set high enough to recoup expenditures
following a future terrorist attack. Any surcharges would likely be spread over
several years to reduce the impact on premiums, and since the Treasury
Department is only required by law to recoup up to $27.5 billion, there is no
guarantee that the full costs of the program would ultimately be recovered.

State Property Insurance Markets
Although the Federal Government is actively involved in insuring risks
from floods and terrorist attacks, most homeowners and businesses look first
to their local property insurers to obtain financial protection against a variety
of hazards including potential catastrophes. State governments are responsible
for regulating insurance markets. Though laws differ from state to state, all
states’ insurance regulators exercise some control over who is permitted to sell
insurance, what terms and conditions can be attached to insurance policies,
and how much insurers can charge. Insurance regulations are intended to
protect consumers who may have difficulty evaluating complex insurance
contracts and to ensure that insurers maintain sufficient financial resources to
pay future claims. While regulation plays an important role in protecting
118 | Economic Report of the President

consumers from fraud and poor risk management practices, poorly conceived
and executed regulation can create long-term problems for the operation of
state catastrophe-risk insurance markets.
Every state regulates property insurance premiums charged to homeowners
and small businesses. Many states require that premiums be approved in
advance by regulators. Others allow insurance regulators to review existing
price schedules and empower regulators to force companies to reimburse policyholders when premiums are found to be excessive. Rate regulations can
make it difficult for insurance companies to set premiums that accurately
reflect available information about risks, which can exacerbate moral hazard
and adverse selection problems. In some states the rate review and approval
process can take many months, so insurers cannot rapidly adjust premiums
when new information becomes available. The rate review process may also
discourage insurance companies from proposing complex pricing plans
which, though difficult to explain and justify to state rate boards, more accurately reflect detailed information about the risks associated with individual
insurance policies.
Efforts by regulators to keep property insurance prices artificially low can
make it difficult for individuals and businesses to obtain insurance on private
markets at any price. To ensure that they will be able to pay claims after a catastrophe, private insurers need to set premiums high enough to enable them to
build surplus or transfer risk to reinsurers. If regulators do not allow insurers
to charge rates sufficient to accomplish these tasks, the insurers will be discouraged from taking on catastrophe risks. They may choose to sell insurance only
in areas at low risk for catastrophe hazards, or they may seek to exclude
coverage for such hazards under the terms of the property insurance policies
they offer. Regulation can also deter insurers from competing for customers,
thereby reducing the range and quality of insurance options available.
Many states that face risks from hurricanes or earthquakes have established
special entities to provide insurance to those who cannot obtain coverage
from private insurers. In 1996, California established a quasi-public company,
the California Earthquake Authority, to sell earthquake insurance policies to
California residents, backed by funds contributed by a number of private
insurers operating in the state. Several states maintain residual pools to cover
windstorm risks. These pools operate like traditional insurance companies,
but they are required to sell policies to property owners in high-risk coastal
areas and they are empowered to levy surcharges on primary insurers
operating in a state.
Some state-sponsored insurance programs use complicated procedures for
setting premiums, and many claim to charge premiums that are actuarially
fair, but they all have one thing in common: they provide insurance only to
policyholders who either will not, or cannot, obtain insurance from the

Box 5-2: Gulf Coast Property Insurance Markets After
Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma
2005 was a terrible year for communities located along the U.S. Gulf
Coast. Hurricane Katrina devastated a land area the size of Great Britain
and displaced more than 270,000 people. The total value of property
damage and business interruption caused by Hurricane Katrina has
been estimated at $135 billion. Hurricane Katrina was followed a few
weeks later by Hurricane Rita, which caused an estimated $15 billion in
damage, and Hurricane Wilma, which caused an estimated $20 billion
in damage. The President and Congress responded by appropriating
about $110 billion for disaster relief and recovery aid to affected
communities. Property insurers have also played an important role in
recovery efforts by paying billions of dollars of loss claims, but there
are concerns that rising insurance premiums for coastal properties may
be a barrier to redevelopment. The response of property insurance
markets to the unprecedented losses caused by the 2005 hurricane
season underscores the role of effective underwriting in managing
catastrophe risks.
Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma resulted in an estimated
$57 billion in insured property damages, not including claims filed with
the National Flood Insurance Program. Despite bearing enormous
losses, most private-sector primary insurers operating in the Gulf Coast
emerged from the 2005 hurricane season in reasonably sound financial
condition. At least four primary insurers failed as a result of the 2005
storms, but the share of property and casualty insurers listed as financially impaired by a major insurance company rating agency actually
dropped to a 25-year low while the aggregate value of surplus available
to insurers for paying future claims increased. Primary insurers fared
well as a group in part because they had transferred a significant share
of their catastrophe risk exposure to reinsurers. According to one
industry association, reinsurance covered about 60 percent of 2005
insured hurricane losses.
Though the U.S. property and casualty insurance sector as a whole
remains healthy, property insurance markets in several coastal states
are under stress. Information collected during the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons revealed deficiencies in industry-standard catastrophe
risk models used in underwriting property insurance. These models are
now being adapted to reflect expectations of more violent hurricane
seasons, revised analysis of the costs of repairing property damage
following major catastrophes, new findings about the effects of hurricane-generated storm surges, and other factors. As a result, primary
insurers and reinsurers are increasing their estimates of probable
losses on windstorm policies in areas at risk for hurricanes. A leading

120 | Economic Report of the President

catastrophe-risk modeling firm reports that revised forecasts of the
severity of Atlantic hurricane seasons alone will increase estimates of
loss rates from future hurricanes in the Gulf Coast and southeastern
U.S. by 50 percent.
As assessments of the potential costs of future hurricanes have
increased, primary insurers and reinsurers have sought to limit their
exposure to windstorm hazards and increase the premiums charged for
insuring this hazard. Reinsurance companies, many of whom lost
capital in 2005 to hurricane-related claims, have significantly increased
premiums. Unlike reinsurance premiums, premiums charged by
primary insurers for homeowners’ and commercial property policies
are regulated by state insurance commissions. Primary insurers have
petitioned state regulators to allow them to raise premiums to cover
rising reinsurance costs and to more closely reflect new information on
the risks posed by windstorms. Where possible, some insurers have
also attempted to reduce their exposure to windstorm hazards by
refusing to renew existing policies in high-risk areas or by adding
conditions to policies that exclude coverage of windstorm damage. In
several states, government-sponsored insurance programs that are
required to provide windstorm coverage to property owners who are
unable to obtain insurance through the private sector have grown
dramatically.
Recent developments in coastal property insurance markets have the
potential to discourage some investment in areas at high risk for hurricanes, since property owners in these areas will likely have to pay
higher insurance premiums or bear greater risk than in the past. For this
reason, some have argued that Federal and State governments should
take action to ensure that insurance for windstorm coverage in hurricane-prone regions is widely available and that the premiums charged
for this insurance are relatively low. However, as discussed in the text,
efforts to keep premiums for windstorm insurance artificially low may
discourage property owners from taking action to lessen future windstorm losses while potentially encouraging excessive development in
high-risk areas.

private market. These programs tend to attract exactly those members whose
high risk makes them unattractive to private insurers. For example, in some
states, residual pools are the main providers of windstorm insurance for
homeowners in coastal areas exposed to high risk from hurricanes.
In recent years a number of state-sponsored insurance programs have had
difficulty paying claims following major catastrophes. Different states have
dealt with this problem in different ways. A few states have used government
money to provide new funds for insolvent programs, thereby passing the cost
Chapter 5

| 121

of covering losses on to taxpayers. More commonly, states have levied
surcharges on premiums for policies sold by private insurers. This approach
effectively forces property owners in relatively low-risk areas who can obtain
insurance from private providers to pay higher premiums to cover insured
losses for property owners in higher risk areas who obtain insurance through
the residual pool. By effectively raising the cost of insurance in the private
market, these surcharges may actually encourage more property owners to
seek insurance from the residual pool so that the pool is exposed to even
higher losses the next time a catastrophe strikes.
Since people consider the cost of property insurance when deciding where
to live and conduct business, the use of rate regulations or state-sponsored
insurance programs to keep property insurance prices in high-risk areas
artificially low can have significant negative consequences. All else equal,
commercial and residential development will tend to be greater in those areas
where insurance prices are lower. As a result, artificially low premiums for
catastrophe risk insurance can lead to excessive development in catastropheprone areas, putting lives and property in harm’s way.

Conclusion
All insurance markets are susceptible to problems arising from adverse
selection and moral hazard, but insurers of catastrophe risks must also deal
with the fact that total insured losses are difficult to predict and are potentially quite large. While it may not be possible to eliminate these problems,
their effects can be moderated through prudent underwriting. Adverse selection and moral hazard problems can be lessened by being selective about
which risks to insure, by setting premiums to match observable differences in
risk, and by requiring policyholders to bear a share of the financial risk posed
by the hazards they are insured against. Insurance providers deal with uncertain losses by charging premiums that are high enough to enable them to
build surplus and/or transfer excess risk to third parties such as reinsurers.
Regulations that constrain private insurers’ underwriting flexibility can
undermine their ability to provide insurance coverage for catastrophe risks.
Government-sponsored insurance programs that can borrow from the U.S.
Treasury or levy surcharges to pay claims after a catastrophe has occurred do
not face the same financial constraints as private insurers. Nonetheless,
government programs that do not apply prudent underwriting standards
expose taxpayers to large liabilities.
Effective insurance underwriting serves an important social function by
tying the premiums and terms of insurance policies to the risks covered. When
insurance prices reflect underlying economic costs they can encourage a more
122 | Economic Report of the President

efficient allocation of resources. Efforts to keep premiums for insurance against
catastrophe hazards artificially low, whether through regulation or through
subsidized government programs, can encourage excessively risky behavior on
the part of those who might be affected by future catastrophes.

The Transportation Sector:
Energy and Infrastructure Use

E

nergy is a $1 trillion industry representing 8 percent of the U.S. economy.
The two biggest consumers of energy from fossil and renewable fuels are
electric power and transportation. While electricity can be generated from
diverse sources—coal, nuclear fission, natural gas, water, petroleum, and
increasingly, wind and sun—98 percent of transportation, whether by plane,
train, ship or automobile, is currently powered by petroleum. The transportation sector alone accounts for two-thirds of the petroleum consumed in the
United States. Thus, key to understanding the transportation sector is understanding the petroleum market, and the ways in which consumers and firms
in the transportation sector respond to changes in world oil prices.
The lack of substitutes for oil means that in the short run, oil consumption
in transportation is particularly unresponsive to price changes. This makes
the economy vulnerable to sudden increases in oil prices. Perhaps more
importantly, the world’s reliance on oil creates an external cost in terms of
national security.
In addition to petroleum, the transportation sector relies on infrastructure.
The United States has close to 4 million miles of roads, bridges, and highways
to support a wide variety of economic and social activity. Over time, however,
demands on this infrastructure have outstripped its capacity. While the miles
of urban roadways built have increased by nearly 60 percent since 1980,
vehicle miles traveled on urban roadways increased by double that amount.
The primary reason for this shortfall is that a well-functioning market that
puts a price on roadway use is largely nonexistent. As a result, traffic in most
metropolitan areas has become increasingly congested, costing both time and
fuel. In 2003 alone, Americans were delayed about 3.7 billion hours and used
2.3 billion extra gallons of fuel (47 hours and 29 gallons per rush-hour
commuter) in stop-and-go traffic. Like the costs exacted by oil use on national
security and the environment, the full costs of congestion are not taken into
account by individuals when they drive: each driver usually decides when and
where to drive based on his or her own private needs and ignores the costs
imposed on others.

125

This chapter discusses several developments in the use of energy and
infrastructure for transportation, and reviews strategies that have been used to
reduce oil use and better manage the existing infrastructure. Key points in this
chapter are:
• Recent increases in the price of oil and the external costs of oil have led
to renewed interest by markets and governments in the development of
new alternatives. Government can play a role in ensuring that external
costs are taken into account by markets, but ultimately markets are best
suited to decide how to respond.
• Cars and light trucks are the largest users of petroleum. As a result, the
fuel economy of the vehicles purchased and the number of miles that
they are driven have a large effect on oil consumption.
• Congestion is a growing problem in American urban areas. Cities and states
have shown a growing interest in and capacity for setting prices for road
use during peak periods to reduce the full economic costs of congestion.

Fuel Markets and the Transportation Sector
Over the past 15 years, petroleum use in the industrial, utility, and building
sectors has been relatively flat, while petroleum use by the transportation
sector has grown by 27 percent. This trend is expected to continue. While
new, more energy-efficient technology has reduced the energy needs of most
sectors, gains in vehicle engine efficiency have been more than offset by a shift
to heavier, more powerful cars and light trucks, and increases in driving.
Cars and light trucks accounted for 92 percent of U.S. roadway travel in
2006 and account for 62 percent of petroleum devoted to transport.
Department of Energy projections suggest that these modes of transportation
will continue to be important, and that light truck usage will show significant
growth in the years to come (see Chart 6-1). Heavy trucks consume almost
17 percent of the petroleum used for transport. Air, rail, marine, and off-road
vehicles currently account for the remaining 21 percent. Air travel is one of
the fastest growing modes of transportation. Energy consumption for air
travel is projected to increase nearly 46 percent by 2030, or about 620,000
more barrels of oil per day.

126 | Economic Report of the President

Responding to Changes in the Price of Oil
In well-functioning markets, the price of a good or service reflects all of the
associated costs and benefits—for example, the costs incurred in extracting,
transporting, and refining the oil, or the benefits from using gasoline to drive.
The market then uses price to achieve the most efficient level of production
and consumption. Transportation has largely reacted to changes in energy
markets in this way.
High demand for oil, due in part to rapid economic growth in China and
India, has helped push oil prices to record levels. The real average monthly
price of oil to the refiner was $26 between 1986 and 2004 (see Chart 6-2, in
2006 U.S. dollars). In 2004, the price to the refiner began to climb,
approaching $70 per barrel in 2006 (other oil price measures were higher).
For the transportation sector, this is a significant increase in the cost of one of
its primary inputs. Normally, as the price of a good rises, consumers reduce
how much they use. However, it typically takes years before the transportation sector’s consumption of oil is substantially reduced, in part due to the
lack of easily available substitutes. Eventually, though, consumers do react to
high prices. For instance, hybrid vehicle sales have tripled since 2004, while
light truck sales have fallen by 16 percent.
Chapter 6

| 127

When high oil prices are sustained, as has been the case recently, the market
shows renewed interest in investing in new technologies for developing alternatives to oil and improving vehicle fuel economy. Such research and
development investments tend to recede when oil prices fall. During the
period of high oil prices in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the private sector
invested billions of dollars in energy research and development before the
price of oil declined. A recent study finds that private investment in alternative fuel technologies again has increased in response to higher oil prices,
doubling between 2004 and 2006, constituting 10 percent of the total investment in energy. Because of the transportation sector’s delayed response to oil
prices, these increases are likely to continue for some time.
The lack of alternatives to oil also means that sudden major oil supply
changes—such as when oil production in an entire region is unexpectedly
shut down—can lead to large and sudden price increases in the months
following the shock. Since oil trades in a global market, the impact on the
economy from such shocks does not depend on how much we import, only
on how much we consume, and our consumption has been growing. The
market has adapted to this threat by investing in more energy-efficient modes
of production, investing in alternative energy sources, and increasing holdings
of private oil inventories.

128 | Economic Report of the President

External Costs of Oil Use
Prices determine which goods and services are produced in the marketplace. In the absence of government policy (such as taxes or regulations), the
price of a good or service accounts for all private costs incurred by those who
have produced or purchased the product. In the case of oil, this includes
everyone from the oil company that extracts the oil, to the shipper, refiner,
retailer, and driver who fuels her car. In the case of oil, the price reflects most
of the costs, but there are some costs to society that remain unaccounted for.
Eighty-one percent of the world’s remaining proven petroleum reserves are
currently controlled by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) (including Iran and Venezuela) and Russia, and nearly all
of these reserves are controlled by national oil firms. Since oil trades in a world
market, oil consumption anywhere in the world affects the price of oil for
Americans. The importance of oil to the world economy gives the major oilproducing countries disproportionate diplomatic leverage in world affairs. Oil
resources can also fuel corruption in developing countries. Air pollutants and
carbon dioxide from burning gasoline also contribute to concerns about air
quality, human health, and climate.
The purchase of a gallon of gasoline imposes these national security and
environmental costs on everyone, not just on the buyer and seller. Though
State and Federal gasoline and diesel fuel taxes and regulations help account
for these other costs, many studies suggest that the total external costs of oil
may be higher. Carefully crafted government policy may be a useful way to
account for these additional costs. However, this objective should be balanced
against additional inefficiencies that government involvement introduces into
the market. Once policies are in place that ensure that individuals account for
the full costs of the goods and services they consume—e.g., national security
and environmental concerns—competitive markets are the most efficient
means to determine how goods are produced, as well as which goods are
produced in the future.

Transportation Fuel Supply
Motor gasoline and diesel fuel will continue to be the main sources of
power for cars and trucks in the near future. In 2006, motor gasoline
accounted for 74 percent of fuel used in highway vehicles, and diesel
accounted for 24 percent (alternative fuels made up the remainder). Diesel
cars and light trucks are uncommon in the United States—only 2 percent of
new cars and light trucks sold use diesel engines; the majority of diesel fuel is
used by commercial vehicles.

Chapter 6

| 129

Ethanol, an alternative fuel, is currently used as an additive in gasoline to
increase octane and help gasoline burn more completely, reducing emissions
of carbon monoxide and other pollutants. In many states and metropolitan
areas, gasoline sold at the pump contains between 2 and 10 percent ethanol,
depending on State requirements. Using such alternatives to oil can reduce
the environmental costs of transportation as well as the national security
consequences of oil use. To further encourage alternative fuel use, a provision
in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005) known as the Renewable Fuel
Standard requires a certain quantity of renewable fuel to be used by gasoline
producers each year. In 2006, producers were obligated to use 4 billion
gallons per year; this obligation will gradually increase to 7.5 billion gallons
in 2012 (Americans consumed about 140 billion gallons of motor gasoline in
2006). One of the strengths of this policy is that it does not choose which
renewable fuel to promote, but allows the standard to be met with any renewable fuel that accomplishes the goal of reducing oil use. However, it does not
extend to oil alternatives beyond renewable fuels, such as electric cars or
hydrogen fuel cells. The Renewable Fuel Standard also allows imports to
satisfy the standard, allowing U.S. consumers to take advantage of cheaper
production of renewable fuels in other countries, although this is impeded by
an import tariff on such fuels.
A more significant regulatory change has been applied to diesel fuel.
Starting in 2006, diesel fuel sold in the United States is required to have
a sulfur content of no more than 15 parts per million (ppm), down from
500 ppm in the previous standard. This reduction results in the most stringent diesel fuel standard in the world and enables U.S. consumers to purchase
vehicles with engines that meet clean air requirements using clean diesel fuel.
Diesel engines are between 20 and 25 percent more fuel efficient than comparable gasoline engines (even accounting for the fact that a gallon of diesel
contains more energy than a gallon of gasoline). EPAct 2005 also grants tax
credits to buyers of diesel cars that meet stringent emission standards.

Alternative Fuels and Advanced Technologies
To date, changes in petroleum usage have been driven primarily by the
increasing price of oil and by regulatory concerns. The greatest potential for
large reductions in gasoline consumption stems from new technologies that
could transform how transportation is powered. Over 1 million advanced
technology cars and light trucks were sold in the United States in 2006. About

130 | Economic Report of the President

two-fifths of these were flex-fuel vehicles that can use conventional gasoline
or an alternative fuel called E85, which is approximately 85 percent ethanol
and 15 percent gasoline. U.S. consumers also purchased 256,000 hybrid vehicles in 2006. Hybrid vehicles use an electric motor in conjunction with a
gasoline engine to increase fuel economy.
Use of advanced technology vehicles in the United States is projected to grow
over time (see Chart 6-3). The Department of Energy projects that over 3
million advanced technology vehicles will be sold in 2015 and that by 2030
they will make up more than 25 percent of all light-duty vehicles sold. Of these
advanced technology vehicles, 71 percent are expected to be either
gasoline–electric hybrids or vehicles that can be powered by ethanol and other
plant-based fuels. Though alternative fuels currently power only a small fraction
of our transportation needs, private-sector investments combined with government policies are expected to fundamentally change the energy landscape.

Chapter 6

| 131

Ongoing research explores a wide variety of vehicle fuel technologies such
as electricity, hydrogen fuel cells, and biofuels. Significant technological
barriers exist that prevent the development of these as commercially viable
alternatives. For instance, the wide-scale deployment of hydrogen fuel cells—
devices that combine hydrogen with oxygen in the atmosphere to yield
electricity—will depend on reductions in expense and weight as well as on the
development of clean, cost-effective sources of hydrogen.
Private markets tend to underinvest in innovation of all kinds because
inventors only capture a fraction of the benefits from discovery.
Underinvestment is particularly likely for basic scientific research where
the application to the marketplace may not be evident at early stages.
Underinvestment is also likely when the results of research mainly reduce the
external costs of consumption (such as national security and environmental
costs associated with oil) instead of directly benefiting consumers. In
response, the President’s Advanced Energy Initiative proposed an increase in
annual funding for alternative energy research of 22 percent for fiscal year
2007, adding to the $10 billion of government spending devoted to such
research since 2001.
Several studies find that Federal research and development (R&D) investment in energy has yielded sizeable societal benefits, not only in economic
terms, but also in terms of knowledge creation and pollution reduction. Still,
the government’s ability to predict which technologies will best meet a given
goal is questionable, so the most effective government policies allow the
market to choose the path of innovation.

Demand for Transportation Fuel
The United States is a vehicle-dependent society. More than 9 out of 10
American households own at least one vehicle, and most households own two.
In 2004, vehicles in the United States traveled close to 3 trillion miles, up more
than 20 percent from 1995. Commuting and other business-related activities
account for about 35 percent of vehicle miles traveled (see Chart 6-4).
Americans also use their cars and trucks to go shopping (15 percent of miles
driven), attend to personal and family business such as medical appointments
and dropping children off at school (25 percent of miles driven), and for social
and recreational activities, including vacations (22 percent of miles driven).

132 | Economic Report of the President

In spite of widespread vehicle use, the proportion of the American
household budget spent on transport fuel is small (less than 4 percent). That
said, Chart 6-4 shows that a significant share of vehicle miles traveled are
related to nonwork activities, indicating that households may have some flexibility to quickly adjust when the costs of travel are high. In response to higher
prices, drivers make two adjustments: they drive less and they purchase more
fuel-efficient vehicles. Several studies have found that these two effects
combined imply that a 10 percent increase in the price of gasoline will result
in about a 4 percent decrease in gasoline consumption in the long run.
Compared to other commodities, households’ gasoline consumption may
take several years to respond to price changes.
State and local initiatives that encourage use of mass transit and carpooling
focus on encouraging people to drive less. In New York City, the most densely
populated of all cities in the United States, mass transit accounts for
45 percent of all commutes into the central city. New York, however, is

Chapter 6

| 133

unique. Many U.S. cities, such as Phoenix and Los Angeles, are spread out
over a large area, making it difficult to design mass transit corridors that
effectively meet the commuting needs of travelers. Public transportation also
has difficulty competing with the flexibility and convenience of car travel in
these types of cities. In the entire United States, 5 percent of commuters rely
on public transportation.
One way many urban areas try to encourage carpooling is through the
designation of high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. This method rewards
carpooling by allowing vehicles with two or more passengers to travel in lanes
not open to vehicles with only one person in them. In this way, HOV drivers
can reduce travel time when roads are congested. Unfortunately, HOV lanes
are often underutilized and the popularity of carpooling is not increasing. In
2000, 90 percent of American commuters drove to work each day, but of
these drivers only about 13 percent carpooled, down from almost 20 percent
in 1980. This trend makes it unlikely that initiatives focused on carpooling
will make large strides in reducing vehicle fuel use.

Improving Fuel Economy
Evidence shows that drivers switch to more fuel-efficient vehicles in
response to higher gasoline prices. One study finds that higher gasoline prices
accelerate the retirement of older, less fuel-efficient vehicles, and shift new
purchases toward more fuel-efficient vehicles. Government policies have also
been used to influence vehicle fuel economy. The Corporate Average Fuel
Economy (CAFE) standard, passed in 1975, mandates a minimum mile per
gallon (mpg) requirement for each manufacturer’s fleet of new cars and a
minimum requirement for each manufacturer’s fleet of new light trucks. If a
given vehicle is less fuel efficient than the requirement, the manufacturer
must offset it by producing a vehicle that is more fuel efficient, so that the
average fuel economy for all cars (or for all trucks) the manufacturer sells is
above the required miles per gallon level. One rationale used to justify
increasing the stringency of the CAFE standard is to further induce improvements in the fuel economy of vehicles sold to consumers, reducing the
demand for transport fuel and the external costs associated with oil use.
It is important to note that while improvements in fuel economy translate
into gasoline savings, it is not a one-to-one relationship. Higher CAFE standards encourage increased driving. Since higher fuel economy vehicles can go
the same distance using less gasoline, the cost of driving a mile is reduced. As
the per-mile cost of driving declines, the quantity of miles driven by individuals tends to increase. This “rebound effect” reduces potential fuel savings
from improvements in fuel economy by 10 to 30 percent. Recent estimates
suggest that as incomes grow, driving decisions will depend less on the cost of
driving, and therefore, the rebound effect is expected to shrink in the future.
134 | Economic Report of the President

In 1978, CAFE mandated 18 mpg for cars and 17.2 mpg for light trucks.
The CAFE standard became increasingly stringent until 1990, after which it
remained virtually unchanged. It only recently became more stringent for
light trucks. Currently, the CAFE standards are 27.5 mpg for cars and
22.2 mpg for light trucks (including SUVs). The Federal government has
increased the CAFE standard for light trucks through two separate regulations, raising it in increments each year beginning in 2005. By 2011, new
light trucks will meet a 24 mpg standard, reflecting a 16-percent increase.
Also by 2011, the largest SUVs—those weighing between 8,500 and 10,000
pounds—will be subject to the CAFE standard for the first time. The
Department of Transportation based the new standard for light trucks on
vehicle footprint, a measure of size, in line with a recommendation by a
National Academy of Sciences panel as a way to mitigate safety concerns. The
footprint-based CAFE standard for light trucks is also an improvement over
its previous configuration because it ensures that all manufacturers make fuel
economy improvements instead of only those producing a wide mix of vehicles. The Department of Transportation is seeking similar authority to
reexamine CAFE for new passenger cars (see Box 6-1).
The fuel economy of new vehicles rapidly increased over the first 8 years of
CAFE. In part, this was a market response to the dramatic increase in gasoline prices between 1973 and 1981. By the late 1980s, however, overall fuel
economy had stagnated. While the fuel economy of cars has continued to
slowly increase over time and has been above the CAFE standard since 1986,
consumers have bought an increasing number of SUVs and light trucks whose
fuel economy has remained close to the mandated level of the light truck standard. Half of all vehicles sold in 2005 were light trucks, including SUVs,
compared to 20 percent when CAFE was first put in place. This shift in
consumer preferences is a rational response to more than a decade of low real
gasoline prices, rising household incomes, and incentives created by CAFE
requirements. Manufacturers also responded to changing consumer preferences and CAFE requirements. For instance, while station wagons and
minivans have similar fuel economies, the former are counted as cars, and the
latter are counted as light trucks. In the late 1980s, many manufacturers took
advantage of the difference in the stringency of CAFE standards across cars
and light trucks to phase out the station wagon—a relatively fuel-inefficient
car—and replace it with the minivan—a relatively fuel-efficient light truck.
This shift improved the individual fuel economy of both the car and light
truck fleets but did little to change overall fuel economy. While the CAFE
standard has contributed to improved fuel economy since its inception,
understanding its precise impacts and its interaction with gasoline prices is a
matter of some debate. A recent National Academy of Sciences study also
finds that CAFE may have led manufacturers to produce smaller and lighter
cars, posing a risk to safety.

Box 6-1: The President’s New Energy Initiatives
The President has announced several energy initiatives designed to
increase the country’s energy security by reducing projected gasoline
consumption in the light-duty vehicle transportation sector by 20 percent
within a decade.
About three-fourths of this goal will be met by greatly increasing and
expanding the Renewable Fuel Standard. The new standard will
mandate that 15 percent of transportation fuels come from alternative
fuels. In 2006 about 3 percent of fuels used in light-duty vehicles were
not petroleum-based. Under the revised standard 35 billion gallons will
be alternative fuels in 2017. This initiative reflects the belief that technological change is the key ingredient to diversifying America’s energy
portfolio. Energy security will increase as the dominance of oil use in
the transportation sector diminishes.
The standard will continue to allow refiners, importers and blenders
to use renewable fuels to meet the standard but will expand to allow for
current or future viable alternatives to petroleum to compete.
Expanding the alternatives that meet the standard makes it easier for
blenders and refiners to comply and affords the market broad flexibility
to find the most cost-effective non-petroleum-based fuel options. In the
event that production of alternative fuels proves more costly than
expected, the President has built in two safety valves to protect
consumers. First, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, and the Secretaries of the Department of Energy and the
Department of Agriculture will have the authority to waive or modify
the standard if refiners and blenders have difficulty finding alternative
fuels for purchase. Second, an automatic mechanism will be in place to
prevent the price of gasoline from rising above a threshold due to this
policy. These two provisions ensure a degree of market stability as use
of alternative fuels expands in the marketplace.
The 20 percent goal will also be met through increasing the fuel
efficiency of automobiles. This will occur through reforming and
modernizing CAFE standards for cars and further increasing light truck
and SUV standards. These changes are predicted to reduce consumption of gasoline by an estimated 5 percent, based on the assumption
that increases in the standard of 4 percent each year starting in 2010 for
cars and 2012 for light trucks prove warranted. Three reforms are key to
the President’s proposal of increased stringency of CAFE. First, paralleling recent changes for light trucks, the law for cars should be
changed to allow the standard to be based on a vehicle attribute (such
as footprint) to address safety concerns. Second, CAFE for both cars
and light trucks should allow manufacturers the option of increased
flexibility in how they meet the standard, by allowing them to trade

136 | Economic Report of the President

credits. Any manufacturer that increases fuel economy by more than
what is mandated could generate credits that other manufacturers
could purchase to reduce their costs of meeting the standard. The
benefit of trading credits is that it allows the same overall goal of
improved fuel economy to be met at a lower cost. Third, the rate of
increase of the CAFE standard as well as how fuel economy improvements will be divided between cars and light trucks should be at the
discretion of the Secretary of Transportation, as is currently done for
light trucks. The Department of Transportation will employ the regulatory process to determine these increases based on sound science and
an assessment that balances the costs and benefits.
The President has also proposed a new $175 million initiative to give
State and local governments the opportunity to explore innovative
ways—such as roadway pricing and increased use of real-time traffic
information—to reduce traffic congestion and save fuel.
In addition to improving the nation’s energy security profile, these
initiatives will also produce significant benefits by reducing air toxics
associated with petroleum-based fuel. They will also help confront the
challenge of climate change by potentially stopping the projected
growth of carbon dioxide emissions from this sector.

Transportation Infrastructure and
Management of Existing Traffic Flow
In addition to its reliance on oil, the transportation sector also relies heavily
on the existing infrastructure of roads and highways. Under the Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, the Federal government plays
an important role as overseer of the National Highway System to ensure that
the highway system is “economically efficient and environmentally sound,
provides the foundation for the Nation to compete in the global economy,
and will move people and goods in an energy-efficient manner.” In recent
years, however, the road and highway infrastructure has not kept pace with
the number of miles driven in the United States. When more people use a
roadway than the capacity for which it is built, traffic slows. Commercial
trucking—the most common method of moving freight across the United
States—is increasingly reliant on urban interstate highways, many of which
are congested. Between 1982 and 2003 the share of roads in U.S. urban
areas that are congested rose from 34 percent to 59 percent. Changes in

Chapter 6

| 137

commuting patterns have also spread congestion to more roads. The traditional
suburb-to-city commute has diminished in importance: As of 2000, half of all
commuters drove to jobs in the suburbs, while only 20 percent drove to jobs
in central cities.
Congestion is defined as the marked slowing of traffic as a roadway reaches
capacity. Congestion in the United States manifests itself primarily as a bottleneck on a roadway (see Chart 6-5). A bottleneck is a hindrance to vehicle
movement because it involves delays at key intersections, backed-up traffic, or
narrow or obstructed sections of a roadway. Unexpected events such as accidents or other traffic incidents also cause congestion on crowded roadways.
Together, they are responsible for 65 percent of all congestion.

It is important to note that roadways are not congested at all hours of the
day. For instance, on one particular roadway in the Seattle area, a trip that
occurs prior to 6 a.m. or after 10 p.m. takes about 10 minutes (see Chart 6-6).
That same trip takes about 30 percent longer at 8 a.m. and almost twice as
long at 6 p.m. due to slowing traffic. This general trend appears in many U.S.
cities and suggests that it is the timing of vehicle miles traveled more than
their growth that is at the root of the congestion problem.
138 | Economic Report of the President

One underlying reason why congestion exists on U.S. roadways is the lack
of a private market to price roadway use. Most roads in the United States are
provided by the government, are open to all, and are free of charge.
Economists generally believe that a good may be better provided by the
government when it is difficult for private markets to charge for its use.
Because one motorist’s use of a congested road reduces the road’s value for
other drivers and drivers can be selectively prevented from entering the
roadway through the use of gates or technologies that monitor use, it is
increasingly appropriate to charge drivers for some roadway use in the same
way the private market charges for other goods and services.
A driver decides which road to use based on private needs: for instance, the
shortest distance or fastest route between destinations, or the closest, most
accessible highway. The fact that each driver decides on a route independently
of other drivers is not a problem when the number of drivers is well below the
roadway’s capacity. However, when drivers have free access to roads, crowding
occurs at times of high demand, decreasing vehicle speed and flow. Each additional driver slows down other drivers on the roadway, causing them to lose
time and to burn extra gasoline. However, drivers typically do not consider
the added costs they impose on others. This is a “get in line” or “queuing”
approach to allocating road space. When there is a shortage of something—

Chapter 6

| 139

for instance, space on a ski lift, or attendants at the Department of Motor
Vehicles—those willing to get in line and wait eventually receive what they
want. This approach to road-use management is inefficient because it allocates road space to those with the time to wait in traffic, not necessarily to
those who value its use most highly.
If a roadway is priced—that is, if drivers have to pay a fee to access a particular road—then congestion can be avoided by adjusting the price up or down
at different times of day to reflect changes in demand for its use. Road space
is allocated to drivers who most highly value a reliable and unimpaired
commute. This arrangement encourages drivers to consider the tradeoff
between the price of using the road and the additional time and inconvenience of using a nonpriced, alternate route, or driving at a noncongested time.
Drivers who place a high value on the predictability and reduced time of
commuting, for instance, a doctor who has been called to the hospital for an
emergency, have the option to pay for access to noncongested roads. Drivers
with more time flexibility, for instance a person doing his or her grocery shopping, can avoid the road and the fee. They can use alternative but more
congested roads, shift when they drive to nonpeak hours, or use mass transit
when it provides a cheaper alternative to driving. The average cost to each
driver falls because drivers have a choice in how they pay for roadway use, in
time or in money.

The Cost of Congestion
Over time, slowing traffic exacts heavy costs on drivers. On average,
congestion caused 47 hours of delay for U.S. commuters and commercial
truck drivers in 85 urban areas during peak hours in 2003. For America’s
13 largest cities, this number is much higher: 61 hours. Extra fuel is
consumed on congested roads because of the effect that waiting in stop-andgo traffic has on fuel economy. In 2003, sitting in traffic wasted about
2.3 billion gallons of fuel, or almost 1.4 percent of all fuel consumed by lightduty and commercial vehicles that year. Waiting in traffic can also increase the
cumulative amount of pollution emitted from a vehicle’s tailpipe, which
contributes to poor air quality and more greenhouse gas emissions.
Aggregating over the 85 most congested U.S. cities, the cost of time wasted
in traffic and extra fuel consumed by commuters and commercial truck
drivers due to congestion is estimated to have exceeded $63 billion in 2003
(see Table 6-1). In Los Angeles, the city with the worst congestion, the fuel
and time cost of waiting in traffic was calculated to be almost $1,600 per traveler in 2003. In Philadelphia, congestion is noticeably less than in Los
Angeles, but the estimated cost to travelers is still high: $641 per traveler per
year. In addition, businesses that rely on regular and on-time delivery of
supplies have begun to maintain larger inventories to safeguard against

unanticipated delays caused by congestion. A recent study conducted by the
Department of Transportation confirms that congestion has resulted in higher
transportation prices and less reliable pickup and delivery times for freight.

Building More Roads
Expanding road capacity may be an important component of any longterm strategy to accommodate traffic growth in urban areas. However, there
are a number of reasons why a construction-only strategy to alleviate congestion is likely not the best solution. First, increasing capacity can take years to
complete and is expensive—one study found that a lane costs between
$1 million and $8.5 million per mile to build. Second, new lanes are often
needed in densely populated areas, but these are often also the areas where it
is most difficult to find unoccupied space for expansion, making new lanes
politically controversial. Third, a body of evidence suggests that the addition
of a nonpriced lane to an already congested roadway may do little to alleviate
congestion. This happens for two reasons: new roads generate additional
traffic as drivers take trips to destinations that previously took too long to
reach. And since traffic flow improves initially, drivers who were previously
using alternative, often less congested routes now find the highway with the
added lane more attractive. Drivers continue to redistribute themselves across
the various routes until the costs of using the new route and the costs of using
the existing route are about equal. At this point, no driver can be made better
off by changing routes. Ultimately, the reason why building more roads is
insufficient is because it does not address the underlying problem: roads are
not priced and are therefore subject to overuse.
Chapter 6

Pricing Road Space
There is reason to believe that reductions in traffic congestion would be
relatively easy to attain. Small changes in the number of cars using a particular roadway at a given time can result in large improvements in the flow of
traffic. For instance, the addition of just a few school buses makes traffic flow
noticeably worse on the first day of school, while traffic flow is noticeably
better on some State holidays when only a small number of residents stay
home from work.
Congestion pricing dampens demand for roads during peak hours and
spreads usage over a longer time period. Differentiating the price of a good by
the time of day effectively allocates limited space during periods of higher
demand. This approach is used by many providers of goods and services:
movie theaters charge more in the evening than they do midday; ski runs
charge more during weekends than they do on weekdays; airlines raise prices
on tickets during peak seasons; taxi cabs charge more during rush hour; and
railroads often charge lower prices for offpeak traveling.
In addition to improved allocation of road space, charging a fee also
provides urban planners with useful information about when and where to
invest in the expansion of existing road capacity. Expansion should be focused
on roads where drivers demonstrate a willingness to pay that is higher than
the costs of construction. Revenues from roadway pricing may also prove a
viable alternative to taxes as a way to fund the building of new roads in urban
areas. As is the case in other markets, those who use the roadway would pay
for its maintenance and expansion.
In general, there are two ways to price road space to address congestion:
cordon pricing and roadway pricing. Cordon pricing charges a toll to vehicles
for access to a congested area regardless of which roads in the area are used. It
is typically in effect during the work week and varies by time of day. Cordon
pricing has been implemented in a number of cities including London,
Stockholm, and Singapore. While cordon pricing has been considered for
several cities in the United States, it has not yet been implemented here. It is
likely to be less effective in cities that are less dense, do not have adequate
public transportation systems, and have multiple areas of centralized
economic activity (such as Phoenix or Los Angeles).
Evidence suggests that cordon pricing fees have been effective in reducing
congestion where they have been tried. After the first year that cordon pricing
was imposed in London, for instance, congestion fell by 30 percent, average
vehicle speed increased by 20 percent, and bus travel became more reliable
(see Box 6-2). One important mechanism for reducing congestion appears to
be the ability to substitute some form of public transportation for driving.

142 | Economic Report of the President

Box 6-2: Cordon Pricing Experiences in London and Stockholm
In London, drivers pay an 8-pound fee for daily access to a portion of
downtown between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. on weekdays.
There are no toll booths around the perimeter of this area. Instead,
cameras record the license plates of vehicles and check them against a
list of prepaid vehicles. Drivers have a variety of choices in how they
pay: they can pay at designated service stations, through the Internet,
by text message or phone, or by mail. Weekly and monthly charges also
are available for regular commuters. If drivers have not prepaid, they
have until midnight of the next day to do so. Anyone who drives within
the zone without paying during this time period is fined 100 pounds
through an automated system.
Stockholm also recently implemented cordon pricing, but it differs from
the London system in two ways. First, it charges vehicles via a card
mounted on the windshield that is read electronically by roadside beacons
when cars drive past them. Second, Stockholm uses a variable pricing
system, which means that the fee is higher during rush hour periods.
A recent report on the London policy indicates that cordon pricing
has led to a 30 percent reduction in delay time for city commuters.
Initial reports from Stockholm’s 6-month test period indicate that there
were decreases in traffic of about 22 percent due to cordon pricing.
Large reductions in London and Stockholm traffic were due in part to
increased use of bus transit. In spite of early criticism from drivers and
businesses within the central city, cordon pricing has grown in popularity in London. In Stockholm, this has also been the case: a majority
of residents voted to retain cordon pricing after the test period ended.

Roadway pricing aims to limit congestion on certain routes by charging
variable fees (tolls) to access a particular lane or road, regardless of the final
destination. Ideally, road tolls should be responsive to the actual level of congestion at each moment. By increasing the fee during periods of high demand and
reducing it during periods of low demand, the variable tolls reduce congestion
by encouraging offpeak driving and the use of alternative routes.
Variable tolls are rare in the United States. Most of the over 5,000 miles of
toll roads in the United States have flat tolls designed to generate revenue,
rather than variable tolls to relieve congestion. Where they do occur, they are
typically limited to a single road or freeway. On the congested bridges and
tunnels connecting New York and New Jersey, tolls are discounted by

Chapter 6

| 143

20 percent ($1.00) during nonpeak hours. Results of a small survey indicate
that about 7 percent of drivers changed their behavior as a result of these variable tolls. The most common changes were to switch to mass transit, carpool,
or to increase offpeak driving.
Recently, the Department of Transportation helped fund a small pilot
project in Seattle to examine how drivers would respond if the entire road
system in the city were subject to a variable tolling system. Where and when
participants drove was automatically tracked and transmitted by a device
installed in their car. Participants received prepaid accounts between $600
and $3,000 to pay the tolls. At the end of the pilot, they were allowed to keep
whatever they did not spend. Tolls ranged from 5 to 50 cents per mile
and varied by road and time of day. Preliminary results show that nearly
80 percent of participants decreased the amount they drove or changed when
they drove. On average, participants took 5 percent fewer trips by automobile
and drove 2.5 percent fewer miles each weekday due to tolls. Participants took
10 percent fewer trips and drove 4 percent fewer miles during the morning
commute.
Currently, there are about six U.S. highways that use high-occupancy toll
(HOT) lanes, many of which incorporate variable pricing and were piloted
using Federal funds. HOT lanes are variations of the high-occupancy vehicle
(HOV) lanes discussed earlier in the chapter, but they have greater potential to
reduce congestion since they are less likely to be underutilized. Similar to
HOV lanes, they allow carpoolers to use the road for free or at a discount but
charge a toll to single occupancy drivers for access. The toll frequently varies
by time of day. Some tolls set variable prices based on historical highway use
and adjust rates monthly or quarterly. Other tolls use real-time information on
congestion conditions to adjust tolls dynamically over the course of the day. In
locations where HOV lanes are underutilized, conversion to HOT lanes is
suggested as a way to increase use and to provide more choice to drivers. For
instance, in San Diego, conversion of HOV lanes to HOT lanes on a portion
of Interstate 15 increased usage by 64 percent over a 3-year period. Several
studies confirm that there are substantial gains in societal welfare from
allowing solo drivers to pay for access to existing HOV lanes. Others caution,
however, that when only one HOV lane is converted to a variable toll and
other lanes are free of charge, any temporary decrease in congestion on the
remaining free lanes may be offset by the redistribution of traffic.
The use of real-time or historically based variable tolling on HOT lanes may
have a significant effect on traffic flow. For instance, San Diego’s variable toll
uses real-time pricing, which changes every 6 minutes to reflect the amount of
traffic on the road. Computerized electronic signs make information on the
toll amount and the speed and flow of traffic available to drivers before they
have to decide between the free and priced lanes. Results show that travel times
144 | Economic Report of the President

vary little on San Diego’s variable toll lanes because free-flow conditions are
almost always maintained. In Orange County, the tolls vary by hour and day
of the week, but are based on historical information. While they are adjusted
several times each year, the toll does not convey actual conditions to drivers,
only average conditions. Thus, unexpected events such as accidents can cause
major delays on the variable toll lanes and because drivers do not have up-todate information on road conditions, travel time is less predictable.
Despite their potential benefits, toll lanes are sometimes portrayed as
“Lexus Lanes.” The contention is that tolled roadways supply faster routes
only to high-income drivers who can afford to pay the tolls, while lower
income drivers continue to be stuck in traffic. One study finds that drivers
with higher incomes tend to use HOT lanes more often than lower income
drivers, but that lower income drivers rely on toll lanes when on-time arrival
at their destination is important. For instance, you can imagine a case where
a parent is running late, but needs to be at the daycare to pick up his or her
child by a certain time. If the parent is late, and the daycare fines him or her
$10, then paying a $4 toll to arrive on time saves $6. A recent survey also
finds that support for or opposition to HOT lanes is unrelated to income.
Another study finds that lower income, bus commuters were some of the
largest beneficiaries of cordon pricing in London. Bus riders are exempt from
paying the cordon fee, but their commute times greatly improved. Not
surprisingly, the number of bus passengers during morning hours increased.
Experts note that implementation of congestion pricing faces less resistance
where motorists are unaccustomed to free and unrestricted roadway access.
For instance, it may be more feasible to implement congestion pricing on a
new road than on an existing road. Likewise, it may be easier to convert HOV
lanes to HOT lanes. The advent of new technologies that electronically
charge the toll by sensing a microchip placed on the windshield of the vehicle
eliminates the need for a driver to stop and physically pay the toll. These are
increasingly used to charge drivers tolls on existing roadways, making congestion pricing systems easier and less costly to implement.
Historically, one of the largest hurdles to variable price tolling on roadways
in the United States has been the Federal-aid highway program, which has
prohibited states from collecting tolls on interstates or other roads that receive
Federal funding. Federally funded pilot projects that explored variable price
tolling brought the advantages of congestion pricing to the attention of policymakers. Policymakers also began to explore the use of pricing mechanisms
to reduce congestion in other contexts, such as for allocation of runway access
at airports (see Box 6-3). A transportation bill signed into law in 2005 (The
Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for
Users) provides states with increased flexibility to use tolling to manage
congestion and finance infrastructure improvements, and provides ways to

Chapter 6

| 145

participate in pilot demonstrations of variable tolling. States such as Texas and
Colorado have passed laws allowing the formation of toll authorities at local
levels that can then construct and operate toll roads. States such as
Washington, California, Florida, and Minnesota have identified candidate
freeways for variable tolling.

Box 6-3: Airport Pricing to Decrease Congestion
Though traffic jams are easily observable manifestations of congestion, flight delays and runway bottlenecks also waste time and fuel.
Landing fees at most U.S. airports are directly related to the weight of
the plane, even though lighter and heavier planes tend to consume
approximately the same runway time. This contributes to airport
congestion because it encourages smaller, lighter planes (which can
use smaller satellite airports) to overuse the airport, displacing larger,
heavier passenger planes and reducing the number of passengers that
an airport can serve at a time.
A short-lived experiment at Boston’s Logan airport in 1988 demonstrates how a change in the landing fee structure can effectively reduce
airport congestion. Boston changed its runway use fee from one based
only on aircraft weight to one that combined a non-weight-based fee
and a smaller weight-based component. The fee for a small singleengine plane increased from $25 to about $100, while the fee for a large
jumbo 747 jet decreased from $800 to less than $500. By flattening the
landing fee, Logan made it relatively more costly to land small planes,
decreasing their volume. This allowed it to more easily accommodate
the larger planes that carry more passengers. The result was that Logan
airport reduced delayed landings from 30 percent to 14 percent in less
than 4 months. Despite a reduction in congestion, the new landing
fee structure abruptly ended when the program was deemed to be in
violation of the Federal Aviation Act.
The auctioning of runway access for planes may prove to be an even
more effective way to reduce congestion at airports. An auction would
award landing rights to the carrier that values the slot the most. Such
auctions have been successful in other contexts such as to allocate radio
waves while still accommodating smaller local and public radio stations.

Conclusion
The transportation industry relies overwhelmingly on petroleum for fuel.
In spite of its reliance, the market largely functions as it should; while transportation is particularly unresponsive to changes in oil prices in the short run
due to the lack of readily available substitutes, it does eventually respond.
Also, the price reflects the costs to the firm of producing the oil and the benefits to drivers from consuming the oil. That said, the use of oil by the
transportation and other sectors generates costs to national security and the
environment that users typically do not take into account. Likewise, the full
costs of congestion are not taken into account by individual users when they
drive, since roadway use is not priced by the market. Carefully crafted policies could help address these costs but care should be taken as government
action itself imposes inefficiencies.

Currency Markets and Exchange Rates

I

n the modern economy, firms buy and sell products from more than just
local or national markets. Often a firm’s supplier is located in a different
country. To make purchases and sell their own goods internationally, firms
need to change units of one currency for units of another currency. For
instance, when a British firm trades with a U.S. firm, the U.S. firm may pay
in U.S. dollars. However, the British firm needs to pay many of its costs in
British pounds. When the U.S. firm pays the British firm, then, one of two
things has to occur: the U.S. firm must convert its dollars to pounds and then
pay the British firm in pounds, or the British firm must accept dollars from
the U.S. firm and then convert the dollars into pounds to pay its workers.
And, to be sure that the sum in pounds is equivalent to the sum in dollars, all
parties to the transaction must know the value of dollars in terms of pounds.
Now multiply this single transaction by the number of countries and firms
involved in all aspects of the production of all internationally traded goods
and services and one can see that multiple currencies make international trade
far more complex and difficult than domestic trade.
The desire to transact internationally provides the impetus for a huge,
well-functioning market that facilitates such currency conversions and allows
global economic integration and trade to take place smoothly and quickly at
low cost. Both by volume of trade and ease of making transactions, currency
markets today are the world’s deepest, most liquid markets in the world.
Currency markets range from simple markets where parties simply exchange
one currency for another, to sophisticated markets where parties buy and sell
currency far into the future.
In 2005 the United States imported and exported over $3 trillion worth of
goods and services. In addition, gross sales and purchases of long-term U.S.
securities, such as corporate and Treasury bonds, to residents of foreign countries amounted to around $41 trillion. Most of these transactions either
directly or indirectly required a foreign-exchange transaction. A foreignexchange transaction is a trade of any two currencies. For example, a purchase
of Japanese yen with U.S. dollars is a foreign-exchange transaction.
As cross-border transactions have become larger and more frequent,
foreign-exchange markets have become increasingly important to the global
economy and have grown in relative size: whereas U.S. cross-border trade in
goods and services and long-term securities are measured in trillions of dollars
per month or year, turnover in foreign-exchange markets is measured in trillions of dollars per day. Daily average turnover in global foreign-exchange
149

markets averaged $1.9 trillion in April 2004. (Note: Unless otherwise noted,
all foreign-exchange transactions data in this chapter are from April 2004, the
latest date for which global turnover data are available.)
Foreign-exchange transactions vary in size and complexity. A foreignexchange transaction is simply a trade of one country’s currency for that of
another, whether the amount traded is a few dollars or a few billion dollars;
whether the entity making the exchange is a tourist changing money at the
border for a short holiday or a foreign company building a new factory
needing to exchange millions in domestic currency to pay for materials and
labor; or whether the form of money being acquired is foreign currency notes,
foreign currency bank deposits, or assets such as stocks or bonds denominated
in foreign currency. Key points of this chapter are:
• Foreign-exchange markets not only allow firms to trade goods and services
across borders but also allow firms to manage the risks they face from
fluctuations in the price of their domestic currency.
• As with any other good, the exchange value of a currency is determined by
its supply, as well as the demand for the country’s assets, goods, and services.
• Over much of the 20th century, countries tended to favor fixed exchange
rates. In recent decades, there has been a shift away from fixed regimes
toward freely floating exchange rates.
• Monetary and exchange-rate policies are tightly linked. A nation’s
government must decide between controlling its exchange rate and
controlling its domestic inflation rate.

Currency Markets Are Large
On an average day in April 2004, an amount equivalent to $1.9 trillion was
traded in the foreign-exchange market. These trades occurred between
different agents (individuals, firms, banks, governments) and for different
reasons, varying from tourist demand for currency to firms needing payment
for goods in local currency. To put this number in perspective, on average in
2004, every 7 trading days a sum greater than the entire value of the U.S.
annual GDP changed hands in the foreign-exchange market. Not surprisingly, turnover in the foreign-exchange market is larger than turnover in most
other financial markets. For example, the dollar value of average daily trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, the largest exchange in the world, was
around $46 billion in 2004, roughly 2 percent of the turnover in all world
foreign-exchange markets.
When currencies are traded in the foreign-exchange market, participants
need to know the value of their currency relative to other currencies, just as
participants in a traditional stock market need to know the value of the stocks
they wish to buy or sell. In foreign-exchange markets, this price is known as
150 | Economic Report of the President

the exchange rate, the number of units of one nation’s currency that must be
traded to acquire one unit of another nation’s currency. For example, on
October 11, 2006, a person wanting to acquire one British pound would have
had to pay $1.86 in U.S. dollars. By November 30, 2006, a person wanting
to make the same trade would have had to pay almost $1.97 for one British
pound. In this case, the dollar is said to have depreciated. After the depreciation, more dollars are required to buy the same number of pounds. If the
transactions are viewed from the perspective of the pound, the pound is said
to have appreciated; fewer pounds are required to purchase each dollar.
In principle, an exchange rate exists between each possible pairing of the
individual currencies in the world. Among the 52 nations (out of a world total
of 193 nations) that reported formal exchange-market transactions in 2004,
there are 820 possible bilateral exchange rates. If the 12 European nations that
share the euro as their national currency had separate currencies, this number
would be even higher.
In reality, a substantial portion of foreign-exchange trading occurs through
an intermediate or a vehicle currency, that is, a currency that is widely used
throughout the world. For example, the U.S. dollar serves as a global vehicle
currency and the euro is becoming an important vehicle currency in Europe.
A Turkish bank that wishes to exchange Turkish lira for Swedish krona may
first exchange lira for euros and then exchange the euros for krona. Vehicle
currencies reduce transaction costs in foreign-exchange markets because a
bank wishing to provide foreign exchange for its customers need not keep
stores of large numbers of currencies on hand. Instead, it need only maintain
stores of its own domestic currency and one or two other vehicle currencies.
The U.S. dollar is the most important vehicle currency in the world. The
dollar has served as an important vehicle currency in part because it has
remained remarkably stable over time. This stability is in part a result of the
United States’ long history of flexible exchange markets and its commitment
to improving capital market and trade access to the United States. As of 2004,
the U.S. dollar was used in almost 89 percent of world currency transactions;
its average turnover was over $1.5 trillion per day, more than twice as much
as the next most-used currency, the euro. Most of this trading occurs outside
of the United States.
Just as a few vehicle currencies dominate the transactions, two trading
locations dominate foreign-exchange market transactions. In 2004, over half
of the world exchange-market transactions occurred either in London
(31.3 percent) or New York (19.2 percent). The next-largest location in terms
of trading share was Japan, with 8.3 percent of transactions. Foreign-exchange
market transactions are also concentrated among a few large banks. In the
United States, 75 percent of transactions were conducted by only 11 banks in
2004. In the United Kingdom, 16 banks captured 75 percent of foreignexchange market transactions.
Chapter 7

| 151

Innovations in technology, such as computers and international
communications networks, and breakthroughs in economic theory that have
improved our understanding of the value of currencies, have made foreignexchange markets among the most sophisticated markets in the world.
Investors can easily take advantage of small differences in exchange values
across the different global markets, buying a currency for a lower amount in
one location and selling it for a higher amount in another, making the global
currency market one global exchange.
The sophistication of modern currency markets also helps multinational
firms protect themselves, or hedge, against currency risk. Because costs and
revenues of multinational firms are often denominated in different currencies,
currency risk is a fundamental part of international trade, and changes in the
exchange rate affect the cash flow of the firm. For example, a Mexican manufacturer may enter into a contract with a U.S. firm, agreeing to sell its product
at a fixed dollar price for a set period of time, for example, 1 year. The
Mexican manufacturer must pay its employees in Mexican pesos but will
receive a fixed dollar stream of revenue. If the peso appreciates over the year
(that is, if the peso becomes more valuable so that it takes fewer pesos to buy
one U.S. dollar), the manufacturer’s dollar-denominated revenue will fall in
value relative to his peso-denominated costs. If the peso appreciates sufficiently, the manufacturer may not be able to cover his costs. To see this
dilemma more clearly, suppose that when the Mexican firm enters into the
contract with its U.S. counterpart, the exchange rate is 10 pesos per dollar. If
the firm has costs of 1,000 pesos, and it receives $110, then the firm is able
to cover its costs and has 100 pesos of profit after the transaction. However,
if the peso appreciates over the year from 10 pesos per dollar to 8 pesos per
dollar, after the firm receives payment of $110, it will only hold 880 pesos.
The firm would not be able to cover the costs from the revenue it receives. If
the firm has no way to hedge this risk, its owner may be unable or unwilling
to enter into the contract and thus the opportunity for Mexico and the
United States to realize gains from this trade may not be realized. Advances in
economic theory that have helped companies learn how to price risk appropriately have enabled financial markets to develop contracts that allow firms
to sell their currency risk. Boxes 7-1 and 7-2 provide more detail.

Box 7-1: Types of Currency Market Transactions
A spot transaction is an immediate exchange of one currency for
another. A tourist exchanging currency upon arrival at an airport is an
example of a person making a spot transaction. Spot transactions
between professional currency traders specify a clearing date that

152 | Economic Report of the President

requires the actual exchange of currency within 2 business days; the
2 days gives each side of the transaction ample time to move funds. As
a share of total foreign-exchange market turnover, spot transactions
have declined from 54 percent in 1989 to 33 percent in 2004. The share
of spot market transactions has not shrunk because the spot market is
smaller—the volume of spot transactions almost doubled between 1989
and 2004—but because the growth rate of other types of foreignexchange transactions has grown at a much faster rate. For example,
over the same time period, transactions with clearing dates in the future
have increased almost eightfold.
A forward transaction is similar to a spot transaction except that the
clearing date (also called the settlement date) is in the future. The price at
which the parties agree to exchange currency on the settlement date is
known as the forward exchange rate and it almost always differs from the
spot rate at the time the contract is entered into. In a forward transaction,
no currency changes hands until the settlement date. The primary purpose
of a forward transaction is to allow multinational firms to hedge their
currency market risk. A foreign-exchange futures transaction is virtually
identical to a forward transaction. The main differences between a forward
and a future transaction lie in the institutional details of the transaction.
For example, futures contracts tend to be much more standardized than
forward contracts and are sold on organized, centralized exchanges.
Foreign-exchange swaps combine a spot and a forward transaction
into one transaction. Foreign-exchange swaps are typically used by
banks and other dealers when they wish to temporarily reallocate their
portfolio into or out of a currency without incurring any exchange-rate
risk. In the swap, one currency is swapped for another for a prespecified
period of time. In about two-thirds of foreign currency swaps, the swap
period is less than 1 week. In 2004, foreign-exchange swaps accounted
for about 50 percent of the foreign-exchange market turnover. A foreignexchange swap is particularly useful for a firm that has payments and
expenses payable in the same currency but payable at different dates.
For example, a U.S. firm may receive a euro-denominated payment
from its German affiliate. The firm plans to use the payment to purchase
euro-denominated goods in 1-month’s time. However, over the month,
the firm would like to invest the money in the United States. This firm
could use a foreign-exchange swap in which it trades the euros for
dollars today and trades the dollars for euros at the end of the month.
A foreign-exchange or currency option gives the buyer the right, but
not the obligation, to purchase a prespecified amount of currency at a
prespecified price. Depending on the type of option, the contract can
either specify a date on which the option may be exercised (European
option) or may specify an expiration date, where the buyer may exercise
the option anytime prior to the expiration date (American option).

Box 7-2: Hedging Against Foreign-Exchange Rate Fluctuations
In 2005 Volkswagen, a German automobile company, announced to
the world that it was going to increase its hedging of foreign-exchange
risk. Volkswagen was exposed to foreign-exchange risk because the
majority of its operating costs, in particular a portion of its labor costs
were denominated in euros, while a substantial share of its revenues
were denominated in U.S. dollars. In other words, Volkswagen paid its
workers in euros and received U.S. dollars for the cars it sold in the
United States.
Between 2002 and 2004, the euro appreciated considerably relative to
the dollar. That is, more dollars were required in order to purchase each
euro. Since Volkswagen was unable or unwilling to change the price of
cars sold in the United States enough to offset this swing in the
exchange rate, the company’s dollar revenues from sales in the United
States lost substantial value in terms of euros. With costs holding steady
and revenues falling, Volkswagen’s profits on U.S. operations were
reduced by an unfavorable change in the euro/dollar exchange rate.
To avoid similar losses in the future, the company chose to combat
the appreciating euro by increasing its hedging of foreign-exchange
risk. Between 2004 and 2005, Volkswagen more than doubled its use of
a variety of currency market contracts. In essence, this hedging strategy
involved buying forward contracts for euros at a predetermined rate so
that if the euro were to appreciate relative to the dollar and cause an
unexpected reduction in dollar revenue, the company would receive an
offsetting profit from its forward contract. If the euro were to depreciate
and cause an unexpected increase in dollar revenue, the company
would incur an offsetting loss from its foreign currency position. In this
way, Volkswagen was able to shield its revenue flow from foreignexchange volatility for the duration of its futures contracts.
Volkswagen’s strategy highlights the benefits of hedging against the
currency risk posed by short-term fluctuations in exchange rates. When
faced with a permanent shift in the exchange rate, however, companies
operating in multiple currencies are forced to either change their prices,
which are in one currency, or change their costs, which are in another.
Volkswagen has therefore shifted some of its euro costs into dollar
costs by expanding production facilities in the United States. This
strategy, known as natural hedging, permanently eliminates the
currency mismatch between revenues and costs.

What Determines Currency Values?
The exchange rate is a market price, and like other market prices it is
determined by the interaction of buyers and sellers in the market. In the
foreign-exchange market, the demand for a country’s currency arises from two
sources: demand for a country’s assets and demand for a country’s goods and
services. When analyzing foreign-exchange markets, the supply of a country’s
currency is usually taken as given and fixed at an amount determined by the
country’s central bank. The role of the central bank and the supply of money
will be revisited when exchange-rate policies are examined later in this chapter.
The concept of parity is central to any analysis of how exchange rates are
determined in the foreign-exchange market. Two types of parity are particularly important: interest rate parity and purchasing power parity (PPP).
Exchange rates and prices that move too far from either concept of parity will
tend to move back toward the level implied by interest rate parity and
purchasing power parity as economic agents try to exploit pricing differences
across countries. In this way, the prices for currencies in the foreign-exchange
market adjust. Just as prices across markets within a country tend to move
toward each other as buyers tend to go to the lower priced market and sellers
tend to go to the higher priced market until prices are equalized. The absolute
volume and speed of asset trading tends to make interest rate parity a shortterm condition while purchasing power parity tends to hold over a somewhat
longer time horizon.

Interest Rate Parity
For the United States, the volume of international trade in assets is many
times larger than the volume of international trade in goods and services. As
a result, day-to-day fluctuations in the exchange rate tend to be driven much
more by the value and desirability of a nation’s assets than by the value and
the desirability of goods and services the nation is selling. That is, demand for
assets tends to determine the value of a nation’s currency in the very short run
because asset trade drives such a large part of the day-to-day transactions in
the foreign-exchange market.
Goods and services are purchased for use today while assets are bought in
order to purchase goods in the future. A financial asset is at its most basic a
contract that offers a payment at some future date. For some assets, the
contract is explicit: U.S. Treasury notes contain a promise to pay the face
value of the bond at a certain date in the future as well as a fixed sequence of
interest payments over the life of the note. For other assets, the contract is
implicit: buying a stock in a company gives the holder the right to sell the
stock at a future date but not at any explicit price. Because assets involve a
future payment, the return on an asset—the return is the future payment
Chapter 7

| 155

divided by the purchase price—is typically uncertain. Assets differ in the
amount of risk they offer. For example, a Treasury bond is considered to be
less risky than a stock. For any given level of risk, assets with higher future
payments are more desirable and tend to have higher prices.
Further, because the payment of an asset may vary depending on the
conditions at the time the payment is due—the stock may have a high price
or a low price when the holder sells the stock—information about the likely
amount of the future payment also affects how much of the asset people want
to hold today. For example, when a firm announces an increase in future dividend payments, the price of the firm’s stock often increases. This increase
in price reflects an increase in the desire to hold the stock. Every time new
information is released, investors reevaluate their holdings of assets.
The foreign-exchange market plays an important role in determining the
value and return to foreign currency assets. When buying assets that are
denominated in a foreign currency, investors must take into consideration
both the future payment in terms of the foreign currency and any change in
the relative values of the two currencies, the exchange rate. For example, in
August 2006 the interest rate paid on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds was
4.9 percent and the interest rate paid on 9- to 10- year German Treasury
bonds was 3.9 percent, a difference of 1 percentage point (see Chart 7-1).
Does this difference imply that investors should have preferred U.S. Treasury
bonds to German Treasury bonds?

156 | Economic Report of the President

Not necessarily. The expected return for a U.S. resident who purchases a
German bond includes both the interest paid on the bond, in euros, and the
expected change in the exchange rate over the period during which the bond
is held. In other words, the return on a German bond, from a U.S. investor’s
perspective, includes both the explicitly defined interest rate and the value of
this return once converted back to U.S. dollars, an effect that can increase or
decrease the return to the bond.
An example will clarify the concept. A German investor wishes to
calculate the expected return on investing €100 in a savings deposit at a bank
in the United States for 1 year. She needs three pieces of information to
calculate the expected return: the current exchange rate between the dollar
and the euro, the interest rate paid on the savings deposit, and the exchange
rate that will prevail 1 year in the future. The investor knows the first two
variables (today’s exchange rate and the interest rate) with certainty. The one
element of the calculation that is not readily available is the future exchange
rate. For this example, let’s first assume the investor knows all three variables:
today’s exchange rate is $1 per euro, the interest rate to be paid on the savings
deposit is 5 percent, and the future exchange rate is $0.99 per euro (the euro
depreciates relative to the dollar). The calculation of the investor’s return is
straightforward: after exchanging her €100 for dollars, she has $100 in hand
and deposits it in the U.S. bank account. At the end of one year, she withdraws $105 from the bank account and takes it to the foreign-exchange
market to trade the $105 dollars for ($105 / .99 =) €106.06. The effective
return on the savings deposit was 6.06 percent: the $5.00 in interest earned
by the $100 at 5 percent plus the €1.06 gained because the euro depreciated
by 1 percent.
In the example, the future exchange rate was taken to be 0.99, a 1-percent
depreciation of the euro relative to the dollar. Holding the U.S. interest rate
fixed, changes in the future exchange rate have large implications for the rate
of return. For example, if the euro had appreciated by 1 percent, the return
would have been just under 4 percent: the $5.00 in interest earned by the
$100 at 5 percent minus the €1.04 lost because the euro appreciated by
1 percent. Had the future exchange rate been the same as the initial exchange
rate, the return would have been the 5 percent paid on the deposit. Investors
must take into consideration future changes in the exchange rate in order to
decide which asset has a higher expected return.
Now, what happens if investors all decide that the expected return—the
return considering both the exchange rate and the interest rate—is higher on
German bonds than on U.S. bonds? In this case, U.S. investors will sell U.S.
dollars and purchase euros and then use the euros to purchase German bonds.
The investors will keep doing this until they no longer perceive German
bonds as having a higher return than U.S. bonds. That is, investors keep
buying German bonds until prices adjust. In this example, there are three
Chapter 7

| 157

prices: the two interest rates and the exchange rate. Here, the euro would
appreciate because the demand for euros is rising; the yields on German
bonds would fall; and the yields on U.S. bonds would tend to rise.
Interest rate parity is one of the key equilibrium relationships in
international economics: The foreign-exchange market is in equilibrium
when deposits of all currencies offer the same expected risk-adjusted rate of
return. Interest parity is expected to hold except when countries prevent the
free flow of assets. If, in the example above, German and U.S. residents could
only buy their own domestic bonds, interest parity would not necessarily
hold. The return on the bonds would be determined independently in each
country. This issue is revisited in Box 7-4 later in the chapter.

Purchasing Power Parity
The last section focused on the influence the return on a country’s assets
tends to have on the country’s exchange rates. Purchasing power parity is a
second equilibrium concept that also helps determine exchange rate. PPP
also relies on the concept that prices (and returns) must be consistent
internationally. At a weekend farmer’s market, the price of corn cannot vary
too much between any two vendors. If there is a large difference in price for
the same corn, most of the corn sales will be at the cheaper booth. In other
words, people at the market, perceiving the corn to be the same quality, will
tend to buy from the cheaper vendor until either that vendor’s supply is
exhausted or the prices at the two booths adjust so that they are closer
together. Purchasing power parity is an extension of this simple concept on
a global scale. That is, prices of goods sold in any two countries should
exhibit about the same price once those prices are converted to a common
currency. If goods are sold for different prices in different countries, then
either the prices of those goods or the exchange rate would be expected to
change until the exchange-adjusted prices in the two countries were similar.
An example may clarify how this process works. Imagine a farmer’s market
with three booths. One booth sells corn in U.S. dollars, the second booth sells
identical corn in euros, and a third booth (the foreign-exchange market) sells
and buys euros at a posted price. A buyer arrives at the market with a single
U.S. dollar in his pocket and wishes to buy corn. The prices are as follows:
1 bushel of corn from the U.S. dollar booth sells for $1, the same bushel of
corn sells for 1 at the euro booth, and at the foreign-exchange booth $1 can
buy 1.1. Therefore, the buyer finds that euro-corn is cheaper; he exchanges
his U.S. dollar for 1.1 and is able to buy 1.1 bushels of corn instead of the
1 bushel he could buy at the dollar market. If nothing changes, all buyers who
show up to the market will prefer euro corn. In response to this preference,
two things are likely to occur. The price of corn at the dollar booth will
begin to fall as the dollar booth sees less demand for its corn, and the
158 | Economic Report of the President

foreign-exchange booth will raise the price of euros relative to dollars as it
perceives an increased demand for euros.
The above example is quite stylized; however, the economic forces in the
global marketplace work in exactly the same way. Buyers and sellers search for
the best location to sell their goods. However, unlike asset markets in which
the adjustments can happen on a large scale very quickly, purchasing power
parity depends in part on the adjustment of goods markets, which tend to take
place over a relatively long period of time. Therefore, purchasing power parity
tends to hold over a very long time horizon—months and years rather than
day-to-day. In addition, because there are real costs to shipping goods internationally, very small differences in purchasing power parity will not necessarily
disappear. Nevertheless, purchasing power parity is a powerful concept.

Fixed versus Floating Exchange Rates
The previous sections assumed that currency values could immediately
adjust as the demand for either goods or assets changes. In reality, some countries do not allow the value of their currencies to fluctuate. Instead, by
systematically changing the supply of their own currency through changes in
monetary policy, they control the changes in the value of their currencies and
limit exchange-rate movements. The choice of exchange-rate policy is often
called the exchange-rate regime of a country. This section discusses the two
most basic categories of exchange-rate regimes, fixed and floating. Defining a
country’s exchange-rate regime is, in practice, not an easy task. For example,
in 2004 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified eight distinct
exchange-rate regimes (see Box 7-3). Using the simplification of fixed versus
floating allows a simpler discussion of the links between the exchange rate and
monetary policy, a topic discussed in the next section.

Floating Exchange-Rate Regimes
Floating exchange-rate regimes are regimes in which the government takes
no action to influence the exchange rate. Under this regime, the exchange rate
is completely determined by the general market forces discussed above. One
advantage of a floating exchange rate is that the government does not have to
have any knowledge over what the correct or true exchange rate should be.
Market forces drive the exchange rate toward its true value.
Over the past 25 years, there has been a general trend away from fixed
exchange rates and toward floating exchange rates. Chart 7-2 illustrates this
general trend. The chart shows that the number of countries using floating
exchange rates has risen gradually over time. In 1980, over 75 percent of the

Chapter 7

| 159

Box 7-3: A Description of the IMF Classification of ExchangeRate Regimes
Exchange arrangements with no separate legal tender: A country
gives up its own currency and allows the currency of another country
to circulate as the sole legal tender. This exchange regime is often
referred to as dollarization. This classification includes countries, such
as members of the euro area, that form currency unions: arrangements
by which the same legal tender is shared by the member countries.
Currency board arrangements: An exchange-rate regime in which a
country commits to exchange domestic currency for a foreign currency
at a preannounced price. Currency board arrangements feature restrictions on the nation to ensure that it will abide by its legal obligation.
Conventional fixed peg arrangements: A regime in which a nation
announces that it will buy or sell its currency in exchange for a foreign
currency at a preannounced price. This regime differs from a currency
board arrangement only in the legal structure of the regime.
Pegged exchange rates within horizontal bands: A regime in which a
country allows only limited movements in the exchange rates. The
nation announces a high and a low value for the currency and only
agrees to sell the domestic currency at the high price and to buy the
domestic currency at the low price.
Crawling pegs: A crawling peg is essentially the same as a pegged
exchange rate except that the price at which the currency is traded
changes over time. For example, a nation that wishes to allow a longterm appreciation of its currency may choose to do so by adopting a
crawling peg that allows the currency to appreciate on average.
Exchange rates within crawling bands: This regime is a combination
of a crawling peg and a pegged exchange rate with horizontal bands.
Independently floating: The exchange rate is driven by the market.
The country does not attempt to influence the value of the exchange
rate. For example, the United States has an independently floating
exchange rate.
Managed floating: The exchange rate is driven by the market part of
the time but on occasion the government seeks to systematically influence the exchange rate through purchases or sales of the currency.

160 | Economic Report of the President

countries listed in the IMF exchange classification maintained a specific target
for their exchange rate. By 2005, this number had dropped to 55 percent.
Even among countries that are considered to be freely floating, the
government may occasionally or even periodically intervene in the exchange
market. For example, Turkey, listed as freely floating in the IMF classification
system, does not have a fixed exchange rate but reserves the right to intervene
in the exchange market to limit volatility in its exchange rate (and has done
so many times over the past few years).

Fixed Exchange-Rate Regimes
A fixed exchange-rate regime is a regime in which a nation’s government
announces the price at which its currency will trade for another currency. To
maintain the exchange rate, the government must stand ready to buy or sell
unlimited quantities of currency at the preannounced price. To keep the
exchange rate from appreciating, the government sells its domestic currency
in exchange for foreign currency. The increased supply of the currency lowers
the value of the currency. To keep the exchange rate from depreciating, the
government buys its domestic currency using foreign currency. To make these
transactions, the government must have sufficient supplies of both domestic
and foreign currency. Maintaining a supply of domestic currency is simple, as

Chapter 7

| 161

the government has the right to print unlimited quantities of its own
currency. However, supplies of foreign currency must be held in reserve and
the government does not have the option of increasing its supply. The possibility of running out of foreign currency and being unable to keep the
currency from depreciating is one of the reasons that many nations have given
up fixed exchange-rate regimes.
Fixed exchange rates have been used by a large number of countries and for
a large portion of modern economic history. Following World War II, the
major industrialized countries agreed to fix the value of their currencies with
respect to each other. This agreement was known as the Bretton-Woods
agreement, and the IMF was established in 1949 to monitor this system of
exchange rates. To a greater or lesser degree, this system remained in place until
the early 1970s, when countries began to allow their exchange rates to drift.
Following the breakdown of the Bretton-Woods agreement, the Western
European nations joined together in a fixed exchange-rate regime. After suffering
several major exchange-rate crises, 12 of the European nations preferred so
strongly to maintain a fixed exchange rate that they agreed to give up their
national currencies and the euro area was established. By giving up their national
currencies and forming a monetary union, the member nations hope to avoid
future crises. While the euro area is still relatively young (it was formally
established in 1999), the currency union has not yet suffered a major crisis.

The Links Between Monetary and Exchange-Rate
Policies
A nation’s choice of exchange-rate policy is tightly linked to a nation’s choice
of monetary policy. They are tightly linked because exchange-rate policy is a
form of monetary policy. Monetary policy, broadly defined, is the policy that
controls the growth rate of the money supply. In order to fix the exchange rate,
a government must use its ability to control the money supply to sustain a fixed
level of the exchange rate. If the supply of money is dedicated to controlling
the level of the exchange rate, it cannot simultaneously be dedicated to controlling inflation. Given the earlier discussion of interest rate parity, the choice of
monetary target is essentially a choice between stabilizing domestic prices and
stabilizing the exchange rate. If the exchange rate is fixed, then domestic prices,
both asset prices and goods prices, must do all of the adjusting.
The increase in the number of economies preferring floating exchange rates
and the rise of independent central banks with mandates to maintain price
stability is not a coincidence. An increasing number of countries have come
to desire central banks charged with maintaining low and stable inflation.
To achieve this goal, central banks need a nominal target to automatically
stabilize the money supply. Most modern central banks have chosen a
domestic short-term interest rate for the nominal target. The short-term
162 | Economic Report of the President

policy rate allows the central bank complete autonomy over choosing the rate
of domestic inflation.
The short-term policy rate is not the only nominal anchor available to the
central bank, however. The central bank could choose to fix the domestic
price of gold or any other commodity. The use of the gold standard has a long
and reputable history. A nation’s exchange rate with another country can also
be used as the nominal anchor for monetary policy. By fixing the value of the
domestic currency against another currency, a country essentially adopts the
monetary policy of the foreign country; one of the problems of using a strict
fixed exchange rate is that the monetary policy of the foreign country may
differ from what the central bank would have chosen given complete
autonomy. That is, the bank could be forced to print either more or less
currency than it would have otherwise chosen.
Thinking through a specific example will help clarify the relationship
between exchange-rate policy and overall monetary policy. For a long time,
China had a fixed exchange rate with the United States. To maintain its fixed
exchange rate, the Chinese government had to stand ready to buy or sell yuan,
China’s domestic currency, for U.S. dollars at a fixed price. From 2000 to July
2005, this price was set at approximately 8.28 yuan per dollar. Over this time
period, Chinese productivity growth was much higher than U.S. productivity
growth and Chinese prices on average grew much more slowly than U.S.
prices. High productivity growth implies a high return to investment in
China relative to the United States. The slow growth of Chinese prices implies
that, holding the exchange rate constant, Chinese goods were becoming
cheaper relative to goods in the United States. Therefore, both in terms of
maintaining interest rate parity and in terms of maintaining PPP, there was
pressure for the yuan to appreciate relative to the U.S. dollar. How did the
Chinese authorities prevent the appreciation?
The Chinese authorities prevented the appreciation by buying U.S. dollars
and exchanging these dollars for yuan. The pressures for appreciation of the
yuan implied that the yuan was facing higher demand—that more goods
could be purchased for dollars converted to yuan, and investments in China
delivered, on average, a higher return. To offset the increase in demand, the
Chinese government effectively increased the supply of Chinese assets and
decreased the supply of U.S. assets. Chinese foreign-exchange reserves
increased from around $150 billion in early 2000 to almost $1 trillion by
September 2006, a truly remarkable increase. In other words, the Chinese
prevented an appreciation of the exchange rate by effectively printing yuan
and using those yuan to accumulate U.S. dollar assets.
By fixing the exchange rate, the Chinese monetary authority is unable to
use monetary policy for any other goal. By printing yuan, the Chinese raise
the amount of currency in the country, which in turn, holding all else equal,
raises the domestic price level, thus raising the economy’s inflation rate.
Chapter 7

| 163

But if they are just printing enough to buy and hold U.S. assets, from
where does the domestic price pressure arise? The price pressure arises as the
yuan, which are used to purchase the dollar assets, flow back into the Chinese
economy. In other words, the prices increase because of foreign demand for
Chinese goods. On the surface, this foreign demand appears to arise as a result
of the Chinese exchange-rate regime; however, this demand is the same
demand which was originally putting pressure on the Chinese exchange rate.
At the old prices, there was not enough supply of Chinese goods to meet all
of the demand. Because the exchange rate was unable to adjust, the price of
Chinese goods had to adjust.
Could the Chinese conduct a monetary operation to lower inflation? To
lower inflation, the Chinese would need to remove yuan from circulation,
perhaps by selling domestic bonds. This transaction is sometimes referred to
as sterilization. The action, however, will tend to raise the value of the
currency: the currency would become scarcer as a result of the reduction in
supply. As the currency becomes more valuable the foreign-exchange value of
the currency would tend to appreciate. Any monetary action the Chinese
undertake to reduce domestic inflation tends to undo their exchange-rate
intervention (see Box 7-4).
This example also illustrates why the Chinese intervention does not systematically change the relative real prices between the United States and China.
Had the Chinese government not intervened, Chinese domestic prices would
have remained the same in terms of yuan and become more expensive in
terms of dollars through a change in the exchange rate. With the intervention,
Chinese domestic prices rose in terms of yuan and became more expensive in
terms of dollars even though the value of the nominal exchange rate was
unchanged. This outcome occurs any time a country takes actions to fix its
exchange rate: fixing the nominal exchange rate does not necessarily have any
impact on the relative prices between two countries. In other words, fixing the
nominal exchange rate does not tend to move countries away from purchasing
power parity. The only effect is that domestic goods prices have to do all of
the adjustment since the exchange rate is fixed.
In the end, central banks that choose to fix the value of their exchange rate
relative to another currency and central banks that choose to set a short-term
interest rate are each choosing a different tool to conduct monetary policy.
Economic theory does not dictate a clear preference between the two tools;
however, by 2006 no central bank from any major industrialized nation has
opted to use a fixed exchange rate, while maintaining their own domestic
currency, as a monetary policy instrument. These central banks understandably believe that interest rate targeting, in practice, is a preferred tool in the
conduct of monetary policy.

164 | Economic Report of the President

Box 7-4: The Impossible Trinity
A fixed exchange-rate regime forces a country to choose between
allowing free flows of assets in and out of the country or restricting the
flows in order to preserve independent monetary policy. This choice is
forced on countries because only two of the following three policies—
free asset flows, a fixed exchange rate, and an independent monetary
policy—can be maintained at any point in time.
The underlying reason for this restriction is that free asset flows and
monetary policy operations may yield a foreign-exchange value of the
currency which is inconsistent with the fixed rate that the government
is trying to maintain. The United States, for example, allows free asset
flows and maintains an independent monetary policy. As a result, the
U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve Board, can influence domestic
interest rates relative to foreign rates. If the Federal Reserve elects to
raise domestic rates, however, then the United States becomes a more
attractive investment environment relative to other countries, and
assets flow into the U.S. economy. Because this shift in asset flows
raises demand for the U.S. dollar, the exchange rate appreciates. Since
the U.S. government lets the market determine the dollar’s foreignexchange value, the dollar’s appreciation can occur without any active
intervention by the Federal Reserve.
In this example, the only way to break the direct link between the
exchange rate and the interest rate would be for the United States to
restrict asset flows. If assets cannot flow into the United States,
demand for the dollar does not rise with the increase in interest rates,
and the exchange rate does not necessarily appreciate. In other words,
one of the key assumptions of interest rate parity—that assets can flow
to the location with the highest return—is broken.
Denmark, on the other hand, effectively pegs its domestic currency to
the euro and allows free flows of assets, as evidenced by the nearly
632 billion kroner of foreign direct investment in Denmark in 2005 (over
40 percent of Denmark’s GDP). By pegging its currency and allowing
free asset flows, Denmark essentially loses the ability to independently
determine its domestic inflation rate. If Denmark were to alter interest
rates so that they deviated from world rates, assets would flow in or out
of the Danish economy and lead to a shift in the exchange rate. To
correct this shift and maintain its fixed exchange rate with the euro,
Denmark would then have to buy or sell kroner, thus negating the
interest rate changes it achieved through its monetary policy. In this
sense, free asset flows and a fixed exchange rate make an independent
monetary policy virtually impossible.

Box 7-4 — continued
In the middle of the spectrum are countries such as China, which has
pegged its exchange rate to the U.S. dollar. China can, to a limited extent,
operate an independent monetary policy, however, because it restricts
the ability of its residents to move capital out of the country. In China’s
case, world and domestic interest rates can differ since restrictions on
the flow of funds out of the domestic economy limit the resulting
changes in the money supply and the corresponding pressures on the
exchange rate.

Conclusion
Currency markets facilitate global trade and investment by making it easy
for firms and investors to buy or sell the currencies they need to do business
globally. In the absence of global currency markets, the benefits of international openness would be nearly impossible to realize—international trade
would effectively be reduced to barter arrangements. The growing importance
of international trade and investment has been accompanied by an increasing
number of transactions in the foreign-exchange markets.
The value of a nation’s currency is determined like any other good, service,
or asset. The more people demand the currency and the scarcer the supply of
the currency, the higher the currency’s value. The value of a currency is measured by its purchasing power relative to other currencies. In other words, the
value of a currency is measured by its exchange rate with other currencies.
Exchange-rate policy is a form of monetary policy. When a country fixes its
exchange rate relative to another country, that country must use its monetary
policy to maintain the exchange rate. A country with a fixed exchange rate
does not have the ability to use monetary policy for any other purpose, just as
a nation which sets a short-term interest rate must devote its monetary policy
to achieving that goal.
In addition, the value of a country’s currency is in large part determined by
the value of that country’s goods, services, and assets and the ability of people
and firms to freely trade these items across national borders. Any policy that
restricts the free flow of these items will lower the value of the currency, in
addition to lowering the value of the restricted asset. The value of a nation’s
currency is tied to people’s ability to move assets and goods. Small changes in
a nation’s openness to trade and investment will likely have a small impact on

currency than would have been true otherwise.

International Trade and Investment

T

he United States derives substantial benefits from open trade and
investment flows. Over many decades, increased trade and investment
liberalization has been an important catalyst for greater productivity growth
and rising average living standards in the United States.
Trade liberalization and globalization remain controversial subjects because
competition invariably raises both anxieties and opportunities. Reducing
obstacles to trade can help economies grow more rapidly in the long run and
create better, higher paying jobs. Increased competition, however, can lead to
hardships for others in the short run. Constructive policies that help displaced
workers train for and find new work and increase the portability of pension
and health benefits can help to ease adjustment.
The key points in this chapter are:
• Engagement in the global economy through increased trade has
contributed to rising average living standards in the United States. Firms
engaged in international trade are more productive, have higher employment growth, and are higher wage firms than domestically oriented
firms. Looking ahead, international trade liberalization in services presents significant opportunities for U.S. workers, firms, and consumers.
• Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into the United States benefit the
U.S. economy by stimulating growth, creating jobs, and financing the
current account deficit. FDI flows into the United States also stimulate
investment in research and development in high-technology areas that
promote innovation and competitiveness.
• U.S. direct investment abroad is an important channel of global market
access for U.S. firms. U.S. multinational companies have contributed to
productivity growth, job creation, and rising average living standards in
the United States.

Trade Liberalization: A Key Contributor
to the Strength of the U.S. Economy
Increased international trade has raised real incomes, restrained prices,
introduced greater product variety, spurred technological advances and innovation, and raised living standards in the United States. Studies have
estimated that the annual payoff from U.S. trade and investment
167

liberalization to date, including from the Kennedy Round, the Tokyo Round,
the Uruguay Round, the North American Free Trade Agreement and other
free-trade agreements, is up to $1.5 trillion. These gains arise through many
channels: higher long-term levels of commerce in goods and services that
come from trade and investment liberalization; increased product variety;
more efficient allocation of resources; and better transportation and communication technology. Some economists have conjectured that trade
liberalization alone has accounted for about half of these gains, which implies
that the annual income gain from trade liberalization to date is over $2,500
per capita, or $10,000 for an average American family of four. Existing studies
suggest that U.S. incomes could rise further by approximately $590 billion
per year by moving all the way to global free trade in goods and services.
International trade in goods and services exposes firms to foreign competition and reduces their ability to charge high markups above production costs.
International trade also increases the variety of goods available such as silk
sweaters from China, wine from Australia, and winter blueberries from Chile.
Consumers value variety and one study estimated that the U.S. economic
value of increased varieties through imports over the past three decades
is equivalent to $350 billion per year, or 2.8 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP).
Engagement in the global economy through increased trade has
contributed to rising average living standards in the United States. Research
shows that firms engaged in the international marketplace tend to exhibit
higher rates of productivity growth and pay higher wages and benefits to their
workers than domestically oriented firms. Economists agree that the most
important determinant of living standards in a country is the average level of
productivity, or output per worker.
A free and open international trade regime is vital for a stable and growing
economy, both here at home and throughout the world. The United States
will continue to work aggressively toward multilateral trade liberalization
through the World Trade Organization’s Doha Development Agenda negotiations. The prospects for these negotiations to produce significant benefits for
this country and our trading partners, particularly developing countries,
demand that we promptly reach a balanced and ambitious outcome.

Firms That Engage in International Trade Are
Strong Performers
At the microeconomic level, firms engaged in international trade outperform domestically oriented firms on many dimensions. Research has shown

168 | Economic Report of the President

that firms engaged in international trade have higher productivity than their
counterparts engaged solely in domestic activity. One study found that value
added per employee, one simple measure of productivity, was 15 percent
higher in manufacturing exporting firms than in firms that did not export
(controlling for industry effects, plant size, and geographic location). And
these productivity effects are reflected in higher wages: the wages paid by
manufacturing plants that export are 9 percent higher on average than wages
paid by non-exporting plants of the same size. Wages in service-oriented firms
that export are, on average, 13 percent higher than their purely domestic
counterparts of the same size.
One recent study that examined the dynamics of globally engaged firms
between 1993 and 2000 found that firms engaged in international trade had
a higher survival rate (65 percent) than the average for all firms in the country
(53 percent). In addition, a firm that began to trade during this time period
increased employment by nearly 100 percent on average, while a firm that
quit trading experienced a decline in employment.
An increasing number of American workers are employed by firms engaged
in international trade. Between 1993 and 2000, firms that trade increased
employment by 9.8 million workers, and the share of the American workforce
employed by a firm engaged in trade increased from 40 percent to approximately 42 percent. Applied to today’s workforce, this result implies that over
57 million American workers are currently employed by a firm that engages
in international trade.

The Effects of Nontariff Barriers on International Trade
While trade can generate many economic benefits, governments at times
set up barriers to international trade. One of the more common and harmful
barriers is a nontariff barrier, a barrier behind the border that is a policy (other
than a tariff or tax) or official practice that can unfairly inhibit competition.
Unjustified nontariff barriers can distort the prices and quantities of goods
and services traded internationally, restrict international investment, and
reduce economic welfare in exporting and importing countries. As tariffs have
fallen both in the United States and in many other countries, nontariff
barriers have increased in importance and are often cited as more traderestricting than tariffs. Nontariff barriers can arise as a result of government
policies aimed explicitly at protecting domestic firms from international
competition, or from rules or laws within a country that effectively hinder
trade (see Box 8-1).

Chapter 8

| 169

Box 8-1: Nontariff Barriers Restrict Trade
Unjustified nontariff barriers (NTBs) make it more difficult for international goods and services to compete freely and fairly with those
produced domestically. Common examples of NTBs are burdensome or
nontransparent product standards or regulations. For example, in
Korea, pharmaceutical imports must be tested on Korean nationals, and
each individual batch produced must undergo testing. In China, the
process of standards certification for telecommunications and IT products can be burdensome and unpredictable, as two separate Chinese
regulatory agencies each check for conformity to the same set of standards. Other often-cited NTBs include investment restrictions,
government procurement laws, and lax enforcement of intellectual
property rights.
Measuring the effects of NTBs on trade is more difficult than
assessing the effects of tariffs, but some attempts have been made. A
growing body of evidence consistently shows that the economic
welfare gains from eliminating NTBs are at least as large as those
obtained from further tariff liberalization. One study shows that the U.S.
payoff from eliminating NTBs with just seven of our trading partners
(Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and Great
Britain) would generate annual income gains of $90 billion for the
United States (0.72 percent of GDP), compared with $37 billion from
tariff liberalization (0.30 percent of GDP). These benefits arise largely
from the pro-competitive effects of increased international trade and
more efficient allocation of resources.
Tariff negotiations are fairly straightforward, and forums such as the
World Trade Organization (WTO) exist for this purpose. Members are
required to report their tariff schedule to the WTO each year, so
members know the tariff rate for each product in every country.
However, countries do not always agree on what constitutes a NTB and
there is no formal, consistent notification process, thereby making
negotiations aimed at addressing such barriers more complicated. Part
of the policy problem is making distinctions as to whether NTBs are
warranted for nontrade reasons (e.g., product safety standards) or
whether they are simply covert barriers to imports (nontransparent
licensing requirements for foreign firms). For instance, customary regulatory and legal procedures within one country might be seen as
complex and overly burdensome to would-be exporters.
Apart from the challenges of identifying NTBs, policymakers face
difficulties in knowing which NTBs they should seek to dismantle first.
The U.S. Department of Commerce has surveyed its industry and trade
experts and country desk officers in an effort to identify the most prevalent NTBs faced by U.S. exporters and to identify which export products

170 | Economic Report of the President

are most likely affected. The survey results suggest that, on average, at
least one NTB affects U.S. exporters for each major product category in
which they export to our main trading partners. For instance, a problematic regulatory environment was cited as a problem in 43 of the
49 countries covered by the survey, and was cited as the top problem
in 14 of those countries. The industries facing the most NTBs included
entertainment, pharmaceuticals, and information technology.

International Trade in Services
Liberalizing trade in services is important for economic growth here and
abroad. As an economy grows and matures, services tend to increase as a share
of GDP and as a share of trade. The United States has a global competitive
advantage in services, yet services remain highly protected abroad.
Services such as financial, insurance, transportation and storage, telecommunications, express delivery, and business services generate 68 percent of
world GDP but account for just under 20 percent of global trade. While
global advances in information and communications technology are making
services increasingly tradable, existing trade barriers to services are significant.
These barriers are currently subject to negotiation in a host of bilateral,
regional, and multilateral trade talks.

U.S. Competitive Advantage in Services
A large and growing part of the U.S. economy and workforce is employed
in services. In 1800, 9 out of 10 American workers were employed in agriculture; today that number is less than 1 in 10 (Chart 8-1). In contrast, nearly
8 in 10 American workers are employed today in the service sector.
The vast economic benefits from trade liberalization for services stem in part
from our competitive advantage in services. That is, the United States can
produce many services at a lower cost than our trading partners, and our
trading partners can produce some other set of goods and services at a lower
cost than the United States. When we trade our lower cost services for their
lower cost goods, we and our trading partners gain from trade. Chart 8-2
shows the changing structure of U.S. trade, which in part mirrors the changing
structure of the U.S. economy. Since the 1970s, the United States has consistently run a surplus in services trade, with a $66 billion surplus in 2005.

Technological Change Is Fostering International Trade in Services
Services have become increasingly tradable, particularly knowledge-based
or information technology-enabled services that are beyond the traditional
notion of internationally traded services such as transportation, travel, and
tourism. For many of these services, a physical commercial presence is necessary. For example, a financial institution is able to offer a host of financial
products to international clients, but the multinational firm must still set up
intermediary branches to serve their clients overseas. Other services can be
delivered with virtually no physical presence. An increasingly wide range of
commercial transactions ranging from stock trades, to manufacturing orders,
to airline reservations, can occur almost entirely over networked digital media
located in many countries around the world.
Trade in services previously involved high transaction costs between businesses and customers. Technological innovations and changes in global
technology such as the Internet, information technology (IT) hardware such
as personal computers, and IT networks have greatly reduced communication
and transaction costs for trade in services.
Table 8-1 reports U.S. trade in private services. The largest subcategories in
“other private services” trade, which captures many of the IT-enabled services,
include financial and insurance services; computer, management, and
consulting services; and other business, professional, and technical services.

Trade growth in “other private services” has far outpaced growth in the rest
of services. From 1995 to 2005, U.S. exports of “other private services” grew
143 percent, compared with 44 percent growth in all other services. The bulk
of the overall trade surplus in services comes from the “other private services”
category, which accounted for 90 percent of the overall U.S. services trade
surplus in 2005, up from 38 percent in 1995. In contrast, the surplus in more
traditional services (e.g., travel and transportation) has fallen. The surplus in
“other private services” has grown from $30 billion in 1995 to $60 billion in
2005, and the surplus in the rest of services has fallen from $48 billion to $7
billion. Many of these trends are consistent with the global IT advancements
that have fostered international trade in services over the past decade.

High Barriers Restrict International Trade in Services
Barriers to trade in services are mostly regulatory and investment restrictions and tend to be higher than trade barriers in merchandise. For instance,
U.S. banks that wish to offer retail banking services abroad face a host of
barriers that limit their ability to compete in foreign markets. Examples of
such barriers might be investment restrictions that limit the number of bank
licenses the country will issue to a U.S. bank; requirements for U.S. banks to
enter the banking market through a joint venture with a domestic bank; or
limits on the degree of control that a U.S. bank can exercise over its foreign
affiliate. Foreign firms wishing to enter the U.S. airline industry face ownership restrictions that limit their ability to compete with domestic firms.
Despite such barriers, services trade is expected to continue to grow.
Research suggests that as countries’ incomes grow, their demand for services
and their trade in services will each grow more than one-for-one with income.
U.S. producers are well-positioned to continue to engage in increased services
trade, as many have already incorporated the technology in their operations
to facilitate trade.

Looking Ahead to Larger Gains from Trade
Liberalization
Despite decades of trade liberalization, the world economy is still far from
a global marketplace of unfettered trade. Many of the remaining barriers lie
in services, and the prospective gains for the United States from further trade
reform are substantial. While global tariff liberalization in manufacturing and
agriculture could generate over $16 billion in income for the United States
each year, the prospective gains from services liberalization are immense: an
estimated $575 billion in annual U.S. income (4.3 percent of GDP).
Summing up, this is an additional $591 billion in annual income that will be
foregone in the absence of further trade reform.

174 | Economic Report of the President

The magnitude of the payoff to the United States from services trade liberalization reflects a number of factors: the U.S. competitive advantage in many
services, the large share of services in the global economy compared to the relatively small share of services in global trade, and the high barriers to services
trade. These barriers are often regulatory in nature or involve restrictions on
the form of investment, such as foreign equity restrictions that limit foreign
investors’ holdings and control in a company, transfer limitations on capital
flows, and the repatriation of profits. Removing these barriers would free up
capital to move across borders to the location with the highest rate of return.
Developing countries also stand to benefit greatly from global liberalization
of services trade. The service sector share of GDP exceeds the manufacturing
share in most developing countries. The increased availability and quality of
services enhances the competitiveness of manufactured goods, agricultural
products, and existing services. For instance, India stands to gain an estimated
$12 billion in national income each year (1.7 percent of GDP) from
removing barriers to trade in services, and China stands to gain an estimated
$105 billion (4.0 percent of GDP) each year.

Foreign Direct Investment
International trade in goods and services is an important channel of
international commerce, but it is not the largest channel. For many U.S.
firms, foreign direct investment (FDI) is a more significant path to accessing
foreign markets than are exports.
FDI is investment of foreign assets into domestic structures, equipment,
and organizations (e.g., a manufacturing plant, an R&D facility, an office or
a warehouse), whether in the form of acquisition or “greenfield” establishment. FDI is distinguished from passive portfolio investment (FDI does not
include foreign investment in the stock market). Only the former can confer
managerial or operational control. The two types of foreign direct investment
are inward FDI and outward FDI. Inward foreign direct investment is generally
understood to imply ownership by a foreign person or corporation of at least
a 10-percent stake in a U.S. business enterprise. Similarly, outward foreign
direct investment is ownership by a U.S. person or corporation of at least a
10-percent stake in a foreign business’ operation abroad. A foreign automaker
building or buying a production plant in the United States is an example of
inward FDI, while a U.S. automaker building or buying a production plant
in China is an example of outward FDI.
Before we examine each type of FDI and its importance to the U.S.
economy, it is useful to define some of the terms that are commonly encountered when discussing FDI. A multinational corporation is a business enterprise
Chapter 8

| 175

(i.e., the parent) headquartered in one country that has at least a 10-percent
ownership stake in a foreign business enterprise (i.e., the affiliate) in another
country. That 10-percent ownership stake is the minimum stake used by many
statistical agencies around the world, including those in the United States, for
identifying meaningful managerial influence over the affiliate.
A majority-owned U.S. affiliate is an affiliate of a foreign-owned company
that is located in the United States and has at least 50 percent foreign ownership (we focus on majority-owned U.S. affiliates here but use the term “U.S.
affiliates”). Similarly, a majority-owned foreign affiliate is a foreign affiliate with
at least 50 percent U.S. ownership.
U.S. firms are more reliant on FDI for the international delivery of services
than they are for the international delivery of goods. While services are
becoming increasingly tradable, their actual delivery often requires some
physical presence, for example, distribution and express delivery services.
Even with widespread use of ATMs and electronic banking, financial or retail
banking often requires physical presence in the country in which services are
being offered. Based on data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis for 2004,
the ratio of sales by U.S.-owned services affiliates abroad to total U.S. services
exports was 5.5, compared to 2.5 for goods. That is, U.S. firms deliver over
five times the value of services through their foreign affiliates as they do
through cross-border trade. Similarly, U.S. firms deliver 2.5 times the value of
goods through their foreign affiliates as they do through cross-border trade.

Contributions of Inward FDI to the U.S. Economy
The United States receives inward FDI from firms and individuals located
in countries from all over the world. Countries with the largest FDI positions
in the United States include Great Britain, Japan, Germany, and Canada.
These funds support firms across the U.S. economic landscape, from food,
mining, and manufacturing firms to service sectors such as finance, telecommunications, and wholesale and retail trade. Every state in the United States
is a recipient of foreign direct investment.

Presence of U.S. Affiliates
Decades of trade and investment liberalization both here and abroad have
encouraged the growth of multinationals and global supply chains. Today,
U.S. affiliates of foreign multinationals account for an important part of the
U.S. economy. In 2004, the latest year for which data are available, U.S. affiliates owned $5.5 trillion in assets and had $2.3 trillion in sales. They
produced $515 billion of goods and services inside the United States and
accounted for 5.7 percent of total U.S. private output—up from 3.8 percent
in 1988. U.S. affiliates employed 5.1 million workers or 4.7 percent of the

176 | Economic Report of the President

U.S. workforce in 2004—up from 3.6 percent in 1988. While historical data
show upward trends in the presence of U.S. affiliates, since 2000 U.S. affiliate
investment, output, and employment have leveled off or decreased slightly.

Microeconomic Benefits to the U.S. Economy
Inward FDI provides a number of benefits to the U.S. economy at the
microeconomic level. Research has shown that multinationals are more
productive than firms focused primarily on domestic markets. The relatively
high productivity of U.S. affiliates of foreign-owned firms is attributable, in
part, to their relatively high levels of investment in physical capital, R&D,
and exporting and importing. Specifically, while U.S. affiliates account for
5.7 percent of output and 4.7 percent of employment, they account for a
disproportionately high share of U.S. exports (19 percent), imports
(26 percent), physical capital expenditures (10 percent), and R&D expenditures (13 percent) (see Chart 8-3). Studies show that all of these activities are
correlated with strong productivity performance. (Chapter 2 discusses
productivity growth and long-run effects on the standard of living.)

Chapter 8

| 177

At the firm level, U.S. affiliates pay higher compensation (wages and
benefits) on average than their counterparts in the rest of the U.S. economy.
In 2004, an average U.S. worker employed by a U.S. affiliate of a foreignowned firm received $63,400 in annual compensation compared to $48,200
for workers in the rest of the economy. Research suggests that this difference
is largely attributable to above-average labor productivity at U.S. affiliates.
Part of this productivity advantage reflects these firms’ ability to integrate
production processes across borders and their organizational efficiency.
Another part reflects differences in plant size, capital intensity (that is, higher
use of capital relative to other factors, such as labor, in the production
process), and employee skill level. The data also suggest that these firms have
higher levels of efficiency (how well labor and capital inputs are used), the
gains of which are passed on, in part, to workers. In other words, firms can
break up their production process across borders to lower average costs and
realize increased productivity and revenues, which can be shared with workers
through higher compensation and/or captured by firm owners as higher
profits (see Box 8-2).

Macroeconomic Benefits to the U.S. Economy
Inward FDI provides a number of benefits to the U.S. economy at the
macroeconomic level. For instance, inward FDI is an additional source of
investment that helps to modernize the U.S. capital stock. Another benefit is
that it provides a source of financing for the U.S. current account deficit,
which measures net flows of goods and services between the United States and
the rest of the world. As the United States continues to run a current account
deficit, foreigners continue to accumulate U.S. assets, and inward FDI is one
of the main ways in which they do so.
The accumulation of FDI flows over a period of time results in a stock of
assets, or the gross foreign investment position. In 2005, the inward FDI position at market value totaled $2.8 trillion and was the largest component of
foreign holdings of U.S. assets. Other components were U.S. Treasury securities ($2 trillion); corporate stocks ($2.1 trillion); and corporate and other
private bonds, excluding official holdings ($2.3 trillion) (see Chart 8-4).
The share of foreign holdings is not concentrated in any particular class of
assets, which implies a general broad-based confidence in the U.S. economy.
Inward FDI is generally considered to be the most stable among the four
types of assets shown in Chart 8-4—that is, the least subject to sudden withdrawal. FDI flows are generated by long-term risk–return considerations and
are far less liquid and less reversible than portfolio investments. Therefore,
FDI flows provide stability to U.S. capital flows because they are not easily
reversed for short-term considerations.

Box 8-2: Multinationals Bring New Products and Processes to
the Host Country
The benefits to the U.S. economy from inward FDI mirror those of
many other countries. A growing body of evidence across countries
and industries demonstrates that globally engaged firms tend to be
strong performers—such firms are more productive, pay higher wages,
and generate beneficial productivity side effects that accrue to
domestic competitors. The three case studies that follow provide a
snapshot of the benefits of inward FDI.
Increasing Living Standards in the United States
Infineon Technologies of Munich, Germany, built a state-of-the-art
manufacturing plant in Richmond, Virginia, using leading-edge technology to produce dynamic random access memory products that are
used in computers. The Richmond company’s annual payroll exceeds
$100 million, with average wages that are nearly double average
Virginia salaries. Over 3,000 North American workers are employed by

Box 8-2 — continued
this German-headquartered multinational, with over 1,750 workers in
Richmond alone. The firm has built extensive ties with its customers
and suppliers worldwide, and many advanced technology suppliers
have emerged in Virginia to support Infineon and other semiconductor
firms. Semiconductors are now Virginia’s second largest export.
Enhancing Productivity for Mexican Producers and Retailers
One case study documents impressive efficiency gains for Mexico’s
domestic soap producers once Wal-Mart entered its retail sector. WalMart helped improve Mexico’s retail sector by improving the way
Mexican retailers interacted with their suppliers. These changes
brought about efficiency improvements such as modernization of warehousing, distribution, and inventory management; triggered greater
use of information technology in supply management; and required
delivery trucks to have appointments and drivers to carry standard
identification cards. These innovations have been adopted by other
retailers and producers outside of Mexico’s soap industry. Mexican
soap producers improved their productivity and have gained market
share in key export markets, including in the United States.
Improving Banking and Telecommunication Services for Czech
Manufacturers
The change toward a freer and more open investment climate in the
Czech Republic was followed by the entrance of foreign-owned banks
and telecommunication firms. These foreign-owned service providers
helped to improve the availability, range, and quality of services. These
improved services contributed to better performance of Czech manufacturing firms that rely on services as inputs. For instance, foreign
banks accelerated the processing of loan applications, offering decisions to small and medium Czech enterprises within 2 days, compared
to a previous waiting period of several weeks. Foreign banks were
among the first to offer Internet and remote banking services, including
ATMs, which save individual customers and business clients days and
sometimes weeks in transaction times. The time needed to send a fax
went from hours (or sometimes days for rural areas) to just minutes
following the liberalization of the telecommunication sector.

180 | Economic Report of the President

Is Inward FDI on the Decline?
The increase of inward FDI since the late 1980s has coincided with the
generally solid performance of the U.S. economy, along with a surge in U.S.
worker productivity that has occurred since 1995. Recently, however, some
trends have developed with respect to FDI in the United States that may be
cause for concern. First, while the U.S. affiliate share of U.S. output has
grown over the past two decades, it has stagnated and even declined in recent
years. Second, the U.S. affiliate share of employment has declined, from 5.1
percent in 2000 to 4.7 percent in 2004. Third, the share of inward FDI in the
U.S. capital account—that is, FDI in the United States as a share of all the
assets owned by foreign interests—has declined since 1999. It is not yet clear
whether these are benign and temporary trends or whether this development
is symptomatic of deeper issues with respect to the attractiveness of the
United States as a country in which to make direct investment. To ensure that
inward FDI remains a strong, positive force in the U.S. economy, foreign
investors in the United States must continue to receive fair and equitable
treatment as a matter of both law and practice.
Historically, the United States has opposed the use of government actions
that distort, restrict, or place unreasonable burdens on foreign investment. No
property can be expropriated pursuant to U.S. law unless it is done for a
public use with payment of just compensation. The United States has historically provided a domestic environment conducive to investment by
providing foreign investors fair and equitable treatment based on the national
treatment principle: foreign investors should be treated no less favorably than
domestic investors in like circumstances. Moreover, while taking every necessary step to ensure that foreign investments do not jeopardize national
security, the Administration recognizes that our economic vitality depends on
our openness.

The Contributions of Outward FDI to the U.S.
Economy
A U.S. multinational company is headquartered in the United States and,
through outward FDI, has affiliates (often production or marketing facilities)
in other countries. Activities of U.S.-headquartered multinationals have
contributed strongly to productivity growth in the United States, and thus to
rising U.S. living standards.
Because multinationals are engaged in cross-border investment and production networks, they are better able to enhance their organizational efficiency.
Studies have shown that multinationals are more productive than firms that
are focused primarily on domestic markets. By combining domestic production with foreign production, multinationals can produce at lower costs, earn
Chapter 8

| 181

higher profits, and pay higher wages and benefits. Domestic firms can benefit
from outward FDI as multinationals are exposed to the world’s best business
practices that can be adopted by other U.S. firms.

Basic Facts About U.S. Multinational Companies
U.S. multinationals are relatively small in number but have a disproportionately large economic footprint. Less than 1 percent of U.S. firms are
multinationals, but these multinationals account for 20 percent of total U.S.
employment and 25 percent of total U.S. output. In 2004, there were 2,369
U.S. multinationals with 22,279 foreign affiliates, with 21.4 million
employees in the United States and 9 million workers abroad. The operations
of U.S. multinationals are concentrated in the United States. In 2004, the
combined value-added output of U.S. multinationals was $3.04 trillion. U.S.
parents accounted for over 70 percent of this output and foreign affiliates for
less than 30 percent.
While U.S. multinationals have increased employment and output in an
absolute sense, their share of the workforce has decreased slightly over the
years while their share of output has remained fairly constant. U.S. multinationals employed 18.7 million American workers, or 25 percent of the
workforce, in 1982 (the first year for which annual employment data are
available). In 2004, those figures stood at 21.4 million workers and 20
percent, respectively. The value of output by U.S. parents was $1.3 trillion or
24 percent of the total private U.S. output in 1994 (the first year for which
annual output data are available). In 2004, those figures were $2.2 trillion and
25 percent, respectively. In terms of recent trends, both employment and
output by U.S. parents peaked in 2000 and then began to decline. Output
rebounded in 2003 and employment rebounded in 2004, largely reflecting
economy-wide trends.

Why Do U.S. Firms Become Multinational?
There are three conditions required for a firm to be willing to invest abroad:
(1) the firm has specific assets that can be transported to foreign affiliates;
(2) the host country has certain characteristics that make it attractive for the
firm; and (3) the firm wishes to maintain control over its intellectual assets.
Multinationals often face large costs and barriers to doing business abroad
compared with domestic firms in the host country that are familiar with the local
business climate. Physical and human capital are needed to establish an affiliate,
and additional resources are needed to understand the local business environment (for example, regulations and tax laws, supply networks, cultural
differences, and property rights). Thus, a multinational firm must have certain
advantages to compensate for these costs. Three types of compensating
advantages are commonly cited. One advantage is firm-specific resources or
knowledge-based assets and services (such as technology, patents, trademarks,
182 | Economic Report of the President

and managerial or engineering expertise) that can be used by the foreign affiliate.
Another advantage is the location and characteristics of the host country such as
market size, trade costs, and differences in the prices for key inputs such as land,
labor, or capital. The existence of a large market or the high costs of trading with
a certain country or region can motivate multinationals to produce and sell in
foreign countries. Price differences in land, capital, or labor; transportation and
telecommunications infrastructure; or good business practices can also motivate
a multinational to invest and produce abroad.
The third type of advantage is known as internalization advantage. A firm
may choose outward FDI over giving a foreign company a license to produce
its goods so that it can retain control of its intellectual assets. For example, a
firm may be reluctant to reveal the details of its product’s construction or its
production process to a prospective licensee. There is also the danger that a
licensee may produce a lower quality product and consequently reduce the
value of the multinational’s trademark. The difficulty of guaranteeing quality
control, monitoring and managing employees, achieving a satisfactory
licensing agreement, and enforcing patent or trademark rights all tend to
favor outward FDI.

The Organization of Multinational Production
There are two main organizational strategies for multinational production.
One strategy is vertical FDI, whereby the multinational geographically fragments the production process and carries out different stages of production at
different locations. In contrast, horizontal FDI occurs when the multinational
conducts the entire production process in the host country to sell locally
through its affiliates.
Vertical FDI establishes cross-border production networks. A multinational
firm may perform many activities—for example, R&D, assembly, marketing,
and sales—that require different mixes of capital, more- or less- skilled labor,
land, and other inputs. Separating these activities across borders (and across
the parent company and affiliate companies) enables the firm to locate each
activity in countries with relatively low costs for each activity’s intensively
used inputs. Because each stage of the production process is carried out in the
optimal location in terms of the input mix, vertical FDI production networks
can allow firms to take advantage of differences in comparative advantages
across countries and produce at an overall lower unit cost. Trade between U.S.
parents and their affiliates (“intra-firm” trade) has risen over time, accounting
for 20 percent of total U.S. goods exports in 2004, and 14 percent of total
goods imports.
Horizontal FDI can allow U.S. multinationals better access to foreign
markets. Ninety-five percent of the world’s consumers live outside U.S.
borders. Companies can reach foreign markets through FDI or exporting. But
for U.S. multinationals, the predominant mode of serving foreign markets is
Chapter 8

| 183

through FDI and affiliate sales (producing and selling locally), not exporting.
In 2004, U.S. multinationals sold $2.3 trillion of goods abroad through affiliate sales compared to $400 billion through exports (see Chart 8-5). In other
words, for every $1 of exports in goods, U.S. multinational firms sold $5.84
through their foreign affiliates, up from $3.40 ten years earlier.
A common allegation is that U.S. multinationals set up production plants
to serve as export platforms back to the United States. However, the data do
not support this claim. In 2004, sales by foreign affiliates of U.S. multinationals totaled $3.2 trillion. Most of these sales were to customers outside of
the United States; 89.6 percent of total sales were to foreign customers and
10.4 percent were to U.S. customers.

Outward FDI Complements Domestic Economic Activity
Studies show that economic activity abroad by U.S. multinationals complements domestic economic activity. One dollar of additional foreign capital
spending is associated with $3.50 of additional domestic capital spending.
Firms combine home and foreign production to generate final output at a
lower cost than would be possible in just one country, resulting in increased
output and profits. Further, when multinationals hire abroad, they also
expand employment here at home, making multinationals an important force
behind job creation in the United States (see Box 8-3).

184 | Economic Report of the President

From a broader perspective, U.S. multinationals enhance U.S. competitiveness by engaging in the same activities and possessing the same characteristics
that make the U.S. economy competitive in world export markets. Research
has shown that the competitiveness of U.S. multinationals tends to be driven
by relatively high levels of R&D and highly skilled labor. Studies have also
shown that U.S. firms tend to control larger shares of world markets in industries with high levels of R&D and highly skilled labor. Because their
competitive interests largely coincide with broader U.S. economic interests,
U.S. multinationals make the economy as a whole more competitive.

Box 8-3: U.S. Multinational Companies and U.S. Jobs
In recent years, many observers have expressed dismay that U.S.
companies have expanded their operations overseas, claiming that
when U.S. firms hire workers in foreign countries, they reduce the
number of jobs available to U.S. workers. The idea that U.S. multinationals hiring abroad are “exporting jobs” relies on at least two
assumptions: first, that jobs abroad at foreign affiliates are substitutes
for domestic jobs at U.S. parent companies; and second, that when U.S.
parent companies expand overseas, they do not change the overall
scale or scope of their domestic activities. However, in looking at historical data regarding the activity of U.S. multinationals, we see exactly
the opposite: when U.S. companies expand their employment abroad,
they also tend to expand domestically.
When U.S. Multinationals Hire Abroad They Also Expand Domestic
Employment
Over the last two decades (1984–2004), U.S. multinationals expanded
employment at their foreign affiliates by 3.8 million and at their parents
by 3.2 million (see chart). In other words, the long-run data show that
when U.S. multinationals hire abroad they also expand domestic
employment. There have been short-run anomalies to this historical
trend that largely reflect economic business cycles both here and
abroad. For instance, between 1990 and 2000, for each job U.S. multinationals created abroad they created nearly two at home. Between 2000
and 2003, U.S. multinationals continued to expand employment abroad,
albeit at a slower pace, while decreasing their U.S. payrolls. Since 2003,
both U.S. parent company and affiliate employment have risen.
One study found that as U.S. companies expand employment abroad,
increase their compensation of foreign workers, and invest in their
overseas operations, they also increase their hiring, employee compensation, and investment in the United States. Thus, rather than being
continued on the next page

Chapter 8

| 185

Box 8-3 — continued

substitutes for one another, the domestic and foreign operations of U.S.
multinationals have tended to be complements. Consider the operations
of General Electric. According to its latest annual report, since 2001 this
multinational has expanded foreign employment by 3,000 while also
expanding domestic employment by the same amount.
One reason for the complementary relationship between domestic
and foreign activity is that a firm may change the overall size of its operations and expand both at home and abroad. Alternatively, a firm may
change the scope of its operations and change the mix of its activities
(for example, manufacturing, services, or R&D). In fact, it is common for
parent companies in one industry to own foreign affiliates in another
industry. In 2004, U.S. parent companies primarily engaged in manufacturing owned over 15,000 foreign affiliates, but over 6,500 of these
affiliates specialized in areas outside of manufacturing.
In sum, the decision of a firm to expand abroad is based on many
factors, and it may be part of a larger overall expansion strategy or a
change in the scope of its operations. It is difficult to predict beforehand
what such an expansion means for U.S. workers and the U.S. economy.
The only way to tell the effect is to examine the data, and thus far the
data show that, over the long run, when U.S. multinational firms hire
abroad, they also hire at home.

186 | Economic Report of the President

Good Performance Features of U.S. Multinationals
U.S. multinationals differ from the average U.S. firm in a number of ways.
For example, while U.S. multinationals account for 25 percent of total U.S.
output and 20 percent of employment, they account for a disproportionately
high share of U.S. goods exports (49 percent), goods imports (31 percent),
physical capital expenditures (29 percent), and research and development
(68 percent) (see Chart 8-6). In fact, U.S. affiliates and multinationals
combined conduct over 80 percent of all private sector R&D in the United
States. Also, the plants operated by these companies tend to be larger in size
than the U.S. average. These differences are important because each of
them—international trade, capital expenditure, research and development,
and plant size—is associated with high labor productivity. And because of
the strong link between labor productivity and employee compensation (see
Chapter 2), this higher productivity is a potential benefit to U.S. workers.
U.S. multinationals pay higher average compensation than firms in the rest
of the economy. In 2004, U.S. workers employed by U.S. parent companies
received an average of $57,800 in annual compensation, compared to about
$46,800 for workers in the rest of the economy. The relatively high productivity of U.S. multinationals may be one of the causes for the difference
in compensation.

Chapter 8

| 187

U.S. multinationals have had high productivity growth over at least the last
three decades, and because they make up a sizeable part of the overall U.S.
economy, they have been one of the main drivers of overall U.S. productivity
growth during this period. U.S. multinationals accounted for over half of U.S.
productivity growth between 1977 and 2000, and for half of the increase in
U.S. productivity growth between 1995 and 2000. During this 5-year period,
productivity at U.S. multinationals surged, growing 6.0 percent annually.

Conclusion
Engagement in the global economy through increased trade and investment has contributed to rising average living standards in the United States.
Further trade liberalization, particularly in services, could bring even larger
gains to American consumers, firms, and workers. Advancing free and fair
trade in multilateral, regional, and bilateral negotiations will help to ensure
that America continues to derive benefits from international trade. This
includes renewal of the Trade Promotion Authority and a successful outcome
of current global trade talks, the World Trade Organization’s Doha
Development Agenda negotiations.
Both inward and outward FDI have contributed to higher levels of productivity in the United States. Inward FDI contributes to productivity growth,
provides a source of financing for the current account deficit, and generates
high-paying jobs for American workers. Outward FDI is an important
channel of market access for U.S. multinational companies. U.S. multinationals are an important force behind job creation in the United States and
have contributed to productivity growth and rising average living standards in
the U.S. economy.
In order to continue to derive important economic benefits from global
economic engagement, the United States must continue to break down
barriers to trade and investment abroad, and keep our markets open to
international trade and secure protections for foreign investors.

Immigration

I

mmigrants play a vital role in the dynamic U.S. economy. Understanding
the forces that drive immigration can help us design more effective immigration policies. This chapter discusses the economics of immigration; the
incentive effects of immigration policies on migrants, native workers, and
employers; and the benefits of comprehensive immigration policy reform.
The United States is a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws, and we
value both historical legacies. Although immigrants continue to make positive
contributions to our nation and our economy, our current immigration laws
have proven difficult to enforce and are not fully serving the needs of the
American economy. It is unofficially estimated that between 11 and 12
million foreign-born persons reside in the United States illegally, almost onethird of the total foreign-born population and about four percent of the total
U.S. population.
Effective immigration policy can curtail illegal immigration and at the same
time promote America’s national and economic interests. Comprehensive
immigration policy reform, which combines more effective enforcement
capabilities and a temporary worker program, is the most promising route to
an immigration system that is legally functional, security conscious, economically beneficial, and humane. In this comprehensive approach, the various
elements of policy reform reinforce and enhance one another. In contrast, any
given partial reform, standing alone and without the reinforcing measures
that characterize the comprehensive approach, cannot fully address the
problems and engage the opportunities that accompany immigration.
The key points of this chapter are:
• International differences in economic opportunities and standards of
living create strong incentives for labor migration. Once established,
migration flows from a certain region tend to be self-perpetuating
because past migrants facilitate the movement of new migrants,
employers become familiar with the migrant group, and U.S. immigration policy favors family reunification. A large supply of potential
migrants will exist for decades to come.
• Foreign-born workers make significant contributions to the American
economy, but not all Americans gain economically from immigration.
Understanding the labor-market effects of immigration requires consideration of the migrants’ skill mix and the capital-accumulation response
to labor force growth. Foreign-born workers tend to be concentrated at

189

the low end and the high end of the educational spectrum relative to
native-born workers.
• Immigration policy plays a key role in determining the volume and
composition of the foreign-born workforce. Comprehensive immigration reform can help ensure an orderly, lawful flow of foreign-born
workers whose presence benefits the American economy.

The Economics of Immigration
International migration patterns are strongly influenced by the interaction
of economic forces and public policy. In this sense migration is similar to
other aspects of international economic integration and exchange, such as
trade in goods and services and investment flows. The fundamental motivation for such movement—whether of goods, capital, or workers—is that
people perceive more profitable economic opportunities abroad. The ultimate
results are that the world’s economy functions more efficiently, entrepreneurship is rewarded, and many Americans reap economic gains.
Compared to barriers to the movement of goods, policy restrictions on the
international movement of labor are tight. Immigration policy determines the
volume and composition of both permanent immigrants and temporary
workers legally admitted to the United States. But many more people would
like to come to the United States than are legally permitted to do so, and
millions manage to reside and work here illegally. There is broad agreement
among U.S. citizens that immigration policy needs to be reformed. To this
end, the reform of U.S. immigration policy should be based on an understanding of the forces that drive migration, relevant lessons from American
immigration history, and the ways in which immigration affects the economy.
This chapter highlights some facts and principles that can help guide the
design of a better immigration policy.

The Migration Decision and the Volume of
International Migration
Economic analyses of migration typically start by imagining an individual
who has many choices about where to live and work at various times in his
life. If this person perceives that job opportunities and living conditions are
approximately the same everywhere, then he will not have an economic
motive to choose one place over another. More realistically, because migration
costs time and money and often requires leaving behind one’s friends and
family and adjusting to a new culture and language, our imaginary individual
will be strongly inclined to live and work near his original home. On the other
190 | Economic Report of the President

hand, if the same person perceives that incomes and living conditions differ
significantly across places for workers with similar skills, then he might find
it worthwhile to incur the costs of migration to secure a higher standard of
living. In this sense, migration is like an investment decision—a cost is borne
today in return for an increased flow of income and well-being in the future.
Essentially, the potential migrant must decide whether the expected benefits
from migration outweigh the expected costs.
From the perspective of workers in many countries today, the potential
income gains from migration are large. One study measured average wages for
Mexican-born men who had recently moved to the United States and
compared them to the wages of similar men who were still working in
Mexico. The real wage ratios (that is, wages adjusted for international differences in prices) ranged from about 6-to-1 to 2-to-1 in favor of the U.S.-based
workers, depending on the age and education group. For example, in 2000
those who were 18 to 22 years old with 5 to 8 years of education earned $7.60
per hour in the United States compared to the equivalent of $1.56 per hour
in Mexico. Another study compared the earnings of fast-food restaurant
workers who performed nearly identical jobs but in different countries. Again,
the real wages in the United States were much higher than in several less
advanced economies.
Facing such large international wage differences, a worker might hope to
move abroad permanently or with the expectation of returning home after
accumulating a nest egg. Indeed, migrants often work intensively at relatively
high wages (compared to home) and save or send back home a portion of
their earnings. In this scenario the opportunity to work abroad temporarily
can help finance large purchases or investments (like a house, car, or new business) in home countries where credit markets are underdeveloped and where
wealth accumulation is difficult due to low wages. Migration might also allow
households to expand and diversify their income sources, thereby serving as a
lifeline to a higher and more stable income level for family members who
remain based in a less-developed economy. The large volume of international
remittances of migrants’ earnings testifies to the strength of the links that
migrants maintain with their home country. A recent study estimated that
U.S.-based workers from Latin America sent home $45 billion in remittances
in 2006, about 10 percent of their total earnings. Nearly three quarters of the
migrants in the survey remitted some portion of their earnings.
The decision framework described thus far emphasizes a potential migrant’s
expectations regarding the future stream of income at home compared to that
available abroad, after accounting for broadly defined migration costs
(including transportation costs, time spent out of work, difficulties adjusting
to a new culture and labor market, and perhaps fees paid to “coyotes” or other
smugglers who facilitate illegal migration). But these are not the only

Chapter 9

| 191

determinants of the migration decision. A potential migrant might consider
the risk of unemployment, uncertainties associated with illegal status, and
other sources of income variability in different locations. The migrant might
also consider factors that are not narrowly economic but that certainly would
count as “benefits from migration,” such as family reunification or safety
from religious or political persecution.
Even if the incentives to migrate are strong, however, the economic costs of
migration might be impossible for poor workers to meet by saving or
borrowing. Moreover, immigration policies often make it difficult for workers
to relocate to high-wage countries, especially if they are not highly skilled or
closely related to someone in the high-wage country who can sponsor their
application for admission. In this sense, immigration policy acts as a filter
that selectively allows some workers to migrate but also deters many
potential migrants.
This simplified model of an individual’s migration decision is a useful
starting point for understanding the economic pressures for labor to move
internationally. To make sense of the overall volume and composition of immigration, we must expand our scope to consider the sum of many individuals’
migration decisions and the role of immigration policy. Within any given
country, some inhabitants might perceive promising economic opportunities
abroad whereas others do not; some might have sufficient means to finance the
move whereas others do not; and some might have family connections or skills
that make it easy for them to relocate legally whereas others do not. Against
this backdrop, events (such as economic or political crises) that widen international gaps in expected well-being or that lower the costs of international
movement will tend to amplify the volume of international migration because
a higher proportion of any given population will find it optimal or feasible to
relocate. Working in the other direction, events that narrow gaps in expected
well-being and policies that make it more difficult for people to relocate will
tend to dampen the volume of international mobility.
The immigration pressures felt by virtually all high-income countries today
reflect the ongoing tension between declining costs of migration and
persistent international differences in material standards of living, on one
hand, and policy responses that seek to manage the inflow of foreign-born
persons, on the other. In this context, the flow of legal migration is determined by selective immigration policies. In the United States, these policies
facilitate permanent immigration for family reunification and, to a lesser
degree, for those with high levels of skill. For other workers, legal channels for
migration are narrow while the economic incentives, underpinned by labor
demand from U.S. employers and consumers, remain strong. Consequently,
many seek employment through illegal channels.

192 | Economic Report of the President

Lessons from American Immigration History
The surge of immigration in recent decades is not unprecedented, and we
can better understand the economics of immigration by examining the current
situation in light of historical experience. In the decades after the
Revolutionary War, migration to the United States was hindered by the high
costs of international transport, the relative immobility and poverty of agrarian
populations in potential emigrating regions, and political disruptions to international economic integration. By the 1840s, however, economic,
technological, and political conditions had combined to launch the first era of
voluntary mass migration. The first big waves of U.S.-bound migration originated in northwest Europe, but by the end of the nineteenth century migrants
from eastern and southern Europe dominated the immigration flow. The
foreign-born proportion of the U.S. population increased from 9.7 percent in
1850 (the earliest census to record place of birth) to 14.4 percent in 1870, and
it hovered around 14 percent until 1910 when it began to decline steadily. In
recent decades it has risen again, and in 2005 the foreign-born proportion of
the population reached approximately 12.4 percent.
The mass migration of labor between 1840 and 1914, along with extensive
trade in goods and capital mobility, contributed to a high degree of global
economic integration that in many ways was a precursor to our more recent
and familiar era of globalization. World War I abruptly curtailed the earlier era
of globalization, and the political and economic turbulence of subsequent
decades further disintegrated the international economy. Since World War II,
policymakers have worked toward re-integrating the global flow of goods, services, and capital. However, in comparison with the pre-1914 era, significant
policy restrictions on the international movement of labor remain in place.
Four historical lessons are especially relevant for contemporary thinking
about American immigration and the policies that manage the inflow of
foreign-born workers. First, migration to the United States has always reflected
the relatively high level of labor productivity here. In the previous section, we
cited the wage gap between the United States and Mexico. Similarly, estimates
of real wage gaps in the late nineteenth century suggest that U.S. wages were
often 1.5 to 4 times higher than those available in Europe. Thus, immigration
is a sign of our economy’s ongoing success and the relatively high rewards that
it has long offered its workers. While immigration policy reform is surely
necessary, we should be glad that after more than 200 years the United States
is still a magnet for ambitious foreign workers.
Second, immigration flows are often self-propagating. From the perspective
of a potential migrant, the cost of migration drops sharply when one has a
number of friends and family abroad who can help locate employment and
housing opportunities and who can provide a sense of community. One

Chapter 9

| 193

consequence of this self-propagating mechanism is that macroeconomic and
political shocks can have long-lasting ramifications for American immigration
patterns. The Irish famine in the late 1840s is a salient example of how a dire
economic situation abroad accelerated a process of mass migration that
continued long after famine conditions had passed. Macroeconomic shocks in
Mexico in recent decades, though far less severe than the Irish famine, may
have had a similar effect. Durable networks of family, friends, and employers
have always facilitated migration, especially given current policy preferences
for family reunification.
The third historical lesson is that regions of emigration that are in the
process of economic modernization and development often send out an
increasing number of workers. Migration has always been a costly enterprise
that the very poor cannot easily finance. As the process of modern economic
development unfolds, a larger number of workers surpass the necessary
threshold of wealth and education for long-distance migration; employment
declines in the agricultural sector and young workers seek employment in
urban areas at home and abroad; and stronger migrant networks and financial systems develop to facilitate long-distance movement. Along these lines,
it has been argued that the spread of economic modernization in Mexico has
promoted emigration even as it has raised gross domestic product (GDP) per
worker. The ongoing process of economic development in many parts of the
world may lead to a growing pool of potential international migrants for
decades to come.
Eventually, at advanced stages of economic development when domestic
wages rise to levels that are comparable to those that are available elsewhere,
the rate of emigration from a particular place tends to decline. The long-run
experience of parts of Europe that were massive exporters of labor in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries exemplifies this pattern of rising and
then falling emigration rates. Thus, a secondary point is that the pool of
potential migrants may change substantially as some countries enter into the
process of economic modernization and as others reach comparatively high
levels of economic development.
Fourth, the demographic structure of regions of emigration is relevant to
the volume of international migration. Migrants to the United States have
generally been drawn from the pool of relatively young workers. In 2005, for
example, foreign-born persons who reported being in the United States for
only one year (recent migrants) had a median age of 25, whereas the median
age of native-born persons was 35. The young have the most to gain from
migration, and they also have fewer ties binding them to a specific location in
the home country. Relatively large groups of workers came of age in Mexico
in the 1980s and 1990s, and emigration surged when the Mexican macroeconomy stumbled. Reinforcing the point made above, the sheer number of
194 | Economic Report of the President

young people in less advanced economies ensures that many foreign workers
will be interested in migration opportunities in the future.
In sum, past experience and current economic and demographic realities
suggest that the forces that attract migrants to the United States will continue
to be strong in the twenty-first century. Managing the inflow of migrants is
an important and complex challenge for policymakers. It demands a comprehensive immigration strategy that views the process for what it is and has
always been for the United States—a significant contributor to labor force
growth and vitality.

Foreign-Born Workers in the U.S. Labor Force
Foreign-born workers (the sum of both legal and illegal migrants) make up
15 percent of the total U.S. labor force, and since 1996 they have accounted
for about half of the total growth in the labor force, thereby fueling macroeconomic growth. In 2005, foreign-born men had higher labor force participation
rates than natives (81 percent compared to 72 percent), whereas foreign-born
women worked somewhat less than their American counterparts (54 percent
compared to 60 percent). Among those in the labor force, foreign-born men
had lower unemployment rates than natives (4.1 percent compared to
5.3 percent), whereas foreign-born women had slightly higher unemployment
rates than native women (5.4 percent compared to 5.0 percent).
At the high end of the skill spectrum, foreign-born workers were more likely
than natives to work in computer, mathematics, architecture, engineering, and
science occupations (6.5 percent of foreign born compared to 5.0 percent of
natives). Lower in the skill spectrum, the foreign born were two to four times
as likely as the native born to work in building and grounds cleaning and
maintenance; farming, fishing and forestry; and construction and extraction
occupations.
Tables 9-1 and 9-2 report more detailed occupational information for the
foreign born. Table 9-1 lists the ten occupations that the foreign born are most
likely to fill. For comparison, it also reports the proportion of native-born
workers in the same set of occupations. Construction laborers, maids and
housekeepers, janitors, and cooks are at the top of the foreign-born occupation
list. Together these four occupational categories account for 11 percent of all
foreign-born workers compared to about 4 percent of native-born workers.
Table 9-2 lists the occupations that have the highest proportion of workers who
are foreign born. Tailors and dressmakers, graders and sorters of agricultural
products, miscellaneous personal appearance workers (such as manicurists), and
plasterers and stucco masons are the occupations with the highest proportions
of foreign-born workers, all with over 50 percent. The foreign born are also
strongly represented among medical scientists (46 percent).

In recent decades, a handful of states have absorbed the majority of foreignborn persons. In 2005, California, New York, Texas, and Florida together
accounted for 57 percent of all the foreign born in the United States. The
same states accounted for only 29 percent of the native-born U.S. population.
These states still attract a large share of the foreign born, as one would expect
given the importance of family and information networks in facilitating
migration, but there is also evidence of significant gains in many other parts
of the country. Georgia, for instance, gained more than 200,000 foreign-born
persons between 2000 and 2005, raising its total foreign-born population by
38 percent. Several other states had comparable percentage increases, though
smaller gains in absolute numbers. The largest percentage changes were in
New Hampshire (51 percent) and South Carolina (50 percent). These
geographic shifts reflect foreign-born workers’ responsiveness to changes in
labor demand across regions within the United States.

The Foreign-Born Skill Mix and the Labor Market
Impact
The inflow of foreign-born labor has complex effects on the productivity
and earnings of American factors of production—capital, land, and labor. To
understand how immigration affects the labor market, it helps to consider the
determinants of the skill mix among the foreign born and the nature of substitutability among different factors of production.
American immigration policy acts as a filter that strongly favors potential
migrants with family connections to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. In 2004, 946,142 persons were granted lawful permanent resident
status. Forty-three percent were admitted as immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and an additional 23 percent were admitted under other family-based
sponsorship. Only 16 percent were admitted under the employment-based
preference category.
To some extent, this policy structure helps explain observed differences in
the economic performance of immigrants from different countries. Most
permanently admitted Mexican immigrants, for example, were selected on the
basis of family connections rather than skills. Therefore, it is not surprising
that as a group they do not fare as well economically as groups of migrants
who were selected largely on the basis of their skills, such as those from India.
Out of the employment-based permanent admissions category, only
10,000 lawful permanent resident slots are reserved for less-skilled workers.
For less-skilled seasonal workers, H-2A visas (for agriculture) and H-2B visas
(for other sectors) admit workers for short durations and specific jobs. These
visas help alleviate peak seasonal demands, but there is still demand for lessskilled workers to work for longer durations. In an environment in which
unauthorized migrants can find employers without great difficulty, the
mismatch between labor market forces and immigration policy has resulted in
a large number of unauthorized migrant workers.
Standard surveys, such as the Current Population Survey, do not specifically
identify the legal status of the foreign born. Therefore, it is difficult to
measure and characterize the unauthorized population with precision. With
this caveat in mind, Box 9-1 discusses current estimates of the illegal
population’s size and economic characteristics.
H-1B visas permit temporary employment for skilled professionals who are
sponsored by a U.S. employer, typically in occupations in science, computers,
or engineering. The worker can remain in H-1B status for up to six years.
Current law permits only 65,000 new H-1B issuances per year, with some
exceptions for those with advanced degrees from U.S. universities and those
going to work for institutions of higher education or government research
organizations. For fiscal year 2007, the H-1B application cap was reached in
May 2006.
Chapter 9

Box 9-1: The Number and Characteristics of Unauthorized
Migrants
Due to the clandestine nature of illegal migration, the unauthorized
foreign-born population cannot be precisely enumerated. Nonetheless,
reasonable estimates have been made using data from the Census
Bureau’s Current Population Survey (CPS). The CPS data do not explicitly identify unauthorized individuals, but they do record a great deal of
relevant information. Using an estimate of the number of legal foreignborn residents that is based on official U.S. immigration data, the total
number of illegal migrants can then be estimated as the difference
between the total foreign-born population and the number of foreignborn estimated to be present legally. In 2006, a study estimated that
there were between 11 and 12 million unauthorized migrants residing in
the United States, accounting for approximately 30 percent of the total
foreign-born population. A related study estimated that between one
third and one half of the unauthorized migrants entered the country
legally but then overstayed their visas.
To provide more detailed characterizations, the study used statistical
techniques to select a certain number of potentially unauthorized
foreign-born residents from the March 2005 CPS. Keep in mind that the
following conclusions are unofficial estimates. They are subject to error,
but are also the best current characterization of the illegal population.
It appears that the labor force participation and occupational choices
of unauthorized migrants differ substantially from that of the general
U.S. population. Unauthorized adult males (ages 18 to 64) were more
likely to participate in the labor force than their native counterparts (94
percent participation rate compared to 83 percent for natives).
Unauthorized adult females were less likely than natives to participate in
the labor force (54 percent participation rate compared to 72 percent for
natives). In this case, the difference partly reflects the migrant women’s
higher likelihood of having young children in the household.
In general, unauthorized migrants were concentrated in jobs that
require comparatively little formal education. Thus, they are under-represented relative to natives in “white collar” jobs in management, business,
and professional occupations, and in sales and administrative support
occupations. Relative to native-born workers, unauthorized migrants were
highly concentrated in other service jobs (31 percent compared to 16);
construction and extraction (19 percent compared to 6); production, installation, and repair (15 percent compared to 10); and farming (4 percent
compared to 0.5). Although unauthorized migrants represented just 4.9
percent of the total U.S. labor force in 2005, they represented large
proportions of the workforce in several specific occupations: 24 percent in

198 | Economic Report of the President

farming occupations, 17 percent in cleaning occupations, 14 percent in
construction, and 12 percent in food preparation.
Approximately 40 percent of the unauthorized migrants had been in
the country for five years or less. The vast majority of unauthorized
migrants had come from Mexico (56 percent, or 6.2 million) and elsewhere in Latin America (22 percent, or 2.5 million).
Nearly half (5.4 million) of the unauthorized migrants were adult
males, with a little less than half (2.4 million) of the adult males residing
without a spouse or children. Adult females accounted for 35 percent
(3.9 million) of the unauthorized migrants, and less than one-fifth of the
women were residing without a spouse or children. Approximately 1.8
million children accounted for the remainder of the unauthorized population. In addition, approximately 3.1 million U.S.-born citizen children
were living in households where the head or the head’s spouse was an
unauthorized migrant.

The interaction of migrant supply, labor demand, and policy structure
results in a foreign-born skill mix that is described in Chart 9-1 (for all foreign
born, age 25 and above). Educational attainment is only one component of
productive capability and it does not fully capture ambition, reliability, or
knowledge of a specific trade or language. Nonetheless, many jobs have strict
educational requirements, and economists frequently study the labor market
in terms of educational categories. The height of each bar in Chart 9-1 represents the number of foreign born from each region (age 25 and above).
Clearly, Latin America supplies more migrants than any other region, and
many from Latin America have less than a high school degree.
Foreign-born workers are found disproportionately at the extremes of the
educational spectrum. The educational mix of foreign-born workers relative
to native-born workers is shown in Chart 9-2. It differs from Chart 9-1 in
that it pertains to all employed workers over age 15, it groups all foreign-born
workers together, and it has more detailed information about the top end of
the educational scale. The first bar indicates that 15 percent of all workers in
the United States in 2005 were foreign born. The foreign born were heavily
over-represented in the group of workers with less than a high school degree;
they were slightly under-represented among workers with only a high school
degree, those with some college, and those with only BA degrees; and they
were over-represented among workers with advanced degrees, especially
among those with Ph.D. degrees who worked in scientific and technological
fields. All together, and remarkably, over 40 percent of Ph.D. workers in
computer, mathematical, architectural, engineering, and science occupations
were born outside the United States.
Chapter 9

200 | Economic Report of the President

Highly skilled migrants make many economic contributions to the United
States, and a strong case can be made that policy should accommodate more
of them. Skilled migrants, whether permanent or temporary, enrich our scientific and academic communities, boost the technical capabilities of U.S. firms
(and the native-born workers employed there), augment the supply of healthcare providers, and pay far more in taxes than they absorb in government
services. Many of these workers were educated at American universities, and
nearly all adjust easily to life in the United States in terms of language skills
and employment. They make major innovative contributions in science,
medicine, and engineering, and help keep the United States at the forefront
of technological capability. For example, between 1901 and 2005 approximately one third of U.S. Nobel Prize winners in medicine and physiology
were born abroad.
Because the foreign born, as a group, do not have the same mix of skills as
U.S. natives, they alter the relative supply of different types of labor in the
economy. The extent to which this alteration of labor supply influences
natives’ wages depends in large part on whether the foreign born are complements or substitutes for natives in the labor market. When two inputs closely
resemble one another, they are likely to be substitutes, and an increase in the
supply of one will lower the earnings of the other. In some cases, however,
inputs are likely to be complements, and an increase in the supply of one will
raise the productivity and, therefore, the earnings of the other. For example,
construction laborers may be complements to skilled craftsmen because additional laborers may raise craftsmen’s productivity. Conversely, new
construction laborers may be close substitutes for other construction laborers
and for similar less-skilled workers, and so additional construction laborers
would tend to make the services of less-skilled laborers less valuable on the
labor market.
The impact of immigration on the labor market also depends on how other
factors of production, such as capital, respond to the change in labor supply
associated with immigration. In particular, in the short run an increase in the
supply of labor puts downward pressure on wages, allows more hiring, and
raises the productivity of capital. This increase in capital productivity, in turn,
induces firms to invest in more physical capital which ultimately makes labor
more productive. Thus, over time the capital accumulation response to immigration tends to offset the downward pressure on wages caused by an increase
in the labor supply. The key point is that in trying to understand the effect of
immigration on labor markets it does not make sense to suppose that all the
other factors that influence labor markets remain the same over a long period
of time; rather, these other factors adjust to immigration in important ways.
Economists have produced many data-intensive analyses of the response of
native-born workers’ wages to immigration, and the debate is still ongoing. To

Chapter 9

| 201

some extent the estimates depend on the methodological approach that is
used to isolate the effects of immigration. One recent study concluded that
immigration between 1990 and 2004 slightly raised the wages of most nativeborn workers but slightly lowered the wages of those without high school
degrees (who represent about 10 percent of the native-born labor force). If
this finding is correct, then excluding foreign-born workers might give a small
boost to the earnings of American high-school dropouts. But such a policy
would be costly and counterproductive from the perspective of American
consumers, businesses, and most native-born workers. Moreover, such a
policy would not be a well-targeted or effective way to assist low-income
Americans. The economic challenges facing low-income Americans are a
serious concern, but sharp restrictions on immigration are not the remedy.
A better policy is to ensure that all Americans have opportunities to acquire
skills that will improve their labor market outcomes.

Comprehensive Immigration Policy Reform
Border security is a fundamental responsibility of a sovereign nation and an
urgent requirement for our national security. Since 2001, funding for border
security has more than doubled, from $4.6 billion in fiscal year 2001 to $10.4
billion in fiscal year 2007. We will have increased the number of Border Patrol
agents by 63 percent, from 9,000 at the beginning of this Administration to
nearly 15,000 at the end of fiscal year 2007, and we have deployed about
6,000 National Guard troops to assist our border security efforts at the
southern border. We have also added 6,700 new detention beds, for a total of
27,500, and have been able to effectively end the practice of “catch and
release” of illegal aliens apprehended at the border. The heightened efforts to
control entry into the United States are one part of a larger strategy to
improve the immigration system while bolstering national security.
The President believes that the best way to fix immigration policy is to
adopt a comprehensive program that combines stronger border security, more
effective worksite enforcement of employment eligibility laws, and expanded
legal channels for the employment of foreign-born workers, including those
who are not highly skilled. The comprehensive program would reduce the
number of illegal workers and preserve the economic benefits associated with
a flexible supply of hardworking foreign-born workers. The key features of
comprehensive immigration policy reform would work together and reinforce
one another to strengthen the incentives for both workers and employers to
comply with immigration and employment laws.

202 | Economic Report of the President

A Legal Bridge between Employer Demand and
Migrant Supply
By improving the technology that firms use to verify new workers’
employment eligibility and expanding the channels for legal, temporary
migration by less-skilled workers, comprehensive immigration policy reform
can dramatically reduce incentives for illegal work. Effectively narrowing
employment opportunities for illegal workers must be the keystone of immigration policy reform. Unfortunately, at present, it is often difficult for
employers to verify the employment eligibility of migrant workers, some of
whom have fraudulent documents or engage in identity theft. And as long as
some firms employ illegal workers, other firms might do the same to compete
on the basis of cost. The current situation with millions of illegal workers and
many non-compliant employers is both unacceptable and unnecessary.
Comprehensive immigration reform should aim to establish an environment in which all employers can easily determine the legal status of newly
hired workers, in which foreign-born workers can easily prove their identity
and legal status, and in which firms can legally hire a foreign worker when no
American worker is available to fill a given job. This reform requires an electronic employment eligibility verification system that is accurate, fast, and
inexpensive. The Department of Homeland Security continues to refine and
expand an internet-based system called the Basic Pilot Program that allows
participating employers to verify the employment eligibility of their new hires
by checking against Social Security Administration and immigration records.
In addition, to curtail the use of fraudulent identity documents, the
Department of Homeland Security now issues tamper-resistant, biometrically
enhanced (with photograph and finger print) identity documents to most
lawfully present foreign-born workers.
Employers also must be held accountable if they hire illegal workers. A
rigorous system of verification checks in combination with strong enforcement
and enhanced penalties can effectively promote compliance. In this regard, the
new policy would remedy the comparatively lax enforcement of immigration
law that followed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.
Electronic verification of new hires’ eligibility, tamper-resistant and
biometric identification cards for foreign-born workers, and stronger interior
enforcement measures should be complemented by the establishment of a
temporary worker program, initially proposed by the President on January 7,
2004. A temporary worker program would provide a legal channel for a
foreign-born worker to enter the United States for a specific period of time,
provided that the worker maintains a consistent work record, does not break
the law, and follows the rules of the program. In addition, under certain
conditions, some currently undocumented workers would be eligible to work
here legally if they pay a substantial penalty for having violated the law. As
Chapter 9

| 203

long as the costs for program participation are kept low, enforcement is
robust, and the number of workers allowed to participate is sufficient,
migrants and employers will choose this legal channel for finding matches
rather than resorting to illegal means.
A temporary worker program should also endeavor to preserve the flexible
role that foreign-born workers play in the American economy. Foreign-born
workers are responsive to new economic opportunities and to variation in
opportunities over time and space. This responsiveness tends to improve labor
market efficiency and overall economic productivity. Administrative requirements that are burdensome for firms, migrants, or government agencies will
raise the program’s economic costs and, depending on the program’s structure,
result in either non-compliance with the new policy or a significant drain on
government resources.
Finally, comprehensive immigration reform must ensure that highly-skilled
immigrants are welcome to make contributions to the U.S. economy. For
example, many of the world’s best students come to American universities for
advanced training in science and technology, and a large share of these
students would like to stay and work in the United States after finishing their
education. As discussed earlier in the chapter, their work helps keep the
United States at the frontier of research and development, and their postschooling employment depends upon their ability to acquire a temporary
work visa or permanent resident status.

The Pitfalls of Partial Policy Reforms
Less-skilled workers are infrequently admitted to the United States unless
they have a close relative who is already an American citizen or lawful permanent resident, or they are coming for a short-term, seasonal job. At the same
time, America has a strong demand for the products and services that lessskilled workers provide and a declining number of less-skilled domestic-born
workers to provide them. This combination acts as a powerful magnet for lessskilled foreign workers. While there is no excuse for breaking immigration
and employment laws, the underlying economic forces that draw immigrants
to the United States are powerful and deeply rooted. Comprehensive immigration reform can put the United States on a firm legal and economic footing
to manage twenty-first century immigration, whereas partial reforms are
likely to entail significant costs without yielding satisfactory results.
A policy that relies on more extensive border fencing or more intensive
border patrols will make it more difficult for migrants to cross the border illegally. This is an important step in improving control over our borders. By
itself, however, this approach will not undercut the existing demand from
U.S. employers and consumers for the labor services of foreign-born workers.
Therefore, it seems likely that in response to this partial reform the flow of
204 | Economic Report of the President

migrants would change its path rather than dry up completely. Building
fences, for example, does not address the problem of lawful entrants overstaying their visas and working without permission, and according to a recent
study, between one third and one half of all unauthorized migrants in the U.S.
entered the country legally. Thus, even with substantial increases in border
patrol resources and increases in the cost of “coyote” services (guides who lead
illegal migrants across the southern border), the best efforts of our Border
Patrol have not fully stemmed the tide of illegal immigration. Pursuing intensive fencing and patrolling approaches to extremes would be inordinately
costly in terms of material and manpower, and still it would not achieve the
goal of greatly reducing the employment of illegal workers.
A partial policy reform that targets current employers of illegal migrants
might lower the demand for illegal workers, make it more difficult for illegal
migrants to find work, and therefore lessen the illegal inflow. But if the supply
of authorized foreign-born workers is not simultaneously augmented through
a temporary worker program, this approach would hurt many American
companies and consumers and, as discussed above, would hurt complementary American workers. It would also slow the growth of the labor force and
the overall economy.
Alternatively, a partial policy reform that focuses primarily on detecting,
apprehending, and removing illegal workers who are already present in the
United States might reduce migrants’ desire to live and work here, but would
be very costly to carry out. Moreover, fundamental economic forces would
still drive many foreign workers to try their luck in America, illegally if necessary. The likely outcome of such partial reform is that there would still be
many illegal workers and, more than ever, they would be unwilling to
communicate with local law enforcement officials, prone to work in the
underground economy, and subject to exploitation by criminals, smugglers,
and unscrupulous employers.
Unlike partial reforms, the President’s comprehensive approach can succeed
because it combines a number of elements that reinforce one another. This
comprehensive approach gives employers access to a source of legal foreignborn workers when they cannot find Americans to fill jobs, gives them better
tools to verify the employment eligibility of persons they hire, and strongly
punishes non-compliance with enhanced civil and criminal penalties. This
approach also provides potential temporary migrants a more expansive legal
route to employment in the United States that does not depend so heavily on
having high levels of education and skills or on having relatives in the United
States to sponsor them. It also makes illegal border crossing more difficult to
accomplish and makes unauthorized employment more difficult to find. By
simultaneously narrowing illegal channels for migration and employment and
widening legal channels, the comprehensive approach to immigration policy
reform can significantly improve upon the current system.
Chapter 9

| 205

Conclusion
Immigrants make important contributions to the American economy. They
help the economy grow by adding to the labor force; they fill in jobs at the
lower end of the skill distribution where relatively few native-born Americans
are available to work; they also fill in jobs at the highest end of the skill distribution and help keep the United States at the forefront of technological and
medical innovation; they respond quickly and flexibly to shifts in labor
demand; and they work hard to make better lives for themselves and their
children. Immigration is both a reflection of and a contributor to our
economy’s prosperity.
The foreign-born proportion of the population has steadily increased in
recent decades, and now stands at about 12 percent of the total U.S. population. Over the same period, the U.S. economy has performed well in
comparison with other advanced economies. Still the large number of unauthorized workers has made it clear that our current immigration policy is
inadequate. At the same time, the economic forces that drive international
migration are as strong as ever and will remain so for the foreseeable future.
Comprehensive immigration policy reform can improve border security,
significantly reduce the number of illegal workers, and yield economic benefits for employers, workers, and consumers in the United States. Achieving
these policy goals requires better interior enforcement which, in turn, requires
better tools for employers to verify worker eligibility. It also requires the
creation of better legal channels for the migration of hard-working foreignborn workers who are eager to fill jobs that contribute to the American
economy. Such workers tend to enhance the productivity of American factors
of production, but they currently have few avenues, aside from family reunification, to gain legal entry and employment for a sustained period of time.
By mutually reinforcing one another, the various components of comprehensive immigration policy reform can support a legally and economically viable
immigration system.

Report to the President on the
Activities of the Council of Economic
Advisers During 2006
The Council of Economic Advisers was established by the Employment Act
of 1946 to provide the President with objective economic analysis and advice
on the development and implementation of a wide range of domestic and
international economic policy issues.

The Chairman of the Council
Edward P. Lazear was appointed by the President on February 24, 2006 as
Chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers. Dr. Lazear
succeeded Ben S. Bernanke, who was appointed by the President as Chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board on February 1, 2006.
Dr. Lazear is on a leave of absence from the Stanford Graduate School of
Business where he is the Jack Steele Parker Professor of Human Resources
Management and Economics. He also serves as the Morris Arnold Cox Senior
Fellow at the Hoover Institution.
Dr. Lazear is responsible for communicating the Council’s views on
economic matters directly to the President through personal discussions and
written reports. He represents the Council at daily White House senior staff
meetings, a variety of inter-agency meetings, Cabinet meetings, and other
formal and informal meetings with the President. He also travels within the
United States and overseas to present the Administration’s views on the
economy. Dr. Lazear is the Council's chief public spokesperson. He directs the
work of the Council and exercises ultimate responsibility for the work of the
professional staff.

The Members of the Council
Katherine Baicker and Matthew J. Slaughter are Members of the Council of
Economic Advisers. Dr. Baicker is on leave from the University of California
in Los Angeles, where she is an Associate Professor in the Department of
Public Policy. She also served as a Faculty Research Fellow for the National
Bureau of Economic Research. At the Council, Dr. Baicker’s responsibilities
include work on public finance, labor, and health issues.

Dr. Slaughter is on leave from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth
College where he is an Associate Professor of Business Administration. He also
serves as a visiting Fellow at the Institute for International Economics and has
served as a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Dr. Slaughter’s responsibilities at the Council include work on international
finance and trade, and industrial organization issues.

Macroeconomic Policies
As is its tradition, the Council devoted much time during 2006 to assisting
the President in formulating economic policy objectives and designing
programs to implement them. In this regard the Chairman kept the President
informed, on a continuing basis, of important macroeconomic developments
and other major policy issues through regular macroeconomic briefings. The
Council prepares for the President, the Vice President, and the White House
senior staff regular memoranda that report key economic data and analyze
current economic events. Council staff also regularly provides assistance with
economic data to other offices of the Executive Office of the President.
The Council, the Department of the Treasury, and the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB)—the Administration’s economic “troika”—
are responsible for producing the economic forecasts that underlie the
Administration’s budget proposals. The Council, under the leadership of the
Chairman and the Chief Economist, initiates the forecasting process twice
each year. In preparing these forecasts, the Council consults with a variety of
outside sources, including leading private sector forecasters.
In 2006, the Council took part in discussions on a range of macroeconomic
issues. The Council contributed significantly to discussions of the macroeconomic impact of unexpected oil supply shocks, the effects of a potential
pandemic flu, and proposed mitigation plans.
The Council works closely with the Department of the Treasury, the Federal
Reserve, and other government agencies in providing analyses to the
Administration on these topics of concern. It also works closely with the
National Economic Council, the Office of Management and Budget, and
other offices within the Executive Office of the President in assessing the
economy and economic policy proposals.

International Economic Policies
The Council was involved in a range of international trade and finance
issues, and was an active participant in discussions at the global, regional,
and bilateral levels. On the international trade front, the Council provided

214 | Economic Report of the President

empirical analysis of forthcoming free trade agreements and the recently
released top-to-bottom review of U.S.-China bilateral economic relations
spearheaded by the United States Trade Representative. Staff also conducted a
landmark study exploring the prevalence and effects of non-tariff barriers in
conjunction with the Department of Commerce.
Further involvement included extensive analysis and participation in
deliberations related to the U.S. economic interaction with China. The
Council participated in the inaugural U.S. Treasury-led Strategic Economic
Dialogue in Beijing where a host of bilateral economic issues with China were
discussed, ranging from financial liberalization, to energy and the environment, to bilateral trade relations.
The Council participated in the development of U.S. proposals for securing
global energy security and combating the spread of pandemic disease at this
year’s G8 Summit held in St. Petersburg, Russia. The Council also prepared
in-depth analyses for the President’s international itinerary, including the
annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, and travel to
Europe, India, and Mexico. The Council participated in discussions
concerning the need for greater international financial and trade liberalization
with both advanced and emerging market economies. Council members regularly met with representatives of the Council’s counterpart agencies in foreign
countries, as well as with finance ministers, other government officials, and
members of the private sector.
The Council is a leading participant in the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), the principal forum for economic
cooperation among the high-income industrial economies. Chairman Lazear
and Dr. Slaughter participated in meetings of the OECD’s Economic Policy
Committee (EPC), as well as meetings of the OECD’s Working Party 3 on
macroeconomic policy and coordination.

Microeconomic Policies
A wide variety of microeconomic issues received Council attention during
2006. The Council actively participated in the Cabinet-level National
Economic Council and Domestic Policy Council, dealing with issues
including health care, labor issues, energy policy, legal reform, the environment, homeland security, education, pensions, transportation, and technology
among others.
The Council was involved in a plethora of discussions related to health care.
These included examination and policy proposals relating to the tax treatment
of health insurance, analysis and development of Administration efforts to
enhance Health Savings Accounts, analysis of potential Medicare and

Appendix A

| 215

Medicaid reforms, and promotion of transparency in health price and quality.
The Council investigated the causes and consequences of rising health care
costs and examined potenial remedies including greater consumer involvement in health care, opening access to insurance across state lines, Association
Health Plans, and encouraging high quality health care when the government
is the payer.
The Council was also especially active in energy and environmental policy
discussions, where it analyzed energy markets, fuel economy issues, and alternatives to oil. This included issues such as the President’s Advanced Energy
Initiative, bio-energy, the Outer-Continental Shelf, the Renewable Fuels
Standard, CAFE, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, regulatory reforms, global
climate change, and the international trade of energy.
The Council examined transportation policies relating to airports, hybrid
vehicles, and congestion pricing. The Council also played a role in the analysis
of policy for telecommunications, broadband, and spectrum allocation.
Council staff also provided analyses related to agricultural issues.
The Council participated in discussions related to catastrophic risk
insurance relating to natural disasters and attacks. The Council also participated in ongoing policy discussions relating to the government’s role in
terrorism risk insurance.
On labor policy, the Council was involved in the development of the
President’s comprehensive immigration policy and other proposed immigration reforms. The Council also assisted in Administration evaluation of higher
education policies, as well as in the examination of the No Child Left
Behind program.
The Council was active in tax policy discussions relating to comprehensive
tax reforms, business tax credits, and corporate taxation, as well as tax issues
related to entitlement programs such as Social Security. Many additional
tax policy discussions were involved in other microeconomic discussions
including labor, insurance, pensions, and health care.

General Notes
Detail in these tables may not add to totals because of rounding.
Because of the formula used for calculating real gross domestic product (GDP),
the chained (2000) dollar estimates for the detailed components do not add to the
chained-dollar value of GDP or to any intermediate aggregate. The Department of
Commerce (Bureau of Economic Analysis) no longer publishes chained-dollar
estimates prior to 1990, except for selected series.
Unless otherwise noted, all dollar figures are in current dollars.
Symbols used:

Data in these tables reflect revisions made by the source agencies through January 29, 2007. In particular, tables containing national income and product accounts (NIPA) estimates reflect revisions released by the Department of Commerce in July 2006.

1 Inventories at end of quarter. Quarter-to-quarter change calculated from this table is not the current-dollar change in private inventories
component of GDP. The former is the difference between two inventory stocks, each valued at its respective end-of-quarter prices. The latter
is the change in the physical volume of inventories valued at average prices of the quarter. In addition, changes calculated from this table
are at quarterly rates, whereas change in private inventories is stated at annual rates.
2 Inventories of construction, mining, and utilities establishments are included in other industries through 1995.
3 Quarterly totals at monthly rates. Final sales of domestic business equals final sales of domestic product less gross output of general
government, gross value added of nonprofit institutions, compensation paid to domestic workers, and space rent for owner-occupied housing.
Includes a small amount of final sales by farm and by government enterprises.
Note.—The industry classification of inventories is on an establishment basis. Estimates through 1995 are based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). Beginning with 1996, estimates are based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

inventories component of GDP is stated at annual rates.
2 Inventories of construction, mining, and utilities establishments are included in other industries through 1995.
3 Quarterly totals at monthly rates. Final sales of domestic business equals final sales of domestic product less gross output of general
government, gross value added of nonprofit institutions, compensation paid to domestic workers, and space rent for owner-occupied housing.
Includes a small amount of final sales by farm and by government enterprises.

5 Not strictly comparable with earlier data due to population adjustments or other changes. See Employment and Earnings for details on
breaks in series.
6 Beginning in 2000, data for agricultural employment are for agricultural and related industries; data for this series and for nonagricultural employment are not strictly comparable with data for earlier years. Because of independent seasonal adjustment for these two
series, monthly data will not add to total civilian employment.
Note.—Labor force data in Tables B-35 through B-44 are based on household interviews and relate to the calendar week including the
12th of the month. For definitions of terms, area samples used, historical comparability of the data, comparability with other series, etc., see
Employment and Earnings.

1 Annual

data are averages of monthly not seasonally adjusted figures.
2 Unfilled orders are seasonally adjusted, end of period. Ratios are unfilled orders at end of period to shipments for period (excludes industries with no unfilled orders). Annual ratios relate to seasonally adjusted data for December.
3 Effective in 2001, data classified based on North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Data on NAICS basis available beginning 1992. Earlier data based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC).
Data on SIC basis include semiconductors. Data on NAICS basis do not include semiconductors.
Note.—For data beginning 1992 on NAICS basis, since there are no unfilled orders for manufacturers’ nondurable goods, manufacturers’
nondurable new orders and nondurable shipments are the same (see Table B–58).

1 CPI-U-X1 is a rental equivalence approach to homeowners’ costs for the CPI-U for years prior to 1983, the first year for which the official
index incorporates such a measure. CPI-U-X1 is rebased to the December 1982 value of the CPI-U (1982-84=100) and is identical with CPI-U
data from December 1982 forward. Data prior to 1967 estimated by moving the series at the same rate as the CPI-U for each year.
2 CPI research series using current methods (CPI-U-RS) introduced in June 1999. Data for 2006 are preliminary. All data are subject to revision annually.
3 Chained consumer price index introduced in August 2002. Data for 2005 and 2006 are subject to revision.

1 In the old series, ‘‘income taxes’’ refers to Federal income taxes only, as State and local income taxes had already been deducted. In the
new series, no income taxes have been deducted.
2 Annual data are average equity for the year (using four end-of-quarter figures).
3 Beginning 1988, profits before and after income taxes reflect inclusion of minority stockholders’ interest in net income before and after
income taxes.
4 Data for 1992 (most significantly 1992:I) reflect the early adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 106 (Employer’s
Accounting for Post-Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions) by a large number of companies during the fourth quarter of 1992. Data for
1993 (1993:I) also reflect adoption of Statement 106. Corporations must show the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in
the first quarter of the year in which the change is adopted.
5 Data based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Other data shown are based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC).
Note.—Data are not necessarily comparable from one period to another due to changes in accounting principles, industry classifications,
sampling procedures, etc. For explanatory notes concerning compilation of the series, see ‘‘Quarterly Financial Report for Manufacturing,
Mining, and Trade Corporations,’’ Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census.

1 End-use commodity classifications beginning 1978 and 1989 are not strictly comparable with data for earlier periods. See Survey of Current Business, June 1988 and July 2001.

Note.—Data are on a balance of payments basis and exclude military.
In June 1990, end-use categories for goods exports were redefined to include reexports; beginning with data for 1978, reexports (exports of
foreign goods) are assigned to detailed end-use categories in the same manner as exports of domestic goods.

1 Department of Defense shipments of grant-aid military supplies and equipment under the Military Assistance Program are excluded from
total exports through 1985 and included beginning 1986.
2 F.a.s. (free alongside ship) value basis at U.S. port of exportation for exports.
3 Beginning 1989, exports have been adjusted for undocumented exports to Canada and are included in the appropriate end-use categories.
For prior years, only total exports include this adjustment.
4 Total includes ‘‘other’’ exports or imports, not shown separately.
5 Total arrivals of imported goods other than intransit shipments.
6 Total includes revisions not reflected in detail.
7 Total exports are on a revised statistical month basis; end-use categories are on a statistical month basis.
Note.—Goods on a Census basis are adjusted to a BOP basis by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, in line with concepts and definitions
used to prepare international and national accounts. The adjustments are necessary to supplement coverage of Census data, to eliminate
duplication of transactions recorded elsewhere in international accounts, and to value transactions according to a standard definition.
Data include international trade of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Foreign Trade Zones.

1 Prior

to 1991 data are for West Germany only.
2 Civilian unemployment rates, approximating U.S. concepts. Quarterly data for Japan, France, Germany, and Italy should be viewed as less
precise indicators of unemployment under U.S. concepts than the annual data.
3 There are breaks in the series for France (1982 and 1990), Germany (1983, 1991, 1999 and 2005), Italy (1986, 1991 and 1993), and
United States (1990 and 1994). For details on break in series in 1990 and 1994 for United States, see footnote 5, Table B–35. For details on
break in series for other countries, see U.S. Department of Labor Comparative Civilian Labor Force Statistics, Ten Countries: 1960–2005, October 19, 2006.
4 Hourly compensation in manufacturing, U.S. dollar basis; data relate to all employed persons (employees and self-employed workers).
For details on manufacturing hourly compensation, see U.S. Department of Labor International Comparisons of Manufacturing Productivity
and Unit Labor Cost Trends, 2005, September 26, 2006.
