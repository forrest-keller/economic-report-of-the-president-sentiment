economic report of the president

To the Congress of the United States:
Eight years ago when I took office, our economy was in crisis. We
were just months into the worst recession since the Great Depression, with
unemployment rising rapidly toward a peak of 10 percent. Nearly 800,000
Americans were losing their jobs each month, and home prices and the
stock market had plummeted. The auto industry was on the verge of
collapse. Many American families struggled to pay their bills, and millions
had lost their homes.
Faced with this crisis, my Administration acted quickly, taking steps
to shore up the financial system; cut taxes for working families; invest in
infrastructure, clean energy, and teacher jobs; help families refinance their
homes; and rescue the auto industry. These actions stemmed the tide of the
crisis and laid the foundation for a stronger economy over the long term.
Today, thanks to the resilience of the American people, our
economy has emerged as the strongest and most durable in the world.
By nearly every economic measure, America is better off than when I
took office. We are in the midst of the longest streak of job growth on
record. U.S. businesses have added 15.6 million jobs since early 2010. The
unemployment rate has been cut by more than half from its peak, falling
much faster than economists expected. Rising home prices have brought
millions of homeowners back above water, we are less reliant on foreign
oil than we have been in nearly three decades, and we have cut our budget
deficit by two-thirds as a share of the economy.
Most importantly, wages have begun to rise again for working
families. In 2015, median household income rose at the fastest rate on
record, with the typical family earning an additional $2,800. The poverty
Economic Report of the President  |  3

rate fell by more than any year since 1968. And data indicate that these
gains have continued in 2016, with wages rising over 2.7 percent at an
annual rate so far this year, much faster than inflation.
While American families have made remarkable progress during
the recovery, my Administration has also strengthened the long-term
foundation of our economy and worked to ensure that every American has
a fair chance to succeed if they work hard. We enacted the Affordable Care
Act (ACA) and reshaped our healthcare system, expanded opportunity by
making education more affordable and our tax code fairer, and increased
our economy’s resilience by strengthening the financial system and
addressing climate change. These efforts have yielded undeniable results.
Today, 20 million more American adults have health insurance. On
top of that, more than 3 million additional children have health insurance
today than in 2008, thanks in large part to the ACA and other actions
under my Administration. Our uninsured rate has hit its lowest level ever,
and insurance companies can no longer discriminate against those with
pre-existing conditions. At the same time, we have slowed the growth of
health costs dramatically. The average premium for a family who gets
coverage on the job is $3,600 lower today than it would be if premium
growth had matched the decade before the ACA. All of these changes pay
dividends for our economy.
We have also worked to ensure that all American families can share
in the benefits of the economy, not just those at the top, and we have
succeeded in rolling back some of the rise in inequality since the 1970s.
Tax changes since 2009 have increased the share of income going to the
bottom 99 percent of families by more than any Administration since at
least 1960. These tax changes and the ACA will boost incomes for our
lowest-income families by 18 percent, or $2,200.
Over the long term, education provides the surest path to increasing
economic opportunity. During my Administration, we have increased
access to early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to
record highs, and encouraged States to adopt higher standards and provide
better training for teachers. And to help make college more affordable, we
have doubled investments in Pell Grants and college tax credits; simplified
the application for Federal student aid; and helped more than 5 million
borrowers cap their monthly student loan payments.
Finally, we have made our economy more resilient against future
challenges. After the financial crisis, we passed the toughest Wall Street

reforms in history. Banks have sharply increased the size of their capital
buffers, there are new tough limits on risky behavior by banks, and we
have brought dark corners of the shadow banking industry under the
regulatory umbrella, all of which make another crisis less likely. We have
new tools to guard against another “too big to fail” scenario and a new
consumer watchdog to hold financial institutions accountable.
Sustainable economic growth also requires addressing climate
change, and since 2008, we have seen U.S. emissions fall even as our
economy has grown. America’s economy is becoming more energy
efficient and less carbon intensive. Our policies helped to catalyze this
change: In 2009, the Recovery Act made a historic investment in clean
energy, and we have since increased incentives for renewable energy like
wind and solar, improved energy efficiency, and implemented the firstever greenhouse gas standards for power plants, cars, and trucks. And
America’s leadership on climate issues helped pave the way for the Paris
Agreement, in which almost 200 countries committed to take concrete
steps to reduce emissions.
Our economic progress over the past eight years has been nothing
short of remarkable, and I am proud of everything my Administration has
accomplished. But I have always acknowledged that the work of perfecting
our union, and making our economy work for every American, would take
far longer than my time in office.
As I pass the baton to my successor, much work remains to
continue strengthening our economy and, most importantly, lifting
wages for working families. It is no secret that our openness to new
ideas and inclusivity are part of what make the United States the most
resilient economy in the world. Continuing our technological progress
and innovation, engaging with the world economy through trade, and
welcoming immigrants and new American families will create shared
growth and help define our economy for the coming decades.
The first step is to make smart, long-term investments that raise
productivity, like boosting funding for infrastructure and research and
development. We must also promote competition and innovation in the
economy and open new markets for American businesses through highstandards trade agreements.
But strengthening economic growth is only half of the equation. We
must also make sure that workers can share in that prosperity by creating
new, well-paid jobs and preparing workers for them. That means investing

in education from Pre-K all the way through college and increasing access
to apprenticeships and other career pathways. It means giving workers a
bigger voice and setting fair rules of the road by strengthening collective
bargaining, raising the Federal minimum wage, expanding access to paid
leave, and supporting retirement savings. And it means making our tax
system fairer so that those at the top pay their fair share.
Finally, we must ensure that growth is sustainable by continuing
to address the global risk of climate change, by increasing the safety and
accountability of our financial system, and by making responsible fiscal
decisions.
Over the past eight years, our country has come back from a oncein-a-lifetime economic crisis and emerged even stronger. For all the work
that remains, a new foundation has been laid. A new future is ours to
write. I have never been more optimistic about America’s future, and I am
confident that this incredible journey that we are on as Americans will
continue.

EIGHT YEARS OF RECOVERY
AND REINVESTMENT

A

s the 2017 Economic Report of the President goes to press, the United
States is eight years removed from the onset of the worst economic
crisis since the Great Depression. Over the two terms of the Obama
Administration, the U.S. economy has made a remarkable recovery from the
Great Recession. After peaking at 10.0 percent in October 2009, the unemployment rate has been cut by more than half to 4.6 percent as of November
2016, below its pre-recession average. Real gross domestic product (GDP)
per capita recovered fully to its pre-crisis peak in the fourth quarter of 2013,
faster than what would have been expected after such a severe financial
crisis based on historical precedents. As of the third quarter of 2016, the
U.S. economy was 11.5 percent larger than at its peak before the crisis. As of
November 2016, the economy has added 14.8 million jobs over 74 months,
the longest streak of total job growth on record. Since private-sector job
growth turned positive in March 2010, U.S. businesses have added 15.6
million jobs. Real wage growth has been faster in the current business cycle
than in any since the early 1970s. Meanwhile, from 2014 to 2015, median
real household income grew by 5.2 percent, the fastest annual growth on
record, and the United States saw its largest one-year drop in the poverty
rate since the 1960s.
Other indicators at the end of 2016 also show substantial progress.
Rising home prices have helped bring millions of homeowners back from
negative equity. Real, or inflation-adjusted, household net worth exceeds its
pre-recession peak by 16 percent. Since 2008, the United States has tripled
the amount of energy harnessed from wind and increased solar generation
thirtyfold. The United States is less reliant on foreign oil than it has been in
nearly three decades. Since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) became law in
2010, health care prices have risen at the slowest rate in 50 years. Measured
as a share of the economy, the Federal budget deficit has been cut by about
two-thirds since 2009.

The forceful response of the Federal Government to the crisis in 2008
and 2009 helped stave off a potential second Great Depression, setting the
U.S. economy on track to rebuild, reinvest, and recover. Recovery from the
crisis alone, though, was never the President’s sole aim. The Administration
has also addressed the structural barriers to sustained, shared prosperity that
middle-class families had faced for decades—rising health care costs, limited
access to higher education, slow growth in incomes, high levels of inequality,
a reliance on oil and other sources of carbon pollution, and more—so that
the U.S. economy would work for all Americans. Thanks to these policy
efforts, eight years later, the American economy is stronger, more resilient,
and better positioned for the 21st century than ever before.
The 2017 Economic Report of the President reviews the economic
record of the Obama Administration, focusing both on how its policies have
promoted economic growth that is robust and widely shared and on the
challenges the U.S. economy still faces in the years ahead.

The Recovery in Review
Across a broad range of macroeconomic measures, the U.S. economy
has made remarkable progress in the eight years since one of the most
tumultuous and uncertain periods in its history.

Employment and Wages
The Great Recession was well underway when President Obama took
office in January 2009. In that month, the unemployment rate stood at 7.8
percent, already elevated from its average of 5.3 percent in the 2001-07
expansion period. The unemployment rate would continue to increase until
it peaked at 10.0 percent in October 2009. The long-term unemployment
rate—the share of the labor force unemployed for 27 weeks or more—rose
to an all-time high of 4.4 percent, as did the share of Americans working part-time for economic reasons (that is, those working part-time who
would prefer a full-time position), which doubled to 6.0 percent from its
pre-recession average.
From its peak, the unemployment rate recovered to its pre-recession
average in mid-2015 and continued to fall, standing at 4.6 percent as of
November 2016. This rapid decline came far more quickly than most economists predicted: as recently as March 2014, private forecasters expected the
unemployment rate to remain above 5.0 percent until at least 2020 (Figure
1-1). All but one of the broader measures of labor underutilization published
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) have recovered fully to their respective pre-recession averages. Further, the labor force participation rate, which

has been subject to downward pressure due to the aging of the U.S. population, has been broadly stable since the end of 2013, as the strengthening
labor market recovery has led workers to enter (or reenter) the workforce,
offsetting downward pressure from demographic trends.
Total nonfarm employment peaked in January 2008 before falling by
8.7 million jobs, or 6.3 percent, to its trough in February 2010; over the same
period, private-sector employment fell by 8.8 million jobs, or 7.6 percent. In
the first quarter of 2009 alone, total job losses averaged 772,000 a month,
larger than the populations of a number of U.S. States. While job losses were
broad-based across industries, several sectors were particularly hard-hit.
From January 2008 to February 2010, employment in the manufacturing
sector declined by 16.6 percent, while employment in the construction sector declined by 26.4 percent.
Nonfarm job growth turned consistently positive beginning in
October 2010. Since then, the U.S. economy has added jobs for 74 straight
months, the longest streak of total job growth on record; over this period,
nonfarm employment growth has averaged 199,000 jobs a month. Total
nonfarm employment recovered to its pre-recession peak in 2014—the best
year for job creation since the 1990s—and, as of November 2016, exceeded
its pre-recession peak by 6.7 million jobs. Since private-sector job growth

turned positive in March 2010, U.S. businesses have added 15.6 million jobs
(Figure 1-2). The manufacturing sector has added over 800,000 jobs since
February 2010, the industry’s fastest growth since the 1990s (see Box 1-2).
And since June 2009, when Chrysler and General Motors (GM) emerged
from bankruptcy, the automobile industry (manufacturing and retail) has
added nearly 700,000 jobs, the industry’s strongest growth on record.
As the labor market has strengthened, the recovery has translated
into real wage gains for American workers. Due to both an acceleration
in nominal wage growth and low inflation, since the end of 2012 private
production and nonsupervisory workers, who comprise about 80 percent of
private-sector employment, have seen their real hourly earnings increase by
5.3 percent, more than the total cumulative real wage gains for these workers
from 1980 to 2007. Overall, real hourly wage growth since the business cycle
peak in December 2007 has averaged 0.8 percent a year for these workers,
the fastest growth of any business cycle (measured peak-to-peak) since the
1970s (Figure 1-3).
The combination of robust employment growth and accelerating real
wage growth has translated into strong growth in household incomes. From
2014 to 2015, real median household income grew 5.2 percent, or $2,800, the
fastest growth on record. Moreover, these income gains have been widely

shared: households at the bottom and middle of the income distribution saw
faster real income gains from 2014 to 2015 than did households at the top of
the income distribution.
While the labor market has made major improvements, some challenges still remain. The share of employees working part-time for economic
reasons, and, accordingly, the broadest measure of underemployment, the
U-6 rate (of which this share is a component), remain modestly elevated
relative to their respective pre-recession averages. As discussed below, labor
force participation, particularly for many workers in their prime working
years, has been declining for decades, a key challenge for the U.S. labor market in the years ahead. And while real wage growth has picked up in recent
years, more work remains to reverse decades of limited income growth for
many middle-class families.

Output and Economic Growth
Like employment, economic output contracted sharply in the Great
Recession. Real GDP peaked in the fourth quarter of 2007 before falling
rapidly over the following year. In the fourth quarter of 2008 alone, real GDP
contracted at an annualized rate of 8.2 percent. As discussed in Box 1-1,
this drop was more severe than initially estimated: the first estimate of GDP

growth in the fourth quarter of 2008 was a contraction of 3.8 percent. All
told, real GDP fell 4.2 percent, from its peak in the fourth quarter of 2007 to
its trough in the second quarter of 2009. Since the U.S. population continued
to grow over this period, real GDP per capita fell by an even greater amount,
5.5 percent.
By the fourth quarter of 2013, per-capita real GDP had fully recovered
to its pre-recession peak, and by the third quarter of 2016, per-capita GDP
exceeded its pre-crisis peak by 4 percent. This rebound occurred much
more quickly than in most other advanced economies, many of which also
experienced systemic financial crises in 2007-08. For example, Japan, which
recovered relatively quickly, has seen growth level off in recent years, and
while the euro area economy has improved noticeably over the last two
years, the area is on the verge of missing nearly an entire decade of growth,
as it still has not attained 2008 levels of income per capita (Figure 1-4). Not
only has the U.S. economy outperformed those of other advanced economies in the current global business cycle, but the recovery from the Great
Recession compares favorably with historical recoveries in countries experiencing systemic financial crises (Reinhart and Rogoff 2014). Still, a number
of trends—including demographic changes resulting in slower workforce
growth and a slowdown in productivity growth—have presented headwinds
to U.S. output growth over the recovery.

Equity Markets, House Prices, Household Wealth, and Other
Measures
The collapse of the housing bubble and the financial crisis of 2007-08
manifested in steep declines in both house and equity prices. From their
peak in February 2007 to their trough in January 2012, house prices (as measured by the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index) fell by 26 percent. The S&P 500 index, meanwhile, fell by more than half between August
2007 and March 2009. These steep declines in asset prices caused stark drops
in overall household wealth: real household net worth—the assets of U.S.
households minus their liabilities, net of inflation—fell 21 percent from its
peak in 2007 to its trough in 2009.
By the end of 2016, the landscape was much improved. From March
2009 to November 2016, the S&P 500 index increased 186 percent. Since their
January 2012 trough, home prices have increased 34 percent as of September
2016, and have nearly recovered to their February 2007 nominal peak
(Figure 1-5). As of the second quarter of 2016, rising home prices since the
end of 2012 have helped to lift almost 7.9 million households out of negative
equity, and the number of homes in foreclosure has declined dramatically.

and diligent efforts to pay down debts has left American households with
their strongest net worth position on record: as of the third quarter of 2016,
real household net worth exceeded its pre-recession peak by 16 percent.
Other indicators show a similar pattern of strong progress. Since the
ACA was signed into law in 2010, health care prices have risen at the slowest pace in 50 years. Since 2008, the United States has tripled the amount of
energy harnessed from wind and has increased solar generation thirtyfold.
Today, the United States is less reliant on foreign oil than it has been in
nearly three decades. The Federal budget deficit in fiscal year (FY) 2016 was
3.2 percent of GDP, about a third of the 9.8 percent of GDP deficit recorded
in 2009 and equal to the average over the last 40 years.

The Crisis and the Response
After eight years of recovery, it is easy to forget how close the U.S.
economy came to an outright depression during the crisis. Indeed, by a
number of macroeconomic measures, the first year of the Great Recession
in the United States saw larger declines than at the outset of the Great
Depression in 1929-30. However, the forceful policy response by the Federal
Government—including the efforts of the Bush Administration, the Obama
Administration, the Federal Reserve, Congress, and others—combined with
the resilience of American businesses and families and coordination with
our international partners to help stave off a second Great Depression.

A Once-in-a-Lifetime Crisis
In the run-up to the 2007-09 recession, the country experienced a
dramatic escalation in home prices, fueled in part by lax mortgage underwriting standards and a financial system that channeled too much funding
into housing. The rapid increase in home prices came to an abrupt halt in
late 2006. Home prices stopped rising and then started falling rapidly within
a year. Millions of homeowners found themselves “underwater”—that is,
their mortgage loan balances exceeded the value of their homes—and many
were unable to make scheduled mortgage payments.
Fallout from the housing crisis quickly spread to the broader economy
through a complex web of opaque financial instruments tied to housing and
questionable business practices of some financial firms, including excessive
leverage and an overreliance on short-term debt (Financial Crisis Inquiry
Report 2011). Investors pulled back from risky assets and, during one fateful
week in September 2008, the investment bank Lehman Brothers went out of
business, a prominent money market fund “broke the buck” (meaning that
depositors could no longer count on getting their money back in its entirety,

an almost unprecedented event), and the large insurance firm American
International Group (AIG) teetered on the edge of bankruptcy until the U.S.
Government provided $85 billion in financial support.
The dramatic fall of asset prices—due to both the collapse of the housing bubble and the resulting financial turmoil—was, by many measures,
deeper than at the outset of the Great Depression in 1929-30. Home prices
in the United States fell 5.6 percent between 2008 and 2009, outpacing the
4.3-percent decline from 1929 to 1930. Between 2008 and 2009, the S&P
500 Index declined 23 percent on an annual average basis, exceeding the
1929-30 decline of 19 percent. As a result of these steep declines in asset
prices, nominal household net worth declined by a total of $13 trillion, or 19
percent of total U.S. household wealth, from its peak in 2007 to its trough in
2009. The decline in wealth in the early stages of the Great Recession was far
larger than the reduction experienced at the onset of the Great Depression
(Figure 1-6).
Faced with a drop in demand for their goods and services and extraordinary uncertainty about their economic futures, businesses stopped hiring
and laid off workers: employment declined 4 percent from 2008 to 2009,
nearly the same rate as from 1929 to 1930 (Figure 1-7). Businesses also

shelved investment plans and consumers cut back on spending. The financial crisis also had wide-ranging effects abroad, and global trade suffered a
much more drastic fall between 2008 and 2009 than during the first year of
the Great Depression (Figure 1-8). In short, as the Obama Administration
began, the United States faced an economic crisis of historic proportions.

The Policy Response
The short-term policy response in the United States to the global
financial crisis in 2008-09 was aggressive, swift, and—by the preponderance
of evidence from many private-sector, academic, and government analyses—effective. It included a combination of aggressive aggregate demand
management driven by expansionary fiscal and monetary policy and shortterm financial stability measures that prevented the risks of the crisis from
compounding further.

Fiscal Policy
The fiscal response began in early 2008, well before the height of the
financial crisis, as the economy began to slide into recession. Congress and
the Bush Administration enacted the Economic Stimulus Act in February
2008, cutting taxes for low- and middle-income households while providing

tax incentives to encourage business investment. The value of the cuts in the
Act totaled $124 billion over 11 years, with nearly all of the cuts concentrated
in FY 2008. The Act was designed to counteract a short recession by providing brief, temporary support to consumer spending—including electronic
payments to households that began less than three months after passage
of the Act—but it was insufficient to reverse the emerging distress and, by
design, did not have long-lasting effects.
In December 2008, then-President-elect Obama proposed an outline
of what would become the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009, also known as the Recovery Act or “ARRA.” The Recovery Act was
the first bill introduced in the House of Representatives just days after the
President’s inauguration, and the President signed it into law less than a
month after he took office. As the name of the Act suggests, the intention
was for the bill to both generate recovery from the crisis and to be an important investment in the future of the economy.
Several principles guided the new Administration’s fiscal policy. First,
the fiscal effort was to be implemented quickly. Second, it should be large,
given the scope of the economic problem. Finally, it should be a sustained
effort that would not only provide immediate fiscal support over the first
two years, but would also provide smaller levels of temporary support

Box 1-1: Revisions to Crisis-Era Data
Policymakers face a number of challenges in assessing the state
of the economy in real time. First, macroeconomic indicators are only
available on a lagged basis, since it takes time for the Federal statistical
agencies—such as the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis
(BEA), and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)—to collect and analyze
the data underlying their estimates. Initial estimates of gross domestic
product (GDP) for a given quarter, for example, are released several
weeks after that quarter ends. Second, more timely data generally tend to
be incomplete and can only present a partial snapshot of the economy.
Third, and perhaps most importantly, though subsequent revisions
to macroeconomic data—particularly estimates of employment and
output—often do not receive the same attention as initial estimates, they
can often be large and economically meaningful, especially around turning points in the business cycle (when extrapolations and assumptions
underlying some initial estimates can turn out badly wrong).
These challenges confronted the Obama Administration in determining the response to the 2008 crisis. When President Obama took
office on January 20, 2009, BEA had not yet released its advance estimate
of GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2008, a critical measure for
understanding how much the financial crisis had affected real economic
activity. Yet what data were available at that point showed an economy
facing a substantial and protracted decline in economic output, and the
incoming Administration had proposed the contours of what would
become the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in December
2008. When BEA released its advance estimate of GDP growth for the
fourth quarter of 2008 in late January 2009—a contraction of 3.8 percent
at an annual rate, the largest quarterly decline since 1982—it confirmed
the need for a vigorous response from the Federal Government.

Subsequent revisions to fourth-quarter GDP growth, however, have
revealed that early estimates greatly underestimated the extent of output
losses in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis. As shown in
Table 1-i, BEA’s most recent estimate is that real GDP decreased by 8.2
percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2008, the largest onequarter drop since 1958.
Labor market data show a similar pattern, with initial estimates
of job losses in the fourth quarter of 2008 subsequently revised further
downward, as shown in Table 1-ii. In January 2009, contemporary
estimates of nonfarm employment losses from September to December
2008 totaled 1.5 million jobs. As of 2016, BLS estimates that 1.9 million
Americans lost their jobs during those months.
All told, subsequent revisions to crisis-era data have revealed that
the state of the U.S. economy in early 2009 was even worse than initial
data indicated. The revisions have also helped to confirm both the historic nature of the economic downturn that policymakers faced in the
early months of 2009 and the role that policy played in helping to avert
a second Great Depression.

thereafter. The new approach would require a mix of policy instruments
such as tax cuts and other temporary assistance that put cash in the hands
of households who needed it immediately and who were likely to spend it,
boosting aggregate demand. Other measures provided States with funding
to continue providing necessary services and to help them avoid cutting
their own budgets drastically in the face of fiscal shortfalls. Additional
components, such as investments in infrastructure and innovation, would
be more lagged but would be more likely to have larger cumulative countercyclical impacts and greater longer-run benefits. In all cases, however, the
Eight Years of Recovery and Reinvestment  |  33

measures would end and would not have long-term impacts on the Federal
Government’s primary budget deficit.
To ensure that the fiscal stimulus would be as effective as possible,
the Recovery Act utilized a variety of spending, tax, and incentive channels. Recovery Act policies were fairly evenly distributed across individual
tax cuts and business tax incentives (29 percent), aid to directly impacted
individuals and State fiscal relief (34 percent), and public investments in
infrastructure, education, job training, energy, and health information technology (37 percent).
When passed, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated
that the Recovery Act would cost $787 billion, though that estimate would
increase as the full impact of the recession became apparent (CBO 2009). The
most recent CBO estimate shows that the fiscal support from the Recovery
Act will total $836 billion through 2019 (CBO 2015). Between calendar years
2009 and 2012, the period for which the Recovery Act had the largest impact,
the Act provided a total fiscal impulse of approximately $700 billion.1
Importantly, while the Recovery Act provided a considerable shortterm boost to aggregate demand, its investments were targeted for their
long-term growth potential, helping ensure that the United States climbed
out of the crisis stronger than before. The provisions of the Recovery Act
were tailored to deepen the United States’ stock of private physical capital
(through business tax incentives), public physical capital (through investments in transportation infrastructure), human capital (through extensive
education investments), and intellectual capital (through research and
development investments).
More than a dozen subsequent fiscal measures extended certain
Recovery Act provisions and introduced additional countercyclical policies,
such as the temporary payroll tax cut in effect during 2011 and 2012. In total,
discretionary fiscal stimulus from 2009 through 2012 totaled $1.4 trillion
and averaged around 2 percent of GDP. Together with automatic stabilizers,
the total fiscal stimulus over these four years averaged 4 percent of GDP
(Figure 1-9). The initial U.S. fiscal response exceeded the response by the
euro area or Japan, one of the reasons the United States recovered sooner
and more strongly (Furman 2016a).

Monetary Policy
The Federal Reserve’s independent decision to take a vigorous
approach to monetary stabilization was another major driver of the United
1 This figure excludes a routine set of patches for the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).
This part of the Recovery Act, a continuation of a longstanding practice, is best thought of as
ongoing fiscal policy, not as a temporary fiscal impulse designed specifically to counter the
effects of an economic recession.

States’ recovery. The traditional tool of monetary policy—the Federal Funds
target rate—was reduced to nearly zero by the end of 2008, after which the
Federal Reserve turned to a program of unconventional policy in an effort
to reduce long-term interest rates. The Federal Reserve used two principal
mechanisms to achieve this end: forward guidance, by which it provided an
indication of its plan for the future path of short-term interest rates, and
asset purchases (commonly known as “quantitative easing”). As part of its
forward guidance, the Federal Reserve assured market participants that it
would maintain its near-zero interest rate policy for an extended period of
time. As part of its quantitative easing program, the Federal Reserve purchased long-term debt instruments, including mortgage-backed securities
and U.S. Treasury bonds, expanding its balance sheet from $900 billion to
$4.5 trillion between 2008 and 2014. In contrast, the European Central Bank
initially did not cut rates to zero, raised rates in 2011, and did not undertake
nearly as large a balance sheet expansion as the Federal Reserve.

Stabilizing Financial Markets
In addition to expansionary fiscal and monetary policy, the Bush and
Obama Administrations and the Federal Reserve implemented a package of
short-term measures to stabilize financial markets. In late 2008, the Treasury

Eight Years of Recovery and Reinvestment  |  35

Department established a temporary guarantee program for money market
mutual funds while the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
expanded its guarantee on bank deposits and debt to avoid runs on banks
and other financial institutions. The Bush Administration also proposed,
and Congress approved, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), providing up to $700 billion to stabilize troubled banks. Meanwhile, the Federal
Reserve instituted a number of programs designed to provide liquidity to
borrowers, investors, and financial market participants. These early policy
responses helped stem a plunge in consumer confidence, credit flows, and
corporate balance sheets that could have been much worse.
Within three weeks of President Obama taking office, the new
Administration released its Financial Stability Plan. Building on the initial
action of the Bush Administration, the plan included a host of new measures
designed to continue to shore up financial markets and increase credit flows.
Ultimately, over 700 banks received capital through TARP, and the Obama
Administration also expanded the use of TARP funds to help millions of
families affected by the housing crisis, restructure the automobile industry,
and support small businesses. It is important to note, however, that TARP
gave the Federal Government authority to recoup any returns on asset purchases or equity investments made under the program. To date, the Federal
Government has collected 103 percent of the $412.1 billion spent on investment programs, as well as an additional $17.5 billion from Treasury’s equity
stake in AIG, for a total return of about $28 billion.
In addition to expanding and effectively managing the TARP program, the Administration established comprehensive stress tests of the
Nation’s 19 largest financial institutions to reduce uncertainty regarding
their solvency, stabilize the financial system, and ensure the banks were able
to continue lending. By using TARP funding as a backstop for firms unable
to raise necessary capital, the Administration moved the financial system
rapidly toward a better-capitalized system where financial institutions and
investors knew that institutions were solvent, so normal financial activity
could resume.

Rescuing the Automobile Sector
In addition to stabilizing the financial market, the Administration
provided substantial support to automobile companies to keep them from
failing during the Great Recession. At the height of the financial crisis,
capital markets would have been unable to oversee the orderly restructuring
of the automobile companies necessary to preserve their viable assets. The
ensuing job losses and the concentrated, severe impact on specific communities would also have resulted in large economic hardship as well as

36  |  Chapter 1

substantial costs to the Federal Government for Medicaid, unemployment
insurance, and other social assistance programs. In these circumstances,
the Federal Government took extraordinary steps to avoid the unmanaged
bankruptcy of the largest automobile manufacturers, failures that likely
would have cascaded through supply chains, threatening even more firms.
The Administration guided two of America’s largest automobile
manufacturers—GM and Chrysler—through a targeted bankruptcy and
comprehensive restructuring. In the spring of 2009, the Administration’s
Auto Task Force worked with these two firms to produce plans for viability.
For both companies, a quick, targeted bankruptcy was judged to be the most
efficient and successful way to restructure. Chrysler filed for bankruptcy
on April 30, 2009; GM, on June 1. In addition to concessions by all stakeholders, including workers, retirees, creditors, and suppliers, the Federal
Government invested funds to bring about an orderly restructuring. By the
end of 2013, the Federal Government had disposed of all of its investments
in Chrysler and GM. To date, American taxpayers have recovered $71 billion of the $80 billion invested in the automobile industry, and the Federal
Government continues to receive proceeds from the bankruptcy liquidations of Old Chrysler and Old GM.

Supporting the Housing Market
The loss in household wealth from the collapse in housing prices was a
significant factor slowing the economy in the recession, and financial products linked to real estate valuations were central to many aspects of the global
financial crisis. The short-term policy response did not lose sight of this key
fact. By establishing the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP), the
Obama Administration helped more than 3 million borrowers refinance
their loans and save hundreds of dollars each month. The Administration
also eliminated additional barriers to refinancing and proposed reforms so
that all responsible borrowers with loans insured by Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac would have access to simple, low-cost refinancing.
In addition to helping millions of Americans refinance, the
Administration created the Home Affordable Mortgage Program (HAMP)
to provide millions of homeowners who are behind on their payments an
opportunity to modify their mortgages in order to reduce their monthly
payments and avoid foreclosure. The Administration also provided over $7
billion in targeted support to the hardest-hit communities who experienced
the sharpest declines in home prices. These funds were intended to help
manage vacant and foreclosed properties that bring down local home values,
support unemployed and underwater homeowners, and convert foreclosed
properties into rentals.

Box 1-2: The Manufacturing Sector
A robust manufacturing sector acts as a galvanizing force for
America’s economic well-being, as it is linked to productivity growth,
innovative capacity, and high-quality jobs. The average worker employed
in the domestic manufacturing sector earns an hourly wage that is 2 to 9
percent higher than the overall average worker (Nicholson and Powers
2015). Further, the manufacturing sector houses a great deal of innovation, accounting for nearly 80 percent of private-sector research and
development (R&D) and the vast majority of patents issued in the United
States. The high-quality jobs and innovative capacity of the manufacturing industry, supported by the Administration, serve as investments
in a strong macroeconomy and broad-based growth. In the last two
decades of the 20th century, manufacturing employment followed a slight
downward trend, while manufacturing output rose quickly (Figure 1-i).
However, throughout the first decade of the 21st century, employment
fell sharply. By the time that the Great Recession hit, the manufacturing
sector had already lost 3.5 million jobs relative to January 2000. By the
beginning of 2010, the sector had shed another 2.3 million jobs.
Given the importance of the manufacturing sector to the U.S.
economy, the Obama Administration made revitalizing domestic performance in this sector a central component of its economic agenda and

worked to promote innovation and invest in manufacturing workforce
skills.
The Administration’s commitment to manufacturing was manifested in its decision to save the automobile industry. The President
made the crucial, early decision to not only rescue, but to also restructure
and rebuild American automobile manufacturing and its many connected industries. Yet, support for manufacturing went beyond this
rescue. Creating the Manufacturing USA initiative in 2012 marked
another significant action taken to support manufacturing. The Federal
Government has committed over $600 million—which has been matched
by over $1.3 billion in non-Federal investment—to fund the development of world-leading manufacturing capabilities with technologies
such as 3D printing, integrated photonics, and smart sensors. In the four
years since its establishment, Manufacturing USA has grown from one
institute with 65 members to a network of nine institutes and over 1,300
members.
Further, the Administration has taken steps to reinvest in our
manufacturing workforce to prepare it for a more competitive, global
economy. First, the Administration awarded nearly $2 billion in Trade
Adjustment Assistance Community College Career Training grants to
help community colleges expand and improve programs that prepare
workers for high-paying, high-skill occupations. To date, nearly 300,000
participants have enrolled in retraining programs through these grants,
and 160,000 credentials have been awarded. Second, the Administration
has prioritized apprenticeships. Research shows that apprenticeships
tend to lead to high-paying jobs and provide a strong return on investment for employers. Recent Department of Labor data indicate that
after completing her programs, the average registered apprentice earns
a starting wage above $60,000, and 89 percent of registered apprenticeship program completers enter employment after exiting. To these ends,
the Administration has allocated $265 million toward grants aimed
at expanding apprenticeships in the United States. Since 2014, active
apprenticeships have increased 31 percent, with an estimated 20,000 new
apprentices in the manufacturing industry.
Ultimately, U.S. manufacturing output since the Great Recession
has recovered at twice the pace of the overall economy since the third
quarter of 2009. This marks the longest period in which manufacturing
has outpaced U.S. economic output in 50 years. Contrary to the pattern
in all other U.S. expansions since 1982, the current expansion has seen
an increase in manufacturing output as a share of U.S. value-added.
Notably, the U.S. manufacturing sector’s job growth since the Great
Recession is a marked departure from last decade, when the sector

Eight Years of Recovery and Reinvestment  |  39

struggled to recover the jobs lost in the 2001 recession. Since February
2010, U.S. manufacturing has added over 800,000 new jobs.
Following the strong manufacturing recovery in the expansion
after the Great Recession, the manufacturing sector has seen lackluster
output and employment growth since 2014. The sector is inextricably
tied to the global economy, and as global demand has slowed and
energy-related capital expenditure has fallen, U.S. manufacturing has
suffered. Global economic output, as one of the key drivers of export
demand, is particularly important to manufacturing, as it is a far more
trade-exposed sector than other parts of the economy. For example,
while manufacturing represents roughly 12 percent of value added in
the economy, manufactured exports have maintained a share of more
than 60 percent of U.S. exports. Real exports rebounded swiftly after
the crisis, helping the manufacturing sector. But recently, real exports
of goods and services have fallen slightly, tied in large part to slower
foreign GDP growth and a strong U.S. dollar. Moreover, recent declines
in energy prices have affected many manufacturing industries that serve
as significant upstream suppliers for the energy sector, such as steel
manufacturers that supply oil producers.
Yet, even despite these headwinds, manufacturing job growth over
the last two years is comparable with its best two years in the previous

expansion, a period of low production and negative employment growth
in the sector. Further, the underlying structure of the sector is robust.
One clear piece of evidence regarding the continued resilience of the U.S.
manufacturing industry is that the United States has stabilized its market
share in global manufacturing exports (Figure 1-ii). This stabilization is
all the more notable given that the U.S. share of world manufacturing
exports fell precipitously in the first half of the 2000s. These are signs
that the headwinds that the U.S. manufacturing sector is facing are likely
temporary and will subside as the underlying strength of the sector
continues to support the U.S. macroeconomy.

The Impact of the Policy Response
A number of studies adopting a wide range of approaches to measuring the effect of the Recovery Act and subsequent fiscal measures find a
large positive impact on output and employment (CEA 2014). Overall, CEA
estimates that the Recovery Act saved or created about 6 million job-years
(where a job-year is the equivalent of one full-time job for one year) through
2012 and raised the level of GDP by between 2 and 2.5 percent in FY 2010
and part of FY 2011. Combining effects of the Recovery Act and additional
countercyclical fiscal legislation that followed, CEA estimates that the cumulative gain in employment was about 9 million job-years through the end of
2012 (Figure 1-10a). The cumulative boost to GDP from 2009 to 2012 was
equivalent to about 9.5 percent of the level of GDP in the fourth quarter of
2008 (Figure 1-10b).
CEA’s results are consistent with outside estimates, including those
from CBO and academic researchers. These include studies that focus on
portions of the Recovery Act that provided relief to States in ways that were
not tied to current conditions (Feyrer and Sacerdote 2011; Chodorow-Reich
et al. 2012), as well as those taking a broader view of the Federal policy
response to the crisis and recession. Blinder and Zandi (2015) find that
in the absence of policy actions by the Bush and Obama Administrations,
Congress, and the Federal Reserve, the peak-to-trough decline in real GDP
would have been nearly 14 percent (instead of 4 percent), the unemployment
rate would have risen to nearly 16 percent (instead of 10 percent), and real
output would have contracted for 13 quarters (instead of six).2

Act and subsequent fiscal measures, see Chapter 3 of the 2014 Economic Report of the
President.

The 2017 Economic Report of the President:
Promoting Stronger, More Inclusive,
and More Sustainable Growth
The response of the Federal Government to the crisis averted a
sharper and more prolonged downturn and put the U.S. economy back on a
path to growth. Even so, a number of decades-long trends that preceded the
crisis—rising inequality, insufficient health insurance coverage, high health
care costs, and growing costs for higher education—still remained, preventing middle-class Americans from seeing gains in their incomes, economic
security, and standards of living. Addressing these barriers to inclusive
growth has been the cornerstone of the Obama Administration’s economic
policy, which has been focused not only on returning the U.S. economy
back to stability, but on setting it on a firmer path to sustained growth that
is broadly shared among all American families.
The Administration’s reforms—and their effects on the U.S. economy
and American families—are the main topic of this year’s Economic Report
of the President. Following a summary of macroeconomic developments in
the last year (Chapter 2), each subsequent chapter focuses on a different
aspect of the Obama Administration’s economic record, describing the great
strides that the Nation has made in building a stronger foundation for future
prosperity.

Chapter 3: Reducing Inequality	
The legislation President Obama fought for and signed into law represents a historic accomplishment in reducing inequality. The Administration
has achieved its most substantial and immediate success in this respect in
three areas: restoring economic growth, expanding health insurance coverage, and enacting a fairer tax code.
The policy response to the Great Recession served a dual role in
reducing inequality. It reduced inequality in after-tax incomes directly
through progressive tax and spending policies, such as temporary tax cuts
for working and middle-class families and extensions of unemployment
insurance, and it reduced wage inequality indirectly by boosting employment. By reducing unemployment, these policies offset roughly half of the
increase in wage inequality that would otherwise have occurred if more
workers lost their jobs and saw their wages fall to zero.
In addition to providing substantial gains in health insurance coverage (see below), the ACA also led to a large reduction in inequality in aftertax incomes. Meanwhile, progressive changes in tax policy have increased

tax rates for the highest-income Americans and increased the generosity of
tax credits for working families, reducing inequality in after-tax incomes.
Together, changes in tax policy and the ACA coverage provisions will
increase the share of after-tax income received by the bottom quintile of
households in 2017 by 0.6 percentage point, or 18 percent—equivalent to
more than a decade of average income gains—and the share received by the
second quintile by 0.5 percentage point, or 6 percent. At the same time, they
will reduce the share received by the top 1 percent by 1.2 percentage points,
or 7 percent (Figure 1-11). These changes will increase average tax rates for
the top 0.1 percent of families, a group projected to have average pre-tax
incomes over $8 million, by nearly 7 percentage points.
The impacts of these policies are large relative to previous Federal
policy actions. Tax changes enacted since 2009 have boosted the share of
after-tax income received by the bottom 99 percent of families by more than
the tax changes of any previous administration since at least 1960. President
Obama has overseen the largest increase in Federal investment to reduce
inequality since the Great Society programs of the Johnson Administration.
However, while these accomplishments are historically large, they have
offset only a fraction of the decades-long increase in inequality, and much
more work remains to be done.

44  |  Chapter 1

Chapter 4: Reforming the Health Care System
The Obama Administration has made dramatic progress in ensuring that all Americans have access to affordable, high-quality health care
by expanding and improving health insurance coverage and reforming the
health care delivery system.
In his first month in office, President Obama signed legislation
improving the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Slightly more
than a year later, the President signed into law the ACA, which reformed the
individual health insurance market to ensure that all Americans, including
people with pre-existing health conditions, could find affordable, highquality coverage; provided generous financial support to States that expand
their Medicaid programs to cover more low-income Americans; and allowed
young adults to remain on a parent’s plan until age 26, among other reforms.
The ACA also improved financial security and access to care for those
already insured, including by ensuring that everyone with private insurance
has an annual limit on out-of-pocket spending and closing the Medicare
Part D coverage gap.
Together, these actions have led to a historic expansion of health
insurance coverage. Because of the ACA, an estimated 20 million additional
adults now have health insurance. In addition, thanks in large part to the
ACA and improvements to CHIP, the uninsured rate among children has
fallen by almost half since the President took office, providing health insurance to more than 3 million additional children. As of 2016, the uninsured
rate stands at its lowest level ever. Evidence demonstrates that broader insurance coverage is improving access to care, health, and financial security for
the newly insured, while reducing the burden of uncompensated care for
the health care system as a whole, without the adverse effects on the labor
market that critics of the ACA had predicted.
The ACA and related legislation have also implemented comprehensive reforms to make the health care delivery system more efficient and
improve the quality of care. The ACA achieved significant near-term savings
by better aligning payments to medical providers and private insurers in
Medicare with the costs of providing services. The law also began a longterm process of deploying alternative payment models (APMs) that, unlike
existing fee-for-service payment systems, reward providers who deliver
efficient, high-quality care, rather than just a high quantity of services. As
of early 2016, more than 30 percent of traditional Medicare payments were
associated with APMs, up from virtually none in 2010. The tools provided
by the ACA, enhanced by the bipartisan physician payment reform legislation enacted in 2015, will enable further progress in deploying APMs in the
years ahead.

price index for 2016 is a CBO projection.

Health care costs have grown exceptionally slowly since the ACA
became law. Prices of health care goods and services have grown at a slower
rate under the ACA than during any comparable period since these data
began in 1959, and recent years have also seen exceptionally slow growth in
per-enrollee spending in both public programs and private insurance. The
reforms implemented in the ACA have made an important contribution to
these trends. CBO estimates imply that the ACA has reduced the growth rate
of per-beneficiary Medicare spending by 1.3 percentage points per year from
2010 through 2016, and “spillover” effects of these reforms have subtracted
an estimated 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points per year from the growth rate of
per-enrollee private insurance spending over the same period. Moreover,
there is reason to believe that the ACA has had systemic effects on trends in
costs and quality that go beyond these estimates.
Because of slow growth in costs in employer coverage, illustrated in
Figure 1-12, the average costs for a family with employer-based coverage
in 2016 were $4,400 below where they would have been had costs grown at
their pace over the decade before the ACA became law. Similarly, the premium and cost sharing amounts incurred by the typical beneficiary enrolled
in traditional Medicare in 2016 are about $700 below 2009 projections, even
before accounting for reductions in cost sharing for prescription drugs due
46  |  Chapter 1

to the ACA and other factors. The ACA and the accompanying slow growth
in health costs have also driven dramatic improvements in the Nation’s
long-term fiscal outlook, while at the same time adding 11 years to the life
of the Medicare Trust Fund.
In parallel, the ACA’s reforms have helped drive major improvements
in health care quality. Since 2010, the rate at which patients are harmed
while seeking hospital care has fallen by 21 percent, which is estimated to
have led to approximately 125,000 avoided deaths through 2015. Payment
incentives created in the ACA have also driven a substantial decline in the
rate at which patients return to hospital after discharge, corresponding to an
estimated 565,000 avoided readmissions from April 2010 through May 2015.

Chapter 5: Investing in Higher Education
The Obama Administration made great strides to help students
make more effective investments in higher education. To help expand
college opportunity, the President doubled investments in higher education affordability through Pell Grants and the American Opportunity Tax
Credit (AOTC). To help more students choose a college that provides a
worthwhile investment, the Administration provided more comprehensive
and accessible information about college costs and outcomes through the
College Scorecard, simplified the Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA), and protected students from low-quality schools through a package of important consumer protection regulations including the landmark
Gainful Employment regulations. To help borrowers manage debt after
college, income-driven repayment options like the President’s Pay as You
Earn (PAYE) plan have allowed borrowers to cap their monthly student loan
payments at as little as 10 percent of discretionary income to better align the
timing of student loan payments with the timing of earnings benefits from
attending college (Figure 1-13).
Moreover, Administration efforts to improve PreK-12 outcomes
have helped to better prepare students for success in college and in their
careers. The wide-ranging set of policies have included increasing funding
for educators in the Recovery Act; expanding funding for high-quality early
education programs; improving the research evidence base with Investing in
Innovation (i3) grants and better data systems; closing gaps in opportunity
with School Improvement Grants and other programs at disadvantaged
schools; and encouraging excellence for all students with higher standards
and stronger teaching.
The benefits of some of these policies are already evident, while many
more will be realized over the coming decades. For example, CEA analysis
finds that the Pell Grant expansions since 2008-09 enabled at least 250,000

Box 1-3: The Administration’s Record in the Technology Sector
The technological advancements of the 21st century, like cloud
computing, personalized medicine, and advanced materials, not only
improve our daily lives, but also have the potential to increase productivity growth, one of the most important factors in raising standards of living and incomes. The Obama Administration has been dedicated to laying the groundwork for technology to improve the lives of all Americans.
It has created and updated essential infrastructure for providing more
equitable access to technology and worked to modernize America’s
institutions so that they support, rather than inhibit, innovation. The
Administration has also placed a large emphasis on preparing Americans
for the 21st century economy. (For a discussion of the economic impact
of a number of these policies, see Chapter 5 of the 2014 Economic
Report of the President and Chapter 5 of the 2016 Economic Report of the
President.)
The Administration has worked to ensure that the technological
infrastructure is in place, and the rules of the road are set, so that all
Americans can benefit from technology. The American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act provided funding to deploy or upgrade more than
114,000 miles of new broadband infrastructure, consistent with the
President’s goal of enhancing consumer welfare, civic participation, education, entrepreneurial activity, and economic growth through greater
access to broadband. The Recovery Act financed additional broadband
projects totaling $2.9 billion, bringing high-speed Internet access to
260,000 more rural households, 17,500 businesses, and 1,900 community
facilities. Indeed, average home Internet speed in the United States has
tripled over the past four years.
In addition, the Administration has taken unprecedented action
to free up spectrum—the airwaves that carry our wireless communications—with Presidential Memoranda directing the Department of
Commerce, through the National Telecommunication and Information
Administration, to collaborate with the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) to make available 500 MHz of spectrum for mobile
broadband use by 2020 and to accelerate spectrum sharing efforts. The
Nation is halfway to the 500 MHz goal, thanks to the hard work of nearly
two dozen Federal agencies to free up spectrum for auction and innovative new plans to share the airwaves. The FCC’s 2015 spectrum auction
was its most successful ever, raising more than $40 billion in revenue
for the Federal Government while spurring the deployment of faster
wireless and mobile broadband. Thanks in large part to these efforts,
we have achieved the President’s 2011 State of the Union goal that more

48  |  Chapter 1

than 98 percent of Americans should have access to fast 4G/LTE mobile
broadband.
Further, the President supported FCC rules to protect net neutrality—the concept that Internet providers must treat all Internet traffic
equally. By putting into effect strong net neutrality rules, the FCC has
helped ensure that the Internet remains open, fair, and free.
In addition to updating physical infrastructure, the Administration
set about making sure that America’s institutions better support innovation. For example, the Administration recognized that the U.S. patent
system needed to be updated to address the needs of America’s entrepreneurs. From excessive wait times, to decreasing patent quality, to overly
aggressive Patent Assertion Entities, the patent system was doing more
to stifle innovation than promote it. The America Invents Act (AIA) of
2011 helped reform the patent system, leading to a 20 percent reduction
in patent wait times from 2011 to 2016 and establishing a tribunal-based
process for patent disputes, leading to an increase in patent quality.
These reforms help ensure that all entrepreneurs will have fair and easy
access to the patent system and increased incentives to innovate, supporting a roughly 30 percent increase in U.S. patents granted from 2011
to 2015 (Figure 1-iii).
Finally, President Obama prioritized education and training to
ensure that everyone is able to fully enjoy the benefits of today’s technological progress. Over half a million of today’s open jobs are in technology fields such as software development and cybersecurity—many of
which did not even exist a decade ago. The average salary in a job that
requires technology skills is 50 percent more than the average privatesector job. For this reason, the Administration has prioritized investing
in America’s youngest generation so that they have the necessary skills
to succeed in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.
The U.S. technology sector has thrived since 2009, with rapidly
growing new sectors like the “app economy,” rising valuations and venture capital for technology firms, robust growth in technology employment, and the positioning of major U.S. technology firms as global
leaders. And technology employment and investment are not limited
to the computer hardware, software, and Internet industries. Advanced
manufacturing, health care, and many other industries increasingly
employ software engineers and data specialists, and have seen parallel
improvements. These successes are due to the innovation and skills of
American businesses and workers, and the Administration has worked
to ensure that government has played its role to enable these successes.
Administration efforts have secured more than $1 billion in private
investment in STEM education and, since 2008, STEM degrees as a

share of total degrees awarded have grown 12.4 percent overall, and 20.3

American schools every year, a new record, and the Nation is 30 percent
of the way to achieving the President’s goal of training 100,000 new
STEM educators. Further, the Administration has helped workers get the
skills and training they need for jobs in the 21st century. The TechHire
initiative—which works to expand local tech sectors by providing training assistance through grants and public-private partnerships and has
now been rolled out to 50 communities with 600 employers participating—is actively drawing on people from all backgrounds, including
young adults who are disconnected from school and work, the long-term
unemployed, and those living in rural areas where access to technology
training is scarce. In support of TechHire, the Department of Labor
awarded 39 grants—totaling $150 million—for programs in 25 States
and Washington, DC to support innovative ways to get more than 18,000
participants on the fastest paths to well-paying jobs in in-demand sectors
such as information technology (IT), healthcare, advanced manufacturing, and financial services.

students to access or complete a college degree in 2014-15, leading to an
additional $20 billion in aggregate earnings. This represents a nearly twoto-one return on the investment. While more work remains, these policies
taken together represent a significant step forward in building an educational system that supports and encourages all Americans who wish to invest
in an affordable, high-quality college education to do so.

Chapter 6: Strengthening the Financial System
The 2007-08 financial crisis revealed a number of fault lines in the U.S.
financial system. Many banks were inadequately capitalized, did not have
enough liquidity, and took too many risks. Many non-bank financial firms
faced the same risks as banks, but lacked the same regulatory supervision
or protection against runs. In addition, gaps in the regulatory architecture
meant that financial regulators lacked a holistic view of the risks in the
system.
Responding quickly, the Obama Administration, Congress, and
Federal regulators addressed these failures by adopting necessary reforms to
the financial system. Financial reform included measures aimed to improve
the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions by not only
increasing their capital and liquidity but also decreasing risky behavior.

These reforms should increase the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks
arising from financial and economic stress. Other reforms included measures
aimed at reducing systemic risk in the financial system by bringing more
of the financial system under a regulatory umbrella, improving financial
regulatory coordination, and ensuring that individual financial institutions
can fail without derailing the system. Also included were specific measures
designed to increase transparency and accountability in financial markets in
addition to providing additional consumer and investor protections.
Financial reform has helped make the financial system more secure by
requiring financial firms to have less unstable funding, more liquid assets,
higher capital levels (Figure 1-14), and reduced risk-taking. The recovering
economy and implementation of financial reform have been accompanied
by strong performance of a wide variety of financial market indicators. Not
only have financial markets recovered from the losses suffered during the
crisis, but banks are healthier and stronger, regulators are on the lookout
for systemic risk, once-opaque derivatives markets are safer and more transparent, credit ratings agencies are subject to more effective oversight and
increased transparency, and investor protections have been strengthened.
The recovery of markets—particularly those that serve a core role in the
economy, such as equity and housing markets—is also an indicator of the

52  |  Chapter 1

success of the financial rescue and reform efforts in this Administration.
Banks and other financial institutions now face different rules designed to
make them safer and less of a threat to the overall system. In many ways,
these longer-run reforms have reshaped and ensured greater resilience in the
financial regulatory system of the United States.

Chapter 7: Addressing Climate Change
The Obama Administration has also demonstrated a commitment to
fighting climate change through a diverse set of policy approaches. In 2009,
the Administration made a historic investment of more than $90 billion in
clean energy in the Recovery Act, helping to spur both a dramatic increase
in clean energy capacity and advances in clean energy technology. The
President’s 2013 Climate Action Plan mapped out a new framework for the
transformation to a more energy-efficient economy with lower greenhouse
gas emissions. Related policies and initiatives included the first-ever Federal
greenhouse gas pollution standards for power plants, light-duty cars and
trucks, and commercial trucks, buses, and vans; investments in research and
development to support innovative clean energy technologies; enhanced
incentives for renewable energy and improvements in the energy efficiency
of homes and appliances; and stronger international cooperation to drive
down greenhouse gas emissions and limit increases in global temperatures.
The Administration has worked to ensure that environmental regulations
are undertaken in an efficient and cost-effective manner, as documented by
rigorous regulatory impact analysis.
The Administration’s policies have supported a considerable shift
toward clean energy resources. From 2008 to 2015, energy intensity, energy
consumed per dollar of real GDP, fell by 11 percent; carbon intensity, the
amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of energy consumed, declined by
8 percent; and, as a result, carbon dioxide emitted per dollar of GDP declined
by 18 percent. In fact, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector
fell by 9.5 percent from 2008 to 2015, and in the first six months of 2016 they
were at their lowest level in 25 years. This encouraging drop in carbon intensity was not anticipated, even as recently as 2010, and was driven both by
an increase in renewable energy and increased use of cleaner fossil fuels like
natural gas. CEA analysis shows that more than two-thirds of the decline in
emissions relative to 2008 can be attributed to decreased energy intensity (40
percent) and carbon intensity (29 percent), with the remaining 31 percent
of the emissions decline due to the lower-than-expected level of GDP after
unanticipated shocks such as the Great Recession (Figure 1-15).

Box 1-4: Administration Actions in the International Economy
The Obama Administration moved on several international fronts
to promote America’s prosperity and security. These include: global
policy leadership and cooperation; expanding opportunities for U.S.
businesses, farmers, entrepreneurs, and consumers through trade; and,
advocating for more inclusive global economic growth, development and
health, including in the most vulnerable areas of the world.
Global economic cooperation. Elevating the G-20 to be the premier forum for international economic cooperation was a critical part
of the Obama Administration’s economic strategy. The elevation of the
G-20 has advanced the goal of a more representative and inclusive global
economic governance, allowing leaders representing approximately 85
percent of global economic output to work together towards the shared
objective of strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive global growth.
The G-20 in turn worked to launch reforms that modernized and
strengthened the international financial architecture, including historic
recapitalization and reform across multilateral development banks
and commitment to reform of the quota and governance system of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). Taken together, these steps have

54  |  Chapter 1

reinforced U.S. leadership in the rules-based global economic system
that has prevailed since the end of World War II.
Within months of taking office, in April 2009, the President joined
the second-ever summit meeting of the G-20 leaders. At that time, the
global economy was shrinking for the first time in half a century as
the world dealt with the financial crisis and its aftershocks. Together,
the G-20 countries mobilized trillions of dollars in fiscal stimulus and
expanded the resources of the IMF and Multilateral Development Banks
by $1 trillion. The G-20 created the Financial Stability Board, which has
helped to coordinate the G-20’s financial reform agenda and to put in
place international policies to end “too-big-to-fail.” This has made the
global economy better able to weather financial shocks and to prevent
these shocks from causing broader economic damage on Main Street
and across borders. The G-20 countries agreed to refrain from beggarthy-neighbor competitive devaluation of currencies and to take actions
against tax havens and profit shifting. By 2016, both the U.S. and global
economies are substantially stronger than they were—though more work
remains to be done.
In addition to immediate crisis response, the G-20 is taking steps
to build a framework for strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive
growth in the long term. These have included commitments to increase
female labor force participation, phasing-out of fossil fuel subsidies,
implementing strategies to create jobs and boost investment, and commitments to promote sustainable development. In 2010, the Obama
Administration hosted the first meeting of G-20 labor and employment
ministers in Washington and committed to spur action to create quality
jobs, lift living standards, and promote broadly shared prosperity. Since
then, G-20 member nations have committed to bring more women into
the labor force, reduce income inequality, address youth unemployment,
and invest in workforce sustainable development, including through
quality apprenticeships and other measures. They have also improved
financial transparency and made significant progress to address corruption around the world.
Expanding opportunities for U.S. businesses, farmers, entrepreneurs, and consumers through trade. The United States has initiated
and strengthened high-standards trade agreements with countries across
the world, seeking to open foreign markets to U.S. goods and services
and ensure a level playing field for workers and businesses. At the same
time, U.S. consumers enjoy opportunities to shop from the world,
expanding their choices and stretching their budgets further.

•	 The Obama Administration lifted sanctions on Cuba and
Myanmar (formerly known as Burma), laying the path for increased
economic engagement and U.S. investment.
•	 The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement would eliminate over 18,000 tariffs, establish the highest labor and environmental
standards of any trade agreement in history, enhance opportunities
for small and medium enterprises, promote Internet-based commerce,
protect American workers and businesses from unfair competition from
foreign state-owned enterprises, and strengthen transparency and anticorruption.
Global development and health. President Obama has also
worked intensively to elevate global development as a central pillar of
our national security policy, on par with diplomacy and defense, as articulated in Presidential Policy Directive 6 on U.S. Global Development
Policy. In 2015, the United States joined the rest of the world in adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which sets out an
ambitious global development vision and priorities for the next 15 years
that strive to end extreme poverty and to prioritize policies and investments that have long-term, transformative impact. The Administration
has harnessed donor assistance, domestic resource mobilization, and
private-sector capital to promote the development agenda in health,
livelihoods, food security, and energy.
Programs building domestic resources have taken a variety of forms.
The Addis Tax Initiative, launched by the United States in July 2015, is
an example of how the Administration has worked to help developing
countries mobilize and effectively use their own domestic resources for
sustainable development. In a similar vein, the U.S. Government’s Feed
the Future program helped over 9 million smallholder farmers, food
producers, and rural families adopt innovations and new practices to
improve domestic agricultural productivity in 2015 alone. Also in 2015,
the President and the First Lady launched Let Girls Learn to address the
challenges preventing adolescent girls from obtaining a quality education and to empower them to reach their full potential, building crucial
human capital in vulnerable communities. In 2011, President Obama
joined with seven other heads of state to launch the Open Government

56  |  Chapter 1

Partnership (OGP), a global partnership between governments and
civil society to advance transparency and accountability, bolster citizen
engagement, and leverage new technologies to strengthen governance.
The Administration also has promoted new public- and privatesector efforts to harness cutting-edge technologies, including to accelerate research and scale innovations to support sustainable development.
In 2015 alone, USAID maintained over 360 active public-private
partnerships that, over their active lifetimes, have leveraged over $5.9
billion from the private sector and other partners. Through FY 2014, the
Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) supported more than
$35 billion in private investment in developing and emerging markets.
The Administration’s Power Africa initiative has successfully built a
broad coalition of more than 130 bilateral, multilateral, and privatesector partners who have collectively committed to invest more than $52
billion in the energy sector in sub-Saharan Africa, where two-thirds of
the population lack access to electricity.
The Administration also has fought aggressively for global health
by building on successful existing programs and launching new initiatives. President Obama built on the President’s Emergency Program for
AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) launched by President George W. Bush, bringing
the prospect of an AIDS-free generation within sight. Over the past 15
years, investments in the President’s Malaria Initiative, the Global Fund
to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, and other partnerships have
averted an estimated 6.2 million malaria deaths. In addition, the Obama
Administration has challenged the world to  end preventable child and
maternal deaths, and, since 2008, efforts by USAID have helped save the
lives of 4.6 million children and 200,000 mothers.

Four Continued Structural
Challenges: Productivity, Inequality,
Participation, and Sustainability
The Obama Administration has taken great strides in addressing
many structural barriers to inclusive growth over the last eight years, working to ensure both that growth is stronger in the future and that the benefits of this growth are more widely shared among American households.
However, these efforts have only started to address the structural obstacles
to future prosperity for middle-class families. Many of these barriers have
been decades in the making, and many are shared across a wide range of
advanced economies. Addressing four of these structural challenges—boosting productivity growth, combatting rising inequality, raising labor force

participation, and building a resilient economy that does not grow today at
the expense of the future—will be critical in the years ahead.

Productivity Growth
The single most important determinant of living standards, across
countries and over time, is labor productivity—the amount of output a
worker can produce in an hour of work. The evolution of labor productivity
growth in the United States since World War II can be roughly partitioned
into four regimes. Labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose
by an average of 2.8 percent a year between 1948 and 1973. Beginning in
the early 1970s, though, productivity growth slowed sharply, averaging only
1.4 percent annually between 1973 and 1995. Productivity growth did not
rebound meaningfully until the mid-1990s, when information technology
advanced at a startling rate. Productivity growth surged, rising 3.0 percent
at an annual rate between 1995 and 2005 in the nonfarm business sector.
However, from 2005 to 2015, labor productivity growth averaged just 1.3
percent a year, due to slowdowns in both capital deepening and in growth
in total factor productivity (a measure of how much output can be produced
from a given combination of labor and capital, with increases largely representing advancements in technology, management, and institutions).
The recent slowdown in productivity growth has also been seen in
other advanced economies. Average annual productivity growth in advanced
economies slowed to less than 1 percent from 2005 to 2015, roughly half the
rate of the previous decade—with productivity slowing in 30 of 31 advanced
economies, including all of the G-7 economies, as shown in Figure 1-16.
Despite its sharp slowdown, the United States has had the strongest record
in terms of productivity growth in the last decade among the G-7 economies.
Productivity growth is critical to the long-run health of the U.S. economy because it is a necessary component of both potential GDP growth and
real increases in household incomes, and thus living standards. A range of
policies can help boost labor productivity growth. These include increasing
public investment in infrastructure; providing greater funding for research
and development; reforming the business tax code to better incentivize
innovation and investment; promoting high-skilled immigration; continuing to improve education and worker training; and expanding trade, which
can boost innovation through the spread of ideas across borders, greater
specialization in innovative activities, access to larger markets by highproductivity firms, and expanded competition.

Income Inequality
In the long run, productivity growth is the most important factor in
increasing earnings. But income growth for households across much of the
distribution also depends on the degree to which economic gains are shared,
or, in other words, on the degree of income inequality. Here, too, the trend
among advanced economies has been unfortunately similar, with the majority seeing increased inequality in recent decades. However, the United States
has the highest levels of inequality, and has seen a faster increase in inequality, than any of the G-7 economies, as shown in Figure 1-17.
As discussed in Chapter 1 of the 2016 Economic Report of the President,
traditional economic explanations of inequality are grounded in competitive
markets, wherein workers receive wages commensurate with their productivity. According to this explanation, a combination of skill-biased technological change, a slowdown in the increase in educational attainment, and
globalization have increased the demand for highly skilled workers at the
same time that their relative supply has not kept pace—resulting in higher
wages for these workers and greater inequality. However, a growing body of
evidence has pointed to economic rents as a potential additional source of
inequality. Rents occur whenever capital owners or workers receive more
income than they would require to undertake their production or work.

Rents could play a role in rising inequality either to the degree that the division of rents is becoming increasingly unequal or to the degree that they are
increasing and being captured by capital or by high earners (Furman and
Orszag 2015).
Despite the historic progress in rolling back rising inequality over the
last eight years described above, more work remains to combat high levels
of inequality in the United States in both pre-tax-and-transfer and after-taxand-transfer incomes. Policies like expanded access to quality education,
increasing the minimum wage, providing greater support for collective bargaining and other forms of worker voice, and reforming barriers to mobility
like occupational licensing requirements and land-use restrictions to reduce
rents can all play a role in reducing inequality. Meanwhile, making the fiscal
system more progressive by, for example, expanding tax credits for lowincome workers financed by higher tax rates on high-income households
would reduce inequality in after-tax incomes. A growing body of evidence
has also found that a more progressive fiscal system does not just increase
after-tax incomes for low- and moderate-income households; when fiscal
transfers (such as programs for health, nutrition, cash assistance, and housing support) are focused on children, they can also increase future earnings
and educational outcomes (Furman and Ruffini 2015).
60  |  Chapter 1

Labor Force Participation
Household incomes also depend on the labor force participation rate:
the share of the adult population working or actively in search of work. In
recent years, the participation rate has faced substantial downward pressure
from the aging of the U.S. population as members of the baby-boom generation begin to retire. This demographic trend implies a decrease in the overall
participation rate of about a quarter of a percentage point a year. However,
the participation rate has been broadly stable since the end of 2013, as the
strong recovery of the U.S. labor market has pulled workers into the labor
force and offset the downward pressure from the aging of the population.
But the United States faces an additional long-run challenge of declining participation among “prime-age” workers, those between the ages of
25 and 54. This troubling pattern in labor force participation goes back
for more than a half-century for men and about a decade and a half for
women. In 1953, 3 percent of prime-age men did not participate in the labor
force. In November 2016, the fraction stood at 12 percent (Figure 1-18a).
Nonparticipation has been even higher in recent years for men with less educational attainment: in 2015, 17 percent of prime-age men with a high school
degree or less did not participate in the workforce. Meanwhile, 25 percent of
prime-age women do not participate in the labor force today, compared to
23 percent in 1999 (Figure 1-18b). Over the second half of the 20th century,
the decline in prime-age male labor force participation was largely obscured
in aggregate data by rising female participation and favorable demographics. But as the trend for prime-age women plateaued and then reversed,
the impact of declining prime-age participation on the overall labor force
participation rate has been far clearer in recent years. (For an expanded
discussion of the decline in prime-age labor force participation, see Box 2-3.)
The reduced participation rate for prime-age workers in the United
States presents a number of challenges, both for these workers’ long-term
employment prospects and well-being and for the U.S. macroeconomy.
Policies to help boost participation include strengthening the “connective
tissue” in the U.S. labor markets by, for example, modernizing the unemployment insurance system and expanding wage insurance; promoting work
by expanding tax credits for low-income workers and raising the minimum
wage; and increasing workplace flexibility by increasing access to paid leave
and affordable child care.

Economic Sustainability
Even as work remains to boost productivity growth and labor force
participation and to combat rising inequality, the Nation must take a

number of steps to ensure that economic growth is sustainable and does not
come at the expense of future prosperity.
Given the current strong position of the U.S. economy in the business
cycle, steps should be taken to protect against future recessions, helping to
ensure that just as we avoided a second Great Depression, we are able to
avoid a second Great Recession. In particular, modifying the design of automatic stabilizers like unemployment insurance such that they are automatically expanded or extended during downturns would provide better countercyclical support for the economy during recessions (CEA and DOL 2014;
Furman 2016b). Moreover, as demonstrated by the Obama Administration’s
efforts, it is possible to combine short-run fiscal expansion with mediumand long-run fiscal consolidation to maintain fiscal discipline. Further curbs
to the growth of entitlement costs that build on the ACA’s progress in reducing health care costs, as well as limiting tax breaks for those at the top of the
income distribution, can also help address our long-term fiscal challenges
without sacrificing investments in growth and opportunity.
Finally, sustainable economic growth also requires addressing both
the short- and long-run effects of climate change, which presents large risks
not just to our environment but also to economic growth and fiscal sustainability. As discussed above, the Administration has taken ambitious steps to
reduce carbon emissions and move toward a clean energy economy, including agreeing to reduce net emissions to between 26 and 28 percent of their
2005 level by 2025 in the historic Paris Agreement (Figure 1-19). But more
work remains to ensure that the effects of manmade climate change do not
endanger future prosperity. As President Obama has acknowledged, even
as the Paris accord has established an enduring framework for confronting
the climate crisis, its ambitious goals are not sufficient. More will need to be
done to invent new technologies, generate energy from low-carbon sources,
and reduce the energy and carbon intensity of our economy so that damage
from climate change does not undermine the economy and living standards
in the future. As the last eight years have demonstrated, efficient policies
tailored to fight climate change can be implemented in ways that support,
and do not hinder, economic growth.

Conclusion
The actions undertaken by the Obama Administration in the midst of
the crisis not only helped prevent a second Great Depression, they set the
U.S. economy on a path to becoming stronger, more resilient, and better
positioned to face the economic challenges of the 21st century. In the pages
that follow, the 2017 Economic Report of the President reviews the efforts of

the Obama Administration to ensure economic growth that is both robust
and broadly shared among all American families. As the Nation emerges
from the shadow of the Great Recession, promoting inclusive, sustainable
growth will remain the key objective in the years ahead. While several structural challenges for shared growth remain, the experience of the past eight
years shows that, by acting decisively and by choosing the right policies,
the United States can build a stronger and more prosperous economy for
generations to come.

THE YEAR IN REVIEW AND
THE YEARS AHEAD

he U.S. economy continued to grow in 2016, as the recovery extended
into its seventh year with strong gains in employment and real wages,
low inflation, and moderate output growth. Robust employment growth and
moderate output growth imply low labor productivity growth, an important
challenge in the years ahead. Strong employment gains along with rising real
wages in 2016 were a continuation of the trends in 2015 that helped contribute to the fastest real median income growth on record and, in conjunction,
a falling poverty rate.
Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 1.8
percent during the first three quarters of 2016 (the latest data available as this
Report goes to press), down slightly from the 1.9-percent growth during the
four quarters of 2015.1 During the first three quarters of 2016, real consumer
spending, which grew at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, exceeded real GDP
growth as personal saving rates fell. Residential investment contributed
positively to overall real GDP growth in the last quarter of 2015 and the
first quarter of 2016, but subtracted from growth in the second and third
quarters of 2016. The weakness in residential investment is surprising given
the solid fundamentals: low mortgage interest rates, favorable demographic
trends, rising real wages, and rising house prices. Business fixed investment
contracted in the last quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, but has
since returned to contributing positively, though weakly, to overall growth.
Inventory investment—one of the most volatile components of GDP—subtracted from GDP during the five quarters prior to 2016:Q3, in particular in
2016:Q2, before rebounding in the third quarter. Net exports contributed
positively to growth in each of the first three quarters of 2016 after subtracting from growth in in the four quarters of 2014 and 2015. Government

Reports of the President were finalized in February.

purchases have been roughly neutral in their effect on overall GDP during
the first three quarters of 2016.
The economy added 2.3 million jobs during the 12 months ended
in November 2016, extending the streak of consecutive months of positive
nonfarm employment growth to 74 months. During the 12 months ended
in November 2016, nonfarm job growth has averaged 188,000 a month,
a somewhat more moderate pace than during 2014 and 2015, but similar
to the strong pace during 2011-13. The unemployment rate was down 0.4
percentage point during the 12 months ended in November to 4.6 percent
(Figure 2-1). The labor force participation rate during the 12 months
ended in November 2016 averaged 0.14 percentage point higher than its
2015 average as the labor market continued to strengthen. The labor force
participation rate had been falling since 2008 due to the aging of the population into retirement, cyclical factors, and other long-term trends, but it has
rebounded slightly to its 2014 level as the strengthening labor market offset
some demographic trends.
Inflation remained low with consumer price inflation, as measured
by the consumer price index (CPI), at only 1.6 percent over the 12 months
ended in October 2016. Low energy prices continue to restrain overall inflation. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy, increased 2.1 percent
over the 12 months ended in October. Over the same period, core personal
consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation increased 1.7 percent, remaining
below the Federal Reserve’s 2-percent target for overall PCE inflation. Real
average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers rose
0.9 percent over the 12 months ended in October, as nominal wage growth
continued to exceed the subdued pace of price inflation, building upon the
2.2-percent gain experienced during 2015 (Figure 2-2). Real median household income increased 5.2 percent in 2015, the fastest growth on record.
Households at all income percentiles reported by the Census Bureau saw real
gains in income, with the largest gains among households at the bottom of
the income distribution.
Challenges remain for 2017 and the longer term, including uncertain prospects for global growth, the low rate of productivity growth, and
constraints posed by slowing trend growth in the labor force due to demographic shifts.
The economic recovery that continued in 2016 has been characterized
by a robust labor market but modest output growth. The labor market continued to strengthen and, by November 2016, the unemployment rate had
fallen to half its peak in October 2009, but the 1.6-percent real output growth
during the four quarters ended in 2016:Q3, was slower than its pace in recent
years. The dissonance between the robust labor market and moderate output

growth reflects slow labor productivity growth during this business cycle
relative to its long-term average. Foreign growth showed signs of stabilizing,
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expecting real output growth
over the four quarters of 2016 to be 3.1 percent, the same pace as in 2015 (IMF
2016b). However, the 3.1-percent pace of global growth in 2016 is below the
year-earlier expectations (3.6 percent), with slower-than-forecasted growth
in both advanced and emerging markets (IMF 2015b). Slow global growth
has been a headwind for U.S. exports in recent years (continuing through
2016), especially for U.S. manufacturing, which constitutes 60 percent of
U.S. exports, as well as for global trade. However, the outlook is improving
in emerging markets with India’s growth continuing at a fast pace and with
Brazil and Russia likely to return to positive growth in 2017.
The Administration expects real GDP to grow at 2.4 percent during
the four quarters of 2017, and 2.2 percent in the long-term, a forecast based
on a baseline that assumes enactment of the President’s policy proposals. In
2017, consumer spending is expected to continue to support solid growth,
along with a pickup in foreign demand. The unemployment rate is projected
to fall slightly from its projected fourth-quarter rate of 4.9 percent. Inflation,
as measured by the price index for GDP and which was only 1.3 percent during the four quarters through 2016:Q3, is forecasted to creep up gradually to
2 percent, and then to remain at that pace thereafter. The yield on ten-year
Treasury notes is projected to edge up from its third quarter level of 1.6 percent toward 3.7 percent in the mid-2020s, partly due to inflation increasing
and term premiums returning to more-normal levels.

Policy Developments
Fiscal Policy
Fiscal restraint in the United States continued in fiscal year (FY) 2016
with the Federal Budget deficit (expressed as a share of nominal GDP) rising
a moderate 0.7 percentage point to 3.2 percent. The deficit-to-GDP ratio is
about equal to the average over the past 40 years, and has fallen by 67 percent
since FY 2009. The Federal deficit-to-GDP ratio had declined 1.9 percentage points a year from FY 2012 to FY 2014, but has flattened out in the
2-to-3 percent of GDP range in FY 2015 and FY 2016 under Administration
policies.
The President signed three pieces of significant fiscal legislation in
2015. The first was the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) of 2015, signed in
October, which set discretionary spending limits for the FY 2016 and FY
2017, providing a moderate $80 billion in total sequestration relief, thus
68  |  Chapter 2

allowing for additional investments in education, job training, research, and
health care, as well as postponing reaching the statutory limit on the Federal
debt (Somanader 2015). Second, the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation
(FAST) Act signed into law in December 2015 funded surface transportation
including roads, bridges, and rail for five years, authorizing $306 billion in
spending—or an increase of roughly 4 percent in highway investment and 7
percent in transit investment in real terms—while increasing predictability
of funding (CEA 2016b). Third, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes
(PATH) Act signed into law in December 2015 ensured that the expansions
enacted in 2009 of the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit,
and the American Opportunity Tax Credit (which provides a tax credit
for students in higher education) are permanent features of the tax code.
These tax credits now provide tax cuts of about $1,000 for about 24 million
families each year (Leibenluft 2015). The PATH Act also made permanent
tax incentives for investment in research and experimentation and small
business investment (through expensing capital purchases). In addition, in
September 2016, Congress approved a spending bill funding the government
through December 9 and provided $1.1 billion in the fight against Zika, as
well as additional funding for military infrastructure and housing.

Federal
Over the four quarters ended in 2016:Q3, real Federal purchases
grew 1.1 percent. At the Federal level, government purchases—including
consumption and gross investment—contributed weakly, but positively, to
four-quarter GDP growth (0.1 percentage point), approximately the same as
during the four quarters of 2015. This modest contribution is accounted for
by decreases in other spending which partly offset the sequester relief under
the BBA. On a quarterly basis, real Federal purchases can be volatile (Figure
2-3). Federal purchases picked up in the third quarter after falling in the first
two quarters of 2016.
State and Local
After strong contributions to real GDP during the four quarters
of 2015, State and local government purchases—consumption plus gross
investment—are on track to have a negligible impact in 2016. Real State
and local government purchases contracted 0.2 percent in the four-quarters
ended in 2016:Q3, after growing 2.5 percent during the four-quarters of
2015 (Figure 2-3).
The State and local share of nominal GDP fell from its historical peak
of 13.0 percent in 2009 to 11.0 percent in 2016, a level not seen since the
late 1980s, as State and local governments cut their purchases in the face of

The Year in Review and the Years Ahead  |  69

budget pressures (Box 2-1).2 In 2016, State and local government purchases
were about 60-percent larger than Federal purchases and three-times larger
than Federal nondefense purchases (Figure 2-4). The roughly 90,000 state
and local governments employ roughly 13 percent of nonfarm workers,
and added about 159 thousand jobs in the twelve months ended November
2016. Changes in State and local purchases can be as important as changes
in Federal purchases.

Monetary Policy
In December 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage point,
ending seven years with the effective federal funds rate maintained at a level
just above the zero lower bound. The FOMC’s decision to tighten monetary
policy was based on its judgment that labor markets had improved considerably and that it was reasonably confident that inflation would move up over
the medium term to its 2-percent objective. Through the first 11 months
of 2016, the FOMC did not raise the target range for the federal funds rate.
As was the case in previous years, the Federal Reserve’s realized pace
of raising rates in 2016 was below the median forecasted pace of FOMC
participants at the close of the previous year. In December 2015, the median
of FOMC participant projections was four 25-basis point rate hikes in 2016.
In March 2016, the median forecast of the federal funds rate from FOMC
participants for the end of 2016 fell to 0.9 percent, implying just two hikes
in 2016. Throughout 2016, the FOMC continued to maintain the target
range for the federal funds rate at between 0.25 and 0.50 percent, as inflation
remained below target, U.S. economic growth was subdued, global growth
prospects remained weak, and some financial market turmoil emerged in
early 2016. Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in June introduced
more uncertainty about global growth and financial conditions. Throughout
the year, the market-implied federal funds rate for the end of 2016 was
below the median forecast of FOMC participants at the time. Importantly,
the FOMC emphasized throughout the year that monetary policy is not on
a “preset path”3 and that the projections of FOMC participants are only an
indication of what they view as the most likely path of interest rates given
beliefs on the future path of the economy.
2 Forty-nine out of fifty states have constitutions or statutes mandating a balanced budget and
many local governments have similar provisions (National Conference of State Legislatures
2010). This does not prevent them from running deficits. Many of those balanced budget
statutes apply only to the operating budget, while deficits may be allowed on their capital
accounts. Also, spending from “rainy day funds” appears as a deficit on the government
balance sheet in the national income and product accounts.

Box 2-1: Challenges in the State and Local Sector
During the current expansion, growth in State and local purchases
has been the weakest of any business-cycle recovery in the post-World
War II period (Figure 2-i). Although in a typical recovery State and
local spending tends to grow quickly and at a similar pace as in the prerecession period, in the current business cycle, State and local spending
sharply contracted and, after seven years, has still not rebounded to
its pre-crisis levels. During the four quarters of 2010, State and local
purchases subtracted 0.5 percentage point from GDP growth, and then
subtracted about another 0.3 percentage point in both 2011 and 2012.
Spending in this sector stabilized in 2013, added modestly to GDP
growth during the four quarters of 2014 and 2015, and had a negligible
impact on GDP during the three quarters of 2016.
Real State and local government consumption expenditures, gross
investment (particularly investment in structures), and employment
(particularly in the education sector) remain below their pre-crisis levels
(Figure 2-ii). Real State and local government consumption expenditures—which consists of spending to produce and provide services to
the public, largely public school education—remains 2.8 percent below
its peak in 2009:Q3. Real State and local government gross investment—
which consists of spending for fixed assets that directly benefit the

public, largely highway construction and maintenance—remains 17.3
percent below its peak in 2009:Q2.
As of November 2016, the roughly 90,000 State and local governments have added 371 thousand jobs since January 2013. Even so,
employment in this sector remains 367 thousand below its previous high
in July 2008, with almost half of this net job loss in educational services.
The 1.7-percent decline in education employment exceeded the 1.0-percent decline in the school-age population (ages 5 to 19) over the 2008-15
period. This disparity implies a rising student-teacher ratio.
Despite some recovery in 2016, there are still factors likely to
restrain State and local spending growth. State and local governments
continue to spend more than they collect in revenues, and their aggregate deficit during the first three quarters of 2016 amounted to about 1
percent of GDP. This deficit has shrunk, however, during the recovery
(Figure 2-iii). During 2016, State and local expenditures (including
transfers and interest payments, as well as purchases) were roughly flat
at about 14 percent of GDP, and revenues held at about 13 percent of
GDP. Until 1990, State and local governments only ran deficits during
recessions. Since then, State and local governments have frequently run
deficits.

obligations—place a burden on finances for many State and local governments. Unfunded liabilities, measured on a net-present value basis, equal
the difference between liabilities (the amount the governments owe in
benefits to current employees who have already accrued benefits they
will collect in the future) and assets held in public pension funds, and
indicate the amount of benefits accrued for which no money is set aside.
The size of these unfunded pension liabilities relative to State and local
receipts ballooned immediately after the recession driven by a combination of factors, including underfunding and lower-than-expected investment returns, and remain elevated at a level that was about 80 percent
of a year’s revenue in the first three quarters of 2016. Assets may fall
short of liabilities when governments do not contribute the full annual
required contribution (ARC), when they increase benefits retroactively,
or when returns on investments are lower than assumed. Additionally,
unfunded liabilities can grow if actuaries’ assumptions do not hold
true. For example, if beneficiaries live longer than anticipated, they will
receive more benefits than predicted, even if the government has been
paying the ARC consistently. Unfunded liabilities will eventually require
the government employer to increase revenue, reduce benefits or other
government spending, or do some combination of these.

74  |  Chapter 2

The size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at the end of November
2016 was $4.45 trillion—over five times its size at the end of 2006, largely
reflecting several large-scale asset purchase programs (quantitative easing)
from 2008 to 2014, which are estimated to have lowered long-term interest
rates by about a percentage point (Ihrig et al. 2012; D’Amico et al. 2012;
Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider 2015).4 Since the conclusion of its largescale asset purchase program in 2014, however, the Federal Reserve’s asset
holdings have remained at $4.4 trillion as maturing bonds were replaced
with purchases of new issues.
In recent years, FOMC participants have tended to lower their estimates of the longer-run level for the federal funds rate. As of September, the
median of FOMC participants’ projections of the long-run federal funds rate
was 2.9 percent, down from 3.5 percent in December 2015. The downward
revisions are consistent with downward trends in long-term interest rates in
U.S. and global financial markets.
The natural rate of interest is the real interest rate that should prevail
when the economy is producing at its long-run potential level and has
attained full employment. Both cyclical factors (such as unconventional
monetary policies, fiscal austerity measures, and private sector deleveraging) and structural factors (such as slowing productivity growth, changing
demographics) could be contributing to the decline in the natural rate of
interest.5 An interest-rate decline implies that monetary policy may now
have less room to provide accommodation during recessions than in the past
because it has less room to lower rates.6 In light of this, some have argued
that stabilization policy could benefit from greater use of countercyclical fiscal policy and perhaps changes in the approach to monetary policy such as
targeting nominal GDP or adopting a higher inflation target.7

4 See Ihrig et al. (2012) for a discussion of how interest rates paid on excess reserves and
overnight reverse repurchase agreement have replaced open market operations—the buying
and selling of Treasury securities—as the way in which the Federal Reserve achieves its target
policy rate.
5 See CEA 2015d for a survey on the nature and sources of the decline in long-term interest
rates.
6 Yellen (2016b) has argued that a low equilibrium federal funds rate does not mean that the
Federal Reserve’s current toolkit will be ineffective. She points out that a recent paper using
simulations from a Federal Reserve model finds that forward guidance and asset purchases
should be sufficient to combat most recessions “even if the average level of the federal funds
rate in the future is only 3 percent.”

Labor Market
The labor market continued to improve in 2016, with many measures
of labor-market performance having recovered to, or near to, their pre-recession levels. From November 2015 to November 2016, the economy added
2.3 million jobs, continuing the longest streak of total job growth on record.
American businesses have now added 15.6 million jobs since private-sector
job growth turned positive in March 2010, and the unemployment rate has
fallen to 4.6 percent, cut by more than half from its peak in October 2009.
Moreover, the pace of nominal earnings growth picked up in 2016, with
average hourly earnings up at a 2.7 percent annual rate through November
2016. This progress has translated into broad-based gains, but some slack
likely remains in the labor market, including a somewhat elevated rate of
those who are working part-time but would like to work full time.
Private employment increased by 2.0 million jobs from November
2015 to November 2016, after rising by 2.7 million jobs in 2015 (Figure 2-5).
Over the 12 months through November 2016, more than half of private-sector job gains came from “professional and business services” and “education
and health services,” both of which have been major drivers of job growth
in this recovery. These sectors account for a large part of growth despite
making up only about 35 percent of private-sector jobs in the economy.
Education and health services added 581,000 jobs in the 12 months through
November 2016 and professional and business services added 571,000 jobs,
consistent with its growth over the course of this recovery.
Despite overall strength, particularly in the services sector, some
industries faced specific headwinds that held down growth in 2016. Mining,
which includes oil and gas extraction, lost 87,300 jobs in the 12 months
through November 2016, largely due to industry cutbacks in the face of the
sharp fall in oil prices, and reverted to its employment level at the beginning
of the labor market recovery in early 2010 (Box 2-2). Manufacturing also
experienced a weak year, losing 54,000 jobs or 0.44 percent, likely reflecting
dampened demand for U.S. exports, which are disproportionately composed
of manufactured goods, amid slow and declining growth among our trading
partners. In fact, after excluding the mining and manufacturing sectors, job
growth since 2014 has been at its strongest since the late 1990s.
The labor market’s improvement was apparent in the continued
decline of the unemployment rate. By November 2016, the unemployment
rate had fallen to 4.6 percent, declining an average of 0.9 percentage point
a year from 2010 to 2016, and dropping below its pre-recession average

of 5.3 percent earlier than most forecasters expected.8 As of March 2014,
economists generally expected the unemployment rate to remain above 5.0
percent until at least 2020 (Figure 2-6). Many economists have revised down
their estimates of the “natural” rate of unemployment as unemployment
fell to low levels without an accompanying increase in the inflation rate.
Still, given today’s low unemployment rate, further declines are expected to
moderate during 2017.
Although the overall unemployment rate was below its pre-recession
average and mirrored other indicators of labor-market strength in November
2016, some indicators of labor-market slack remained above their pre-recession levels. For example, the long-term unemployment rate, or the share of
those unemployed for 27 weeks or more, was 1.2 percent in November 2016,
roughly its lowest point since 2008 but above its pre-recession average of 1.0
percent (Figure 2-7). If the long-term unemployment rate continues to fall
at the same pace as it has over the past year, it will reach its pre-recession
average in 2017. Looking historically across recoveries, the long-term unemployment rate is typically among the last labor-market indicators to return
to normal (CEA 2010).
Similarly, the share of the labor force working part-time for economic reasons (those working part-time but who would prefer full-time

Box 2-2: Oil Prices and Employment in Related Industries
Oil prices were more than 100 dollars-per-barrel as recently as
September 2014. While the decline in oil prices has benefitted consumers
and the economy overall, it has weighed heavily on mining employment,
which includes oil and gas extraction. (See Box 2-1 of the 2016 Report
or CEA 2015c for a more in-depth discussion of the impact of oil price
declines on spending and production). Employment in the mining
industry fell 26 percent from September 2014 to November 2016, though
the pace of decline has slowed in recent months as the price of oil has
stabilized. Oil and gas workers make up about 60 percent of the mining
industry; though, they represent just 0.3 percent of total U.S. nonfarm
employment. The level of mining employment is closely correlated
with the price of oil, with shifts in employment usually following price
changes (Figure 2-iv). Since 2000, mining employment has been most
closely correlated with the lagged price of oil, suggesting that the stabilization in oil prices in the 40-50 dollar-per-barrel range since April 2016
may translate into a stabilization of employment in this sector in 2017.
Employment in the mining sector is more directly correlated with
the oil and gas rig count—a measure that reflects the rate of drilling for
new oil and natural gas—which also tend to lag oil prices. The rig count

fell 80 percent from September 2014 to May 2016, but has grown since
May. The partial rebound in the rig count has moderated the decline
in mining employment, which has edged down 0.9 percent from June
to November. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) forecasted in
November that U.S. natural gas production during 2016 will fall 1.9
percent below its 2015 pace, which would be the first decline in average
annual production since 2005 (EIA 2016). However, the EIA expects
U.S. natural gas production to increase 3.8 percent in 2017.

employment), while falling steadily, remained above its pre-recession average through November 2016 and could indicate continued underutilization
of labor. Between December 2007 and December 2009, the share of the
labor force working part-time rose from 15.7 to 18.0 percent, driven by a
large rise in the share of people working part-time for economic reasons. As
the recovery progressed, the share of the labor force working part-time for
economic reasons began to recede and, in 2016, fell a further 0.3 percentage point (Figure 2-8)9. As of November, the rate stood at 3.6 percent, 2.4
percentage points below its peak in 2010, but still above its pre-recession
average of 3.0 percent.
The persistence in the rate of part-time work for economic reasons,
especially relative to other measures of slack, is largely responsible for the
continued elevation of the U-6 “underemployment” rate. The underemployment rate uses a broader concept of labor market slack than the official
unemployment rate (also known as U-3), by including discouraged workers
who have given up looking for a job, others who are marginally attached
to the labor force, and those employed part-time for economic reasons. In
November 2016, the U-6 rate was 9.3 percent, 7.8 percentage points below
its recession peak, but still 0.2 percentage points above its pre-recession
average. In the 12 months through November 2016, the U-6 rate declined
0.6 percentage point (Figure 2-9).
The labor force participation rate has been roughly stable since
October 2013. By CEA estimates, demographic pressure from the aging of
9 Care must be taken when comparing the share of workers who are part-time for economic
reasons before and after the 1994 redesign of the Current Population Survey. CEA used the
multiplicative adjustment factors reported by Polivka and Miller (1998) in order to place the
pre-1994 estimates of the part-time for economic reasons rate on a comparable basis with postredesign estimates. For the part-time series for which Polivka and Miller do not report suitable
adjustment factors, the pre- and post-redesign series were spliced by multiplying the pre-1994
estimates by the ratio of the January 1994 rate to the December 1993 rate. This procedure
generates similar results to the Polivka and Miller factors for series for which multiplicative
factors are available.

Box 2-3: Male Prime-Age Labor Force Participation1
Labor force participation among American men between the ages
of 25 and 54, or “prime-age men,” has been declining for more than
60 years, from a peak of 98 percent in 1954 to 89 percent today. More
recently, over the last 15 years, labor force participation has also declined
among prime-age women. These trends have troubling implications not
only for overall economic growth, but also for individuals, as prolonged
joblessness is linked to worse economic prospects, lower overall wellbeing and happiness, and higher mortality, as well as negative consequences for families and communities.
The United States has had the second largest decrease in primeage male participation rates among the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries since 1990. Today, the
United States has the third lowest labor force participation rate in that
group. Participation has fallen among every birth cohort of prime-age
men over time, and the decline has been steeper among less-educated
men and among black men. Three classes of explanations for this
decline—supply driven, demand driven, and institutional—are explored
in turn below.
Reductions in labor supply—in other words, prime-age men
choosing not to work for a given set of labor market conditions—explain
relatively little of the long-run trend. Data show that nonparticipating
prime-age men are actually less reliant than in the past on income from
spouses or from government assistance. Among prime-age men who are
not in the labor force, the share receiving government assistance (excluding Social Security benefits) peaked at about 50 percent in 1975 and has
since halved to roughly 25 percent in 2015. In addition, nearly 36 percent
of these men lived in poverty in 2014—up from 28 percent in 1968. These
patterns cast doubt on the hypothesis that nonparticipation represents a
choice enabled by other personal means or income sources.
In contrast, reductions in the demand for labor, especially for
lower-skilled men, appear to be an important driver of the decline in
prime-age male labor force participation. Consistent with a decline in
demand for the labor of less-educated men, the drop in participation
has been particularly steep for this group (Figure 2-v) and has coincided
with a fall in their wages relative to more-educated men. CEA analysis
suggests that when the returns to work for those at the bottom of the
wage distribution are particularly low, more prime-age men choose not
to participate in the labor force. These relative wage declines are likely
due to multiple factors, including a broader evolution of technology,
1 Analysis in this section is from CEA (2016e). See the report for further discussion on this
topic.

automation, and globalization in the U.S. economy and, possibly, also an
increase in the wage-setting power of firms (CEA 2016d).
Institutional factors also appear to be important—and may help
explain some of the differences in the U.S. experience both over time
and compared with other countries. For example, the United States
spends only 0.1 percent of GDP on “active labor market policies” such
as job-search assistance and job training that help keep unemployed
workers connected to the labor force. This is less than nearly every other
OECD country and much less than the OECD average of 0.6 percent
of GDP. The rapid rise in incarceration may have also played a role,
disproportionately affecting low-skilled men and men of color. Although
incarcerated men are not counted in the labor force, formerly incarcerated men are in the labor force and they are more likely to experience
joblessness after they are released from prison and, in many states, are
legally barred from a large number of jobs. For example, according to
the American Bar Association, over 1,000 mandatory exclusions bar
individuals with records of misdemeanors from professions requiring
licenses and nearly 3,000 exclusions barring those with felony records
(American Bar Association 2016).
A number of policies proposed by the Administration would help
to boost prime-age male labor force participation. These include, but are
not limited to, creating new job opportunities for less-educated prime-

assistance and give workers more flexibility to use benefits to integrate
into a new job; insuring workers against earnings losses; reforming the
U.S. tax system to make participation in the workforce easier; investing in education and reforming the criminal justice and immigration
systems; and increasing wages for workers by raising the minimum
wage, supporting collective bargaining, and ensuring that workers have
a strong voice in the labor market.

the baby-boom cohorts into retirement would have been expected to lower
the participation rate by roughly 0.25 percentage point a year, and so this
stabilization is consistent with a strengthening economy that has brought
people into, and kept people attached to, the workforce. Between 2007 and
November 2016, the labor force participation rate fell 3.3 percentage points.
CEA analysis finds that nearly three-quarters of this decline was due to the
aging of the baby-boom generation into retirement. These demographicrelated declines will become steeper in the near term, as the peak of the babyboom generation retires. Cyclical factors, including the lingering effects of
high long-term unemployment rates in the wake of the Great Recession, also
played a role in reducing the labor force participation rate and may still be
having a small impact. The remaining decline of the labor force participation rate beyond what can be accounted for by demographics likely reflects
structural factors, including the longstanding downward trend in participation among prime-age workers, particularly among males but also among
females for the past decade-and-a-half (Box 2-3). As demographic shifts
and longer-term trends continue to be offset by further cyclical recovery,
the participation rate is expected to remain flat in 2017 before resuming its
downward trend in 2018.
	 The Administration has proposed policies to support labor force
participation through a range of measures that include promoting more
flexible workplaces and paid leave, expanded high-quality pre-school,
increased subsidies for child care, and a new proposal for a wage insurance
system that would encourage reentry into work. As the recovery in the labor
market progresses, the pace of job growth is likely to fall as the unemployment rate begins to plateau, particularly in light of increased retirements of
an aging population.

Output
Real GDP grew 1.6 percent over the four quarters ended in 2016:Q3,
somewhat below its pace in recent years. Real GDP grew somewhat slower
than the 1.8 percent annual rate posted by gross domestic output (GDO)—an
average of GDP and gross domestic income that is generally a more accurate
measure of output than GDP—during the four quarters through 2016:Q3.10
The overall composition of demand during the first three quarters
of 2016 shows that most of the growth was accounted for by strong growth
in consumer spending, which was partially offset by declines in inventory
investment. Contributions from other sectors were generally small. Real
consumer spending growth outpaced overall growth, expanding 2.7 percent
during the four quarters ended 2016:Q3.
Business fixed investment (non-residential fixed investment) was sluggish, declining 1.4 percent in the four quarters through 2016:Q3. Growth in
business investment was hurt by the sharp declines in oil-related investment,
which fell 45 percent in the four quarters ended 2016:Q3. Overall, despite
weakness in equipment and structures spending, business investment was
supported by growth in intellectual property products. Indeed, research and
development spending as a share of GDP grew to over 2.6 percent, its highest
share since 1992.
Growth in domestic demand was resilient in 2016, while diminishing
foreign growth was a headwind. The aggregate of consumption and private
fixed investment, known as private domestic final purchases (PDFP), rose
faster than overall output at 2.0 percent in the four quarters ended 2016:Q3
(Figure 2-10). The solid pace of PDFP growth in 2016, which is typically a
better predictor of future output growth than GDP growth, suggests that
near-term U.S. growth prospects are positive. Nevertheless, CEA expects
that the components of real GDP that are not in PDFP, such as net exports,
will hold back overall real GDP growth in 2017. Despite weak foreign growth
and a strong dollar, net exports contributed positively to growth over the
four quarters ended in 2016:Q3.

Consumer Spending
Real consumer spending increased 2.7 percent during the four quarters through 2016:Q3. Stronger growth in real disposable income, due in
part to rising nominal wages and to the direct impact of lower oil prices, as
well as upbeat consumer sentiment and earlier gains in household wealth
10 Research has shown that GDO can be especially helpful in predicting future revisions to
GDP (CEA 2015a). GDO growth is initially estimated to be faster than GDP growth, GDP
growth tends to revise up and vice versa (Box 2-4, CEA 2016a).

all contributed to the solid pace of consumer spending growth. Low interest rates and improving access to credit, particularly automobile loans, also
supported consumer spending. In general, real consumption growth and
the wages and salaries component of real income growth tend to track one
another well, as has been the case in 2016 (Figure 2-11). Overall, the personal
saving rate has been fairly stable at around 5.6 percent of disposable personal
income since the beginning of 2013, implying that real consumer spending
growth has largely tracked real income growth (Figure 2-12).
During the past four quarters, growth was strong for real household
purchases of durable goods (6.1 percent), nondurable (2.1 percent), and
services (2.4 percent). Light motor vehicles sold at a 17. 4 million unit annual
rate during the 11 months through November, roughly the same pace as
the 17.4 million units during 2015, which was the strongest selling pace on
record (CEA 2016a). Mirroring the strong selling pace, domestic automakers
assembled light motor vehicles at an 11.8 million-unit annual pace during
the first 10 months of 2016, while capacity utilization at the automakers was
at its highest level since 2000. The inventory-to-sales ratios for domestically
produced light motor vehicles were slightly elevated by the end of the third
quarter. Consumer sentiment has remained at high levels through 2016,
likely due in part to a strong labor market and low inflation. In 2016, the
Reuters/University of Michigan’s Index of Consumer Sentiment remained

Box 2-4: Optimal Weighting for Combining
Measures of Economic Activity
The U.S. economy is large, dynamic, and complex; measuring it in
real time can be extremely difficult at best. Data on the strength of the
economy depend on extensive surveys of households and businesses and
administrative data that are necessarily imperfect and incomplete, and
the Federal statistical agencies—the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA),
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the Census Bureau—frequently
revise their estimates as newer and better underlying data become available. Given both the uncertainty inherent in any statistical measure and
the standard practice of revising estimates, it is often better to look at
multiple sources of data when assessing the state of the U.S. economy
in real time. For example, as noted in Box 2-4 of the 2016 Economic
Report of the President, growth in the average of estimates of real gross
domestic product (GDP) and real gross domestic income (GDI)—which
CEA refers to as real gross domestic output (GDO)—is a better predictor
of one-quarter-ahead real GDP growth than are estimates of real GDP
growth itself.
However, policymakers must often make decisions in real time,
and may not have the ability to wait for multiple rounds of revisions to
assess current economic conditions. (See Box 1-1 for a specific example.)
As such, they may need to rely on early (incomplete) economic data
on employment and output. It is important to note, though, that not
all measures contain the same amount of uncertainty: some firstreported estimates come from surveys with large sample sizes and tend
to be revised less, while others contain a larger number of statistical
assumptions and consequently may undergo more substantial revisions.
Consequently, when attempting to understand the current position of
the U.S. economy in real time, one should not necessarily weight all
current measures equally.
Each month, the BLS reports two estimates of over-the-month
changes in employment. The first, known as the “household” estimate,
is derived from the Current Population Survey, which samples approximately 60,000 households each month and asks household members
about their employment status in the previous month. The second,
known as the “establishment” or “payroll” estimate, is derived from a
survey of more than 400,000 worksites covering about a third of total
nonfarm employment in the United States. Although the establishment
survey has a much larger sample size, it suffers both from statistical noise
and some systematic errors, especially in recording employment gains at
new firms that come into existence and employment losses at old firms
that have closed. Moreover, monthly jobs estimates are revised multiple

times following their initial release. In principle, then, both the household and establishment measures of job growth contain some information about the true underlying path of U.S. employment (ignoring some
conceptual differences in how employment is defined in each survey).
However, in practice the household survey is so volatile that it
contains almost no additional information about monthly changes
in employment beyond that contained in the establishment survey.
Table 2-i shows the results of CEA analysis of the optimal weighting
to put on first-reported employment growth from the household and
payroll surveys when attempting to accurately predict “true” monthly
employment growth using a weighted average of the two first-reported
measures. The difficulty in such an exercise is in defining truth. When
using the final-reported figure from the establishment survey—which is
based in part on a near-complete census of nonfarm employment in the
United States—as the measure of true employment growth, one should
optimally put 100 percent of weight on the payroll survey. An alternative
is to use a statistical model called a state space model to estimate the
truth. This model extracts an unobserved component that is common
to, and explains as much as possible of movements in, all variables in the
model. When using a state-space model that combines the final-reported
household and payroll estimates to derive an estimate of the common
movements in employment, one should still place approximately 92
percent of weight on the payroll estimate—with very little difference in
error compared with using the payroll survey alone.
More generally, it is possible to combine real-time measures of
economic output (GDP, GDI, and their average, GDO) with real-time
measures of employment growth to gain a more accurate assessment
of broad economic conditions on a quarterly basis. This is particularly
important given that quarterly estimates of output growth can see extensive revisions across multiple years as new and more complete data on
real economic activity become available to BEA. Table 2-ii repeats the
exercise of Table 2-i, this time predicting several final-reported measures

of quarterly economic activity: the payroll survey estimate of nonfarm
employment growth, growth in real GDO, a state-space model combining payroll employment growth and real GDO growth, and three indexes
of economic indicators from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and the Conference Board that
are designed to measure the state of the economy. In each case, the third
estimate of real GDO growth is combined in a weighted average with the
payroll-survey estimate of employment growth available at the time of
the GDO estimate’s release.
Here, too, optimal weighting places a substantial emphasis on the
information contained in the early payroll estimates of employment
growth. This is particularly true when predicting post-revision employment growth—where early output estimates contribute no information
beyond that contained in early payroll estimates—but is true even
when assessing output growth. Even when predicting post-revision real
GDO growth, one should still place approximately one-third weight on
contemporaneous measures of nonfarm employment growth. Optimal
weighting for predicting the broader measures of economic activity
vary somewhat from index to index, but in all cases more emphasis is
placed on early estimates of employment growth than on early estimates
of output growth. (CEA (2016f) contains a more extensive table with
additional variables and details of these computations.)
No single measure of the economy is perfect, and all measures
are subject to measurement error and conceptual challenges. But these

90  |  Chapter 2

results suggest that, to a first approximation, more emphasis should be
placed on contemporaneous estimates of employment growth than on
contemporaneous estimates of output growth when attempting to assess
the overall current state of the U.S. economy.

Box 2-5: The Economics of Aging
The growth of the working-age population (15-64 year olds) in the
United States has been slowing notably, which puts downward pressure
on labor force participation, productivity, and real GDP growth. The
working-age population grew 1.4 percent at an annual rate in the 1960s
through the 1980s, but just 0.6 percent during this recovery. The decline
in the growth rate of the working-age population is expected to continue
through 2028 (Figure 2-vi). As the working-age population growth rate
falls relative to the growth rate of other age groups, it follows that the
working-age share of the population should fall as well. Between 2008
and 2015, the share declined from 67.3 percent to 66.3 percent (averaging -0.15 percentage point per year). The working-age share is expected
to fall at an increasing rate through 2029, reflecting a growing share of
the elderly population (65+). The only age group that is projected to

grow as a share of the population over the next 10 years is the 65+ age
group.
Much of the recent decline in the labor force participation rate
can be explained by the aging of the population. Of the 3.3 percentage
points drop in the labor force participation rate between its 2007 average
and November 2016, 2.3 percentage points can be explained by a simple
demographic trend that only accounts for the aging of the population
over this period (Figure 2-vii). Because older workers are less likely to
work, the LFPR should decline as the population ages. The remaining 1.0
percentage point gap reflects other long-term trends, such as a declining
participation rate among prime-age men (Box 2-3), as well as possibly a
cyclical effect from the extraordinarily long duration of unemployment
in the aftermath of the recession.
Real GDP has grown more slowly in the current economic recovery
than in other cycles, but after taking into account demographic and
workforce changes the current recovery looks more typical. Peak to peak,
real GDP growth averaged 3.1 percent at an annual rate in prior cycles
compared with just 1.2 percent so far this cycle, but comparing across
business cycles can be misleading unless one considers demographics.
The working-age population (ages 16-64) grew 1.4 percent at an annual
rate in the 1960s through the 1980s, but just 0.6 percent during this
recovery. In addition, previous recoveries had faster underlying trend

growth in part driven by the rapid shift of women into the labor force.
Controlling for the number of people in the labor force, growth in this
recovery is quite similar to previous ones (Figure 2-viii).
Beyond the downward pressure on GDP caused by a slower
working-age population growth rate, another economic impact of
demographic shifts in the United States is that they may have reduced
productivity growth. A range of papers finds that higher proportions
of certain age groups are correlated with higher productivity growth
(Feyrer 2007; Aiyar, Ebeke, and Shao 2016; Maestas, Mullen, and Powell
2016). As the share of these age groups employed in the labor force
changes, productivity is affected. In particular, studies find the 40-49
cohort to be correlated with higher productivity (due to a bigger pool
of managerial talent) and 55 and older to be less so. Estimates based on
these papers suggest that somewhere from 0.2 to 0.8 percentage point
of the 1.5 percentage points productivity slowdown from 1995-2005 to
2005-15 could be due to demography. Projections of the composition of
the labor force suggest that the drag on productivity from demographics
may soon be abating (Figure 2-ix).

around its pre-recession levels, oscillating between 87 and 95, driving the
strong consumption growth (Figure 2-13). The Conference Board index hit
its highest level since 2007 in November 2016, although the 2016 average
was only somewhat higher than pre-recession levels.
Meanwhile, U.S. household debt relative to income continued to fall
(Figure 2-14). Before the financial crisis, household debt relative to income
rose dramatically, largely due to net mortgage originations, and then
declined sharply after the crisis, a pattern known as “deleveraging.” (See
Box 2-6 for more on deleveraging.) Charge–offs of delinquent mortgage
debt played an important role in lowering household debt, but the decline
in new mortgage originations and less consumer borrowing played roles as
well (Vidangos 2015). By the end of 2016:Q2, the debt-to-income ratio was
at its lowest level since 2002. The level of mortgage debt relative to income
continued to decline in 2016, while consumer credit (including credit cards,
automobiles, and student loans) relative to income increased slightly.
Moreover, with historically low interest rates, the amount of income
required to service these debts has fallen dramatically. Still, it should be
noted that estimates based on aggregate data could mask higher debt
burdens for some families; that is, the health of personal finances varies
substantially across households. Nonetheless, in aggregate, there is evidence
of deleveraging as discussed in Box 2-6.

Box 2-6: Household Deleveraging and Consumption Growth
Household balance sheets have continued to recover from the
damage wrought during the recession, helping to support the strong consumption growth seen in recent years. Real household net worth—the
difference between the market value of household assets and the value
of outstanding liabilities, adjusted for inflation using the price index
for personal consumption expenditures—did not regain the pre-crisis
high reached in 2007:Q1 until 2013:Q3. Growth has continued and, as
of 2016:Q3, real household net worth is 16 percent above the pre-crisis
high (Figure 2-x).
The improvement of household balance sheets reflects a number of
positive factors. First, households have increased their saving, with the
saving rate moving up to 5.9 percent post-recession compared with the
3.8 percent average from 2001:Q4 to 2007:Q4. Second, the strong stock
market growth seen in 2012-14 and substantial (roughly 6 percent a
year) increases in house prices during the past four years have increased
the value of household assets. Third, mortgage debt—by far the largest
component of household liabilities—has fallen substantially, especially
relative to income gains since the crisis, far outstripping small increases
in other categories of debt. Household debt as a share of disposable
income is at 106 percent as of 2016:Q3, far below the 2007:Q4 peak of
135 percent.

In addition to lower debt balances and strong asset returns, low
interest rates have further supported household finances. Debt service
costs as a fraction of disposable personal income, which reflects the current burden of carrying debt including interest and principal payments,
fell from 13 percent in 2007 to only 10 percent in 2013. This leaves
households with more cash to spend. As shown in Figure 2-xi, the debt
service-to-income ratio has held steady at this new lower level since 2013,
with mortgage expenses continuing to decline while servicing costs for
consumer debt—which includes automobile, student, and credit card
debt—having increased somewhat.
Strong household balance sheets, together with low debt servicing
costs, help to support consumption growth. As shown in Figure 2-xii,
though household debt has begun to grow once more it is still growing
very slowly—on a four-quarter basis, growth is still lower than in any
period between 1971 and 2007. These developments, along with strong
growth in employment and wages, have allowed households to increase
their consumption. In particular, spending on durable goods—which
are more likely to be paid for with borrowing and thus sensitive to balance sheet and interest rate considerations—accounted for 26 percent
of personal consumption growth from 2014 through 2016:Q3, despite
making up only 11 percent of expenditures. A large portion of this
growth in durable goods spending comes from sales of motor vehicles,

Earlier gains in household net worth (that is, assets less debts, also
referred to as household wealth), such as the moderate increases in equity
wealth so far in 2016, also supported consumer-spending growth in 2016
(Figure 2-15). The wealth-to-income ratio remained elevated in 2016, following a marked increase during 2013. Changes in net worth have been
spread unevenly across households, though, and these disparities may have
implications for families and macroeconomic activity.

Housing Markets
The housing market recovery continued in the first quarter of 2016,
but residential investment was a drag on economic growth in the second and
third quarters. In 2016, sales of newly constructed single-family homes and
single-family housing starts, bolstered by strong labor market conditions
and low mortgage interest rates, averaged their highest annual level through
the first 10 months of a year since 2007. However, growth in new construction slowed from its 2015 pace: total housing starts and permits zig-zagged
around their 2015 level. Real residential investment decreased 1.7 percent

at an annual rate through the first three quarters of 2016, down from 13.1
percent positive growth in the four quarters of 2015.
While the housing market has continued its recovery since the recession, several structural challenges remain, including a constrained housing
supply, low affordability in some areas of the country, and persistently
muted household formation for 18-34 year olds. Housing supply is constrained: the inventory of homes available for sale is below its historical
average and vacancy rates (for both renter and owner occupied) have fallen
to levels that had prevailed before the boom, particularly in metropolitan
areas, indicating that there is no longer excess supply (Figure 2-16). Sale
volumes of the most affordable new single-family homes, particularly those
less than $200 thousand, are lower than before the crisis. The share of young
adults living with their parents remains above its long-run historical average,
stifling household formation. These challenges may explain why housing
starts still seem to be below their long-run steady state level.
House prices continued to rise in 2016, similar to the pace in 2015.
National home prices increased between 5.5 and 6.1 percent (depending
on the index) during the 12 months ended September 2016 compared with

4.7-to-6.2 percent in the year earlier period.11 While price increases are
above estimates for long-run steady state house price increases, they are not
as rapid as the 6-to-11-percent increase in 2013. Nominal house prices are
between 25 and 39 percent above their recessionary trough and between 6
percent below and 6 percent above their pre-recession peak (Figure 2-17).
However, in real terms (adjusting for inflation with the CPI), house prices
remain roughly 17 percent below their pre-recession peak.
Continued house price increases have improved owners’ equity relative to the debt they owe on their houses. Homeowners’ equity as of 2016:Q3
equaled slightly more than half of the total value of household real estate (57
percent), 20 percentage points higher than the recessionary trough and near
the historical average of roughly 60 percent. Rising home prices since 2012
also helped lift more than 9 million households out of a negative equity position from 2012:Q2 to 2016:Q2, reducing the overall share of single-family
homeowners with an underwater mortgage (when mortgage debt exceeds
the value of their house) to 12.1 percent in the second quarter, down from
14.4 percent a year earlier. In addition, the number of delinquent home
mortgages (when the homeowner misses at least one monthly payment) has
fallen to its lowest level since 2007, though the share of mortgages that are

seriously delinquent (payment more than 90 days overdue, with the bank
considering the mortgages to be in danger of default) remains somewhat
elevated (Figure 2-18). Falling delinquencies support overall economic
growth because homeowners with underwater or delinquent mortgages
are less likely to spend or relocate in search of better-paying jobs (Ferreira,
Gyourko, and Tracy 2012).
Single-family homes were still more affordable in 2016 than the
historical average, as rising incomes and low and steady mortgage rates
partially offset the effect of rising house prices on the cost of homeownership
(Figure 2-19). Nevertheless, affordability decreased somewhat over the past
three years because median existing home prices grew roughly 4 percentage
points faster than median family incomes on average each year.
The national homeownership rate was 63.5 percent in the third quarter of 2016, much lower than the historical average due to a variety of trends
in the housing market. The decline has been concentrated among young
households. The homeownership rate of those aged 18-34 was 35.2 percent
in 2016:Q3, roughly 8-percentage points lower than its all-time high in 2004.
The major reason for this decline is that young adults are waiting longer to
get married or form households, and first-time homebuyers are older, on
average, than they were in the 1980s. Second, credit availability remains

tight for borrowers with credit scores below 620. Third, it can be difficult
for prospective buyers, especially those living in urban areas, to save for a
down payment.
Overall household formation has showed some tentative signs of
picking up in recent years, after having been weak since the recession. The
number of households increased by 1.2 million in 2016 after rising 0.7
million in 2015. This uptick in household formation contributed to a 5.5
percent rise in overall housing starts during the first ten months 2016 relative to 2015 as a whole and a solid 9.2 percent rise in single-family housing
starts during the first ten months of 2016 relative to 2015 as a whole (Figure
2-20). Nevertheless, starts remained well below the roughly 1.5 million rate
that is consistent with long-term demographics and the replacement of the
existing housing stock.12 Further, because the rates of homebuilding have
been below that pace since the recession, pent-up demand for housing may
play a role in supporting further recovery in the housing market. However,
an increase in housing demand, if not accompanied by an increase in housing supply, would not bring about a full recovery in the housing market. The
accumulation of State and local barriers to housing development—including
12 Demographics and historical trends would have predicted 1.2 to 1.4 million new households
formed each year requiring housing (Joint Center for Housing Studies 2015). Together with the
assumption that about 0.25 percent of the existing homes deteriorate and need to be replaced a
given year, yields an underlying trend of roughly 1.5 million housing starts.

zoning, other land use regulations, and unnecessarily lengthy development
approval processes—have reduced the ability of many housing markets to
respond to growing demand (White House 2016). While land use regulations sometimes serve reasonable and legitimate purposes, they can also
give extra-normal returns to entrenched interests at the expense of everyone
else (see Box 2-6 of the 2016 Report for a more in-depth discussion of the
constraints on housing supply).

Investment
Business Fixed Investment
After being a bright spot early in the recovery, business investment
growth has slowed since the end of 2014, and turned negative in 2015:Q4
and 2016:Q1. Real business fixed investment fell 1.4 percent during the
four quarters ended in 2016:Q3, a reversal from the average increase of 5.0
percent at an annual rate during the twelve quarters of 2012-14, and much
slower that the average of 8.5 percent annual rate increase during the eight
quarters of 2010-11. Not all components of investment were weak in 2016.
The rate of investment growth remained strong for intellectual property
products, which grew 4.5 percent at an annual rate during the first three
quarters of 2016, and has now been positive for 13 consecutive quarters.
However, the strong gains in intellectual property products were more than
offset by larger declines in equipment investment (Figure 2-21). While oil
price declines can explain part of the investment decline in 2015, the slowdown in investment growth continued into 2016 and was not simply due
to lower oil and gas structures investment, but was due to shrinking overall
equipment investment as well. Recent CEA work has found that this broadbased investment slowdown is largely associated with the low rate of output
growth both in the United States and globally (Box 2-7).
Slower investment growth is a concern because it limits the productive
capacity of the economy. Net investment (gross investment less depreciation) is required to increase the capital stock. In 2009, net investment as a
share of the capital stock fell to its lowest level in the post-World War II era
and the nominal capital stock even declined. Although net investment has
rebounded somewhat in the recovery, its level as a share of the capital stock
remains well below the historical average and it declined slightly in 2015
(Figure 2-22).
The slowdown in investment has also contributed to the slowdown
in labor productivity growth. Investment growth contributes to labor productivity growth most directly through capital deepening—the increase in
capital services per hour worked—that had added nearly 1 percentage point

a year to labor productivity growth in the post-war period to 2010. But since
2010, capital deepening has subtracted from productivity growth and contributed slightly more to the slowdown from 1948-2010 to 2010-15 than did
the slowdown in total factor productivity growth.
With the sharp fall in output in 2008-09, the amount of capital relative to output rose considerably (Figure 2-23). Even years into the recovery,
businesses had access to more capital services than the level of output would
typically have required. The excess of capital likely reduced new investment
and helped lower capital services growth. Capital services relative to output
have now fallen back to trend, a factor supporting future investment. This
view is consistent with the usual pattern that historically weaker periods of
investment growth are, on average, followed by stronger periods. This historical pattern argues for faster growth in investment spending during 2017
than in the recent past.
The Administration has pursued policies to support investment,
including additional funding for public research and development and public infrastructure as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, all of which can
stimulate private sector investment. In addition, the President has proposed
business tax reform that would directly spur private investment (see Box
2-9 and Chapter 5 of the 2015 Report for a more in-depth discussion of the
economic benefits of business tax reform (CEA 2015b)).

Inventory Investment
Inventory investment continued to weaken during the first half of
2016, a continuation of the pattern during the last three quarters of 2015.
The inventory-to-sales ratio in manufacturing and trade had crept up over
the past few years, and by 2016:Q1 had reached 1.41 months’ supply, substantially above its post-2000 non-recessionary average of 1.32 months’ supply (Figure 2-24).Given the higher-than-average ratio, it was not surprising
that inventories fell relative to sales in the second and third quarters of 2016.
As of September, the latest data available as this Report goes to press, the
ratio was 1.38, still somewhat elevated relative to recent history.
Real inventory investment—the change in the inventory stock—has
subtracted from output growth thus far in 2016, especially in the second
quarter. Although inventory investment is volatile, and can greatly affect
quarterly GDP growth rates, its contribution to output growth generally
averages close to zero over 4- or 8-quarter horizons outside of recessions
and their immediate aftermath (Figure 2-25). After inventory-to-sales ratios
had risen to relatively high levels in 2015:Q1, though, the change in inventory investment was negative for five consecutive quarters, a string of negative changes that is unusual in non-recessionary conditions. By the second

quarter’s positive contribution of inventory investment to real GDP growth
reflects the swing from negative inventory investment in 2016:Q2 to positive
inventory investment in 2016:Q3.

Net Exports
With weak demand in much of the world outside the United States
and the stronger dollar that has come with it, U.S. nominal exports of goods
and services rose only 0.8 percent over the four quarters ended 2016:Q3. Part
of the reason for the weak nominal growth in the past four quarters is the 1.2
percent drop in export prices, as lower oil and commodity prices have meant
lower prices for U.S. exports of agricultural goods or oil-related products
and falling input costs have other prices. Driven by the strong growth in
agricultural exports in the third quarter, real exports rose 2 percent during
the four quarters ended 2016:Q3, shown in Figure 2-26. As the Figure shows,
real exports tend to trace trade-weighted global growth rates13, and as global

Box 2-7: Explanations for the Recent Performance
of Business Fixed Investment
Business fixed investment comprises business spending on structures and equipment, as well as expenditures on intellectual property
products such as software and research and development (R&D). While
it constitutes only 12 percent of GDP, business fixed investment affects
short-run growth disproportionately, as it accounts for about 20 percent
of the quarterly volatility in real GDP growth. Moreover, business fixed
investment is crucial to long-run growth because it supports future output (and income) and thereby consumption and is a major contributor
to productivity growth. Business fixed investment has weakened since
2014:Q4; for the first time since it began recovering after the recession,
its four-quarter growth rate was negative in 2016:Q1 (Figure 2-xiii).
Although oil-related investment has dragged on investment growth due
to low oil prices, non-oil related investment growth has also slowed over
the period. Finding the sources of this broad-based slowdown in investment spending is an ongoing discussion and empirical effort among
economists. CEA has found that slow U.S. and global growth provides
a partial quantitative explanation for the recent slowdown, while CEA’s
analysis indicates that other factors such as business confidence, policy
uncertainty, or financial conditions do not seem to explain the recent

data. While this implies that headwinds to investment are coming from
the broader economy, it also suggests that investment spending should
rebound if and when consensus forecasts for stronger global growth are
realized.
The slowdown in investment in the United States is not an isolated
trend; in recent years, investment spending in advanced economies has
fallen short of forecasts made by the IMF in the spring of 2007 (Figure
2-xiv). Emerging market economies, which have been accumulating
capital at higher rates than advanced economies, have also seen a slowdown. The global nature of the investment slowdown sheds doubt on
the theory that any particular factor specific to the United States, such
as government policy, is behind the current U.S. investment slowdown.
A standard model that economists employ to explain investment
theoretically and empirically is called the “accelerator model.” This
model assumes that businesses invest if they expect rising demand
growth for their products, so rising GDP growth rates will lead to higher
investment growth. CEA research has found that this accelerator model
explains much of the recent fluctuation in investment, as shown in Figure

2-xv.1 The uptick in output growth after the crisis spurred faster investment growth in 2011 but the slowdown in growth in 2015-16 contributed
to a slowdown in investment growth more recently, though investment
growth is still somewhat weaker than this model would predict over this
past year. Importantly, the model shows that changes in global growth—
not just domestic growth—affect business investment, consistent with
findings from the IMF and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) (IMF 2015a; OECD 2015).
Several factors that have historically mattered for investment
growth have little explanatory power in the recent slowdown. These
include two main financial stress measures, the credit spread (the gap
between treasury yields and corporate bond yields that is sometimes seen
as a measure of concerns for financial risk in the economy) and an index
of tightness of loan conditions. Both of these increased recently, but not
enough to have any explanatory power in the investment slowdown.
Therefore, constraints on credit or in the financial system cannot explain
on their own the slowdown in business investment over the last year and
1 The standard “accelerator” model assumes that investment growth is a function of the
change in the growth of real GDP because firms target a level of the capital stock that moves
with the overall level of GDP. The accelerator model can be estimated using first or second
differences of the relevant series. CEA ran both specifications – Figure 2-xv shows the
results using the model where changes in investment are driven by lags of itself as well as the
second difference of US and a foreign trade-weighted GDP aggregate. As Figure 2-xv shows,
this specification closely matches investment growth.

a half, consistent with the observation that, even as the financial sector
has healed, business investment growth has actually slowed further.
Another possibility is that declining profits have held back investments in the last two years. Real corporate profits rebounded after the
recession but have been declining since 2014, leaving fewer funds for
internal funding of investment projects. But this theory also does not
match the data. Firms still have a high level of profits relative to history,
and have been taking the profits they do have and increasing payouts
to shareholders instead of investing in structures or equipment. This
suggests firms could invest if they wanted to, but do not see adequately
attractive uses of investment funds.
While evidence shows that weak global growth explains weak
business investment growth, this does not suggest that it is the only
explanation. Investment, like any other macroeconomic variable, is
affected by both short- and long-run trends. There is evidence to suggest
that the recent slowdown is also connected to a longer-run downward
trend in investment as a share of GDP over the last few decades. Part of
this decline can be attributed to secular shifts in the U.S. economy. U.S.
output is increasingly produced by services industries that require less
capital. For example, from 2010 to 2015, average investment-to-output
ratio for services industries was 15.6 percent, while it was 21.9 percent
for all non-service industries.
The accelerator model predicts a rebound in investment in the
future. A key feature of the model is that investment depends on changes
in GDP growth (in other words, the acceleration of GDP). The deceleration in GDP, both in the United States and abroad, has already had its
negative impact on investment growth. Moving forward, more normal
investment growth should occur if—as expected—world output growth
stabilizes. Further, a rebound in global growth should also contribute to
a rebound in overall U.S. GDP growth.

growth seems to be stabilizing, real export growth rates have begun to rise
as well.
At the same time, real U.S. imports increased just 0.6 percent in the
four quarters ended 2016:Q3, slower than did exports. Taken together,
Figure 2-27 shows net exports contributed 0.4 percentage point to real GDP
growth during the first three quarters of 2016, after subtracting 0.7 percentage point from overall growth during the four quarters of 2015.

Productivity
Labor productivity, defined as nonfarm output per hour worked, has
grown slower in the past decade and in particular over the past few years.
Productivity growth slowed first around 2005 and then even more after
2011, averaging just 0.5 percent over the five years ending 2015:Q4—the
slowest five years during an expansion in the postwar data and well below its
2.0-percent average since 1953 (Figure 2-28). This low productivity growth
reflects rapid growth in employment while GDP has grown more slowly.
Over longer periods of time, growth in real output and real wages depend on
rising productivity, so this slowdown is a cause for concern.
Similar to trends in business fixed investment, the slowdown in
productivity growth is shared across the advanced economies: 34 of the
35 OECD member countries saw slowdowns labor productivity per hour
worked from 2005 to 2015 relative to the prior 10-year period.14 In fact,
despite its own slowdown, the United States has had higher productivity
growth than any other G-7 economy over the past 10 years (Figure 2-xvi).
The sources of the productivity slowdown are shared across advanced
economies to some extent, so the approaches to address these problems are

somewhat generalizable (Box 2-8), but the U.S. productivity slowdown has
several of its own specific causes.
A useful way to analyze labor productivity is to decompose its growth
into three factors: increased capital services per hour worked (capital
deepening), increased skills per worker (labor composition), and increased
technology or efficiency (technically termed “total factor productivity” and
measured as a residual). While the contribution of all three decreased in
the post-recessionary period compared with their long-run averages, the
slowdown in capital deepening has been the largest factor subtracting from
productivity growth, accounting for more than half the decline in total productivity growth, although the slowdown in total factor productivity (TFP)
was substantial as well (Figure 2-29).
In the period from 1953 to 2010, about 0.92 percentage points (41
percent) of productivity growth was attributable to additional capital services per worker. Even as the recovery was underway during 2010 to 2015,
the capital-deepening contribution to labor productivity growth was actually
negative; in 2014 and 2015, a worker had less capital services at his or her
disposal than five years earlier—the first time this has occurred during any
five-year period since the end of World War II (Figure 2-30). These data
suggest that net investment (that is, gross investment less depreciation)
has not sufficed to grow capital services in line with the increase in hours
worked. Indeed, business fixed investment growth has fallen short of IMF
forecasts and been weak since 2014 (IMF 2014; IMF 2015a).
Another possible explanation is that we are not measuring productivity correctly in the information-driven economy. Measurement error,
however, has probably always been present in the official productivity data
and is therefore unlikely to explain much of the recent, productivity slowdown. CEA analysis and recent research suggests that mismeasurement has
not grown in such a way to explain such a large slowdown in productivity
growth from a 2.1-percent historical average to 0.0 percent during the four
quarters ended 2016:Q3 (Box 2-5 in CEA 2016a). Some reasons for skepticism include: (i) productivity growth was high from 1995 to 2005 when
many of the potentially underestimated information technology innovations
were introduced; (ii) the slowdown in productivity has affected well-measured sectors of the economy too; and (iii) many recent innovations boost
consumer surplus and the value of leisure, which GDP was not designed to
measure.
Changes in industrial composition can explain some of the decrease.
Since 2011, output and employment growth has been higher in lower
output-per-hour sectors, such as business services, construction, and hospitality, holding back productivity growth overall. Conversely, as commodity

prices weakened and the global economy slowed during 2015 and 2016, both
the energy-producing sector and manufacturing have struggled. A shrinking
role for these capital- and technology-intensive sectors reduces output per
hour.
In the labor market, there is some evidence that the improving economy is drawing in workers who have at least temporarily lower productivity,
which also reduces measured productivity growth. Newly employed workers
tend to receive lower wages, presumably because they are at least temporarily
less productive than their more experienced co-workers. Partly for these reasons, it is not unusual for measured productivity growth to be higher early in
a business cycle recovery and slower as a business-cycle expansion matures
as workers are added back onto payrolls, though this is actually an overall
positive development for the economy as long as it moves the economy
towards full employment. Since 2011, newly employed workers have made
up a larger-than-normal share of the workforce as employment growth has
boomed. This has suppressed wage growth by 0.5 to 1.0 percentage point
over this period. These newer hires may have lower skills or productivity
than otherwise similar workers, or their skills may have eroded during their
extended time out of work. Adding relatively more of these below-medianwage workers may have temporarily depressed productivity growth.
Longer-standing declines in the fluidity and dynamism of the economy may also be contributing to slower productivity growth. The entry of
new firms has been slowing for decades and, to the extent that these firms
drive both investment and productivity growth, their decline is important. A
pessimistic view put forward by economist Robert Gordon is that the world
economy may have simply run through the best productivity-enhancing
innovations such as the steam engine, the telephone, and indoor plumbing
while more recent innovations may not have the same impact on output
(Gordon 2012). This pessimistic view of our future is not universally held.
The world has more educated and connected people than at any time in history. Investment in intellectual property products has been strong throughout the recovery. Spending on the research and development component
of investment (R&D) in particular has risen to its highest share of GDP on
record, suggesting good prospects for continued innovation remain.
Of the possible explanations, it appears that more cyclical or shortterm explanations explain a large portion of the slowdown. In particular,
to the degree that the productivity slowdown is caused by an investment
bust, that may actually be encouraging for the future outlook. It means we
are not out of ideas or permanently mired in secular stagnation, but instead
just need to invest more. Not only do we have policy tools to help push in
that direction, but to some degree such investment busts have historically

Box 2-8: Productivity Among the Advanced
Economies—Explanations and Prospects
The slow productivity growth over the last decade in the United
States is hardly an exception within the advanced economies. While
there is still substantial heterogeneity across the advanced economies
in terms of their cyclical position, there is commonality in terms of
their experience with productivity growth. Average annual productivity
growth in the advanced economies slowed to 1 percent in the period
from 2005 to 2015, down from 2 percent in the previous decade—with
productivity slowing in 34 of the 35 OECD member countries, including all of the G-7 economies, with the United States having the fastest
productivity growth in the G-7 (Figure 2-xvi).
An economy takes various inputs, such as labor and capital, and
produces goods and services. Low labor productivity growth means that
labor inputs are growing relatively quickly compared with output, such
that growth in output per hour worked is low. This may be due to less
capital for each worker or because technology or management are not
using these inputs efficiently.
It is unlikely to be a mere coincidence that a substantial shortfall
in aggregate demand and a large slowdown in productivity growth have
occurred simultaneously. In fact, the causal relationship between the
two phenomena likely runs both ways. In the period from 2008 to 2014,

inadequate demand has contributed to a large shortfall of investment in
both advanced and emerging markets. Moreover, CEA has found that
the U.S. investment slowdown in the past 18 months can, in part, be
quantitatively explained by slow global growth (Box 2-7).
In the United States, the largest contributor to the decline in labor
productivity in the past five years is a reduction in capital deepening.
This was not a unique experience, as all of the G-7 countries except
Canada saw appreciable slowing in their rates of capital deepening
between 1995-2005 and 2005-15 (Figure 2-xvii). As in the United States,
the slowdown in capital deepening was even than the slowdown in
total factor productivity (TFP) in Germany, Japan, and Italy. In France
and the United Kingdom, however, relatively larger slowdowns in TFP
growth account for the larger share of the decline in labor productivity
(Figure 2-xviii).
On the supply side, slowing total factor productivity growth has
also played a role in all of the G-7 economies. There is some evidence
that the slowing began before the crisis, around 2004, as the impulse
from the information technology revolution either did not endure or was
not well measured.

been self-correcting as investment tends to be negatively serially correlated,
with busts followed by booms and vice versa. Other factors holding down
productivity growth—particularly shifting industry composition and newworker entry—should fade. As the labor market normalizes over the long
term, the economy will no longer be adding a disproportionate number of
new workers.
Looking forward, a number of the President’s proposed policies would
contribute to increasing productivity growth. Infrastructure spending would
lift public investment, raising effective capital per worker; investing in job
training and greater access to higher education would raise labor quality;
reforming innovation policy, patent reforms, expanding R&D tax credits,
and supporting public R&D spending would all increase total factor productivity. Broader policies would aid as well: the Trans-Pacific Partnership
(TPP) trade agreement would help better firms grow and hire more workers,
increasing productivity within sectors; immigration reform would increase
high-skilled immigration and improve job matching of workers and increase
certainty for undocumented workers already here; supportive entrepreneurship policies would help both investment and firm dynamism; business
tax reform would encourage domestic investment and innovation; and
better competition policy would steer firms away from rent-seeking toward

productive innovation. There is no silver bullet for improving productivity
growth, but sound policy across a range of initiatives could support it, raising real wages and living standards in the process.

Wage and Price Inflation
Nominal wage inflation has trended up over the course of the recovery
as the labor market has continued to strengthen amid robust job growth.
Average nominal hourly earnings for private sector production and nonsupervisory employees increased 2.4 percent during the 12–month period
ended November 2016, up from 2.3 percent during the year-earlier period.
Nominal hourly compensation for private-sector workers, as measured by
the employment cost index, increased 2.2 percent during the four quarters through 2016:Q3, up from 1.9 percent in the four quarters of 2015.
Alternatively, the more-volatile compensation per hour measure for the
non-farm business sector, as measured by the labor productivity and cost
dataset, increased 2.2 percent during the four quarters through 2016:Q3,
below its 3.1-percent rise during the four quarters of 2015. Taken together,
as shown in Figure 2-31, nominal wage inflation has increased with the
strong recovery in the labor market. However, the pace remains below the
pre-crisis pace.
Consumer prices, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and shown in Figure 2-32, increased roughly
1.4 percent over the 12 months ended in October 2016. The growth rate was
held down by continued declines in energy prices, leaving overall inflation
well below the Federal Reserve’s longer-run objective of 2 percent. Core
inflation—which excludes energy and food prices and tends to be a better
predictor of future inflation than overall inflation—was also less than the
2-percent target, ranging between 1.6 and 1.7 percent thus far in 2016.15
Lower imported goods prices, as well as the pass through of lower energy
costs to non-energy goods, likely weighed on core inflation this year. The
speed and degree to which these factors wane are two keys to the inflationary pressures in the economy this year. While inflation has picked up in
recent months, nominal earnings have also continued to grow considerably
15 The Federal Reserve defines its inflation objective in terms of the PCE price index. The
consumer price index (CPI) is an alternate measure of prices paid by consumers and is used
to index some government transfers, such as Social Security benefits. Largely because of a
different method of aggregating the individual components, PCE inflation has averaged about
0.3-percentage point a year less than the CPI inflation since 1979. Recently, though, the gap
between core price inflation has been larger across the two indices. During the 12 months
ended in October 2016, for example, core CPI prices increased 2.2 percent, more than the
1.7-percent increase in core PCE prices.

faster than inflation, translating into sustained real wage gains for American
workers.
Real average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory
workers have grown at a relatively high rate in 2016. As of October, real
wages of production and nonsupervisory workers have grown at an annual
rate of 0.8 percent since the start of the current business cycle in December
2007, which is the fastest real wage growth over a business cycle since the
early 1970s (Figure 2-33). From October 2012 to October 2016, the total
growth of real wages of private production and nonsupervisory workers was
6.1 percent, exceeding the 2.1-percent total growth from the business cycle
peak in 1980 to the business cycle peak in 2007.
The combination of strong employment gains and real wage gains
have contributed to rising real household income. Real median household
income rose 5.2 percent, to $56,516 in 2015. This was the largest percent
increase since records began in 1967. The income gains were broad based:
for the first time since 2006, all income percentiles reported by the U.S.
Census Bureau experienced gains (Figure 2-34). The largest gains were
among households at the bottom of the income distribution; real income
growth was the fastest on record for the 10th, 20th, 40th, 50th, and 60th
percentiles (Figure 2-35). In addition, all racial and ethnic groups saw

non-Hispanic White households.

Financial Markets
U.S. financial markets have been robust so far in 2016, with equity
indexes higher, government bond yields slightly higher, credit spreads lower,
and oil prices rallying from lows that were touched in January. Equity markets had been broadly down in late 2015. The level of the S&P 500 Index as
of November 30 is up 3.2 percent relative to the high reached in mid-2015.
Asset prices in 2016 tended to be broadly affected by central bank policy
decisions and investor perceptions of domestic and global growth prospects.
Financial markets were volatile and equity markets were down early in the
year, but have since recovered. In general, investor sentiment has been cautiously optimistic and, as shown in Figure 2-36, financial conditions have
been relatively loose. Both rising asset prices and eased financial conditions
should continue to support the economic recovery.

Equity Markets
The S&P 500 is up 7.6 percent in 2016 as of November 30. The first
two months of the year saw steep declines, reflecting investor concern
about the health of the global economy. During those episodes of market
declines, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange Market Volatility Index
(VIX), which reflects investor expectations of future volatility for the S&P
500, spiked to almost 30 in early January and again in early February (VIX
levels above 30 are generally considered high). Thereafter, equity markets
recovered broadly and investor volatility expectations were generally much
lower for the rest of the year.
The United Kingdom’s decision to exit the European Union (popularly termed “Brexit”) was followed by falling equity prices in markets
around the globe, but the spike in volatility was temporary and major U.S.
equity indices quickly recovered. The S&P 500 reached a record high in
August, before easing back a bit in September and October. The index rose
sharply in November, rising 3.4 percent and hitting a new all-time high on
November 25. With the exception of early November, the VIX has closed
below 20 since shortly after Brexit, as shown in Figure 2-37. As of November
30, 2016, the S&P 500 was 40 percent above its pre-recession peak in 2007.

Interest Rates and Credit Spreads
During the first half of the year, yields on government and corporate
debt generally moved lower, continuing the downward trend of the past few
years. However, Treasury yields rose in the second half of the year and spiked
upward in November, with the 10-year yield ending the month above its
end-of-2015 level. Levels of default risk, as measured by credit default swap
(CDS) spreads, spiked in tandem with the equity and oil market volatility
near the start of the year but, consistent with equity market volatility, have
returned to relatively low levels since. At the same time, consensus forecasts
of long-run U.S. interest rates have fallen over 2016. The market-implied
expectation for the 10-year Treasury yield 10 years from now fell in the first
half of the year but spiked upward in November and, as of November 30, is
at its end-of-2015 level.
Long-term government interest rates, or yields on 10-year and 30-year
U.S. Treasury notes, declined more than did yields on shorter-term debt
during the first half of 2016. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell below 2
percent at the beginning of the year and reached its lowest level on record
(1.37 percent) on July 5, but recovered steadily throughout the third quarter
and reached 1.84 percent at the end of October (Figure 2-38). In November,
the 10-year yield jumped up 53 basis points (bps) to 2.37 percent, a large
move shared by the 30-year Treasury yield as well as the government bond

yields of other advanced economies. Despite the recent upward movements,
Treasury yields are still low relative to their long-term averages. Unusually
low interest rates are not unique to the United States, as relatively low interest rates were common among G7 economies in 2016.
Average borrowing costs for BBB-rated companies decreased more
than 10-year U.S. Treasury yields did in 2016, with the BBB spread over
10-year U.S. Treasuries declining from 2.18 percentage points at the end
of 2015 to 1.51 percentage points at the end of November. The BBB spread
had widened in late 2015 and peaked at 2.84 percentage points in February
before steadily narrowing to 1.61 percentage points by the end of October.
In November, the spread decreased another 10 basis points, though both
the 10-year Treasury yield and the average BBB yield to maturity rose. As
of November 30, the BBB spread is slightly below its average post-recession
level of 1.70 percentage points. Narrowing corporate credit spreads relative
to Treasury notes mean the market is requiring less compensation for the
credit risk of corporate debt. This is consistent with the downward movement of credit default swap (CDS) spreads for corporate debt over the year
(Figure 2-39). Because CDS spreads are the cost of insurance against the
default of a borrower, falling CDS spreads mean that the market perceives
debt defaults as less probable now than at the start of the year. Corporate
bond issuance has been proceeding at a robust pace; over the first 10 months

of 2016, corporate bond issuers have issued 1.4 trillion dollars of debt, on par
with the pace in 2015.16 This high rate of debt issuance, however, does not
appear to reflect rising business fixed investment (Box 2-7).
North American high-yield CDS spreads increased roughly 80bps in
early February due in part to the increasing credit risk of energy producers,
some of which defaulted after the price of oil plummeted after the start of the
year. As oil prices recovered, industry-average CDS spreads fell, reflecting
the improved health of energy firms as well as improved investor sentiment.
As of November 30, high-yield and investment grade CDS spreads are below
their average 2015-16 levels.
Market estimates for long-term U.S. Treasury rates decreased in the
first half of the year along with the current (spot) Treasury rates, signaling
that markets may believe that interest rates will remain low over the longterm as well. The 10-year U.S. Treasury rate, 10 years forward, which is a
function of the 20-year U.S. Treasury rate and the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate,
was 3.6 percent as of November 30, same as the level at the end of 2015, but
slightly lower than the 3.7-percent rate projected for 2026 by a consensus
of professional forecasters. This forward interest rate may be interpreted

as a market forecast of the 10-year interest rate a decade from today but
may diverge from it due to liquidity and maturity risk premia. Some of the
gap between the market-implied rate and the consensus forecast may be
explained by a lower term premium, global flight-to-safety flows, or divergent expectations about long-term productivity and output growth. Forward
rates incorporate risk premia, can be highly volatile, and their movements
may reflect transitory developments as opposed to structural changes; as
such, they may be poor predictors of future rates. For a more in-depth
analysis into the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate, 10 years forward, and the overall
shift to lower long-term rates, see the Council of Economic Advisers (2015d)
report, “Long-Term Interest Rates: A Survey.”

Energy Prices
Weakness in oil prices contributed to equity and credit market volatility in the first two months of the year. Brent crude oil closing prices fell
to less than $30 a barrel in late January and touched $30 a barrel again in
early February on data suggesting slower Chinese growth would depress oil
demand, dollar appreciation would restrain price increases, and that excess
supply would persist. Oil prices have rallied since then and have mostly hovered between $40 and $50 a barrel since April (Figure 2-40), exceeding $50
in the beginning of November as OPEC members agreed to an output agreement capping production at 32.5 million barrels per day, 3 percent below the
33.64 million barrels per day reported by OPEC members in October.

The Global Macroeconomic Situation
The growth of the global economy in 2016 is expected to be the
same as in 2015, but was below the year-earlier expectations of a rebound.
Relatively lower growth is both a long-term phenomenon, with advanced
economies repeatedly underperforming over the past six years, and the
manifestation of short-term developments arising in part from uncertainty
in European markets following the Brexit vote as well as recessions and
continued risks in selected emerging markets. Downward revisions to
growth forecasts occurred amid an environment of weak global demand
and investment and disappointing global productivity growth. Compared
with forecasts in October 2015, IMF forecasts for four-quarter growth in the
October 2016 World Economic Outlook reflected downward revisions across
both advanced and emerging markets, resulting in a downward revision
in the global four-quarter growth forecast for 2016 from 3.6 percent to 3.1
percent (IMF 2015b; IMF 2016b).

Some developments, especially as they relate to advanced economies,
were unexpected, but the slow growth seen throughout 2016 was an extension of developments seen in 2015, namely the stabilizing but persistently
slowing growth in China, the persistence of low prices for some commodities, and slower working-age population growth in many countries. Despite
coming in below expectations, the pace of growth has broadly stabilized with
growth projected for the four quarters of 2016 matching the pace over the
four quarters of 2015. The weak global growth, particularly among U.S. trading partners, continued to be a headwind to U.S. economic growth in 2016,
but the prospect that global growth has stabilized and may pick up could be
a promising sign for U.S. growth.
The IMF’s projected global growth rate of 3.1 percent during the
four quarters of 2016 is well below both the pace earlier in the recovery and
pre-crisis (between 4 and 5 percent). This longer-term slowdown was not
anticipated in earlier forecasts. Figure 2-41 shows the IMF’s forecast for
global growth at different times. The solid line represents the actual growth
outcomes while the dotted lines show the forecast. At first, as growth slowed,
the IMF—along with most other forecasters—expected a near-term pickup
in growth to over 4 percent. Since then, medium-term global growth has

consistently fallen short of expectations, as the long-term growth forecasts
have flattened and medium-term risks have deepened.
As discussed above, the slowdown in global growth has been a headwind for the U.S. economy, dragging on real export growth. As global growth
and the appreciation of the dollar have stabilized, however, real exports have
grown 2 percent in the four quarters ended in 2016:Q3. Still, global growth
is below expectations and there appears to be room for more growth in
many countries. That is why it is critical for economies around the world to
coordinate efforts focused on promoting growth, undertaking the necessary
steps to expand demand, increase investment, encourage trade, and manage
economic and financial developments as appropriate in different contexts.

Global Headwinds and Trade
Starting in July 2014, the dollar entered a period of sustained real
appreciation, increasing by 17 percent through December 2015, according
to the Federal Reserve’s broad real dollar index. Such a major wave of dollar
appreciation has occurred only twice before since the dollar began to float
freely in 1973 following the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange
rate system. In 2016, the dollar was largely stable for most of the year but
appreciated 2.3 percent on a trade-weighted basis in November (Figure
2-42). The limited appreciation of the trade-weighted exchange rate so far
in 2016 obscures some larger bilateral moves in the dollar, with appreciation

132  |  Chapter 2

against the Mexican peso, the Chinese renminbi (RMB) and the British
pound partially offset by depreciation with respect to the Canadian dollar
and the Japanese yen.
While well above the level that prevailed in the years immediately
following the financial crisis, the recent appreciation leaves the dollar close
to its 40-year historical average on a real, price-adjusted basis. Among the
drivers of the recent dollar appreciation is the strong performance of the
U.S. economy against a backdrop of relatively weak growth in the rest of the
world. U.S. Federal Reserve policy is at a different juncture than monetary
policy in other major economies. The Federal Reserve increased interest
rates for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis at its December 2015
meeting. In the first half of 2016, however, both the pace of U.S. growth
and of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve fell behind expectations. FOMC participants consistently marked down both their interest rate
and U.S. growth forecasts throughout 2016, while several other advanced
economies chose to keep their policy rates unchanged. Although markets
expect the Federal Reserve to reduce monetary policy accommodation over
the coming year, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan
(BOJ) are in the midst of maintaining or expanding monetary stimulus with
the aim of raising inflation from low levels toward their respective 2-percent
targets.
The manufacturing sector, in particular, struggles when foreign
demand for U.S. exports is low because it is a more export-oriented part of
the economy. While manufacturing makes up roughly 12 percent of U.S.
value added, it constitutes about one-half of U.S. exports. Within manufacturing, the more export-oriented sectors have struggled most. In the first
half of the year, export-intensive manufacturing sectors lagged in terms of
both output and employment growth (Figure 2-43).17
Weak global demand and subdued investment growth have driven
a slowdown in global trade. The IMF notes that the rate of growth in the
volume of world trade in goods and services has fallen to less than half its
average rate of growth over the preceding three decades. Both the IMF and
the OECD note that growth in real world trade has just barely kept up with
growth in real global GDP since 2011, whereas it grew on average twice as
fast as real global GDP during the two decades before the crisis. Various
analysts attribute the slowdown to weak global growth, especially in investment, a decline in the growth of trade in both capital and intermediate goods
through the “global value chain,” rebalancing in China, the shift across
17 The CEA defines export share as being the sum of direct export sales and “indirect” export
sales, which are the input-cost weighted export sales of downstream users, using the Leontief
inverse method in Johnson and Noguera (2012).

many economies toward services, and rising protectionist sentiment. The
slowdown in trade may both be associated with, and contribute to, slower
future economic growth. This is because both the slowdown in capital
deepening through investment, which is more import-intensive than other
contributors to aggregate demand, and the end to the rapid expansion of
global value-chain activity, partly attributed to China’s re-balancing toward
consumption and services, may reduce productivity growth.

Developments in 2016
Economic growth in 2016 continued to be subdued in a number of
advanced economies, but improved in emerging market and developing
economies in aggregate. Though total growth for emerging markets and
developing economies as a group continued to improve, it underperformed
forecasts made in fall 2015 and was weighed down by continuing contraction and slowing growth in emerging European economies, Latin America
and the Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Emerging markets had been
expected to grow 4.8 percent over the four quarters of 2016, but now look
set to grow only 4.3 percent (IMF 2015b; IMF 2016b).

United Kingdom
It has been a turbulent year for the United Kingdom since the June
referendum in which voters called for the county to leave the European
Union. It remains too early to tell what the economic impact of a ‘Brexit’
will be for the United Kingdom and the world, as expectations for future
growth evolve with the release of new data. The Bank of England originally
marked down its forecast for UK growth for 2016 through 2018 in its third
quarter inflation report after the referendum; in its fourth quarter inflation
report, the bank revised its forecast upward for 2016 and 2017 reflecting
positive GDP data in 2016:Q3, but further lowered its forecast for 2018.
The central bank acted strongly to support the UK economy at its August
policy meeting, lowering its key policy rate and signaling that it stood ready
to provide more accommodation if needed. However, the depreciation of
the pound since the referendum—it fell as much as 16 percent on a tradeweighted basis, reaching its lowest level since 2010—has sparked inflationary
pressures. Citing these developments at its November meeting the bank’s
policy committee shifted its guidance from an easing to a neutral outlook
for monetary policy.
Global equity markets initially plunged after the Brexit vote, though
generally rebounded later and recovered their losses. The FTSE 250
Index—made up of the stocks of the largest 250 companies on the London
Stock Exchange that are not in the top 100 stocks by market capitalization—dropped 7.5 percent in the immediate aftermath of the vote, but has
since recovered these loses. Despite these developments, the real economy
has proved to be remarkably resilient in the months after the vote: real
GDP growth for 2016:Q3 surprised on the upside, growing at a 2-percent
annual rate, similar to the pace over the preceding four quarters and meeting
forecasts issued prior to the vote; the harmonized unemployment rate held
steady at 4.8 percent through the end of August 2016; consumer confidence
was above its long-term average; and purchasing manager surveys of manufacturing and services activity continued to indicate expansion. Growth in
industrial production, however, missed expectations, and some economists
assert that the negative implications of Brexit have yet to materialize given
the estimated two-year exit process once formal negotiations with the
European Union begin. Of particular concern is the risk to the UK’s financial sector if UK-based firms lose “passporting” rights to operate on an equal
footing in the EU single market. In many ways, Brexit’s impact is yet to be
seen as the true terms of exit are yet to be understood, and the uncertainty
involved could weigh on the economy over time.

The Year in Review and the Years Ahead  |  135

Euro area
Recovery from the financial and sovereign debt crises in the euro area
remains uneven, with new uncertainties creating downward pressure on
growth. Unemployment only recently edged down to 9.8 from over 10 percent, and the euro area’s real GDP-per-capita has only just recovered its precrisis peak in 2016:Q3. The IMF expects the euro area economy as a whole to
grow 1.6 percent over the four quarters of 2016, more slowly than its 2-percent growth rate in 2015, reflecting some weakness in domestic demand in
the first half of 2016. The unemployment rate in the nations hardest hit by
the sovereign debt crisis remains elevated, as high as 20 percent. This persistently slow economic growth and labor market slack, coupled with very low
inflation (averaging 0.2 in 2016 for the euro area as a whole, and deflation
in Ireland, Italy, and Spain) highlight the need for more supportive policy
in Europe, including expansionary fiscal policy. Meanwhile, the euro area’s
current account surplus has widened since 2012, driven by Germany’s growing current account surplus.
Although euro area banks are more resilient to market stress than
before the financial crisis, weak profits and concerns about sufficiency of
financial capital leaves euro-area banks and the financial sector vulnerable,
potentially acting as a drag on growth. Burdened by high levels of legacy
non-performing loans, Portuguese and Italian banks in particular are struggling to recapitalize and achieve a sustainable business model. Additionally,
declines in investor confidence may signal questions about the capacity of
both countries to support its banks, if necessary, given weak growth and
high sovereign indebtedness. Similar vulnerabilities are also weighing on
some large institutions such that the Euro Stoxx Bank Index—an aggregate
of European bank equity prices—has fallen 17.8 percent since the beginning
of the year. Slow growth, low interest rates, and what some observers call
oversaturation of lenders in some credit markets have compressed profit
opportunities.
Japan
Japan has continued to face economic challenges in 2016. Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe is promoting a package of structural reforms aimed at
jumpstarting growth in the Japanese economy, in addition to campaigning
for monetary stimulus and advocating for “flexible” fiscal policy, renewing
his signature “Abenomics.” After dipping in and out of recession since its
1992 financial crisis, economic growth in 2016 continues to be sluggish,
growing 0.8 percent over the four quarters ended in 2016:Q3. Slow growth
is due in large part to Japan’s declining working-age population. When
looking at real GDP per working-age population rather than real GDP,
136  |  Chapter 2

for example, Japan has grown almost as robustly as the United States over
the past 25 years. For this reason, promoting fertility while encouraging
women’s continued engagement in the labor force is a pillar of the second
phase of Abenomics.
Deflationary pressures continue to plague Japan despite expansive
monetary policy. In 2016, the Bank of Japan began an experiment using
negative interest rates to complement its quantitative easing program. The
objective is to put downward pressure on short-term interest rates and raise
inflation by reinforcing its commitment to its inflation target and trying
to encourage spending over saving. Partly as a result of these policies, the
yield curve flattened, with even the 10-year benchmark yield falling below
zero. More recently, the bank has announced continued asset purchases
and introduced a policy of yield curve control, which sets up an interest
rate target of around 0 percent on 10-year Japanese government bonds.
The IMF Global Financial Stability report cautions on the increased reliance of Japanese banks on wholesale dollar funding to finance foreign asset
purchases, which could make banks more sensitive to disruptions in dollar
funding markets.

Emerging Markets
The situation in some emerging markets has improved relative to
2015, but growth in 2016 is still underperforming expectations compared
with forecasts made in 2015, while there continues to be uncertainty surrounding major commodity exporters and China. Emerging markets are
expected to account for 54 percent of world growth in 2016, compared with
53 percent in 2015, and 60 percent between 2010 and 2014. As a group, their
2016 growth is expected to come in below the 2015 forecast. The IMF estimates that growth will pick up in 2017, as growth in several oil-producing
emerging markets, such as Brazil, and Russia (which are expected to recover
from recession) compensates for the steady slowdown in China (IMF 2016b).
Oil-Exporting Emerging Markets. The substantial decline in oil prices
from mid-2014 through 2016 has put considerable pressure on the economies of many oil exporters, especially those with undiversified economies.
Oil sales remain the primary source of government revenues in several
oil-exporting countries, so the drop in oil prices from over $100 a barrel in
2014 to between $25-$55 a barrel in 2016 has put tremendous pressure on
government budgets. As figure 2-44 demonstrates, the oil price that guarantees a neutral fiscal balance is well above the current price of Brent in many
oil-exporting countries.
Beyond the fiscal concerns, in countries where the price of extracting
oil is relatively high, the strain of lower prices for oil and other commodities

has generated recessions. For example, Brazil’s economy continued to
contract (partially due to oil prices) and Venezuela’s economy collapsed.
Unemployment in Brazil in October 2016 was at its highest level since mid2004, though this may be due to a recent change in its computation. Recent
improvements—such as real GDP contracting less than expected in the third
quarter, housing prices beginning to stabilize, and the appreciation of the
Brazilian real reflecting strengthening financial market sentiment—suggest
Brazil’s economy may be beginning to recover and see positive growth in
2017. The combination of the commodities price bust, economic sanctions
following its annexation of Crimea in 2014, and reduced firm access to
international capital markets have caused Russia to enter a recession since
late 2014 from which the IMF expects Russia will exit in 2017 (IMF 2016b).
Other Major Emerging Markets. Among other major emerging
market economies, growth has been mixed in 2016. India remains one of
the fastest-growing countries in the world, with real GDP expanding at 7.3
percent in the four quarters through 2016:Q3. However, countries that typically export to China and the advanced economies have suffered due to the
slowdown in those important markets.
Economic growth in China has been on a downward trend since a
brief rebound after the global financial crisis. China has been attempting to
rebalance from an investment- and export-driven economy to an economy

driven more by private consumption. However, more recently, China may
be postponing its longer-term goal of rebalancing in order to stabilize
growth in the near term after growth fell from 7.2 percent in the four quarters ended in 2014:Q4 to 6.7 percent in the four quarters ended in 2016:Q3.
In 2016, credit growth has been rapid, increasing financial risks, with credit
to the non-financial sector as a percent of GDP now exceeding that of major
emerging market economies (see Figure 2-45), real estate prices hitting
record highs, and distressed bank assets rising.
Against this backdrop, the Chinese renminbi (RMB) has been gradually depreciating since mid-2015 against both the dollar and a weighted basket of currencies. Net capital outflows, which had stabilized in the spring and
early summer, edged up again in the third quarter and uncertainty about the
course of policy in the near term may be putting downward pressure against
the RMB. China’s current account surplus is well below its recent peak, but
has been considerably above levels the IMF assesses to be appropriate, and
it still constitutes a substantial portion of the world’s current account surpluses. As China’s economy grew to 15 percent of global GDP in 2015, targeted industrial policies have made it the world’s largest manufacturer and
the dominant producer of some key goods in the global marketplace, as well
as a major source of demand for an array of goods, magnifying the effects
of changes in its domestic economy on global prices and growth. Delays in

The Year in Review and the Years Ahead  |  139

adjusting to changing dynamics in the world economy have led to excess
capacity in some industries where China is a dominant player. Adjusting to
these factors poses additional challenges for policymakers.
Economic growth in India continues at a solid pace of a projected 7.4
percent over the 4 quarters of 2016 (IMF 2016b). Private consumption has
been a major driver in economic growth, contributing 4.3 percentage points
to its 7.3 percent real GDP growth rate in the four quarters through 2016:Q3.
Lower inflation and fiscal consolidation over the past year has created
additional policy space for India to stimulate growth should a crisis occur.
Macroeconomic risks revolve around inflationary pressure stemming from
increasing commodity prices, which could weigh on the current account and
fiscal deficit (OECD 2016). Inefficiencies remain in the public sector, with
India’s poor still lacking health care coverage, educational attainment, and
access to financial services (IMF 2016a). Further, inequality in India remains
high.

The Outlook
GDP Growth over the Next Three Years
After growing roughly 2.6 percent on average during the four quarters
of 2013 and 2014, real GDP growth averaged 1.9 percent during the four
quarters of 2015 and 1.8 percent at an annual rate during the first three quarters of 2016. The Administration forecast (finalized on November 9, 2016)
projects an acceleration to 2.4-percent growth during the four quarters of
2017. The Administration forecast is the same as the CBO’s August 2016
forecast and slightly above the Blue-Chip November consensus forecast of
2.2 percent. All forecasts implicitly or explicitly make assumptions about the
future course of economic policy. The Administration’s forecast is based on
a baseline that assumes enactment of the President’s policies, most of which
were spelled out in the budget released in February 2016. In contrast, the
CBO forecast assumes that current laws are unchanged while the Blue Chip
implicitly reflects the expectations that private forecasters have about what
policies will actually be enacted in the future.
The Administration’s forecast expects that forces that influence
investment and government spending point to faster growth in 2017 than
in the recent past, while consumer spending will moderate somewhat and
international forces will likely be a drag on growth. With a strengthening
State and local sector, State and local fiscal actions will likely be somewhat
expansionary in 2017.

140  |  Chapter 2

Meanwhile, core inflation (excluding food and energy) is at 1.7 percent during the 12 months through October and remains below the Federal
Reserve target of 2 percent for the PCE price index (the version of the consumer price index in the National Income and Product Accounts), partly
due to declining import prices, and below-average capacity utilization. And
so, though the unemployment rate is now close to the rate consistent with
stable inflation, inflation is likely to remain low and unlikely to impose
constraints, at least during the next four quarters. For consumers, continued growth in nominal and real wage gains in 2016—together with strong
employment growth—will probably continue to boost spending in 2017.
These income gains—following a multiyear period of successful deleveraging—leave consumers in an improved financial position (Box 2-6). Business
investment also shows brighter prospects for growth in 2017 than in earlier
years as the overhang of excess capital that suppressed investment earlier in
this expansion has been reduced. As the economy continues to grow, businesses will need new facilities, equipment, and intellectual property to meet
growing demand, and the expected pickup in output growth should support
an uptick in investment as well (Box 2-7), though global headwinds will
continue to be a concern for this sector.
Although most domestic signals are positive, the United States faces
some headwinds from abroad. The available late-2016 indicators suggest
that the economies of China, India, Mexico, and our euro-area trading
partners are growing more slowly than in 2015, while Canada’s growth is
accelerating. The trade-weighted average of foreign GDP growth in the four
quarters ended in 2016:Q3 has been 2.1 percent, down from the 2.3 percent
average growth rate during the preceding four quarters. On the more positive side, forecasts are for a small pickup in global growth in 2017. Overall
weak growth abroad not only reduces our exports and slows domestic
investment, but also raises risks of adverse financial and other spillovers to
the U.S. economy.
The unemployment rate in November 2016 at 4.6 percent differed
little from the projected long run unemployment rate that is consistent with
stable inflation in the long run, though some broader measures of labor market slack remain somewhat elevated. These facets of the labor market along
with the fact that the capacity utilization rate in manufacturing, which was
74.9 percent in October, is below its long-run average (80 percent), suggest
that the economy still has a bit of room to grow faster than its potential rate.
The Administration’s economic forecast is presented in Table 2-1.
When the Administration forecast was finalized in November 2016, real
GDP growth during the four quarters of 2016 was projected at 1.9 percent.
Real GDP is projected to grow 2.4, 2.3, and 2.2 percent during the four

Treasury, and the Office of Management and Budget.

quarters of 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. The growth rates slightly
exceed the Administration’s estimated rate of potential real GDP growth
over the long run of 2.2 percent a year based on the view that some limited
slack remains in the economy. As a consequence of growth being slightly
above the long-run trend over the next two years, the unemployment rate is
likely to temporarily fall from its 4.9 percent rate in 2016:Q3 to 4.6 percent
in 2017:Q4. The unemployment rate is expected to return to the administration’s estimate of 4.8 percent for the rate of unemployment consistent with
stable inflation in 2019:Q4. The price index for GDP, which increased just
1.3 percent during the four quarters through 2016:Q3, is expected to slowly
creep up, reaching 2.0 percent in 2019, a rate that is roughly consistent with
the Federal Reserve’s 2-percent target for the PCE price index.
Nominal interest rates are currently low because of forces that have
led to a reduction in expected long-run interest rates and wounds that
have not fully healed from the last recession, while monetary policy has

142  |  Chapter 2

kept rates low across a wide range of debt securities with long maturities.
Consistent with the Federal Reserve’s forward policy guidance at the time
of the forecast, long-term interest rates are projected to rise. Eventually, real
interest rates (that is, nominal rates less the projected rate of inflation) are
predicted to move toward, but still remain well below, their historical average. These interest-rate paths are close to those projected by the consensus of
professional economic forecasters. During the past several years, consensus
forecasts for long-term interest rates and long-term economic growth have
fallen, reflecting changes in views on productivity, demographics, the term
premium, and global saving and investment behavior.

GDP Growth over the Long Term
As discussed earlier, the long-run growth rate of the economy is
determined by the growth of its supply-side components, including those
governed by demographics and technological change. The growth rate that
characterizes the long-run trend in real U.S. GDP—or potential GDP—plays
an important role in guiding the Administration’s long-run forecast. After
a brief period of above-trend growth in 2017 and 2018, real output growth
shifts down to its long-term trend rate of 2.2 percent a year. These growth
rates are slower than historical averages mostly because of the aging of the
baby-boom generation into the retirement years and because of slower
growth of the working-age population (Box 2-5).
The long-run potential GDP growth rate is 0.5-percentage point
higher than the growth rate that would be expected if current law is
unchanged. Specifically, the forecast assumes the President’s policies,
including substantial investments in transportation infrastructure, business
tax reform, universal preschool (and other policies to boost female labor
force participation), free community college, reforms to the immigration
system, policies to expand cross-border trade, and approximately $2 trillion
in deficit reduction (Box 2-9). A different set of policy assumptions would
lead to different assumptions for potential GDP growth.
The potential real GDP projections are based on the assumption that
the President’s full set of policy proposals, which would boost long-run
output, are enacted (Box 2-9).18
Table 2-2 shows the Administration’s forecast for the contribution of
each supply-side factor to the growth in potential real GDP: the workingage population; the rate of labor force participation; the employed share
of the labor force; the length of the workweek; labor productivity; and the
difference between productivity growth for the economy as a whole and the
18

Box 2-9: Policy Proposals to Raise Output over the Next-Ten Years
The Administration has a wide-ranging and robust economic
agenda that, if enacted, would expand the labor force and boost productivity. In line with long-standing precedent, the Administration’s
economic forecast incorporates the impact of the President’s policy
proposals. CEA estimates that, in total, these proposals would add over
5 percent to the level of output in 2027. As a result of including policy
assumptions, the Administration’s forecast for the level of output in 2027
is about 2 percent higher than the forecasts from both the Congressional
Budget Office and the Blue Chip consensus panel, as well as about 4
percent higher than the median forecast from the Federal Open Market
Committee.
Immigration reform. The policy proposal with the largest effect
on output is immigration reform, as embodied in the bipartisan Border
Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act
that passed the U.S. Senate in June 2013. CBO (2013a) estimated that
this legislation, if enacted, would raise the level of real GDP by 3.3 percent after 10 years. Immigration reform would benefit the economy by
counteracting the effects of an aging native-born population, attracting
highly skilled immigrants that engage in innovative or entrepreneurial
activities, and enabling better job-matching for currently undocumented
workers who are offered a path to citizenship. Much of the overall effect
is due to an expanded workforce. However, 0.7 percentage point of the
total effect from immigration reform is due to increased total factor productivity, and this is reflected in the Administration’s economic forecast.
Policies to expand cross-border trade and investment. The other
set of policies with a large effect on output are a number of international agreements that would boost cross-border trade and investment,
including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the Transatlantic Trade
and Investment Partnership (TTIP), an expansion of the Information
Technology Agreement (ITA), and a Trade in Services Agreement
(TISA). A new study supported by the Peterson Institute for International
Economics (Petri and Plummer 2016) finds that TPP could raise U.S.
real income by 0.5 percent in 2030. The European Commission (2013)
estimates a roughly similar effect of TTIP on the U.S. economy, an
increase of 0.4 percent in GDP in 2027. In addition, if TPP does not pass,
the United States would also face trade diversion and enjoy less market
access compared with other countries such as China. The Regional
Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a trade agreement that involves
China, Japan, and other fast-growing Asian economies, will provide its
member countries with improved market access, putting U.S. exporters
at a disadvantage (CEA 2016c).

144  |  Chapter 2

Investments in surface transportation infrastructure. The
Administration recognizes that investments in infrastructure support
economic growth by creating jobs, and boosting productivity, and
strengthening the manufacturing sector. In December 2015, the bipartisan Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (H.R. 22), which
authorizes $226.3 billion in budget authority for Federal-aid highway
programs over five years, was enacted into law. This funding is an
important down payment, but the country must further transform our
transportation system to achieve a cleaner, safer transportation future.
The President’s FY 2017 budget calls for $32 billion a year over 10 years
to support innovative programs that make our communities more livable and sustainable. The IMF (2014) estimates that, given the current
underutilization of resources in many advanced economies, a 1-percentof-GDP permanent increase in public infrastructure investment could
help increase output by as much as 2.5 percent after 10 years.
Policies to boost labor force participation. The Administration
has pursued policies that enable all workers to participate in the labor
force to their full potential by making it easier for workers to balance
career and family responsibilities. The Administration’s FY 2017 budget
calls to triple the maximum child care tax credit to $3,000 for children
younger than 5, while enabling more middle-class families to receive the
maximum credit. In addition, every year since 2013, the President has
proposed a Federal-State partnership that would provide all 4-year olds
from low- and moderate-income families with access to high-quality
preschool. Finally, the budget calls to provide technical assistance to
help states implement and develop paid parental leave programs. These
policies would increase labor force participation and the level of output.
Policies to make college affordable. The Administration is committed to making college affordable. The budget includes $61 billion over
10 years to make the first two years of community college tuition free for
responsible students through a Federal-State cost sharing partnership.
This plan would increase America’s human capital and productivity by
enabling 2 million people who would not have enrolled in college to earn
an associate’s degree.
Business tax reform. President Obama’s framework for business tax reform issued in 2012 sets out a series of changes that would
strengthen the economy in three main ways. First, by lowering average
tax rates, the President’s plan would boost investment in the United
States. Second, by moving to a more neutral tax system, the proposals
would result in a more efficient allocation of capital. And third, to the
degree the new system better addresses externalities, for example with a
more generous research and development credit, it would also increase

The Year in Review and the Years Ahead  |  145

total factor productivity and therefore growth. (See Chapter 5 of the 2015
Report for a discussion of the economic benefits of business tax reform.)
Deficit reduction. CBO’s (2013b) analysis of the macroeconomic
effects of alternative budgetary paths estimates that a hypothetical $2
trillion in primary deficit reduction over 10 years raises the long-term
level of real GDP by 0.5 percent. This effect arises because lower Federal
deficits translate into higher national saving, lower interest rates and, in
turn, greater private investment. The Administration’s FY 2017 budget
proposal includes $2.9 trillion in primary deficit reduction relative to
the Administration’s plausible baseline. Results of CBO’s methodology
would raise the level of output in 2027 by 0.6 percent.
Other Policies. Numerous other policies—ranging from policies to
increase competition to increasing innovation or spurring green energy
development might also raise growth over time, but are not explicitly
modeled in the budget forecast.
(Note, to be consistent with previous Administration forecasts the
portion of growth due to the workforce effects of immigration reform
are not incorporated in the forecast or the underlying detail, for example
in Table 2.1. Excluding this component, the policies add 3 percent to the
level of output in 2027.)

nonfarm business sector. The two columns of Table 2-2 show the average
annual growth rate for each factor during a long period of history and over
the forecast horizon. The first column shows the long-run average growth
rates between the business-cycle peak of 1953 and the latest quarter available
when the forecast was finalized (2016:Q3). Many of these variables show
substantial fluctuations within business cycles, so that long-period growth
rates must be examined to uncover underlying trends. The second column
shows average projected growth rates between 2016:Q3 and 2027:Q4; that is,
the entire 11¼-year interval covered by the Administration forecast.
The population is projected to grow 1.0 percent a year, on average,
over the projection period (line 1, column 2), following the latest projection from the Social Security Administration. Over this same period, the
labor force participation rate is projected to decline 0.4 percent a year (line
2, column 2). This projected decline in the labor force participation rate
primarily reflects a negative demographic trend deriving from the aging of
the baby-boom generation into retirement. During the next couple of years,
however, rising labor demand due to the continuing business-cycle recovery
is expected to offset some of this downward trend.
The employed share of the labor force—which is equal to one minus
the unemployment rate—is expected to remain roughly constant during the

next 11 years because as the 2016:Q3 unemployment rate (4.9 percent) is
only slightly higher than the 4.8 percent rate at which the rate of unemployment eventually stabilizes. The workweek is projected to be roughly flat during the forecast period, an improvement relative to its long-term historical
trend growth of a 0.2-percent-a-year decline. The workweek is expected to
stabilize because some of the demographic forces pushing it down are largely
exhausted, and because a longer workweek is projected to compensate for
the anticipated decline in the labor force participation rate in what will
eventually become an economy with a tight labor supply.
Labor productivity is projected to increase 1.9  percent a year over
the entire forecast interval (line 6, column 2), slightly less than the same as
the average growth rate from 1953 to 2015 (line 6, column 1). Productivity
The Year in Review and the Years Ahead  |  147

tends to grow faster in the nonfarm business sector than for the economy
as a whole, because productivity in the government and household sectors
of the economy is presumed (by a national-income accounting convention)
not to grow (that is, output in those two sectors grows only through the use
of more production inputs). The difference in these growth rates is expected
to subtract 0.3 percentage point a year during the 11-year projection period,
similar to the 0.2-percent-a-year decline during the long-term historical
interval (line 10, columns 1 and 2). This productivity differential is equal to
the sum of two other growth rates in the table: the ratio of nonfarm business
employment to household employment (line 4) and the ratio of real GDP to
nonfarm business output (line 7).
Summing the growth rates of all of its components, real GDP is projected to rise at an average 2.2 percent a year over the projection period (line
8, column 2), the same as the annual growth rate for potential real GDP (line
9, column 2). Actual GDP is expected to grow faster than potential GDP only
in 2017 and 2018, and by a small margin that is invisible in the long-term
averages shown in the table.
As noted earlier, but shown in more detail in this table, real potential
GDP (line 9, column 2) is projected to grow more slowly than the long-term
historical growth rate of 3.1 percent a year (line 9, column 1), primarily due
to the lower projected growth rate of the working-age population and the
retirement of the baby-boom cohort.

Upside and Downside Forecast Risks
Like any forecast, the Administration’s economic forecast comes with
possible errors in either direction, and several are worth enumerating here.
One upside risk is from the homebuilding sector, which has some upside
potential given the current low level of homebuilding relative to historic
trends and its potential for increase. Additionally, labor force participation
could continue to grow as it has this year, after decades of decline in participation among prime-age workers (Box 2-3). On the downside, it appears
that global growth may remain sluggish and global trade growth has slowed
dramatically, which may slow the growth of exports and investment. In
addition, financial market developments—either reflecting spillovers from
abroad or U.S.-specific issues—also pose downside risks. Over the longerrun, there are some downside risks to the estimate of potential output
growth insofar as recent low productivity growth rates might continue.

148  |  Chapter 2

Conclusion
	 The economy continued to strengthen during 2016, especially in
the labor market with robust employment gains and continued declines in
unemployment. Job growth continued to exceed the pace needed to maintain a steady unemployment rate (given that labor force participation is
trending down with demographics). That job growth, along with solid wage
growth, combined to generate rising household incomes and improving living standards. The American economic recovery has outpaced most of the
other advanced economies and left a national economy well-prepared for
continued resilience. The United States has domestic strengths, especially
in the household sector, that have the potential to support continued solid
growth in 2017—but at the same time, we face a set of challenges associated
with the slowing global economy.
Looking ahead, some of the most important decisions that we make
as a Nation are the structural policies that influence long-term growth and
how it is shared. The President’s FY 2017 budget set forth a number of policies that could be expected to increase the level or long-term growth rate of
potential GDP. As the economy has approached its long-run natural rate of
unemployment, it is these long-term structural policies that could lift growth
and sustain long-term prosperity for a greater share of Americans.

PROGRESS REDUCING
INEQUALITY

I

n 2013, President Obama declared inequality “the defining challenge
of our time.” According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in
that year—the most recent year for which complete data are available—the
20 percent of households with the lowest incomes had an average pre-tax
income of $25,000, while the 1 percent of households with the highest
incomes had an average income of $1.6 million (CBO 2016b). Roughly 15
percent of Americans lived in poverty, even as mean household income
reached $75,000 (Proctor, Semega, and Kollar 2016).1 Moreover, these
disparities persist across generations due to low levels of intergenerational
mobility. Only 8 percent of children from the bottom 20 percent of the
income distribution make it to the top 20 percent as adults, while 37 percent
of children from the top 20 percent stay there (Chetty et al. 2014).
Inequality extends well beyond the distribution of income. Median
wealth for non-Hispanic White families in 2013 was $142,000, compared
with only $18,000 for all other families (Bricker et al. 2014). A 40-year-old
man at the 95th percentile of the income distribution has a life expectancy 10
years longer than a man at the 5th percentile (Chetty et al. 2016). Students
from families in the bottom 25 percent of the income distribution drop out
of high school at a rate four times higher than students from families in the
top 25 percent (NCES 2015).
Perhaps most troubling is the fact that rising inequality, in conjunction
with slower productivity growth, has led to slow growth in inflation-adjusted
incomes for the typical household for more than three decades. In previous
work, the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) found that if inequality had

1 The Census Bureau and the Congressional Budget Office use different definitions of income
in their estimates of the income distribution. CBO’s definition is generally more comprehensive
than that used by the Census Bureau. Mean income in 2013 per the Census Bureau was $75,000
while mean before-tax income in 2013 per CBO was $100,000.

151

not increased from 1973 to 2013, income for the typical household in 2013
would have been about 18 percent, or $9,000, higher (CEA 2015).
From his first days in office, President Obama has taken important
steps to reduce inequality and make the economy work for all Americans.
The policy response to the Great Recession directly reduced inequality in
after-tax incomes through progressive tax and spending policies, such as
temporary tax cuts for working and middle-class families and extensions
of unemployment insurance; and indirectly, the response reduced earnings
inequality by boosting employment. This policy response—including the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) and subsequent
fiscal measures, bank stress tests, and other financial policy measures, support for the automobile industry, and the actions of the Federal Reserve—
kept the unemployment rate 6 percentage points lower than it otherwise
would have been between 2010 and 2012. By reducing the unemployment
rate, these policies offset roughly half of the increase in earnings inequality
that would have occurred as even more workers lost their jobs and saw their
earnings fall to zero.
The Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted in March 2010, provided
Federal support to states to expand their Medicaid programs and financial
assistance for families purchasing coverage through the Health Insurance
Marketplace, leading to the largest reduction in the uninsured rate since the
creation of Medicare and Medicaid and a substantial reduction in inequality in after-tax incomes. The ACA has resulted in 20 million additional
American adults gaining health insurance coverage as of early 2016 and
helped reduce the uninsured rate to 8.9 percent in the first half of 2016, the
lowest level on record. The ACA reduced inequality in health insurance
coverage by age, race, and income, with larger reductions in uninsured
rates for groups with lower levels of coverage, including young adults, racial
minorities, and low-income families. A growing body of research documents that expanded coverage under the ACA is greatly improving families’
well-being by increasing their access to care, financial security, and health.
Viewed as additions to income, expanded Medicaid eligibility and financial
assistance for families purchasing health insurance through the Marketplace
have dramatically reduced inequality in after-tax incomes.
Over the course of this Administration, the President has signed into
law a series of progressive changes in tax policy that have increased tax rates
for the highest-income Americans and increased the generosity of tax credits for working families, thereby reducing inequality in after-tax incomes.
Changes in tax policy other than ACA coverage provisions will boost aftertax incomes in the bottom quintile by 2 percent in 2017 and reduce after-tax
incomes for the top 0.1 percent by 9 percent relative to what incomes would
152  |  Chapter 3

have been under 2008 policies.2,3 (The policy impacts discussed in this
chapter generally compare after-tax incomes in 2017 under current policy
with counterfactual after-tax incomes in 2017 under 2008 policies. After-tax
incomes include the value of government transfers such as Medicare and
Medicaid.)
Together, changes in tax policy and the ACA coverage provisions will
increase the share of after-tax income received by the bottom quintile in
2017 by 0.6 percentage point, or 18 percent, and the share received by the
second quintile by 0.5 percentage point, or 6 percent. They will reduce the
share received by the top 1 percent by 1.2 percentage points, or 7 percent.
Moreover, they will boost incomes in the bottom quintile by 18 percent,
equivalent to more than a decade of average income gains. And they will
increase average tax rates for the top 0.1 percent of families, a group projected to have average pre-tax incomes over $8 million, by nearly 7 percentage points.
The legislation President Obama has signed into law represents a
historic achievement in reducing inequality. Tax changes enacted since
2009 have boosted the share of after-tax income received by the bottom 99
percent of families by more than the tax changes of any previous administration since at least 1960. The President has also overseen the largest increase
in Federal investment to reduce inequality since the Great Society programs
of the Johnson Administration, an increase that largely reflects the coverage
provisions of the ACA and expanded tax credits for working families.
However, while these accomplishments are historically large, much
more work remains to be done to reverse the decades-long increase in
inequality. From the business cycle peak in 1979 to the business cycle peak
in 2007, the after-tax income share of the top 1 percent more than doubled.
Changes in tax policy and the coverage provisions of the ACA have rolled
back one-third of the decline in the share of after-tax income accruing to the
bottom quintile of households over this period and one-tenth of the increase
in the share accruing to the top 1 percent of households.
As the discussion above highlights, addressing the many manifestations of inequality requires a comprehensive set of policies. Inequality is
a product of economic institutions, standards, and norms; technological
2 Each quintile contains 20 percent of families, ranked by their incomes (adjusted for family
size). For example, the bottom quintile contains the 20 percent of families with the lowest
incomes, and the second quintile contains the 20 percent of families with the next lowest
incomes. However, in this analysis, families with negative incomes are excluded from the
bottom quintile as these families are typically quite different from other low-income families.
3 As used in this report, the ACA coverage provisions include expanded Medicaid eligibility,
the Premium Tax Credit, cost-sharing reductions, small employer tax credits, the individual
shared responsibility payment, and the employer shared responsibility payment.

Progress Reducing Inequality  |  153

developments; individual behavior; and a multitude of other factors. Some
policies—such as ensuring that everyone pays their fair share in taxes,
expanding access to health insurance and to high-quality child care,
raising the minimum wage, and expanding tax credits for working families—address inequality directly and in the near term, in addition to their
longer-run benefits. Other policies—such as improving education, reforming intellectual property laws, and reforming land use and zoning regulations—work to reduce inequality primarily over the long term. Still others
address the temporary inequality that accompanies economic downturns
by providing appropriate countercyclical fiscal support to reduce economic
slack and unemployment.
The President’s policy proposals would further reduce inequality
in both pre-tax and after-tax incomes. Increasing the minimum wage, as
the President has called on Congress and State and local governments to
do, would immediately boost incomes for millions of low-wage workers
and reduce income inequality. Expanding access to high-quality child care
and early education and ending family homelessness, as the President has
proposed, would reduce inequality today while also increasing mobility
and improving economic outcomes in the longer term. The tax reforms
proposed in the Fiscal Year 2017 Budget would increase average tax rates on
the top 0.1 percent by an additional 9 percentage points and would roll back
an additional 13 percent of the increase in the after-tax income share of the
top 1 percent of households between 1979 and 2007. Expanding the Earned
Income Tax Credit (EITC) for workers without dependent children would
provide 13 million low-income workers with a tax cut averaging nearly $500
for each worker, increasing the returns to work and supporting labor force
participation.
This chapter focuses on three specific areas where the Administration
has achieved its most substantial and immediate success in reducing inequality: restoring economic growth, expanding health insurance coverage, and
enacting a fairer tax code (Table 3-1). However, the Administration also has
undertaken a much broader set of initiatives designed to address inequality
and promote opportunity. Some of these efforts, such as investments in early
childhood education and job training, are designed to have longer-term
impacts. (See Box 3-4 for an overview of additional policies that will reduce
inequality by raising wages and expanding educational opportunity, but are
not examined in detail in this chapter. Also see Chapter 5 for additional
discussion of the Administration’s record on education policy.)
The chapter first examines each of the three major policy areas listed
above. It then places the Administration’s record in historical context,
comparing the reductions in income inequality first with previous Federal

action affecting income inequality since the 1960s and then with the growth
in income inequality since the late 1970s. The chapter finishes by highlighting several of the President’s proposals that would further reduce inequality.

The Recovery Act: Restoring Growth
When the President took office in January 2009, the country was experiencing the worst economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression.
In the previous year, private employers shed 3.6 million jobs, household
wealth dropped 16 percent, and the unemployment rate jumped from 5 percent to 7 percent on its way to a peak of 10 percent. One important aspect of
combatting inequality is limiting macroeconomic downturns, during which
unemployment rises and earnings inequality rises along with it. By taking
timely, aggressive action to combat the financial crisis and economic downturn, the Administration limited the extent to which inequality rose during
the Great Recession and its aftermath.
In February 2009, the President signed into law the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) to provide countercyclical
fiscal support to the economy and to help boost employment, output, and
wages. The Recovery Act included a mix of aid to affected individuals, support for State and local governments, public investments, and individual and
business tax cuts. More than a dozen subsequent fiscal measures extended
certain Recovery Act provisions and introduced additional countercyclical
policies, such as the temporary payroll tax cut in effect during 2011 and
2012. In total, discretionary fiscal stimulus from 2009 through 2012 totaled
$1.4 trillion and averaged around 2 percent of GDP (Furman 2015). The
Recovery Act, subsequent fiscal measures, financial policy measures, support for the automobile industry, and the Federal Reserve’s independent
actions combined to substantially reduce the harm of the Great Recession,
in part by moderating the increase in unemployment that would otherwise
Box 3-1: Trends in Inequality
Income, wealth, and consumption inequality have increased
sharply in the United States in recent decades (Table 3-I). However,
while overall inequality of income and wealth has increased, some other
measures of financial inequality have decreased. For example, the gender
pay gap has narrowed in recent decades, even as it remains too large
(CEA 2016b). Similarly, while inequality in life expectancy at middle age
has also increased, some other aspects of health inequality show signs of
improvement.

have occurred. In doing so, these policies partially offset the cyclical increase
in earnings inequality associated with economic downturns. In addition,
the progressive fiscal policies included in the Recovery Act and subsequent
legislation, including tax cuts for working and middle-class families and
extended unemployment insurance, further reduced inequality and helped
families struggling to handle job loss, reduced working hours, and other
consequences of the downturn.

Reducing Unemployment and Earnings Inequality
The economic suffering caused by recessions is distributed in a highly
unequal manner. The unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed,
bear a disproportionate share of the burden. Countercyclical policy is thus
not only essential to ensure that our economy operates at its potential, but
also plays an important role in reducing inequality (Bivens 2015; Coibion et
al. 2016).
The Recovery Act and other elements of the fiscal policy response
to the Great Recession boosted employment and output and reduced the
unemployment rate relative to what they would have been absent the policy
response. According to Blinder and Zandi (2015), the fiscal policy response
boosted employment by roughly 2.5 million jobs and reduced the unemployment rate by 1.5 percentage points on average each year between 2010
and 2012 (Figure 3-1). The broader policy response, including not only
fiscal policy but also financial measures pursued by the Administration,
independent actions by the Federal Reserve, and support for the automobile
industry, boosted employment by about 9 million jobs and reduced the
unemployment rate by 6 percentage points on average each year from 2010
through 2012.4 These estimates may even understate the impact of the policy
response because they do not incorporate a role for negative long-term
effects of recessions. If unemployment reduces the economy’s potential
going forward, the true impact of the policy response may exceed the impact
shown here.
One particularly stark illustration of the unequal burden created by
economic downturns is the disparity in unemployment rates by race and
other demographic characteristics. The unemployment rate for the population as a whole increased 5 percentage points, from 5 to 10 percent, during
the Great Recession and its immediate aftermath. However, the unemployment rate for African American workers rose 8 percentage points to nearly
4 In previous work, CEA estimated that the Recovery Act and subsequent fiscal measures
increased employment by about 9 million job-years through the end of 2012, broadly consistent
with the estimates of the impact of the fiscal policy response by Blinder and Zandi (CEA 2014a).
(A job year is the equivalent of a full-time job held for one year.)

17 percent, and for Hispanic workers it rose 7 percentage points to 13
percent (Figure 3-2). As the overall unemployment rate has fallen during
the recovery, the unemployment rates for African American and Hispanic
workers have fallen by even more, though they continue to exceed the rates
of unemployment for the overall population.
Through increases in the unemployment rate, economic downturns
drive increases in earnings inequality. As measured by the Gini index,
changes in inequality in weekly earnings for the population ages 18-64—
including those not currently employed—closely track changes in the unemployment rate over time (Figure 3-3). (The Gini index is a summary measure
of inequality that ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater
inequality.) During and immediately after recessions, earnings inequality
increases sharply along with the unemployment rate. As the unemployment
rate recovers, earnings inequality decreases. The correlation between unemployment and the Gini index reflects both the mechanical effect of higher
unemployment as well as any changes in the distribution of earnings.
While earnings inequality increases during recessions, other measures
of inequality can decrease. A decrease in inequality would be expected for
measures of income inequality that rely on more comprehensive definitions
of income, that are more sensitive to changes in average incomes for the
highest-income families, or that measure incomes over longer periods of

time. Investment income is concentrated among high-income families and
generally falls sharply during recessions, which reduces the income share
of these families when using broader measures of income or measures of
inequality that are particularly sensitive to high incomes. Similarly, safetynet policies provide partial protection against income losses that result from
unemployment even though earnings fall to zero, thus reducing the recessionary increase in inequality in broader measures of income. The different
behavior of these inequality measures provides important insights into
how different parts of the economy vary with the business cycle. Earnings
inequality reflects individuals’ experiences in the labor market, while
inequality in more comprehensive measures of income tracks the financial
resources families have available. (Another important issue in evaluating
inequality is distinguishing short-term cyclical developments from longerterm trends. See Box 3-2 at the end of this section for a discussion of this
issue as it relates to the evolution of the income share of the top 1 percent of
households since 2000.)
To quantify the impact of the policy response to the Great Recession
on inequality, Figure 3-4 shows the actual Gini index for earnings since 2000
and the Gini index for two simulations reflecting what might have occurred

without the policy response.5 These calculations suggest that the policy
response to the Great Recession reduced the increase in the Gini index for
earnings by roughly half compared with what would have occurred absent
the policy response.

Supporting Struggling Families
In addition to their effects on unemployment and earnings, the
Recovery Act and subsequent fiscal measures also had a direct impact on
inequality in after-tax incomes through the progressive fiscal policies that
they incorporated to support struggling families.
A large portion of the fiscal policy response consisted of tax cuts for
working and middle-class families. The Recovery Act created the Making
Work Pay credit and expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and
Child Tax Credit (CTC) for 2009 and 2010, among other provisions. The
Making Work Pay credit provided a tax cut for 95 percent of workers of
up to $400 for individuals and $800 for couples. In 2009, the Making Work
Pay credit and the EITC and CTC expansions boosted after-tax incomes for
families in the lowest quintile of the income distribution by 4 percent and
boosted incomes in the second quintile by 2 percent (Figure 3-5). In dollar
terms, these provisions provided average tax cuts of $400 and $500, respectively, for families in the first two quintiles. In 2011, the Making Work Pay
credit was replaced by a 2 percentage-point reduction in the payroll tax rate,
sometimes referred to as the payroll tax holiday, which was subsequently
extended through 2012. All told, for a family of four making $50,000 a year,
the Making Work Pay credit and payroll tax holiday provided a cumulative
tax cut of $3,600 over the first four years of the Administration.
A second key plank of the fiscal policy response was enhancements
to the unemployment insurance (UI) system. Both the pre-existing UI
system and the enhancements enacted during the Great Recession provided
essential support for hard-working American families struggling with the
loss of a job during the downturn. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that
unemployment insurance kept more than 11 million people out of poverty
5 Using data from the Current Population Survey, the simulation randomly re-assigns employed
individuals to unemployment (and thus zero earnings) within 64 demographic cells in numbers
calibrated to match the aggregate trends as estimated by Blinder and Zandi (2015), assuming
proportional increases in unemployment across all cells. Two important sources of uncertainty
in the estimate are the (unknown) distribution of earnings for those who would have lost their
jobs absent the policy response and the earnings impacts for those who remain employed. This
estimate assumes the earnings distribution for those who would have lost their jobs absent the
policy response is identical to the overall earnings distribution within demographic cells and
assumes no change in earnings for those who remain employed. A sensitivity exercise suggests
that the conclusion is not substantially affected unless the workers who would have lost their
jobs absent the policy response were selected primarily from the tails of the earnings distribution.

cumulatively between 2008 and 2012, according to the Supplemental Poverty
Measure (CEA and DOL 2013). (This is not a causal estimate because it does
not account for any changes in recipients’ behavior that might occur in the
absence of UI.) In 2012 alone, UI kept 2.5 million people out of poverty.
Between 2008 and 2013, more than 24 million workers received extended
benefits through either the Emergency Unemployment Compensation
program or Extended Benefits program. Including workers’ families, more
than 70 million people—including 17 million children—were supported by
extended UI benefits over this period (CEA and DOL 2013).
The Recovery Act also temporarily expanded benefits in the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provided emergency benefits through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, and
ended or prevented homelessness for over 1.3 million families through the
Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Rehousing Program (CEA 2014a). It
provided temporary support for States to sustain Medicaid coverage and
made investments in health centers, workforce programs, prevention, and
electronic health records.
In total, the pre-existing social insurance system, combined with the
expansions in the Recovery Act and subsequent extensions, offset nearly 90
percent of the increase in poverty that would otherwise have occurred, even
without accounting for impacts in moderating the recession itself (CEA

Box 3-2: Income Inequality and the Business Cycle
Income inequality is highly sensitive to economic conditions, and
short-term trends can easily differ from longer-term developments (see
Box 3-1 for a description of developments over the last 30 years). As a
result, interpreting year-to-year changes in measures of income inequality, such as the share of income accruing to the highest-income 1 percent
of households, must be done with attention to the business cycle. The
most recent business-cycle peak in 2007 saw the pre-tax income share
of the top 1 percent reach a record high of 19 percent, only to fall to 13
percent two years later in the depths of the Great Recession (Figure 3-i).
Both its sharp drop between 2007 and 2009 and subsequent rebound are
likely primarily cyclical developments.

Notwithstanding this short-term cyclical variation, income inequality has increased sharply in recent decades. This longer-term trend of rising income inequality culminated in the record-high income share of the
top 1 percent in 2007. The top 1 percent income share in 2013, the most
recent year for which comprehensive CBO estimates are available, was
below this record level but still high by historical standards. Averaged
across years, the income share of the top 1 percent has increased through
each complete decade from the 1980s to the present (see Figure 3-ii).

Notably, however, the growth rate of inequality may have slowed or
paused in recent years according to this measure. Since 2000, the income
share of the top 1 percent has been highly cyclical, but relatively littlechanged on net. At the same time, other measures of inequality, such as
the Gini index for market incomes, have continued to increase. These
data raise the possibility that the rapid increase in income inequality that
the United States has experienced over recent decades may be entering
a new phase. However, even if the growth in inequality has slowed, the
elevated level of inequality will remain a pressing concern.

2014a). Although the economy was dealt its most severe blow since the Great
Depression, the poverty rate measured to include the effects of antipoverty
policy measures rose just half a percentage point. Excluding these measures,
the poverty rate would have risen 4.5 percentage points—9 times greater
than the actual increase.

The Affordable Care Act: Providing
Affordable, Accessible Health Insurance
In 2008, 44 million Americans lacked health insurance. Individuals
with pre-existing conditions were often locked out of health insurance,

Progress Reducing Inequality  |  165

unable to obtain insurance at any price. For many others, health insurance was available but unaffordable. Many workers faced strong financial
incentives to remain in low-quality jobs, or jobs for which they were poorly
matched, because they needed the health insurance those jobs provided,
even when a better job was available or they saw an opportunity to go back
to school or to start a business.
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) introduced comprehensive reforms
to address these and other problems in the health care system. It requires
insurers to offer health insurance on the same terms to all applicants
regardless of their health status. Families can use the Health Insurance
Marketplace to compare and purchase policies with the certainty that they
will not be denied coverage, and the law provides financial assistance to
ensure that coverage is affordable. The law also supported an expansion of
Medicaid for the lowest-income Americans. In total, the ACA has resulted
in an additional 20 million American adults gaining health insurance coverage; reduced disparities in coverage by age, race, and income; and reduced
poverty and inequality. (See Chapter 4 for further discussion of the Obama
Administration’s record on health care policy.)

Reducing Disparities in Health Coverage and Health Status
The ACA has substantially reduced inequality in access to health care.
It has increased the number of American adults with health insurance by
20 million as of early 2016 and contributed to the largest drop in the share
of the population without health insurance since the creation of Medicare
and Medicaid in the 1960s (Furman and Fiedler 2014e; Uberoi, Finegold,
and Gee 2016). From 2010—the year of the law’s enactment—through the
first half of 2016, the share of the population without health insurance (the
uninsured rate) has fallen from 16.0 percent to 8.9 percent (Figure 3-6).
Uninsured rates varied markedly across different population groups
in 2010 (Figures 3-7A, 3-7B, and 3-7C). Uninsured rates for African
Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans were substantially higher than
those for Whites. And while nearly every American over age 65 had health
coverage thanks to Medicare, more than 30 percent of those between the
ages of 19 and 26 lacked health insurance. Families with incomes below 150
percent of the Federal poverty line lacked health insurance at a rate 9 times
that for families with incomes above 400 percent of the poverty line.
Improvements in health insurance coverage have reduced inequality
in access to health insurance along numerous dimensions, as demonstrated
by the particularly large coverage gains for groups with elevated uninsured
rates prior to reform. Between 2010 and 2015, coverage rates increased by 25
percentage points for Native Americans, 11 percentage points for Hispanics,

ages 19 to 26, with this age group no longer exhibiting the lowest rates of
coverage, and coverage increased by 13 percentage points for families with
incomes below 150 percent of the poverty line.
A growing body of research finds that the coverage expansions resulting from the ACA are generating important improvements in families’ wellbeing. Perhaps the most visible goal of expanding health insurance coverage
is improving access to care. Examining data through March 2015, Shartzer,
Long, and Anderson (2015) find that the share of non-elderly adults with
a usual source of care and the share who received a routine checkup in
the last 12 months has risen with expanded insurance coverage, while
the share reporting problems accessing care or forgoing care due to cost
has fallen. Examining a similar time period, Sommers et al. (2015) report
similar improvements in access to care, including reductions in the share of
non-elderly adults reporting problems affording care or lacking a personal
physician. The pattern of gains in these studies is consistent with the gains
having been caused by the ACA. Both studies report notably larger gains in
Medicaid expansion states, and Shartzer, Long, and Anderson (2015) find
that the largest gains in access were realized by low- and moderate-income
adults, a population that saw the largest gains in insurance coverage as a
result of the ACA’s coverage provisions.
This research also provides early evidence that gains in access to care
are translating into better health. Sommers et al. (2015), for example, find
reductions in the share of non-elderly adults reporting that they are in fair or
poor health, as well as reductions in the percentage of days that respondents
report having their activities limited by health problems. There is also evidence that these gains are larger in states that have expanded their Medicaid
programs (Sommers et al. 2016). Further research will be required to examine the effects of the law on a broader array of health outcomes, though it is
notable that studies of prior coverage expansions targeting populations similar to those targeted by the ACA’s coverage provisions concluded that those
expansions reduced mortality among those gaining coverage (Sommers,
Baicker, and Epstein 2012; Sommers, Long, and Baicker 2014).
The coverage expansions resulting from the ACA also appear to be
achieving one of the other key goals of health insurance coverage: protecting
the sick from financial hardship. Survey data show substantial reductions
in the share of families reporting problems paying medical bills, with particularly large reductions for low- and moderate-income adults as the law’s
coverage provisions have taken effect (Shartzer, Long, and Anderson 2015).
Studies using data from consumer credit reports to compare states that have
Progress Reducing Inequality  |  169

and have not expanded Medicaid found similar improvements in financial
security, with one study estimating that Medicaid expansion reduced the
amount of debt sent to collection by $600 to $1,000 per person gaining coverage (Dussault, Pinkovskiy, and Zafar 2016; Hu et al. 2016).

Reducing Poverty and Income Inequality
To facilitate this dramatic expansion in health insurance coverage,
the ACA combined Federal support for states that expand their Medicaid
programs with financial assistance for people purchasing coverage in the
individual market so as to make health insurance more affordable for
all Americans. These policies have directly reduced poverty and income
inequality.
The value of the Medicaid benefits and Marketplace financial assistance made available by the ACA is substantial. Average medical expenses
covered by Medicaid for adults newly eligible in 2017 as a result of the ACA
will be an estimated $5,400 (CMS 2015).6 CBO has estimated that individuals
receiving subsidized coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplaces
in 2017 will receive benefits of around $4,500 (CBO 2016a). For working
families struggling to make ends meet, these forms of assistance can be the
difference between health insurance coverage and medical bankruptcy or
going without necessary care.
Analysis from the Treasury Department highlights the powerful
inequality-reducing effects of the ACA coverage provisions. Treasury estimates that the ACA coverage provisions will boost incomes in the lowest
decile by 25 percent and for the bottom quintile as a whole by 16 percent
in 2017. They will also boost incomes for families in the second quintile
by 5 percent. The average benefit for families in the first quintile from the
ACA coverage provisions will be about $1,900 and for families in the second
quintile about $1,400.7

6 Different analysts compute the value of health insurance to households in different ways when
measuring the income distribution. CBO (2016a) values Medicare and Medicaid at the average
cost to the government of providing those benefits and the analysis here follows the same
approach in valuing expanded Medicaid programs in the ACA at the cost to the government.
Other approaches are also possible. For example, one recent study has argued for valuing
Medicaid at less than cost because some of the care provided by Medicaid was previously being
received from other sources for free (Finkelstein, Hendren, and Luttmer 2015). In this case, some
of the value of the coverage expansions will accrue to whatever entities bear the cost of providing
the care that goes uncompensated, a combination of medical providers themselves; privately
insured individuals; and local, State, and Federal governments.
7 After-tax incomes include the value of the Premium Tax Credit and cost-sharing reductions
even if the assistance is realized as a reduction in premiums or out-of-pocket expenses rather
than a direct payment.

Enacting a Fairer Tax Code
In 2008, average tax rates on high-income families had fallen to their
lowest levels in many years. Since then, President Obama has signed into
law new tax cuts for working and middle-class families, restored Clintonera tax rates for high-income Americans, created new tax credits to make
health insurance affordable for all Americans, and fully paid for the coverage expansions of the ACA with responsible tax increases for high-income
families.
These tax policies have served many purposes: restoring growth and
boosting employment, expanding access to health care, helping working
families get ahead, and reducing the deficit. In addition to their other purposes, the combined effect of these policies has been to reduce inequality
substantially. Changes in tax policy, other than the ACA coverage provisions, will boost after-tax incomes in the bottom quintile by 2 percent in
2017 and reduce after-tax incomes for the top 0.1 percent by 9 percent relative to what incomes would have been under 2008 policies.

Cutting Taxes to Support Work, Reduce Poverty, and Strengthen
Opportunity
During his first term in office, the President signed into law legislation
that cut taxes for a family of four making $50,000 a year by a cumulative total
of $3,600 between 2009 and 2012. As part of the Recovery Act, the President
and Congress enacted the Making Work Pay credit, which provided 95 percent of workers with a tax cut of up to $400 ($800 for couples) in 2009 and
2010. In 2011 and 2012, the Making Work Pay credit was replaced with a 2
percentage-point reduction in the payroll tax rate. These policies were progressive in their own right, and also reduced inequality through their contribution to the economic recovery, as discussed earlier in this chapter. In
addition, the Recovery Act expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)
and Child Tax Credit (CTC), helping 16 million working families make ends
meet each year. These expansions now directly lift 1.8 million Americans out
of poverty as measured by the Supplemental Poverty Measure, and reduce
the severity of poverty for an additional 15 million Americans (Figure 3-8).
Research finds that refundable tax credits for working families lead to
better short- and long-run outcomes for children. For example, one study
finds each additional $1,000 increase in the EITC reduces the incidence of
low birth weight by 2 to 3 percent, in part due to increased pre-natal care
(Hoynes, Miller, and Simon 2015). Other research suggests that the EITC
and refundable CTC increase test scores and college enrollment (Chetty,

Progress Reducing Inequality  |  171

Box 3-3: Safety Net Policies as Insurance
Distributional analysis can be conducted on either an annual or a
lifetime basis. Annual estimates, like those presented in this chapter, provide a snapshot of the impact of policies in a particular year. Although
they generally require richer data and stronger assumptions, lifetime
estimates quantify the impact of policies over an entire lifecycle. This
lifecycle perspective captures an important additional aspect of safetynet and anti-inequality policies that can be lost in annual analysis: their
role as periodic supports in times of economic distress. For example, a
two-earner family that is not eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit
(EITC) in most years may become eligible when one earner experiences
an extended period of unemployment that depresses the family’s annual
income. Most individuals, in fact, experience such temporary shocks
over a lifetime: a recent study indicated that more than 60 percent of
Americans fall into the bottom 20 percent of incomes for at least one year
between ages 25 and 60 (Rank and Hirschl 2015).
For this reason, the share of Americans that benefit from safety-net
and anti-inequality policies over a longer horizon substantially exceeds
the share that benefit in a single year. The ACA, for example, provides
financial support to states that expand their Medicaid programs and to
individuals for purchasing health insurance through the Marketplaces—

provisions that provide greatest value to those who would otherwise be
uninsured. In the decade prior to the enactment of the ACA, roughly
20 percent of the population was uninsured for at least one month in
any particular year and thus stood to benefit from the law’s coverage
provisions during that year (see Figure 3-iii). However, over the course
of the decade as a whole, more than twice as many people—roughly half
the population—were uninsured for at least one month and thus would
have had the opportunity to benefit from the law’s coverage expansion.
Similarly, about 25 percent of families with children claim the EITC in
any given year, but 50 percent claim the EITC at some point during a
20-year period (Figure 3-iv).
In this way, the inequality-reducing tax and health care policies
that the President has signed into law will ultimately benefit a much
larger fraction of working and middle-class Americans than they do in a
single year, as do existing policies like unemployment insurance and the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

The Recovery Act also created the American Opportunity Tax Credit
(AOTC), which provides up to $10,000 over four years to help pay for
college. The AOTC is the first education tax credit to be at least partially
refundable. The partial refundability of the AOTC is critical because it
allows low-income families with no income tax liability to claim the credit,
and students who do not attend college come disproportionately from
families with lower incomes. In addition, the Administration has expanded
the maximum Pell Grant for low- and moderate-income college students
by more than $1,000 and, for the first time, tied aid to inflation to maintain
its value—an important policy that is not included in the estimates in this
section, which focus solely on the tax system. (See Chapter 5 for additional
discussion of changes in education policy during this Administration.)

Restoring Tax Rates to Their Level in the 1990s and Increasing
Progressivity
Additional tax reforms enacted since 2009 have increased the progressivity of the tax code, helped pay for the ACA, and contributed to responsible

deficit reduction. At the beginning of 2013, the President signed into law a
permanent extension of expiring tax cuts for middle-class families while also
restoring Clinton-era tax rates for the highest-income families. Restoring
Clinton-era tax rates for these families, along with other components of this
legislation, will reduce the deficit by more than $800 billion over the next 10
years. In addition, the ACA extended Medicare taxes to cover the investment
income of high-income families and modestly increased the Medicare tax
rate for these same families. In combination, these reforms have restored
effective tax rates on high-income Americans to the level that prevailed in
the mid-1990s (Figure 3-9).

Reducing Poverty and Income Inequality
The tax policies the President has signed into law since 2009 have
boosted incomes for working families, increased taxes on the highestincome families, and reduced income inequality (Figure 3-10). These policies, primarily the expansion of the CTC for low-income working families
and expansion of the EITC for families with three or more children, will
boost incomes in the first quintile by 2 percent in 2017 compared with
what they would have been under the continuation of 2008 policies. These
estimates do not take into account the additional, temporary income
boosts these families saw from the temporary tax cuts enacted earlier in the
Administration, including the Making Work Pay credit and the payroll tax
holiday that have now expired.
The tax increases enacted by the Administration have been concentrated among the highest-income families. Families in the top 0.1 percent of
the distribution, who are projected to have average pre-tax incomes of more
than $8 million in 2017, will experience a tax increase of more than $500,000
on average and a reduction in after-tax incomes of 9 percent in that year.
Families in the top 1 percent, but not the top 0.1 percent, will experience a
tax increase of $30,000 on average and a reduction in after-tax incomes of
5 percent. In addition to their contribution to deficit reduction and to help
finance the expansion of health insurance coverage made possible by the
ACA, these high-income tax increases have directly reduced inequality in
after-tax incomes.
The impact of these changes in tax policy are measured relative to a
policy counterfactual in which 2008 tax policy remains in place. This policy
counterfactual assumes the extension of the major individual and estate tax
cuts scheduled to expire at the end of 2010; a set of individual, business, and
energy tax provisions that have been regularly extended by Congress in the
past (referred to as “extenders”); a set of provisions limiting the scope of the

The Obama Administration’s Record
in Historical Context
President Obama has overseen the largest increase in Federal investment to reduce inequality since the Great Society programs of the Johnson
Administration, largely reflecting the coverage provisions of the ACA and
expansions of tax credits for working families. However, despite the historic
nature of the Obama Administration’s accomplishments, inequality remains
much higher today than it was a few decades ago, and substantial work
remains to continue reducing inequality and expanding economic opportunities for all Americans (Figure 3-11).

Box 3-4: Additional Actions to Make the
Economy Work for All American
This chapter focuses on the Administration’s accomplishments in
restoring growth, guaranteeing access to health insurance, and enacting
a fairer tax code. However, the Administration has taken many other
critical steps to reduce inequality, including both actions with more
immediate effects, such as spurring State action to raise minimum wages,
and actions with primarily longer-term effects, such as improving our
educational system. This box describes the Administration’s actions on
wages and education.
Raising Wages: In his 2013 State of the Union address, the
President called for an increase in the Federal minimum wage. While
Congress has not acted, 18 states and the District of Columbia have
enacted legislation raising their minimum wages since that time. In part
due to these increases, the decline in the value of the effective minimum
wage (the higher of the Federal and State minimum wage in each state
weighted by worker hours) has been reversed, and the effective minimum wage has now reached roughly the same inflation-adjusted value
it had in 2009 when the Federal minimum last increased (Figure 3-v).
However, despite this progress, too many Americans continue to work

for a minimum wage that is too low, and the President continues to call
for a higher minimum wage.
The President has also worked to improve working conditions
and wages by strengthening worker protections. As part of this effort,
the Department of Labor completed an update to Federal overtime
regulations in early 2016, extending overtime protections to more than
4 million additional workers. Unions also play an important role in supporting working conditions and wages, and the President has worked to
ensure that the National Labor Relations Board is able to fulfill its role in
enforcing workplace protections and upholding the rights of workers. In
addition, the Administration has sought to support new approaches to
enabling worker voice.
Promoting Educational Opportunity: In contrast to higher minimum wages and changes in tax and transfer policy, which generate
immediate reductions in inequality, educational investments pay off
over a longer time horizon. Educational investments are critical to
ensure equal opportunity for children today and to reduce inequality
over the long term. During the recession, the Department of Education
provided over $60 billion in funding to states to support education
budgets, and these resources helped prevent layoffs of education workers
at a time when State and local spending was being cut. As part of the
Recovery Act, the Administration encouraged states to raise educational
standards, turn around the lowest-performing schools, develop effective
support for teachers and leaders, and create uniform data systems to
enhance instruction through the Administration’s Race-to-the-Top initiative. Today, as a result of this initiative, nearly every state has adopted
college and career-ready standards.
The bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act, which the President
signed into law in December 2015, codifies the requirement that every
state set academic standards that prepare students for college and careers,
and that the state intervene to improve both their lowest-performing 5
percent of schools as well as schools where too many students do not
graduate on time—principles that were central to the funding provided
under the Recovery Act. In 2014, the Administration invested $750 million in new resources to expand access to high quality early education
programs, through Early Head Start-Child Care Partnership grants for
infants and toddlers and Preschool Development Grants to states. Today,
all but 4 States are investing in preschool, with more than 40 percent of
four-year olds in the United States enrolled in publicly funded preschool.
In addition, the Administration announced the availability of $135 million in competitively awarded grants to expand Early Head Start and create new Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships in 2016, building on

Progress Reducing Inequality  |  179

$294 million in newly appropriated funds for fiscal year 2016 to ensure
that more Head Start children will receive services for a full school day
and full school year. The Administration has also provided new funds
to support the implementation of new requirements in the reauthorized
Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014.
The Administration has also made progress in promoting college
opportunity, affordability, and completion by expanding Pell Grants
and tax credits; making student loans more affordable by cutting interest rates and allowing borrowers to cap student loan payments at 10
percent of income; making access to financial aid and college information simpler and faster; and promoting innovation and competition to
bring down costs and improve college quality. Today, more students are
graduating college than ever, and student loan defaults and delinquencies are trending downward.
Lastly, the Administration has worked to increase training and
skills for workers during their careers. In 2015, the President signed
into law the first-ever annual funding for apprenticeship grants, totaling $90 million. These investments follow earlier investments through
the American Apprenticeship Grants to promote and expand jobdriven apprenticeship programs in the United States. In addition, the
Administration has launched a series of initiatives, partnerships, and
grants to facilitate training for the American workforce. In April 2015,
the White House hosted an Upskill Summit at which the President called
on companies to expand education benefits and training opportunities,
and employers have responded to this call—the Aspen Institute’s Upskill
America Initiative reports that participating companies have enhanced
the skills of tens of thousands of frontline workers. The Department of
Labor has also awarded a wide variety of competitive training grants.
These grants have ranged from TechHire grants, which are supporting
public-private partnerships to help train tomorrow’s workforce in rapidgrowth sectors, to America’s Promise Job-Driven Training grants, which
are creating and expanding innovative regional and sector partnerships
between community colleges and the workforce system to create more
tuition-free education and training programs for in-demand middle and
high-skilled jobs across the country.

incomes in the bottom quintile by 18 percent, or $2,200, and in the second
quintile by about 6 percent, or $1,500, relative to what they would have
been under the continuation of 2008 policies (Figure 3-12).9 These policies
will also boost incomes in the middle quintile by 0.7 percent, or $300. In
contrast, these policies will reduce the after-tax incomes of very high-income
families, particularly those in the top 1 percent. Targeted tax increases will
reduce after-tax incomes by 5 percent for the 99th through 99.9th percentiles
and reduce after-tax incomes by 10 percent for the families in the top 0.1
percent, a group projected to have average incomes over $8 million in 2017.
Average tax rates provide an alternative perspective on the impact of
these polices. Changes in tax policy since 2009 and tax-related coverage provisions of the ACA will increase the average tax rate for the top 0.1 percent
by 7 percentage points in 2017, from 31 percent to 38 percent. For families
in the top 1 percent but not the top 0.1 percent, these changes will increase
average tax rates by 4 percentage points.
These changes in tax policy and the coverage provisions of the ACA
have led to commensurate changes in the distribution of income. As a result
of these policies, the share of income received by the top 1 percent will
decrease by 1.2 percentage points in 2017, or 7 percent, from 16.6 percent to
15.4 percent (Figure 3-13). The share of income accruing to the bottom 99
percent of Americans will increase by a corresponding 1.2 percentage points.
Income shares in the first quintile will rise by 0.6 percentage point, or 18
percent; in the second quintile by 0.5 percentage point, or 6 percent; and in
the third quintile by 0.1 percentage point, or 1 percent.
The robust reduction in inequality resulting from these policies is
apparent across a wide range of inequality measures (Figure 3-14). The
impact of fiscal policies enacted during the Obama Administration on
inequality varies by measure, ranging from a 3-percent reduction in the Gini
index to a more than 20-percent reduction in the ratio of average incomes in
the top 1 percent to the bottom 20 percent, but all measures show a meaningful reduction in inequality. Changes in tax policy and the coverage provisions of the ACA have had their largest effects on very high-income families,
where the restoration of Clinton-era tax rates and responsible tax increases
to finance the ACA are most important, and in the bottom third of the
distribution, where the ACA’s expansion of health insurance coverage to 20
million more Americans has had its largest impact. Thus, not surprisingly,
9 The ACA coverage provisions and tax changes enacted since 2009 have offsetting effects on
the 2017 deficit judged relative to a 2008 current-policy baseline, with the coverage provisions
increasing the deficit and the tax changes decreasing it. Allocating an additional fiscal adjustment
proportional to income to achieve zero net effect on the deficit would not substantially affect
the results. Such an adjustment can be critical in assessing the ultimate distributional impact of
deficit-financed policy changes.

Obama Administration Achievements Relative to Other Federal
Action in Recent Decades
The decrease in income inequality resulting from changes in tax policy
since 2009 and the coverage provisions of the ACA is large not only in absolute terms but also relative to previous Federal action to reduce inequality.
There are important limitations and uncertainties in any effort to
assign policy changes to particular Presidential administrations. Policies
enacted in one administration may phase in through the next administration. Broader economic and demographic changes in one administration will interact with the entire history of policy changes leading up to
that point. Polices may be repeatedly extended on a temporary basis and
automatic adjustments may be introduced in ways that make it difficult
to consistently interpret action and inaction (for instance, the introduction of automatic inflation adjustments for income tax brackets and other
parameters of the tax code in the 1980s). Notwithstanding these difficulties,
this section compares the anti-inequality accomplishments of the Obama

Progress Reducing Inequality  |  183

Administration with those of previous administrations, first with respect to
tax policy and then with respect to spending.
Figure 3-15 shows the change in the share of after-tax income accruing
to the bottom 99 percent of families attributable to changes in tax policy for
Presidential administrations since 1960. The analysis holds the income distribution constant as it existed in 2006 and adjusts income levels for growth
in the National Average Wage Index, thus isolating the impact of changes in
policy from other sources of variation in tax rates. It focuses on individual
income and payroll tax liabilities. The change for each administration is
defined as the difference between the share of income received by the bottom 99 percent in the last complete calendar year of that administration and
the share in the last complete calendar year of the prior administration.10
Implicitly, tax liabilities in the final year of the previous administration provide the baseline used to assess changes in tax policy across administrations.
The tax changes enacted during the Obama Administration have
had historically large effects on the distribution of income, increasing the
share of income accruing to the bottom 99 percent of Americans by about 1
percentage point, an inequality-reducing shift in the tax burden more than
twice as large as that achieved during the Clinton Administration, which
ranks second by this measure.11
While the Administration’s accomplishments are large by almost any
measure, different measures of inequality focus on different points in the
income distribution and thus can rank administrations in different ways.
Under some measures, the Ford Administration, during which the Earned
Income Tax Credit was created, ranks first; under others, the Clinton
Administration, which substantially expanded the Earned Income Tax
Credit and increased top income tax rates, ranks first.
In addition to inequality-reducing changes in tax policy, the President
has also signed into law a historic investment in Federal anti-inequality programs. Figure 3-16 shows the change in Federal spending on these programs
10 For purposes of these comparisons, 1963 is treated as the last complete year of the Kennedy
Administration. The change for the Kennedy Administration is measured relative to 1960
because the NBER TAXSIM model (on which this analysis relies heavily) can only generate tax
liabilities back to 1960.
11 This estimate differs from other estimates presented in this chapter for four reasons. First,
this estimate excludes the Medicaid expansion but includes all other ACA coverage and tax
provisions, a combination of policies not reflected in other estimates. Second, Treasury estimates
incorporate a more complete set of taxes, including corporate, excise, and estate taxes, which
is not possible with the NBER Internet TAXSIM model. Third, the Treasury estimates apply
to calendar year 2017, while these estimates are based on the distribution of income in 2006
held constant over time. And fourth, the NBER Internet TAXSIM model and CEA imputations
underlying Figure 3-15 necessarily differ from Treasury’s tax models on a variety of technical
dimensions.

as a share of potential GDP by Presidential administrations since 1968.
For purposes of these comparisons, the major anti-inequality programs
are defined as Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the refundable portion of the
Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, Supplemental Security
Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and other family support, educational assistance, Pell grants, housing assistance, and the ACA’s
Marketplace financial assistance. Social Security and Medicare are excluded
due to their universal nature and because, in the case of Social Security,
benefit increases in the last 50 years have often been accompanied by payroll
tax increases. In addition, most of the change in Medicare spending over this
period reflects changes in demographics, health care costs, and other factors,
not changes in policy. Unemployment insurance is also excluded as most
variation reflects cyclical factors, not changes in underlying policy.
Under President Obama, the Federal investment in reducing inequality has increased by about 0.8 percent of potential GDP, more than any
previous President since the Great Society. Much of this increase reflects
the coverage provisions of the ACA and expanded tax credits for working families first enacted as part of the Recovery Act. Federal support for
states expanding their Medicaid programs, financial assistance for families
purchasing health insurance through the Marketplace, and the Recovery
Act’s EITC and CTC expansions comprise a more than $100 billion annual
investment in reducing health and income inequality in 2016, amounting to
roughly 0.5 percent of potential GDP.
Earlier expansions of the safety net are also apparent in Figure 3-16,
including the expansion of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(then the Food Stamp Program) during the Nixon Administration, the phase
in of Supplemental Security Income through the Ford Administration, and
the creation of the Children’s Health Insurance Program in the Clinton
Administration.
A simple comparison of spending over time combines changes in policy with broader economic and demographic changes that affect spending
for existing programs. Thus, an increase in Medicaid spending may reflect
the introduction of a new and expensive treatment, an eligibility expansion,
or other economic changes. For example, spending on inequality-reducing
policies, largely Medicaid, rose sharply during the first Bush Administration.
However, research finds that most of the increase in Medicaid spending over
this period reflects changes in health care prices, the early 90s recession, and
other factors, not contemporaneous policy changes (Holahan et al. 1993).
An alternative comparison of each administration’s policy accomplishments would focus only on those increases or decreases attributable
186  |  Chapter 3

to policy changes enacted during each administration, but the length of the
historical period, the substantial changes in demographics and the economy,
and the number and complexity of policy changes involved make such a
comparison infeasible.
A comparison along these lines, however, would not change the conclusion that the Obama Administration’s investments in reducing inequality
have been historic, and it would be unlikely to change the relative ranking
of the Obama Administration and previous administrations in an important
way. As noted above, the increase during the Obama Administration largely
reflects new programmatic investments in the form of the coverage provisions of the ACA and expanded tax credits for working families. Much of
the increase in the investment in anti-inequality programs during the first
Bush Administration, which ranks second by the simple change in spending
over time, is attributable to factors other than changes in policy, as discussed
above. And the increase in the investment in anti-inequality programs
occurring during all other administrations since the Great Society is much
more modest than the increase during the Obama Administration.

A Partial Reversal of Increasing Inequality
The historic investments in reducing inequality made during the
Obama Administration have achieved a partial reversal of the increase in
income inequality in recent decades. However much more work remains
due to the sheer size of the increase in inequality between 1979 and 2007.
According to CBO, the share of after-tax income received by the bottom
quintile of households fell from 7.4 percent at the business cycle peak in 1979
to 5.6 percent at the business cycle peak in 2007, and the share accruing to
the top 1 percent increased from 7.4 percent in 1979 to 16.7 percent in 2007
(CBO 2016b). While CBO’s estimates of the income distribution and the
Treasury estimates of the distribution of changes in tax policy and the ACA
coverage provisions are not precisely comparable due to different methodological choices, they are sufficiently similar to make broad comparisons
informative.12
12 The comparisons presented in this chapter implement one adjustment to the Treasury analysis
before comparing to CBO. Treasury percentiles are defined to contain an equal number of tax
families while CBO defines percentiles to contain an equal number of people. An approximate
adjustment is applied to the Treasury figures to put them on a similar equal-people basis that
assumes families shifted between percentiles have the average family size of the percentile range
into which they are shifted, incomes equal to the boundary between the income classes, and a
tax rate equal to the simple average of the tax rate in the classes on either side of the boundary.
This adjustment is applied only in determining the fraction of the increase in inequality reversed
and the equivalent growth rate; the changes in shares and changes in after-tax income reported
in this section are unchanged from the prior section for consistency.

The share of after-tax income received by the bottom quintile
increased by roughly 0.6 percentage point as a result of laws enacted during this Administration, equivalent to a roll back of roughly a third of the
deterioration in the income share for this population between 1979 and 2007
(Figure 3-17). At the top, the policy changes signed into law have reversed
roughly a 10th of the increase in the share of after-tax income accruing to
the top 1 percent over the last three decades.
Another way of contextualizing the impact of the policies enacted by
this Administration is to compare them with the growth rate in incomes.
As noted above, the laws enacted during the Obama Administration have
boosted incomes in the bottom quintile by about 18 percent. Between 1979
and 2007, immediately prior to the onset of the Great Recession, cumulative
growth in after-tax incomes for the bottom quintile amounted to about 45
percent. Thus, these policies provided the equivalent of more than a decade
of average income growth for these families.

Next Steps to Further Boost Incomes, Expand
Opportunity, and Reduce Inequality
During his eight years in office, President Obama signed into law
legislation achieving a historic reduction in inequality through changes in

188  |  Chapter 3

tax policy and the coverage provisions of the ACA. However, as the preceding section makes clear, even with these accomplishments, much more
work remains to be done. In the FY 2017 Federal Budget and elsewhere,
the President has proposed an array of policies that would further boost
incomes, expand opportunity, and reduce inequality.

Making Work Pay
Well-paying jobs are essential to reducing poverty and inequality, but
too many Americans continue to work for a wage that is too low. Increasing
the Federal minimum wage would be an important step in addressing the
insufficient rate of wage growth in recent decades. For this reason, the
President called for a minimum wage increase in his State of the Union
address in February 2013. Since then, 18 states and the District of Columbia
have passed increases in their minimum wages, but much more progress
needs to be made.
Expanding the EITC—one of the largest and most effective antipoverty programs—also helps make work pay. The FY 2017 budget proposes
an expansion of the EITC for workers without dependent children, whose
eligibility for only a very small tax credit limits the power of the EITC to
reduce poverty for this population (Figure 3-18). Currently, workers without
dependent children are the only group of workers taxed into poverty by the
current tax code (Marr and Dasilva 2016). Expanding the EITC for workers
without dependent children would provide 13 million low-income workers
with a tax cut averaging nearly $500 for each worker, while also providing an
additional incentive to work. This expansion would build on the success of
the EITC expansions for families with three or more children and for married couples enacted as part of the Recovery Act.

Investing in Children and Families
Not only is inequality in living standards for children an immediate
concern, but recent research highlights the importance of investments in
children and families for future outcomes as well (CEA 2014b; CEA 2014c;
Furman and Ruffini 2015). The FY 2017 budget proposes a number of
inequality-reducing investments in children and families, including in child
care, early education, and ending family homelessness.
First, the President has proposed a historic investment in child care
to ensure that all working families from low- and moderate-income backgrounds can access safe, affordable, and high-quality care for infants and
toddlers. Research finds that quality, affordable child care can promote
parental employment and earnings as well as healthy child development, in
addition to helping families make ends meet (CEA 2014b).

Second, the budget proposes to further expand high-quality early
education through the President’s Preschool for All Initiative. This initiative
would provide all four-year-old children from low- and moderate-income
families with access to high-quality preschool through a new Federal-State
partnership, while encouraging states to expand those programs to reach
additional children from middle-class families. The President would also
continue investments in high-quality learning before preschool through
expansions of the Early Head Start-Child Care partnership, as well as expansions of home visitation programs for new and expecting parents. A large
body of research has found that quality early education programs have high
returns for both the participants and for society as a whole (CEA 2016a; CEA
2014b).
Third, the budget puts forward a package of proposals that would
strengthen the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program so it
does more to help poor families get back on their feet and work toward selfsufficiency. For example, recognizing that 20 years of frozen funding has
eroded the inflation-adjusted value of the block grant, the budget proposes
to increase funding for TANF; the additional funds would be coupled with
an increased focus on helping families prepare for and find jobs, along with
new financial and programmatic accountability standards for states. The
budget also includes a TANF Economic Response Fund that would provide
190  |  Chapter 3

budgetary flexibility for additional assistance when economic conditions
deteriorate, so as to increase the efficacy of TANF during downturns.
Outside of TANF, the budget proposes to invest $12 billion to ensure
adequate food for low-income children during the summer months, as many
low-income children receive food at little or no cost during the school year
but lose this support when school is not in session.
Finally, the budget proposes an $11 billion investment to prevent and
end family homelessness by 2020. Reducing homelessness directly improves
inequality today, and recent research suggests that moving children and
their families to better neighborhoods can generate substantial earnings
gains when those children become adults (Chetty and Hendren 2015;
Chetty, Hendren, and Katz 2016).
In addition, an expansion of paid leave would also help reduce
inequalities in childhood investment, employment, and incomes. While
current law allows many workers to take time off without pay to care for a
new baby or a sick family member, millions of families cannot afford to do
so. Employers are not required to offer paid leave in most states even though
research shows that the availability of paid maternity leave increases the
likelihood that mothers return to their jobs following the birth of a child,
which leads to better outcomes for infants (CEA 2014c).
As documented throughout this report, the ACA has already resulted
in an additional 20 million American adults with health insurance and, in
doing so, has substantially reduced income inequality. Writing in the Journal
of the American Medical Association, the President outlined a number of
suggestions as to how the country can continue making progress in expanding health insurance coverage, improving the quality of care, and reducing
health care costs (Obama 2016). These suggestions include the adoption of a
Medicaid expansion by all 50 states, increasing the financial assistance available to families purchasing Marketplace coverage, and considering a public
option to promote additional competition in the exchanges. In addition,
as the ACA covers the full cost of State Medicaid expansions only through
2016 before gradually reducing the level of Federal support to 90 percent,
the budget proposes to cover the full cost of Medicaid expansion for the first
three years after a state expands, regardless of when this expansion occurs,
to better support states taking action to expand Medicaid.

Reforming the Tax System	
The budget also proposes responsible tax increases on the most fortunate Americans to finance inequality-reducing investments in working
and middle-class families and to drive down future deficits. The budget
proposes to reform the taxation of capital income by increasing the top tax
Progress Reducing Inequality  |  191

rate on capital gains and dividends to 28 percent and by closing a loophole
that allows wealthy families to avoid ever paying tax on their capital gains if
they hold assets until death. The budget would also reform tax expenditures
to limit their value for high-income families and would close loopholes that
allow some wealthy business owners to avoid paying Medicare taxes by
classifying certain income as neither employment nor investment income.
It would also increase the tax paid by the very largest estates. All told, the
tax reforms in the budget would reduce the share of income received by the
top 1 percent of families by 1.3 percentage points, rolling back an additional
13 percent of the increase in the after-tax income share of the top 1 percent
between 1979 and 2007.

Conclusion
During his eight years in office, President Obama has overseen the
largest increase in Federal investment to reduce inequality since the Great
Society. The policy response to the Great Recession reduced the unemployment rate relative to what it otherwise would have been by 6 percentage
points on average each year between 2010 and 2012 and offset roughly half
of the increase in earnings inequality that would otherwise have occurred.
The Affordable Care Act and changes in tax policy will boost incomes in the
bottom quintile of families by 18 percent in 2017 and increase average tax
rates for the highest-income 0.1 percent of families by nearly 7 percentage
points. Together, these policies will increase the share of after-tax income
received by the bottom 99 percent by 1.2 percentage points in 2017 with a
corresponding reduction in the income share of the top 1 percent.
Despite this progress, income inequality remains much higher today
than it was a few decades ago, and the President’s Fiscal Year 2017 Budget
proposes spending and tax reforms that would further reduce inequality.
These steps include, among others, reforms to tax benefits for high-income
Americans; an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers
without dependent children; and a landmark commitment to ensuring all
low- and moderate-income families have access to quality, affordable child
care that allows parents to work or pursue education and training. Taken
together, the policies proposed in the budget would build on the progress
made in reducing income inequality since 2009, helping to ensure that all
Americans have the opportunity to succeed.

Notes:

Both current policy and 2008 policy include a list of individual, business and energy tax provisions that are
scheduled to expire at the end of 2016 but have been regularly extended by Congress (provisions referred to
as “extenders”). Current policy is current law with the extenders. 2008 policy eliminates from current law a
number of key provisions enacted during the Obama administration, including: the higher tax rate on
tobacco enacted in CHIPRA; the AOTC and the expansions of the child tax credit and EITC enacted in
ARRA; provisions in the Affordable Care Act, including expanded Medicaid eligibility, the premium tax
credit, cost-sharing reductions, the additional Medicare tax, the net investment income tax, the individual
shared responsibility payment, the employer shared responsibility payment, the small business tax credit, the
higher floor for itemized deductions for medical expenses, the excise tax on indoor tanning services, fees on
branded prescription drug manufacturers and importers, and fees on insured and self-insured plans; and the
higher top ordinary and capital gains and dividend tax rates, and the reinstatement of the personal exemption
phaseout (PEP) and phaseout of itemized deductions (Pease) enacted in ATRA. 2008 policy also replaces
the AMT parameters enacted in ATRA with a more generous AMT “patch.” In addition, 2008 policy
replaces the estate tax adopted in ATRA with the carryover basis provisions provided for under EGTRRA.
Finally, 2008 policy restores the 0.2% FUTA surtax that expired in 2011.
2
Cash Income consists of wages and salaries, net income from a business or farm, taxable and tax-exempt
interest, dividends, rental income, realized capital gains, cash and near-cash transfers from the government,
retirement benefits, and employer-provided health insurance (and other employer benefits). Employer
contributions for payroll taxes and the federal corporate income tax are added to place cash on a pre-tax
basis. Families are placed into deciles based on cash income adjusted for family size, by dividing income by
the square root of family size. Percentiles begin at family size-adjusted cash income of: $10,902 for 10 to
20; $16,165 for 20 to 30; $21,713 for 30 to 40; $28,753 for 40 to 50; $37,516 for 50 to 60; $48,381 for 60
to 70; $61,100 for 70 to 80; $80,449 for 80 to 90; $117,224 for 90 to 95; $165,373 for 95 to 99; $379,371
for 99 to 99.9 and $1,734,164 for Top .1.
3
The taxes included are individual and corporate income, payroll (Social Security, Medicare and
unemployment), excises, customs duties, and estate and gift taxes. Individual income taxes are assumed to
be borne by payers, payroll taxes (employer and employee shares) by labor (wages and self-employment
income), excises on purchases by individuals in proportion to relative consumption of the taxed good and
proportionately by labor and capital income, excises on purchases by businesses and customs duties
proportionately by labor and capital income, and estate and gift taxes by decedents. The share of the
corporate income tax that represents cash flow is assumed to have no burden in the long run; the share of the
corporate income tax that represents a tax on supernormal returns is assumed to be borne by supernormal
corporate capital income as held by shareholders; and the remainder of the corporate income tax, the normal
return, is assumed to be borne equally by labor and positive normal capital income. The denominator for the
tax rates is cash income under 2017 current law, including ACA Medicaid expansion.
4
Transfers (e.g. Medicaid) are treated as negative taxes for calculating total changes. The ACA coverage
provisions are expanded Medicaid eligibility, the premium tax credit, cost-sharing reductions, the individual
shared responsibility payment, the employer shared responsibility payment, and the small business tax
credit. Pre-ACA, after-tax income under 2008 policy is the denominator used for calculating the percentage
changes in after-tax income due to the transfer and tax changes.
5
Families with negative incomes are excluded from the lowest income decile but included in the total line.

REFORMING THE HEALTH
CARE SYSTEM
Introduction

T

he health care system has profound effects on Americans’ lives. Access
to high-quality health care contributes to good health, which helps
Americans meet obligations to their families, succeed in the workplace and
the classroom, and enjoy an overall high quality of life. At the same time,
health care is a major expense for families and governments alike, so the
health care system’s ability to deliver needed care at a reasonable cost is an
important determinant of Americans’ overall standard of living.
When President Obama took office, he confronted a health care system
that was falling short both in ensuring broad access to high-quality care and
in providing care at a reasonable cost. These shortcomings were the result of
large gaps in our health insurance system and a health care delivery system
that too often provided inefficient, low-quality care. Through the Affordable
Care Act (ACA) and other legislation enacted under this Administration, as
well as accompanying administrative actions, the United States has made
considerable progress in addressing these two major problems.
Turning first to the health insurance system, more than one-in-seven
Americans—44 million people—lacked health insurance coverage in 2008,
the year before the Obama Administration began. Many uninsured individuals were simply unable to afford coverage, while many others were locked
out or priced out of the individual health insurance market because they had
pre-existing health conditions. Their lack of insurance coverage kept them
from being able to obtain the care they needed, and left them vulnerable to
financial catastrophe if they became seriously ill. Meanwhile, even many
Americans with health insurance faced similar risks due to significant gaps
in their coverage.
In his first month in office, President Obama took an initial step
toward ensuring that all Americans had access to affordable, high-quality

195

health insurance coverage by signing legislation improving the Children’s
Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Slightly more than a year later, the
President signed the ACA, which reformed the individual health insurance
market to ensure that all Americans could find affordable, high-quality coverage, provided generous financial support to states that wished to expand
their Medicaid programs to cover more of their low-income residents, and
allowed young adults to remain on a parent’s plan until age 26. Together,
these actions led to a historic expansion in the number of people with health
insurance. Because of the coverage provisions of the ACA, an estimated 20
million additional adults now have health insurance. In addition, thanks in
large part to the ACA and the improvements to CHIP that the President
signed into law, the uninsured rate among children has fallen by almost half
since the President took office, providing health insurance to more than 3
million additional children. Following these gains, the uninsured rate stands
below 9 percent for the first time ever.
A growing body of evidence demonstrates that broader insurance
coverage is generating major benefits for the newly insured and the health
care system as a whole. Access to medical care has improved substantially;
the share of people reporting that they have recently forgone medical care
because they could not afford it has fallen by more than a third since the
ACA became law. Expanded coverage has also reduced the burden of
medical debt and generated corresponding reductions in the amount of
uncompensated care. Nationwide, uncompensated care has fallen by more
than a quarter as a share of hospital operating costs from 2013 to 2015, corresponding to a reduction of $10.4 billion. Early evidence also suggests that
expanded coverage is driving improvements in health that are consistent
with those observed in prior research; if experience under the ACA matches
what was observed under Massachusetts health reform, an estimated 24,000
deaths are already being avoided annually. Looking beyond the health care
sector, the ACA has also sharply reduced income inequality, and it has
achieved this broad range of benefits without the adverse near-term effects
on the labor market that the ACA’s critics predicted, while also helping to lay
the foundation for a stronger labor market over the long term.
The ACA also introduced reforms to improve financial security and
access to care for those who were already insured. These reforms are generating important benefits. Because of the law, private insurance plans are
generally required to limit enrollees’ annual out-of-pocket spending. Due to
the spread of out-of-pocket limits since 2010, an estimated 22 million additional people enrolled in employer-sponsored plans are protected against
catastrophic costs in 2016. Similarly, because of the ACA’s provision phasing out the Medicare Part D coverage gap, more than 11 million Medicare
196  |  Chapter 4

beneficiaries have received cumulative savings on prescription drugs averaging more than $2,100 a person as of the middle of 2016.
Turning next to the health care delivery system, the United States
devoted roughly a sixth of its gross domestic product (GDP) to health care
when President Obama took office, a far larger share than peer nations. Yet
health outcomes in the United States were, at best, no better. At the same
time, health care spending and health outcomes varied widely across regions
of the United States, with no evidence that higher-spending areas achieved
better outcomes. This and other evidence showed that there were major
opportunities to reform the health care delivery system in ways that could
reduce the burden that health care spending placed on the U.S. economy,
while improving health outcomes.
The ACA and related legislation have implemented comprehensive
reforms to make the health care delivery system more efficient and improve
the quality of care. The ACA achieved significant near-term savings by better aligning payments to medical providers and private insurers in Medicare
with the costs of providing services. The law also set in motion a long-term
effort to develop and deploy alternative payment models (APMs) that
reward providers who deliver efficient, high-quality care, unlike existing feefor-service payment systems, which base payment chiefly on the quantity of
services delivered. Using the tools provided by the ACA, the Administration
has made considerable progress in deploying APMs, including accountable
care, bundled payment, and medical home models. As of early 2016, more
than 30 percent of traditional Medicare payments were estimated to be
associated with APMs, up from virtually none in 2010. The tools provided by
the ACA, which were enhanced by the bipartisan physician payment reform
legislation enacted in 2015, will drive further progress in the years ahead.
Changes in Medicare’s payment systems appear to be catalyzing
similar changes by private payers. Indeed, at the beginning of 2016, 17
million—or roughly one in ten—private insurance enrollees are estimated
to have been covered under payment arrangements similar to the accountable care contracts being deployed in Medicare, up from virtually none as
recently as 2011. Similarly, one large survey found that around a quarter of
provider payments made by private insurers were associated with APMs in
2015. The Administration has also taken several steps to accelerate the diffusion of APMs in the private sector by directly engaging private payers in
payment reform efforts in Medicare and Medicaid, facilitating information
sharing across payers, and fostering the development of common standards.
The ACA’s excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored coverage, scheduled
to take effect in 2020, will provide an additional impetus for private sector
plans to engage in payment reform efforts over the coming years.
Reforming the Health Care System  |  197

The six years since the ACA became law have seen very encouraging
trends in both health care costs and health care quality. Prices of health care
goods and services have grown at a slower rate under the ACA than during
any period of the same length since these data began in 1959. Recent years
have also seen exceptionally slow growth in per enrollee spending in both
public programs and private insurance. In parallel, there have been promising indications that quality of care is improving. The rate at which patients
are harmed while seeking hospital care has fallen by 21 percent since 2010,
which is estimated to have led to approximately 125,000 avoided deaths
cumulatively through 2015. Medicare beneficiaries’ risk of returning to the
hospital soon after discharge has also declined substantially, corresponding
to an estimated 565,000 avoided readmissions from April 2010 through May
2015.
A considerable body of research has aimed to understand the causes of
these encouraging trends. The Great Recession does not appear to have been
an important driver of the slow growth in health care costs in recent years.
The recession had little effect on Medicare spending, and, while the Great
Recession did dampen private sector spending growth in the years during
and immediately after the downturn, its ability to explain slow growth over
the last few years is limited. Similarly, neither demographic changes nor
changes in cost sharing appear to explain much of the slow growth in health
care costs under the ACA.
It therefore appears that recent years’ favorable trends in health care
costs and quality primarily reflect structural changes in the health care
delivery system. While multiple factors are likely playing a role, payment
reforms introduced in the ACA have made substantial, quantifiable contributions to slowing the growth of health care costs in both Medicare and
private insurance. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates imply that
the ACA has reduced the growth rate of per beneficiary Medicare spending
by 1.3 percentage points a year from 2010 through 2016. “Spillover” effects
of the ACA’s Medicare reforms on the prices that private insurers pay for
care have likely subtracted between 0.6 and 0.9 percentage point a year from
the growth rate of per enrollee private insurance spending over the same
period. Moreover, there is reason to believe that the ACA has had systemic
effects on trends in health care costs and quality that go beyond what can be
directly quantified.
Recent positive developments in the health care delivery system
are generating major benefits to families and the economy. The average
premium for people who hold employer-based family coverage was nearly
$3,600 lower in 2016 than if premium growth since the ACA became law had
matched the preceding decade, savings families will receive directly in the
198  |  Chapter 4

form of lower premium costs and indirectly in the form of higher wages. Far
from offsetting the slowdown in premium growth, growth in out-of-pocket
costs has slowed as well, and accounting for out-of-pocket costs increases
these savings to $4,400 in 2016.
People who get coverage outside the workplace have also realized
important savings on premiums and cost sharing. The typical Medicare
beneficiary enrolled in traditional Medicare will incur around $700 less in
premiums and cost sharing in 2016 than if Medicare spending trends had
matched what was projected in 2009 under the policies then in place. This
figure does not include reductions in cost sharing on prescription drugs due
to the combination of the ACA’s provision closing the Medicare Part D coverage gap and slower-than-expected growth in prescription drug spending,
so it actually understates the total savings to Medicare beneficiaries.
Because State and Federal governments finance a substantial share
of health care spending, slower growth in health care costs has also greatly
improved the fiscal outlook. Due in large part to the ACA’s provisions slowing the growth of health care costs, CBO projects that the law will reduce
deficits by increasing amounts in the years ahead, rising to an average of 1
percent of GDP over the decade starting in 2026. Over the next two decades
as a whole, the law is projected to reduce deficits by more than $3 trillion. In
addition, since just after the ACA became law, CBO has reduced its projections of Medicare spending under current policies by an additional $125
billion in 2020 or around 0.6 percent of GDP in that year, further improving
the fiscal outlook. The combination of the ACA and broader trends in the
health care sector have also added 11 years to the life of the Medicare Trust
Fund relative to 2009 projections.
The remainder of this chapter provides additional detail on the challenges the United States health care system faced when the President took
office, the actions this Administration has taken to meet those challenges,
and the progress that has been achieved to date. The first section of this
chapter focuses on progress in expanding and improving health insurance
coverage, and the second focuses on improvements in the health care delivery system. The final section concludes.

Expanding and Improving Health
Insurance Coverage
Prior to the Obama Administration, the United States last made substantial progress in expanding health insurance coverage in the years after

Reforming the Health Care System  |  199

Medicare and Medicaid were created in 1965, as illustrated in Figure 4-1.1
Over the decade that followed, the United States uninsured rate fell by more
than half, from 24 percent in 1963 to 11 percent in 1974, driven by the rampup of Medicare and Medicaid, legislative improvements that expanded those
programs to people with serious disabilities, and the continued spread of
employer-based health insurance. But progress stalled by the mid-1970s,
and the uninsured rate rose steadily through the 1980s before stabilizing in
the 1990s. In 2008, the year before President Obama took office, 44 million
people—nearly 15 percent of the U.S. population—lacked health insurance.
This section of the chapter reviews the progress that has been made
under this Administration in expanding and improving health insurance
coverage. The section begins by describing the features of the pre-ACA
health insurance landscape that caused so many Americans to go without
coverage. It then discusses the actions taken under this Administration to
increase health insurance coverage and presents evidence that those actions
have been highly effective. It closes by surveying early evidence demonstrating that expanded coverage is improving access to care, health, and financial
security for the newly insured, reducing the burden of uncompensated care
for the health care system, and reducing income inequality, all without the
adverse effects on labor markets that the law’s critics predicted.

Barriers to Obtaining Health Insurance Coverage Before the
Obama Administration
Prior to the reforms introduced during this Administration, uninsured Americans faced a pair of often-insurmountable barriers to obtaining
coverage. The first was the high cost of health insurance, which made coverage unaffordable for many. The second was the dysfunction of the pre-ACA
individual health insurance market, which caused many people to be locked
out or priced out of the market due to pre-existing health conditions and
kept many others from finding high-quality coverage. The role of each of
these factors is discussed in greater detail below.

Cost Barriers to Obtaining Health Insurance Coverage
Health insurance has long been one of the most costly products that
most families purchase. In 2008, the average premium for a policy offered
in the employer market was $4,700 for single coverage and $12,700 for
1 This discussion draws upon the historical health insurance series described in CEA (2014).
The series is based primarily on analysis of data from the National Health Interview Survey.
The methods described by Cohen et al. (2009) and Cohen (2012) were used to construct a
consistent series over time. For 1980 and earlier, data from the NHIS were supplemented with
information from other survey data sources and administrative data on enrollment in Medicare
and Medicaid.

family coverage (KFF/HRET 2016). These amounts would have been a
major expense for most families, but they represented a particularly heavy
burden for low- and moderate-income families already struggling to meet
other basic needs. As illustrated in Figure 4-2, for a family of four with an
income below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, the average premium for an employer-sponsored family policy would have consumed 30
percent or more of family income. For a family below the poverty line, it
would have consumed 60 percent or more of family income, an essentially
insurmountable barrier.2
Public policy played an important role in helping families meet these
affordability challenges, but the adequacy of these efforts varied widely by
age. For people age 65 and older, Medicare had succeeded in achieving
nearly universal coverage at all income levels, as illustrated in Panel C of
Figure 4-3. But individuals under age 65 were served by a patchwork of
programs and incentives that left significant gaps.
For people with access to coverage through an employer, the tax
code provided a large implicit subsidy for purchasing coverage. Unlike cash
compensation, the compensation employers provide in the form of health
2 Families bore these burdens whether they purchased coverage directly or, as was typically the
case, obtained it through an employer. While employers typically pay around three-quarters
of the total premium, economic theory and evidence indicate that employees ultimately bear
the cost of that subsidy in the form of lower wages and salaries (for example, Summers 1989;
Baicker and Chandra 2006).

insurance is excluded from payroll and income taxation. The Federal marginal tax rate on labor income averages around 35 percent, so for each dollar
of compensation a family received in the form of health insurance instead of
wages, the family saved 35 cents in Federal taxes, reducing the effective cost
of that dollar of health insurance coverage to just 65 cents.3 This favorable
tax treatment played a central role in making coverage affordable for many
middle- and upper-middle class families.4
However, the tax benefit for employer-sponsored coverage was inadequate to make coverage affordable for many low- and moderate-income
families. As depicted in Panels A and B of Figure 4-3, the likelihood of having private insurance from any source fell sharply with income. Bipartisan
efforts during the 1980s and 1990s had made significant progress in filling
these gaps for low- and moderate-income children by broadening eligibility
for Medicaid and creating the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
3 The Federal marginal tax rate reported here was estimated using data from Urban-Brookings
Tax Policy Center Tables T13-0253 and T14-0091. States also generally exclude employerprovided health insurance coverage from taxation, so the value of the tax subsidy is somewhat
larger than reported here.
4 While this favorable tax treatment played an important role in making coverage affordable
for many families, its unlimited nature also encouraged some employers to offer inefficient
and overly generous plans. The ACA introduced a tax reform that maintains this tax benefit,
but mitigates the inefficiencies created by its unlimited nature; this reform is discussed in the
second half of the chapter.

Note: Employment-based coverage is defined as coverage from a current or former employer, including
military and VA coverage. Public coverage is defined as Medicare, Medicaid, and other government
coverage for people with low-incomes or a disability. Individuals reporting multiple sources of coverage
were assigned to a single insurance type using the following hierarchy: Medicare; military health
coverage; VA health coverage; Medicaid and other government coverage for people with low-incomes or
disabilities; coverage through a current or former employer; and coverage purchased directly from an
insurance company. This hierarchy was applied prior to categorizing individuals into the coverage groups
described above.

But these efforts left significant gaps even for children. They left even larger
gaps for adults. Prior to the ACA, most state Medicaid programs did not
cover adults without children, no matter how low their incomes, and the
median state only covered working parents with incomes below 61 percent
of the Federal Poverty Level (Heberlein, Brooks, and Alker 2013). As a
result, low- and moderate-income non-elderly adults were by far the age and
income group most likely to lack health insurance, as illustrated in Panel B
of Figure 4-3.

Failures of the Individual Health Insurance Market
In addition to the affordability challenges described above, many
uninsured Americans faced an additional barrier: the dysfunction of the
individual health insurance market. While most non-elderly individuals
had access to coverage through an employer, it was far from universal, even
at relatively high income levels, as depicted in Figure 4-4. Retirees, many
students, the self-employed, people working part-time due to family or other
obligations, and the unemployed were all particularly likely to lack access to
coverage through the workplace, as were individuals who happened to work
at smaller firms or in industries where insurance coverage was not commonly offered. These individuals, if they did not qualify for public programs,
had no choice but to turn to the individual market.
The fundamental flaw of the pre-ACA individual health insurance
market was that, unlike the employer market, the individual market lacked
a mechanism for forming broad pools that included both relatively healthy
and relatively sick individuals. The employer market forms broad pools by
taking advantage of the fact that people are matched to employers based on
a wide variety of factors, many of which are only loosely related to health status. In addition, employers typically cover around three-quarters of the premium, ensuring participation by a broad cross-section of their workforces,
including both healthier and sicker workers (KFF/HRET 2016). Insurers
offering coverage through employers can therefore be confident that their
products will attract a balanced pool of healthier and sicker enrollees. As a
result, their economic incentives generally drive them to design products
that maximize the well-being of the pool as a whole.
By contrast, insurers in the individual market had to contend with the
possibility of “adverse selection,” the tendency of people with greater health
care needs—and thus higher costs to insurers—to prefer more generous
insurance coverage. Insurers’ concerns that they would attract an adversely
selected pool drove them to engage in a wide range of practices aimed at
discouraging enrollment by sicker individuals. These practices kept the
individual market from performing the core functions of a health insurance

market: sharing risk between the healthy and the sick; providing robust
financial protection against unexpected health shocks; and facilitating access
to needed health care.
Most destructively, insurers typically offered coverage on worse terms
or not at all to people with pre-existing health conditions, a group estimated
to include between 50 million and 129 million non-elderly Americans,
depending on the definitions used (ASPE 2011). Before issuing a policy,
insurers generally required applicants to submit information about their
health history. Individuals with a pre-existing condition might then be
charged a higher premium, offered a policy that excluded care related to the
condition, or denied coverage entirely. While estimates of the frequency of
these practices vary, they were clearly quite common. An industry survey
found that 34 percent of individual applicants were charged higher-thanstandard rates based on demographic characteristics or medical history
(AHIP 2009). Similarly, a report by the Government Accountability Office
(2011) estimated that, as of early 2010, the denial rate among individual
market applications was 19 percent, and the most common reason for
denial was health status. A 2009 survey found that, among adults who had
individual market coverage or shopped for it in the previous three years, 36

Reforming the Health Care System  |  205

percent were denied coverage, charged more, or had exclusions placed on
their policy due to pre-existing conditions (Doty et al. 2009).
Insurers’ desire to discourage enrollment by individuals with significant health care needs also led them to limit coverage in ways that undermined enrollees’ access to care and financial security. For example, plans
offered on the individual market frequently excluded or charged a high premium for services like maternity care, prescription drugs, and mental health
care (Whitmore et al. 2011). One study estimated that, in 2011, 62 percent
of individual market enrollees lacked coverage for maternity services, 34
percent lacked coverage for substance abuse services, 18 percent lacked
coverage for mental health services, and 9 percent lacked prescription drug
coverage (ASPE 2011). Individual market policies also frequently imposed
very high cost-sharing requirements or placed annual, lifetime, or other
limits on the amount they would cover. Half of individual market enrollees
were estimated to be in policies that covered less than 60 percent of their
total medical spending (Gabel et al. 2012). Similarly, an estimated 89 percent
of those purchasing individual health coverage had a lifetime limit on their
benefits (Musco and Sommers 2012).

Reforms to Expand Health Insurance Coverage
The Obama Administration has implemented a series of reforms
designed to overcome the barriers described above and ensure that all
Americans can access high-quality, affordable health insurance coverage. This work began in February 2009 with the enactment of legislation
improving CHIP and continued with the enactment and implementation
of the ACA, which made broader reforms to the health insurance system
in the United States. These reforms, as well as the evidence that they have
dramatically expanded access to health insurance coverage, are described in
detail below.

Strengthening the Children’s Health Insurance Program
The Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) was created in
1997 and provides financial support beyond what is available through the
existing Medicaid program to states wishing to cover additional low- and
moderate-income children. Research has found that CHIP was highly effective in increasing insurance coverage among children and implies that CHIP
was likely the main reason that the uninsured rate among children declined
almost without interruption from the late 1990s through the mid-2000s, as

illustrated in Figure 4-5 (Howell and Kenney 2012).5 Progress stalled after
the mid-2000s, however, and 9.5 percent of children still lacked health insurance coverage in 2008.
In February 2009, just weeks after taking office, President Obama
signed the Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act
(CHIPRA). CHIPRA aimed to further reduce the uninsured rate among
children by making a range of improvements to CHIP. Notably, the law:
provided new options for states that wanted to simplify enrollment, improve
outreach, or expand eligibility; created financial incentives for states to
adopt best practices; and extended the program’s funding.
In the years after CHIPRA’s enactment, the children’s uninsured rate
resumed its rapid decline. From 2008 through 2013, the uninsured rate
among children declined by around a quarter, equivalent to 1.9 million
children gaining coverage. The timing of these gains, combined with the
fact that uninsured rates actually rose during this period for adults—likely
due to the Great Recession and its aftermath—suggests that policy changes
introduced by CHIPRA played an important role in reducing the uninsured
5 Estimates of the uninsured rate for 0-18 year olds have not yet been reported for 2016, so the
uninsured rate for 0-18 year olds reported in Figure 4-5 was calculated by extrapolating the
2015 estimate using the percentage point change for 0-17 year olds, which has been reported.
Similarly, estimates of the uninsured rate for 26-64 year olds were extrapolated using the
percentage point change for the larger group consisting of 18 year olds and 26-64 year olds.

Box 4-1: Public Health Benefits of CHIPRA
In addition to extending and improving CHIP, CHIPRA also raised
the Federal cigarette tax from $0.39 per pack to approximately $1.01
per pack. By increasing cigarette prices, cigarette taxes substantially
reduce smoking rates and generate large improvements in public health.
Research examining the impact of Federal cigarette tax increases on the
number of teen or young-adult smokers imply that the 2009 Federal
cigarette tax increase will reduce youth smoking by between 3 and 15
percentage points (van Hasselt et al. 2015; Huang and Chaloupka 2012;
CBO 2012b; Carpenter and Cook 2008). Assuming that roughly a third
of youth smokers die prematurely due to smoking (U.S. Surgeon General
2014), these estimates suggest that the 2009 cigarette tax increase plausibly reduced the number of premature deaths due to smoking in each
cohort by between 15,000 and 70,000, as illustrated in Figure 4-i.

rate among children.6 Consistent with this time-series evidence, research
examining specific changes in state CHIP and Medicaid programs enabled
by CHIPRA has concluded these changes were effective in expanding coverage for children (Blavin, Kenney, and Huntress 2014; Goldstein et al. 2014).
6 Figure 4-5 uses adults ages 26-64 (rather than all non-elderly adults) as a comparison group
in order to exclude any effects of the Affordable Care Act’s dependent coverage expansion,
which took effect in late 2010. That coverage expansion is discussed in greater detail below.

208  |  Chapter 4

Legislative actions subsequent to CHIPRA have ensured that CHIP
can continue to be a source of affordable coverage for low- and moderateincome children. The ACA extended funding for CHIP through fiscal year
2015 and increased the share of CHIP costs paid by the Federal Government,
making the program even more financially attractive for states. In 2015, the
Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) extended funding for CHIP, as well as many of the policy improvements introduced in
CHIPRA and the ACA, through fiscal year 2017.

Expanding Access to Coverage for Young Adults
The ACA’s comprehensive reforms to ensure access to health insurance coverage are described below, but the law also included a targeted provision to reduce the particularly high uninsured rate among young adults,
which is illustrated in Figure 4-6. Young adults’ uninsured rates exceeded
those for older adults for a number of reasons. Because many young adults
are still in school, and those who have already joined the labor force are
less likely to be offered health insurance through work, they were much less
likely to have employer coverage. They also were much less likely to have
Medicaid coverage than children, reflecting the stricter eligibility rules that
apply to adults.
To address the unique challenges faced by young adults, the ACA
required private insurance plans to allow young adults to remain on a parent’s policy until age 26. Immediately after this policy took effect during
September 2010, the uninsured rate among young adults ages 19-25 started
declining rapidly, as shown in Figure 4-7.7 The uninsured rate fell from
34.1 percent in the four quarters ended in September 2010 to 26.7 percent
in the four quarters of 2013, just before the ACA’s broader coverage provisions took effect. The timing of this decline, combined with the fact that the
uninsured rate for older non-elderly adults was essentially flat during this
period is strong evidence that the decline was caused by the ACA provision.
On the basis of these data, the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) estimates that 2.3 million young adults gained coverage
because of this provision (ASPE 2015). The broader academic literature
has also concluded that the provision generated substantial gains in young
adult coverage, though estimates vary across studies, with some reporting
estimates higher than ASPE’s and others reporting lower estimates (Cantor
et al. 2012; Antwi, Moriya, and Simon 2013; Porterfield and Huang 2016).

Comprehensive Coverage Expansions
Starting in 2014, the ACA implemented broad-based coverage expansions designed to ensure that all Americans could access affordable, highquality health insurance coverage. These expansions consisted of two main
pieces: an expansion of eligibility for Medicaid coverage and comprehensive
reforms to the individual health insurance market. Each of these reforms is
described in greater detail below.
To provide affordable coverage options for the lowest-income
Americans, the ACA provided states with generous financial assistance to
expand Medicaid coverage to all non-elderly people with incomes below 138
percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), around $16,200 for an individual
and $33,500 for a family of four in 2016.8 As specified in the ACA, the
Federal Government has funded 100 percent of the cost for newly eligible
individuals to date, and this share gradually phases down to 90 percent in
2020 and subsequent years. This generous matching rate makes expanding
Medicaid a very attractive proposition for states, particularly since research
has generally concluded that states that expand Medicaid realize significant
8 The base income eligibility threshold is 133 percent of the FPL. However, Medicaid program
rules provide for an additional “income disregard” of 5 percent of income, which brings the
effective eligibility threshold to 138 percent of the FPL. The dollar amounts reported in the text
reflect the 2015 version of the FPL because those are the amounts used to determine eligibility
for coverage during 2016.

offsetting savings elsewhere in their budgets, including in existing portions
of their Medicaid programs, in programs that defray the costs of uncompensated care, and in programs that provide mental health services (Buettgens,
Dorn, and Carroll 2011; Dorn, McGrath, and Holahan 2014). To date, 31
states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid under the ACA.
For Americans with incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid, the
ACA implemented an interlocking set of reforms in the individual health
insurance market. The first component of these reforms was a new set
of consumer protections that guaranteed access to high-quality health
insurance coverage. Most importantly, to ensure that both healthy and
sick individuals could access coverage, the law required insurers to offer
coverage on common terms to all enrollees, regardless of whether they had
pre-existing health conditions, with premiums allowed to vary based solely
on age, geography, and tobacco use. In order to ensure that the coverage
available on the reformed market offered real access to medical care and
financial protection, the law required all plans to cover a set of essential
health benefits and provide a basic level of protection against out-of-pocket
costs. As a complement to these reforms, the law created a risk adjustment
program that compensates insurers that attract a sicker-than-average group
of enrollees, thereby ensuring that insurers have incentives to design plans
that meet the needs of all types of consumers, both healthy and sick. Finally,
to foster competition, the law created the Health Insurance Marketplaces
Reforming the Health Care System  |  211

(Marketplaces), web-based markets that help consumers comparison shop
to find a plan that matches their particular preferences and needs.
The second component of these reforms was designed to ensure
that coverage on the reformed individual market was affordable. To overcome the affordability challenges that kept many low- and middle-income
Americans from obtaining coverage before the ACA, the law created a
premium tax credit for people with incomes between 100 percent and 400
percent of the FPL who purchase coverage through the Marketplaces.9 The
premium tax credit ensures that all consumers have affordable coverage
options by limiting the amount enrollees must contribute to a “benchmark”
plan to a specified percentage of their income; if the premium for the benchmark plan exceeds that amount, the tax credit makes up the difference. For
individuals with incomes below 250 percent of the FPL, the law also provides
cost-sharing reductions that reduce enrollees’ out-of-pocket costs. As an
additional measure to keep premiums affordable, the law implemented
an individual responsibility provision that requires people who can afford
coverage to make a payment if they elect to go without it. This requirement encourages healthy individuals to enroll in coverage, which protects
the individual market’s ability to pool risk between the healthy and the
sick, thereby helping keep premiums affordable; indeed, the Congressional
Budget Office has estimated that individual market premiums would be
around 20 percent higher in the absence of this provision (CBO 2015b). The
provision also discourages individuals from shifting their health care costs
to others in the form of uncompensated care.
The U.S. uninsured rate has declined dramatically since these reforms
took effect at the beginning of 2014, falling from 14.5 percent in 2013 to 8.9
percent in the first half of 2016, as illustrated in Figure 4-1. The decline in the
uninsured rate seen over this period is, by far, the largest decline since the
years following the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. Consistent
with the nearly unprecedented magnitude of this decline, research aimed at
isolating the effect of the ACA from other trends in the health care system
or the economy has concluded that the overwhelming majority of these
gains are directly attributable to the ACA’s reforms (Courtemanche et al.
2016; Blumberg, Garrett, and Holahan 2016). Using a methodology that
controls for unrelated economic and demographic changes, HHS estimates
that 17.7 million non-elderly adults have gained coverage since the end of
2013 because of the ACA’s comprehensive reforms (Uberoi, Finegold, and
Gee 2016). Combining these gains since 2013 with the gains for young adults
9 In states that have expanded Medicaid, people with incomes between 100 and 138 percent of
the FPL receive coverage through Medicaid. In non-expansion states, these people are generally
eligible for subsidized coverage through the Marketplace.

212  |  Chapter 4

because of the ACA’s provision allowing young adults to remain on a parent’s plan until age 26, an estimated 20 million adults have gained coverage
because of the ACA.
The ACA’s main coverage provisions have also driven further coverage gains among children, which are not captured in the data from the
Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index used by Uberoi, Finegold, and Gee
(2016). As illustrated in Figure 4-5 above, the uninsured rate among children
has seen another sharp decline as the ACA’s major coverage expansions have
taken effect, equivalent to an additional 1.2 million children gaining coverage.10 Combining the gains that began in 2014 with the gains in children’s
coverage from 2008 through 2013 that were discussed above, an additional
3.1 million children have coverage in 2016 because of the decline in the
uninsured rate among children since 2008.
Both the law’s Medicaid expansion and its reforms to the individual
health insurance market are contributing to this major expansion in health
insurance coverage. To illustrate this, Figure 4-8 reports the decline in the
uninsured rate from 2013 to 2015 by state in relation to that state’s uninsured
rate in 2013. While every state in the country has seen a decline in its uninsured rate since 2013, states that have taken advantage of the law’s Medicaid
expansion have seen markedly larger declines, with the largest declines in
those states that both took up Medicaid and had high uninsured rates before
the ACA’s reforms took effect. However, even those states that have not
taken up Medicaid expansion have made considerable progress in reducing
the uninsured rate, indicating that the law’s reforms to the individual health
insurance market are also working to expand insurance coverage.
The pattern of coverage gains by income provides additional evidence
that the law’s reforms to the individual health insurance market are contributing to coverage gains, alongside Medicaid expansion. In particular,
Figure 4-9 shows that the uninsured rate has declined markedly among
individuals with incomes above the Medicaid eligibility threshold of 138
percent of the FPL, and these declines are similar in proportional terms to
those for individuals with incomes below 138 percent of the FPL. Notably,
declines have been seen both for people with incomes between 138 percent
and 400 percent of the FPL, who are generally eligible for financial assistance
10 The 1.2 million figure cited here reflects coverage gains for individuals ages 0 to 17 from
2013 through the first half of 2016, as reported in the National Health Interview Survey.
The data reported in Figure 4-5 include individuals ages 0 to 18 because 18-year-olds are
considered children for Medicaid and CHIP eligibility purposes, making this the most
appropriate age range to examine when discussing CHIPRA. By contrast, 18-year-olds are
already included in the estimate reported by Uberoi, Finegold, and Gee (2016) regarding the
effects of the ACA, so including 18-year-olds in this estimate would double-count post-2013
gains for 18-year-olds.

Box 4-2: Dynamics in the Individual Health Insurance Market
After two years of moderate premium growth for plans offered
through the Health Insurance Marketplace, premiums are increasing at
a faster pace for 2017, though experience will vary widely across states
(ASPE 2016b). This box discusses the factors that are driving changes
in Marketplace premiums in 2017, as well as their implications for the
future of the individual market. Contrary to some recent claims, a range
of evidence demonstrates that this year’s premium changes are part of
the ordinary process of adjustment in a new market, not a harbinger of
future market instability.
Factors Driving 2017 Premium Changes
Insurers faced significant challenges in setting premiums in the
years immediately following implementation of the ACA’s reforms to
the individual market. The ACA brought many new people into the
individual market, including people with pre-existing health conditions
who had previously been locked out of the market and people who could
newly afford coverage because of the law’s financial assistance. These
major changes made predicting average medical costs in the reformed
market difficult. This in turn created a significant risk that insurers
would underestimate or overestimate the level of premiums required
to finance those claims. In addition, some insurers may have intentionally underpriced when setting premiums in an attempt to attract the
many new consumers who have entered the individual health insurance
market during its first few years, accepting losses in the short run in
exchange for higher market shares in the long run.
It is now clear that, on average, insurers underpriced in the early
years of the new market. Insurers are estimated to have incurred losses of
around 5 percent of premium revenue on ACA-compliant health insurance policies in 2014, the market’s first year (McKinsey 2016). To achieve
sustainable pricing in subsequent years, insurers needed to make up for
these initial losses while also accommodating two additional factors. The
first was the ordinary upward trend in medical costs, which averaged
around 4 percent a year, though, as discussed below, this has likely been
partially offset by ongoing improvements in the ACA-compliant risk
pool relative to 2014. The second was the scheduled phasedown of the
ACA’s transitional reinsurance program, which defrayed a portion of
insurers’ claims spending on high-cost enrollees in 2014 through 2016.
The decline in payments from this program added around 7 percent to
premium growth in each of 2015, 2016, and 2017. The net effect of these
various factors is that returning premiums to a sustainable level by 2017
likely required premium increases averaging a bit more than 10 percent
per year in 2015, 2016, and 2017. But the premium for the second-lowest

Reforming the Health Care System  |  215

silver (or “benchmark”) plan increased by just 2 percent in 2015 and 7
percent in 2016 in the states using the HealthCare.gov enrollment platform, necessitating much more significant adjustments in 2017.
The pattern of premium changes across areas strongly supports the
view that Marketplace premium changes are being driven in substantial
part by insurers’ efforts to bring premiums in line with costs after having
initially underpriced. Figure 4-ii illustrates how the annual percentage
increase in the premium for the benchmark plan from 2014 to 2017
varies based on the level of the benchmark premium in 2014. In the
four-fifths of the country with higher benchmark premiums in 2014, the
median person has seen average annual increases in the benchmark of
below 10 percent, less than what would have been needed to cover normal increases in medical costs and the gradual phasedown of the ACA’s
transitional reinsurance program. By contrast, the fifth of the country
that had the lowest premiums in 2014 has seen much larger increases
since then. This pattern is what would have been expected if insurers
in some areas significantly underpriced in 2014 and have been working
to bring premiums back in line with costs since then, while insurers in
other areas priced appropriately or overpriced.
It is also important to note that, even after the increases seen for
2017, Marketplace premiums remain roughly in line with CBO’s initial
projections (ASPE 2016b). The average benchmark premium for 2014
was about 15 percent below what the Congressional Budget Office had

projected during the debate over the ACA (CBO 2014), and analysts
have estimated that premiums remained between 12 percent and 20
percent below CBO’s initial projections in 2016, depending on the
methodology used (Levitt, Cox, and Claxton 2016; Adler and Ginsburg
2016). The 2017 increases are therefore taking Marketplace premiums
back to their originally expected trajectory, consistent with the view that
these increases are a one-time correction, not an indication of underlying problems in the individual market.
Implications of 2017 Premium Changes for the Future of the
Individual Market
By bringing insurers’ premium revenue back in line with their
claims costs, the premium increases being implemented for 2017 help
create the conditions for a more stable market in the years ahead.
However, some analysts and commentators have taken a more negative
view. They argue that premium increases will drive large reductions in
individual market enrollment, particularly among healthy individuals.
This decline in enrollment among the healthy, they argue, will increase
average medical costs in the individual market, triggering further premium increases and enrollment reductions. Some observers have even
speculated this feedback loop between higher premiums and falling
enrollment will become so intense that it will cause a “death spiral,” a
scenario in which enrollment in the individual market ultimately falls
nearly to zero. Some of these observers have further suggested that the
premium increases seen for 2017 are evidence that this type of vicious
cycle has already begun.
In fact, there is no evidence that a death spiral is underway. The
defining feature of a death spiral is declining enrollment, particularly
among the healthy, resulting in a deteriorating risk pool. In fact, the
exact opposite is occurring. Marketplace enrollment has grown every
year since the Marketplace opened in 2014, and enrollment in the individual market as a whole was estimated to be around 18 million in early
2016, up from around 11 million in 2013 (ASPE 2016a). Furthermore,
it appears that the average individual market enrollee is actually getting
healthier over time. Using data on medical spending in the individual
market submitted by insurers as part of the ACA’s transitional reinsurance program, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
estimate that nominal per member per month medical spending fell
slightly from 2014 to 2015, and an outside analysis of a private claims
database supports a similar conclusion (CMS 2016a; Avalere Health
2016). Due to the underlying upward trend in medical costs, per member
per month spending would have been expected to increase if the average

Reforming the Health Care System  |  217

health status of individual market enrollees had held steady, so these
data suggest that the average health status improved from 2014 to 2015.
Looking to the future, the design of the ACA’s premium tax credit
ensures that a death spiral can never occur in this market. The tax credit
is designed so that an individual’s contribution to the benchmark plan
is capped at a specified percentage of income; the tax credit pays the
remainder of the premium. Figure 4-iii provides a concrete example of
how this works for a single person making $25,000 per year. This individual’s required contribution to the benchmark plan is $143 a month
in 2017. If the premium for the benchmark plan in the individual’s area
were $243 a month, the tax credit would then pay the remaining $100
per month, as illustrated in the left column of the Figure. If the premium
for the benchmark plan were $50 a month higher, as in the right column
of the Figure, the individual’s contribution would remain at $143 a
month, and the tax credit would increase to $150 a month. Thus, the
individual is fully protected from the higher benchmark premium.
Importantly, even individuals who qualify for only modest premium tax
credits benefit from this protection since their required contribution,
though larger, also does not depend upon the actual level of premiums.
Around 85 percent of individuals who get coverage through the
Marketplace receive the premium tax credit, and about two-thirds of
people in the individual market as a whole are eligible for tax credits
(ASPE 2016a). The premium tax credit therefore ensures that the over-

whelming majority of Marketplace enrollees and the sizeable majority
of individuals in the individual market overall are protected against
premium increases and have no reason to leave the market when premiums rise. That, in turn, stabilizes the overall individual market risk pool
and helps keep premiums affordable for people who are not eligible for
tax credits. The result is that any negative effects of higher premiums
on enrollment and the risk pool will be greatly attenuated, arresting the
feedback loop of falling enrollment and higher premiums that would
cause the market to unravel.
Consumers’ actual behavior under the ACA to date provides no
support for the view that premium increases will trigger significant market unraveling. Panel A of Figure 4-iv examines the relationship between
changes in the average benchmark premium in each state from 2014 to
2015 and the corresponding changes in enrollment in the state’s ACAcompliant individual market (including both on- and off-Marketplace
enrollment). For there to be any risk of a death spiral, premium changes
would need to have very large negative effects on enrollment, akin to
the scenario illustrated by the orange dashed line. In fact, there was
essentially no difference in enrollment growth across areas experiencing
larger and smaller increases in the benchmark premium from to 2014 to
2015, as illustrated by the green dashed line.
Similarly, Panel B of Figure 4-iv examines the relationship between
the change in the benchmark premium in each state from 2014 to 2015
and the change in average claims costs in the ACA-compliant market in
that state. For there to be any risk of a death spiral, increases in premiums
would have to result in substantial increases in claims costs (as a result of
healthy individuals leaving the market), akin to the relationship between
premium and cost changes illustrated by the orange dashed line. In fact,
consistent with the evidence from Panel A that premium increases did
not meaningfully affect enrollment, there is no evidence that premium
increases adversely affected the risk pool. If anything, larger premium
increases appeared to be associated with slightly slower year-over-year
growth in monthly claims costs, as illustrated by the green dashed line.
Complete data on how enrollment and claims in the ACAcompliant individual market changed from 2015 to 2016 are not yet
available. However, the county-level relationship between changes in
benchmark premiums and changes in the number of people selecting
Marketplace plans, depicted in Figure 4-v, reinforces the conclusion
that the individual market is at no risk of unraveling. As above, for the
individual market to be at risk of a death spiral, counties experiencing
larger increases in the benchmark premium would have to see much
smaller growth in plan selections, akin to the scenario illustrated by the

benchmark premiums. Changes in benchmark premiums are calculated on a population-weighted basis.
Enrollment and monthly claims spending for the ACA-compliant market are measured using data
submitted to CMS for the risk adjustment and reinsurance programs. Enrollment is measured as the
number of member months of enrollment during the year. Monthly claims spending is measured as
aggregate claims in the State’s individual market divided by the aggregate number of member months of
enrollment. Observed relationships use a simple log-log fit. The “Relationship Required for ‘Death

different slope coefficients. In Panel A, the “Relationship Required for ‘Death Spiral’” line reflects a
slope coefficient of -2; for a demand elasticity of -2 to allow a death spiral, individuals who leave the
market in response to higher premiums would need to have claims costs half as large as individuals who
remain enrolled, a relatively extreme scenario. In Panel B, the “Relationship Required for ‘Death Spiral’”
line depicts a slope coefficient of 1, which is sufficient to ensure that additional revenue from higher
premiums is fully offset by higher claims costs.

the benchmark premium from 2015 to 2016 actually seem to have seen
slightly larger increases in Marketplace plan selections over that period.
Notably, while average premium increases were lower in 2016 than 2017,
some counties saw rate increases of 30 percent or more in 2016, and even
these counties show no clear evidence of slower enrollment growth.

to purchase Marketplace coverage, and people above 400 percent of the FPL,
who are not eligible for financial assistance. The substantial coverage gains
among the higher-income group, individuals who are not eligible for financial assistance through the Marketplaces, indicates that the combination of
the ACA’s consumer protections guaranteeing access to coverage and its
individual responsibility requirement are also proving effective in increasing
health insurance coverage.

Improvements in Existing Health Insurance Coverage
In addition to implementing reforms that have greatly increased the
number of people with health insurance coverage, the ACA has also implemented reforms that are improving insurance coverage for people who were
already insured, including people covered through an employer or through
Medicare. Because of these reforms, tens of millions more Americans are
now better protected against catastrophic out-of-pocket costs in the event of
serious illness and have greater access to needed medical care.
One such set of reforms is ensuring that all private insurance plans
provide real protection against catastrophic costs. When the ACA became
law in 2010, 18 percent of workers enrolled in single coverage through an
employer were exposed to potentially unlimited out-of-pocket spending, as
Reforming the Health Care System  |  221

illustrated in Figure 4-10 (KFF/HRET 2016). To address this problem, the
ACA required that all non-grandfathered private insurance plans place a
limit on enrollees’ annual out-of-pocket spending starting in 2014.11 The
share of enrollees lacking an out-of-pocket limit fell modestly in the years
immediately after the ACA became law (likely in part because some firms
elected to make changes in advance of 2014) then fell sharply as the ACA
requirement took effect. In 2016, just 2 percent of enrollees in single coverage lacked an out-of-pocket limit. If the share of enrollees in employer coverage who lack an out-of-pocket limit had remained at its 2010 level, at least
22 million additional people enrolled in employer coverage would lack this
protection today.12 The ACA also prohibits private insurance plans from
imposing lifetime limits on the amount of care they will cover and, with the
exception of a dwindling number of grandfathered policies in the individual
market, imposing annual limits on benefits.
The ACA also strengthened protections against high out-of-pocket
costs in Medicare Part D, the portion of Medicare that provides prescription
drug coverage. The original Medicare Part D benefit design included a gap in
coverage, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” Because of the coverage
gap, Medicare beneficiaries spending more than about $2,700 on prescriptions in 2009 were required to pay the next roughly $3,500 entirely out of
pocket. The ACA is phasing out the coverage gap and will close it entirely by
2020. In 2015, the most recent full year for which data are available, 5.2 million Medicare beneficiaries with high drug costs saved $5.4 billion, an average of more than $1,000 per affected beneficiary (CMS 2016d). Cumulatively
through July 2016, more than 11 million beneficiaries have saved $23.5
billion, an average savings of more than $2,100 per beneficiary (CMS 2016b).
Another set of ACA reforms sought to encourage greater use of
preventive services. Research prior to the ACA had documented that many
preventive services—such as blood pressure screenings, mammograms,
and colonoscopies—were seriously underutilized, despite strong evidence
of their effectiveness (McGlynn et al. 2003; Commonwealth Fund 2008).
11 The ACA specified that certain insurance policies in place prior to the law’s enactment
would be “grandfathered” and thus not subject to some of the insurance reforms implemented
under the law. The number of grandfathered policies has fallen steadily over time (KFF/HRET
2016).
12 Trends for those enrolled in family coverage are similar to those reported for single coverage
in Figure 4-10. In 2010, 17 percent of family coverage enrollees lacked an out-of-pocket limit,
and the decline in this percentage almost exactly paralleled the decline for single coverage
through 2014; estimates for family coverage have not been reported for years after 2014. To
be conservative, the 22 million estimate presented in the text assumes that the overall share of
enrollees lacking an out-of-pocket limit declined from 17 percent in 2010 to 2 percent in 2016.
It assumes that 150 million people were enrolled in employer coverage in 2016, consistent with
KFF/HRET (2016).

To encourage greater utilization, the ACA required that private insurance
plans and Medicare cover preventive services that are recommended by the
United States Preventive Services Task Force without cost sharing. While the
research literature examining the effects of this provision is still limited, one
recent study examined plans that implemented this provision at different
times and concluded that eliminating cost sharing had the expected effect
of increasing use of the service studied, in this case contraception (Carlin,
Fertig, and Dowd 2016).

Economic Consequences of Broader Health Insurance Coverage
The historic expansion in insurance coverage described in the last section is still very new, so research to evaluate its consequences is just beginning. Early evidence shows, however, that recent coverage gains are already
generating major benefits similar to those documented in prior research on
the effects of health insurance coverage. This evidence demonstrates that the
law has already succeeded in improving access to care, health, and financial
security for the newly insured and in reducing the burden of uncompensated
care for the health care system as a whole. Looking beyond the health care
sector, the law is helping to reduce income inequality, and it is achieving this
broad range of benefits without the negative near-term effects on the labor
market that many of the law’s critics had predicted, while laying the foundation for a stronger labor market over the long term. This subsection of the
Reforming the Health Care System  |  223

chapter reviews this evidence base, with a particular focus on the effects of
the major coverage provisions of the Affordable Care Act that took effect at
the start of 2014.

Improved Access to Care
One objective of expanding insurance coverage is to ensure that
individuals can access needed health care.13 Research examining prior
coverage expansions leaves little doubt that expanding insurance coverage
is an effective tool for increasing access to care. For example, the Oregon
Health Insurance Experiment, a randomized-controlled trial of expanding
Medicaid coverage to low-income adults, found that Medicaid increased
receipt of health care services, including preventive services, prescription
medications, and physician visits (Baicker et al. 2013). Studies in many other
contexts, including the RAND Health Insurance Experiment (Newhouse et
al. 1993), studies of past Medicaid expansions targeting adults (Sommers,
Baicker, and Epstein 2012) and children (Howell and Kenney 2012), studies of the effect of gaining Medicare eligibility at age 65 (McWilliams et al.
2007; Card, Dobkin, and Maestas 2009), and studies of Massachusetts health
reform (Van der Wees, Zaslavsky, and Ayanian 2013; Sommers, Long, and
Baicker 2014), have similarly concluded that having health insurance or having more generous health insurance enhances individuals’ ability to obtain
care.
A range of evidence demonstrates that recent coverage expansions are
having similar effects on individuals’ ability to access care. One important
measure of individuals’ ability to access care is the share of people reporting
that they failed to obtain needed medical care due to cost during the last
12 months. As illustrated in Figure 4-11, this share rose by more than 50
13 While many non-economists consider it a self-evidently good thing when expanded
insurance coverage increases use of health care, a long-standing strand of economic research
emphasizes the possibility that health insurance will drive overconsumption of health care by
insulating enrollees from the cost of services, a phenomenon referred to as “moral hazard”
(Pauly 1968). For several reasons, however, moral hazard is not the appropriate analytic lens
for considering increases in the use of health care that arise from a coverage expansion. First,
health insurance can increase the use of health care services by increasing the resources that
individuals have available to them when seriously ill, thereby allowing them to access very
expensive, but cost-effective treatments (Nyman 1999); these types of increases in use of care
do not represent overconsumption. Second, in light of evidence that many effective services
are persistently underused, increases in the use of care that result from reducing the cost of
accessing care may, in some cases, reflect a reduction in underconsumption rather than a shift
toward overconsumption (Baicker, Mullainathan, and Schwartzstein 2015). Third, the standard
moral hazard analysis defines care as excessive if the individual would prefer to receive a cash
payment equal to the cost of the care in lieu of that care. Because low- and moderate-income
families face serious constraints on their budgets, they will often prefer a cash payment even
to highly effective health care services, so care that is judged excessive by the moral hazard
definition may still be quite valuable when judged using a broader social perspective.

percent during the decade preceding the ACA’s passage, with particularly
sharp increases coinciding with the onset of the Great Recession. By contrast, since 2010, the overall share of individuals reporting these types of
affordability problems has declined by more than a third, returning to levels
last seen 15 years ago.
The recovery from the Great Recession has likely played some role
in reducing cost barriers to accessing care, as increased employment and
rising wages have reduced financial stress on families. However, the fact
that this measure is now so far below its pre-recession trend, combined with
the particularly sharp declines seen after 2013, strongly suggests that recent
coverage expansions are playing an important role. Consistent with that
interpretation, Figure 4-12 looks across states and demonstrates that states
experiencing larger reductions in their uninsured rates from 2013 to 2015
experienced larger reductions in the share of individuals reporting difficulty
accessing care due to cost. State-level data show that larger coverage gains
are also strongly associated with increases in the share of individuals with
a personal doctor and the share of individuals with a checkup in the last 12
months, as shown in Figure 4-13.
Researchers using other survey data sources have documented similar
sharp improvements in access to care as the ACA’s coverage provisions have
taken effect. For example, examining data through March 2015, Shartzer,
Long, and Anderson (2016) report that the share of non-elderly adults with a
usual source of care and the share who received a routine checkup in the last
12 months has risen alongside insurance coverage, while the share reporting
problems accessing care or forgoing care due to cost has fallen. Examining
a similar time period, Sommers et al. (2015) report reductions in the share
of non-elderly adults reporting that they lack easy access to medicine, lack a
personal physician, or are unable to afford care. As with the trends reported
in Figure 4-12 and Figure 4-13, the pattern of the access gains reported
in these studies is consistent with their having been caused by the ACA’s
coverage expansion. Both studies cited above, as well as Simon, Soni, and
Cawley (2016) and Wherry and Miller (2016), document that gains in access
to care have been largest in states that expanded their Medicaid programs.
Similarly, Shartzer, Long, and Anderson (2016) find that low- and moderate-income adults, who saw the largest coverage gains, also saw the largest
improvements in access to care.

Better Health Outcomes
The ultimate goal of expanding access to health care services is
improving health. Research examining prior coverage expansions that targeted populations similar to those targeted under the ACA provides a basis

for confidence that expanded insurance coverage will translate into better
health. The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment documented significant
improvements in self-reported health status and mental health due to
expanded Medicaid coverage (Finkelstein et al. 2012; Baicker et al. 2013).
Studies of Massachusetts health reform concluded that the coverage expansion drove improvements in self-reported physical and mental health, as
well as reductions in mortality (Van der Wees, Zaslavsky, and Ayanian 2013;
Sommers, Long, and Baicker 2014), and a study of state Medicaid expansions targeting low-income adults during the early 2000s reached similar
conclusions (Sommers, Baicker, and Epstein 2012). Studies of prior expansions of Medicaid and CHIP coverage targeting low- and moderate-income
children have documented that health benefits of expanded coverage can be
long-lasting, with adults who had access to coverage in childhood experiencing lower risk of death and hospitalization many years later (Wherry et al.,
2015; Brown, Kowalski, and Lurie 2015; Wherry and Meyer 2016).
Early evidence on the effects of the ACA appears quite consistent
with the results documented for earlier coverage expansions. Barbaresco,
Courtemanche, and Qi (2015) report improvements in self-reported health
status among young adults following implementation of the ACA’s provision allowing young adults to remain on a parent’s plan. Looking at the main
ACA coverage provisions that took effect in 2014, Sommers et al. (2015) find
that the share of non-elderly adults reporting that they are in fair or poor
health has fallen as coverage has expanded, as has the percentage of days
that respondents report having their activities limited by health problems.
Research has also found evidence that gains in self-reported health status
have been larger in states that have expanded their Medicaid programs
(Sommers et al. 2016; Simon, Soni, and Cawley 2016).
While direct estimates of the law’s effects on physical health outcomes
are not yet available, largely because these data become available with longer
lags, these effects are likely to be quite important. Consider, for example, one
particularly important health outcome: mortality. As discussed in detail in
CEA (2015), there is considerable evidence that prior coverage expansions
targeting populations similar to those targeted in the ACA generated substantial reductions in mortality rates. The most relevant existing estimate of
the effect of insurance coverage on mortality comes from work by Sommers,
Long, and Baicker (2014) on Massachusetts health reform. By comparing
experiences in Massachusetts to those in neighboring states, they estimate
that one death was avoided annually for every 830 people who gained health
insurance. In conjunction with the estimate cited earlier in this chapter that
20 million adult have gained coverage because of the ACA as of early 2016,

228  |  Chapter 4

Box 4-3: Interpreting Results from the Oregon
Health Insurance Experiment
The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (OHIE) is an important
recent contribution to the literature on the effects of health insurance
coverage (Finkelstein et al. 2012; Baicker et al. 2013). The OHIE arose
from the state of Oregon’s decision in early 2008 to reopen enrollment
under a pre-ACA Medicaid expansion that targeted low-income adults.
Because the State could not accommodate all applicants, it allocated
the opportunity to enroll in Medicaid by lottery. This decision by the
State created a unique research opportunity because the only systematic
difference between lottery winners and lottery losers was whether they
could access Medicaid coverage. As a result, the OHIE researchers were
able to estimate the effect of Medicaid coverage on a range of outcomes
by comparing lottery winners to lottery losers and have confidence that
those estimates represented the causal effect of Medicaid.
As discussed in the main text, the OHIE found that Medicaid
coverage generated substantial benefits for those who enrolled, including
greater access to health care services, improved financial security, better
mental health, and better self-reported health status. The OHIE did not,
however, find statistically significant evidence that Medicaid improved
several objective measures of physical health, including the risk of high
blood pressure, high cholesterol, uncontrolled blood sugar, and death.
The OHIE’s failure to find statistically significant evidence that
Medicaid improves physical health has sometimes been interpreted as
evidence that Medicaid has no clinically significant effect on physical
health (for example, Roy 2013; Cannon 2014). But this conclusion is
incorrect. The OHIE’s sample size was limited, so its estimates of how
Medicaid affected physical health were quite imprecise. As a result, while
the OHIE did not find statistically significant evidence of improvements
in physical health, the study also could not rule out the possibility that
Medicaid caused very large improvements in physical health. For this
reason, the correct interpretation of the OHIE results is that they provide
little insight into how Medicaid affects the objective measures of physical
health examined in the OHIE, whether positively or negatively (Frakt
2013a; Frakt 2013b; Mulligan 2013; Richardson, Carroll, and Frakt 2013).
To make this point concrete, Figure 4-vi plots the OHIE estimates
of the effect of Medicaid on four adverse health outcomes, death, and
one outcome from each of the three physical health domains examined
in Baicker et al. (2013), as well as the associated 95 percent confidence
intervals. For scale, both the point estimates and confidence intervals
are shown as a percentage of the risk of each outcome in the control
group; the estimates reported in Figure 4-vi can therefore be interpreted

Reforming the Health Care System  |  229

as the proportional reduction in the risk of each outcome attributable
to Medicaid coverage. For none of these four health outcomes can the
OHIE rule out a proportional reduction in risk of more than two-fifths.
For three of the outcomes, the OHIE evidence cannot rule out a risk
reduction of more than a half, and for uncontrolled blood sugar and
death, the OHIE evidence cannot rule out nearly complete elimination of
the outcomes. Effects of this size would be clinically important and quite
valuable to individuals, indicating that the OHIE simply cannot resolve
the question of whether Medicaid has important effects on physical
health.
Furthermore, Figure 4-vi demonstrates that the OHIE point
estimates suggest that Medicaid reduced the risk of these adverse health
outcomes by between 8 and 18 percent in proportional terms, depending upon the outcome. These estimates are broadly consistent with the
improvements that Medicaid coverage would have been expected to
achieve in light of the prior literature on the efficacy of treatment for
these conditions (Frakt 2013a; Frakt 2013b; Mulligan 2013; Richardson,
Carroll, and Frakt 2013). Thus, while the OHIE estimates provide little
direct evidence on the effects of Medicaid on physical health of any kind,
they certainly do not suggest that Medicaid generates markedly smaller
improvements in physical health than would have been expected based
on the pre-OHIE evidence base.

Fortunately, the OHIE is not the only source of evidence on how
health insurance affects health outcomes. Many prior studies have used
“quasi-experiments” stemming from prior coverage expansions or
quirks in program design to study how health insurance affects physical
health outcomes. Quasi-experimental studies are more vulnerable to systematic biases than studies using randomized research designs, but they
can often draw on much larger samples and, thus, deliver much more
precise estimates. As discussed in the main text, well-designed studies of
this type have concluded that health insurance improves physical health
in a number of ways, including by reducing the risk of death.

this estimate implies that around 24,000 deaths are being avoided annually
because of the ACA.

Greater Financial Security
Another function of health insurance is to protect against the medical
costs associated with serious illness. As discussed above, one benefit of that
protection is that it allows sick individuals to obtain needed medical care. An
additional important benefit, however, is that it helps ensure that families do
not experience financial hardship due to illness, ranging from having to cut
back spending on other needs, to taking on debt, to failing to pay other bills
and thereby impairing their ability to get a loan in the future. 14
Research examining prior coverage expansions convincingly established that expanding health insurance coverage substantially improves
financial security. The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment found that
having Medicaid coverage virtually eliminated the risk of facing catastrophic
out-of-pocket medical costs (defined as medical costs in excess of 30 percent
of income) and sharply reduced the share of individuals reporting trouble
paying bills due to medical expenses (Baicker et al. 2013). Mazumder and
Miller (2016) examine the effects of Massachusetts health reform and document reductions in the amount of debt past due, the amount of debt in thirdparty collection, and the risk of bankruptcy, as well as improvements in
credit scores. Similarly, Gross and Notowidigdo (2011) document substantial reductions in bankruptcy risk due to Medicaid expansions during the
1990s and early 2000s, and Finkelstein and McKnight (2008) demonstrate
14 Medical costs are not the only financial consequence of serious illness. Dobkin et al. (2016)
document that non-elderly individuals experience large earnings losses after serious health
shocks, with the result that even insured individuals are at risk of financial hardship under
these circumstances. A progressive tax code and the safety net, which have been strengthened
by the ACA’s reforms to help low- and moderate-income families afford health insurance
coverage, play an important role in cushioning households against these types of shocks.

Reforming the Health Care System  |  231

that the introduction of Medicare led to large reductions in exposure to high
out-of-pocket medical costs among individuals over the age of 65.
Recent research indicates that the ACA’s major coverage provisions
are having similar beneficial effects on financial security. Research using
survey data show that the share of families reporting problems paying medical bills has fallen substantially since 2013, with particularly large reductions
for low- and moderate-income adults (Shartzer, Long, and Anderson 2016).
Studies using data from consumer credit reports to compare states that have
and have not expanded Medicaid found similar improvements in financial
security, including reductions in the amount of debt sent to a collection
agency and improvements in credit scores (Dussault, Pinkovskiy, and Zafar
2016; Hu et al. 2016). The magnitude of these improvements is substantial;
Hu et al. (2016) estimate that state Medicaid expansions reduce the amount
of debt sent to collection by between $600 and $1,000 per person gaining
coverage under expansion.

Lower Uncompensated Care Costs
While the most salient benefits of expanded insurance coverage
accrue to the newly insured, expanding insurance coverage also has implications for other participants in the health care system. Uninsured individuals
still receive some medical care, and when they do so, they are often unable
to pay for that care; Coughlin et al. (2014) estimated that health care providers delivered roughly $1,000 in uncompensated care per uninsured person
in 2013, costs that must then be borne either by the health care provider
itself or by some other entity. Correspondingly, recent research has emphasized that one important consequence of expanding insurance coverage is
to reduce the amount of uncompensated care that health care providers
deliver (Garthwaite, Gross, and Notowidigdo 2015; Finkelstein, Hendren,
and Luttmer 2015).
Recent trends provide strong evidence that the expansion in insurance
coverage driven by the Affordable Care Act is, as expected, driving substantial reductions in uncompensated care. Figure 4-14 uses data from hospitals’
cost reports to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to examine
trends in uncompensated care. Nationwide, these data show that uncompensated care fell by more than a quarter as a share of hospital expenses
from 2013 to 2015. Had uncompensated care as a share of hospital expenses
remained at its 2013 level, hospitals would have delivered an additional $10.4
billion of uncompensated care in 2015. The reductions in uncompensated
care since 2013 have been concentrated in Medicaid expansion states, likely
both because expansion states have seen larger coverage gains and because
the low-income uninsured individuals targeted by Medicaid expansion were

particularly likely to receive uncompensated care. In Medicaid expansion
states, uncompensated care as a share of hospital operating costs has fallen
by around half since 2013.
More detailed research using these hospital cost report data has
provided additional evidence that the Affordable Care Act’s coverage provisions, particularly Medicaid expansion, have driven substantial reductions
in uncompensated care. Dranove, Garthwaite, and Ody (2016) and Blavin
(2016) document similar aggregate trends in uncompensated care, including
differences in trends between expansion and non-expansion states. Dranove,
Garthwaite, and Ody (2016) also look at hospital-level trends in uncompensated care, finding that reductions in uncompensated care are larger for
hospitals located in areas that had larger numbers of individuals likely to
become eligible for Medicaid under Medicaid expansion.

Reduced Economic Disparities
The ACA’s coverage expansions have also substantially reduced economic inequality, as discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. Most directly,
the law has sharply narrowed differences in uninsured rates across population groups. As illustrated in Figure 4-15 below, the coverage gains from
2010 through 2015 have been broadly shared, with the uninsured rate falling
across all income, age, and race and ethnicity groups. Gains have also been
seen in both urban areas, defined here as counties included in a metropolitan
Reforming the Health Care System  |  233

statistical area (MSA), and rural areas, defined as counties outside an MSA.
However, the population groups that had the highest risk of being uninsured
in 2010 have seen the largest gains; in particular, gains have been larger for
younger adults than for older adults, larger for lower-income individuals
than higher-income individuals, and larger for racial and ethnic minorities
than for Whites.
The ACA has also helped to reduce income inequality. As discussed in
detail above, the ACA achieved its coverage expansion in part by providing
financial assistance to low- and moderate-income individuals who obtain
coverage through Medicaid and the Marketplaces. That financial assistance
has greatly boosted income for these households. Those coverage expansions were, in turn, financed in part through tax increases on higher-income
Americans. These and other ACA coverage provisions, together with
other tax policies enacted during the Obama Administration, are making
the income distribution in the United States considerably more equal, as
illustrated in Figure 4-16. Because of these policies, the share of after-tax
income received by the bottom fifth of income distribution will rise by 0.6
percentage point (18 percent), while the share of income received by the top
1 percent will fall by 1.2 percentage points (7 percent).

Continued Labor Market Recovery
Many critics of the Affordable Care Act argued that its coverage
expansions would seriously harm the labor market. While critics of the law
were not always explicit about how these harms would arise, some analysts
argued that the law’s provisions providing low- and moderate-income
people with affordable coverage options would reduce individuals’ incentive
to work, leading some people to leave the labor force or reduce their work
hours (such as Mulligan 2014a; Mulligan 2014b). These analysts also argued
that the ACA’s requirement that large employers offer health insurance
coverage to their full-time employees or pay a penalty would cause some
employers to shift workers from full-time status to part-time status.
Other analysts noted that the law’s coverage expansions had the
potential to drive important positive changes in individuals’ labor supply
decisions. Economists have long argued that the lack of good coverage
options for those who do not get coverage through the workplace can lead
to “job lock,” in which workers remain in a job that offers insurance coverage, despite the fact that their time and talents could be better employed
elsewhere (for example, Madrian 1994). The pre-ACA research literature
provided some empirical support for this view. Some research has suggested broader insurance coverage increases worker mobility and facilitates
appropriate risk-taking in the labor market (for example, Farooq and Kugler

facilitate entrepreneurship (Fairlie, Kapur, and Gates 2011; DeCicca 2010);
enable workers to invest in additional years of education (Dillender 2014);
or give workers additional flexibility in structuring their work lives, such as
by retiring when it makes sense for them or reducing their work hours in
order to have more time to care for a family member (for example, Heim
and Lin 2016).
Fully understanding how the ACA’s coverage expansions have
affected the labor market will require additional research, but it is already
quite clear that predictions of large reductions in total employment and large
increases in part-time employment have not come to pass. Implementation
of the ACA has occurred alongside the steady recovery of the labor market
from the Great Recession, as illustrated in Figure 4-17. The private sector started adding jobs in March 2010, the month the ACA became law,
and businesses have added a cumulative 15.6 million jobs since that time.
Private-sector employment has actually increased somewhat more quickly
since the ACA’s main coverage provisions took effect at the beginning of
2014 (around 209,000 jobs per month) than over the rest of the employment
expansion (around 181,000 jobs per month).
This time series evidence, particularly the fact that private-sector job
growth has actually been slightly faster after the ACA’s main coverage provisions took effect than before they took effect, is sufficient to demonstrate

that the ACA has not had the extreme negative effects on employment that
many critics predicted. However, more rigorous evidence on the ACA’s
effects on labor markets can be obtained by comparing labor market performance between states where the ACA’s coverage provisions were likely to
have had larger or smaller impacts. One crude indicator of the scope of the
effects of the ACA’s coverage provisions is simply the state’s uninsured rate
in 2013; consistent with this, it is a strong predictor of the magnitude of a
state’s coverage gains since 2013, as demonstrated in Figure 4-8. Comparing
states with higher and lower uninsured rates in 2013 can therefore provide
insight into the effect of the ACA’s coverage provisions on the labor market.
Another useful indicator is whether the state has expanded Medicaid, which
provides insight into the labor market effects of Medicaid expansion in
particular.
Figure 4-18 plots each state’s uninsured rate in 2013 against the
change from 2013 to 2015 in the share of working-age individuals who are

currently employed. 15 Contrary to what would have been expected if the
ACA’s coverage provisions had reduced employment, there is essentially
no correlation between a state’s uninsured rate in 2013 and its employment
gains from 2013 to 2015. Similarly, states that expanded their Medicaid programs actually saw slightly larger employment gains than those that did not
expand Medicaid (an increase in the working-age employment-population
of 1.5 percentage points in expansion states versus 1.3 percentage points in
non-expansion states). Several recent studies using related approaches have
similarly found no evidence that the ACA’s coverage provision have reduced
employment (Pinkovskiy 2015; Kaestner, Gangopadhyaya, and Fleming
2015; Leung and Mas 2016; Gooptu et al. 2016).
There is also no evidence that the ACA has driven the large-scale shift
to part-time work predicted by critics of the law. As with overall employment, time series evidence is sufficient to dismiss the strong claims made
by many of the ACA’s critics. As illustrated in Figure 4-19, since the ACA
became law in March 2010, the number of workers employed full time has
increased by 13.0 million, while the number of workers employed part-time
has been essentially flat. This was true during the years leading up to the
implementation of the ACA’s major coverage provisions in 2014, and it
continued to be true thereafter, contrary to claims that the ACA would usher
in a major shift to part-time work.
More rigorous cross-state comparisons also provide little evidence
that implementation of the ACA’s coverage provisions has meaningfully
reduced workers’ hours. Figure 4-20 plots each state’s uninsured rate in
2013 against the change in average weekly hours among workers ages 16
to 64. Contrary to what would have been expected if the ACA’s coverage
provisions had caused many workers to shift to part-time work or caused
firms to curtail hours, there is essentially no correlation between a state’s
uninsured rate in 2013 and the change in average hours worked from 2013
to 2015. Similarly, average hours worked has increased by about 0.2 hours
per week in both Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states, inconsistent with the view that Medicaid expansion has put substantial downward
pressure on worker hours. Outside estimates using a range of methodologies
similarly conclude that there is little evidence that the law has driven a major
15 An alternative, simpler approach would be to compare labor market outcomes across states
seeing larger and smaller declines in their uninsured rates. Comparisons of this type also
support the conclusion that the ACA has not negatively affected the labor market. However,
this approach has the disadvantage that improvements in labor market outcomes, whatever
their cause, are likely to drive reductions in the uninsured rate since many people who gain
jobs gain coverage at work. This could generate a spurious positive relationship between
coverage gains and employment gains. The approach taken in Figure 4-18 and Figure 4-20
avoids this problem.

shift toward part-time work, though some studies have found evidence of
small effects (Even and Macpherson 2015; Mathur, Slavov, and Strain 2016;
Moriya, Selden, and Simon 2016; Dillender, Heinrich, and Houseman 2016).

Long-Term Labor Market Benefits
The discussion above—like many discussions of the labor market
effects of the ACA’s coverage expansions—focuses on how the ACA might
directly affect the incentives of workers and firms in the short run. However,
there are also mechanisms through which the ACA’s coverage provisions
could have longer-run positive effects on labor market outcomes.
Most directly, by making workers healthier, the ACA may boost their
employment and earnings prospects. Indeed, as discussed above, evidence
from prior coverage expansions, together with early evidence on the effects
of the ACA, demonstrates that insurance coverage improves both mental
and physical health. Furthermore, a variety of evidence indicates that better
health improves both individuals’ ability to work and their productivity on
the job, which in turn leads to higher employment rates and higher earnings. Indeed, looking across individuals, healthier people have far higher
employment rates and earnings, as depicted in Figure 4-21. Moreover,
research has documented that adverse health shocks cause sharp reductions in employment and earnings, strongly implying that at least some of

240  |  Chapter 4

this cross-sectional relationship between health status and labor market
outcomes reflects the effect of health status on labor market outcomes,
rather than the effect of labor market outcomes on health status (Fadlon and
Nielsen 2015; Dobkin et al. 2016).
There is particularly compelling evidence that coverage gains for children improve educational attainment and earnings. Identifying such effects
is challenging because they are likely to appear only gradually over time.
However, a pair of recent studies has examined earlier expansions in insurance coverage for children through Medicaid and CHIP, using the fact that
different states expanded coverage at different times and to different extents.
Because some of these coverage expansions are now decades old, the authors
have been able to study their effects on long-term labor market outcomes.
These studies find important long-term labor market benefits from
expanded insurance coverage. Cohodes et al. (2015) find that having
Medicaid or CHIP coverage in childhood increases the likelihood of completing high school and college. Brown, Kowalski, and Lurie (2015) find
that female children with greater access to Medicaid or CHIP coverage in
childhood have higher educational attainment and higher earnings in early
adulthood. They also find evidence that both boys and girls with greater
access to Medicaid or CHIP in childhood pay more in income and payroll
taxes in their young adult years, potentially offsetting a substantial fraction of the cost of providing coverage to children. These results provide
direct evidence that the increases in children’s insurance coverage that have
occurred under this Administration will generate important long-term labor
market benefits and suggest that expanded coverage for adults could generate similar benefits.
The ACA has also strengthened the U.S. system of automatic stabilizers, programs that automatically expand during hard times and contract
during good ones, which will help to reduce the severity of future recessions.
The ACA’s coverage expansions help ensure that families facing job or
income losses during a recession retain access to affordable health insurance
options. Retaining access to affordable health insurance options safeguards
families’ ability to access health care and cushions their budgets, enabling
these families to better smooth their consumption of health care and other
necessities.
While these direct improvements in families’ economic security in the
face of recession are valuable on their own, they also have important macroeconomic benefits. By boosting consumption at the household level during
recessions, the ACA will increase aggregate demand for goods and services
at times when it would otherwise be impaired, increasing overall economic
output and helping to mitigate the severity of the recession itself. Moreover,

recent discussions of macroeconomic policy have suggested that changes in
the U.S. economy have increased the likelihood that monetary policy will
be constrained by the inability to cut nominal interest rates below the zero
bound in future recessions, increasing the importance of a strong system of
automatic stabilizers (Furman 2016).

Reforming the Health Care Delivery System
The United States has historically devoted a large fraction of its economic resources to delivering health care. In 2009, the year President Obama
took office, the United States spent 17.3 percent of GDP—$2.5 trillion—on
health care. That fraction had risen rapidly over time, having increased from
13.2 percent a decade earlier and just 5.0 percent in 1960, as illustrated in
Figure 4-22. Much of that spending on health care created substantial value.
Indeed, economic research has emphasized that much of the long-term rise
in health care spending results from the steady advance of medical technology and that the resulting improvements in length and quality of life have
historically been more than sufficient to justify the increase in spending
(Newhouse 1992; Cutler 2004). Nevertheless, evidence also demonstrated
that the U.S. health care delivery system suffered from serious inefficiencies
that drove up spending and undermined patients’ health. In light of the magnitude of the resources devoted to the health care system and the great value
of better health, this evidence suggested that reform could bring large gains.
This section of the chapter reviews the progress that has been made
under this Administration in reforming the health care delivery system. The
section begins by summarizing the evidence that the health care delivery
system has historically fallen short of its potential, and then describes the
reforms implemented under this Administration to address these shortcomings. Next, the section documents the slow growth in health care costs and
improvements in health care quality that have occurred as these reforms
have taken effect, and presents evidence that the reforms have, in fact, played
an important role in driving the positive trends of recent years. The section
closes by discussing the benefits that an improved health care delivery system will have for the United States economy in the years to come.

Health Care Costs and Quality Before the Affordable Care Act
A range of evidence indicates that the U.S. health care delivery system
has historically fallen short of its potential. One commonly cited piece of
evidence was how health care spending and outcomes in the United States
compared with those of its peer countries. The United States has historically been an extreme outlier in the share of GDP it devotes to health care,

as illustrated in Figure 4-23. In 2009, the share of GDP that the United
States devoted to health care was more than 80 percent higher than that of
the median member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) and nearly 50 percent higher than that of the next
highest OECD member. Due in part to challenges in obtaining comparable
data for the United States and other OECD countries, the reasons that
spending was so much higher in the United States are not fully understood.
However, research has generally concluded that the United States paid
higher prices for health care services—potentially reflecting the greater market power held by providers and insurers in the United States’ system—and
made greater use of costly, but not necessarily effective, medical technologies
and treatments (Anderson et al. 2003; Garber and Skinner 2008).16
The United States’ much-higher spending could have been justified if
the additional spending translated into better health care outcomes. In fact,
life expectancy was almost two years shorter in the United States than in the
median OECD country, and cross-county comparisons of various measures
of the quality of care, such as the risk of hospital-acquired infections, found
that the outcomes achieved in the United States were, at best, unremarkable
16 These two drivers of higher health care spending in the United States may, to some degree,
be related if providers’ ability to charge higher prices facilitates investment in costly medical
technologies.

(Drösler, Romano, and Wei 2009). In principle, this pattern could arise if
factors outside the health care delivery system, such as the United States’
high obesity rate and uniquely large share of people without health insurance, masked the large returns generated by the United States’ higher health
care spending. While these factors may have played some role in explaining
the United States’ poor performance, the sheer magnitude of the difference
in spending between the United States and its OECD peers made it unlikely
that this was a full explanation (Garber and Skinner 2008).
Patterns of health care spending and quality performance within the
United States provided additional evidence that the United States health care
delivery system suffered from serious inefficiencies. Research documented
that the amount Medicare spent per enrollee varied widely in the United
States, largely reflecting substantial differences in the quantity of care provided in different parts of the country (Fisher et al. 2003a). Other research
has documented a similarly large variation in spending among people covered through private insurance, with those in private insurance also seeing
wide variation in the prices paid for care in different markets in addition to
the quantity of care provided (Chernew et al. 2010; Philipson et al. 2010;
Cooper et al. 2015). As with cross-county comparisons, however, there was
little evidence that higher-spending areas achieved better health outcomes,

Reforming the Health Care System  |  245

suggesting that the additional spending in high-spending areas was unnecessary (Fisher et al. 2003b). Moreover, this research found that there was wide
variation in health outcomes among areas with similar levels of spending,
suggesting that there might be major opportunities to improve patient
outcomes, even while holding spending fixed. Figure 4-24 illustrates these
empirical patterns using data on spending and outcomes among Medicare
beneficiaries from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care.
One important advantage of comparing cost and quality among
different areas within the United States, as opposed to across countries, is
that much richer data are available. This greater data availability makes it
easier for researchers to have confidence that confounding factors were not
masking a positive relationship between spending and health outcomes. For
example, one possible explanation for the patterns in Figure 4-24 is that people in some areas of the country were in worse health, which led those areas
to spend more on health care, but masked any benefits of that additional
spending for health care outcomes. However, the research cited above found
that these patterns held after controlling for individual-level characteristics,
casting doubt on whether this could explain the observed patterns. More
recent research has examined people who move from one part of the country
to another and similarly concluded that much of the variation in spending
across areas reflects differences in how care is delivered in different areas,
not differences in the characteristics or preferences of people in different
places (Finkelstein, Gentzkow, and Williams 2016).
Aggregate data on patterns of care in the United States also suggested
that the delivery system was falling short of what a well-functioning delivery
system could be expected to achieve, driving up costs and leading to worse
outcomes for patients. Research examining individual patient encounters
with the health care system found that patients commonly failed to receive
care that was recommended under clinical guidelines, while also commonly
receiving care that was not recommended (McGlynn et al. 2003). Studies
similarly found evidence that care was often poorly coordinated, with
patients commonly receiving duplicate tests and different medical providers
responsible for a patient’s care often failing to communicate when a patient
transitioned from one care setting to another (Commonwealth Fund 2008).
Research also found that patients were often injured in avoidable ways when
seeking medical care, suffering harms ranging from medication errors, to
pressure sores, to infections (Institute of Medicine 1999). Others noted that
patients were often readmitted to the hospital soon after discharge, despite
evidence that these readmissions might be avoidable with better planning
for post-discharge or other changes in medical practice (MedPAC 2007;
Commonwealth Fund 2008).

Reforms to the Health Care Delivery System Under the Obama
Administration
In light of the compelling evidence that the health care delivery system
has historically fallen short of its potential, this Administration has implemented a comprehensive set of reforms, largely using tools provided by the
ACA, to make the health care delivery system more efficient and improve the
quality of care. These reforms fall in three main categories: better aligning
payments to medical providers and insurers in public programs with actual
costs; improving the structure of Medicare’s provider payment systems
to ensure that those systems reward providers who deliver efficient, highquality care, rather than simply a high quantity of care; and engaging private
insurers in a similar process of payment reform. Each of these reforms, as
well as its underlying economic logic, is discussed in detail below.

Aligning Public Program Payment Rates with Actual Costs
One way of reducing spending on health care is to ensure that the
amounts Medicare and other public programs pay for health care services
match the actual cost of delivering those services. Setting Medicare payment rates at an appropriate level has at least two major benefits. Most
directly, reductions in Medicare payment rates reduce costs for the Federal
Reforming the Health Care System  |  247

Government, which pays for the majority of care Medicare beneficiaries
receive, as well as for beneficiaries themselves, who pay the remaining costs
through premiums and cost sharing.17
Recent research implies that reductions in Medicare payment rates
can also generate savings for individuals enrolled in private insurance plans
by enabling private insurers to secure better rates from medical providers.18
Clemens and Gottlieb (forthcoming) study a past reform in Medicare’s payments to physicians that had different effects in different parts of the country. They find that when Medicare reduces its payment rate by one dollar,
private insurers reduce their payment rates for the same services by $1.12,
on average. White (2013) and White and Wu (2014) undertake a similar
analysis focused on Medicare payment to hospitals using variation in how
earlier Medicare payment reforms affected different hospitals. White (2013)
finds that when Medicare reduces its payment rates by one dollar, private
payers reduce their payment rates by $0.77. White and Wu (2014) find that
for each dollar Medicare saves in response to such a reform, other payers
realize savings of $0.55. These results run contrary to earlier conventional
wisdom that Medicare payment reductions generate offsetting “cost shifts”
to private payers that drive up the costs of private insurance.
The ACA made a range of changes designed to bring payment rates in
public programs more closely in line with the actual cost of delivering services. Two of these were particularly important due to their large size. First,
the ACA modified Medicare’s formula for updating payment rates to certain
medical providers to reflect an expectation that providers will improve their
productivity to a similar extent as the rest of the economy over the long run.
Previously, Medicare had updated payment rates for these providers based
solely on changes in the costs of the inputs they use to deliver care, without
accounting for improvements in productivity, an approach that caused payment rates to rise more quickly than the providers’ actual cost of delivering
health care services.
Second, the law addressed long-standing deficiencies in the system
used to pay Medicare Advantage plans that led to those plans being paid far
17 Many Medicare beneficiaries have supplemental coverage that pays for some or all of their
cost sharing. In some cases, they purchase this coverage individually and in other cases they
receive it from a former employer or a state Medicaid program. In these cases, cost-sharing
is ultimately financed by the entity paying for the supplemental coverage. Similarly, some
Medicare beneficiaries also have all or part of their premiums paid by another entity, typically
a state Medicaid program or a former employer.
18 The mechanism by which Medicare payment rates affect private payment rates remains
unclear. Clemens and Gottlieb (forthcoming) suggest that reducing Medicare’s payment rate
may strengthen private payers’ negotiating position, perhaps because it becomes less attractive
for a provider to walk away from the negotiation or because Medicare’s rates serve as a
benchmark for judging whether contract terms are reasonable.

248  |  Chapter 4

more to cover Medicare patients than it would have cost to cover the same
patient in traditional Medicare (MedPAC 2009). To do so, the ACA phased
in changes to the “benchmarks” used to determine payments to Medicare
Advantage plans. These provisions have taken effect without adverse effects
on the premiums or availability of Medicare Advantage plans, consistent
with the view that pre-ACA payment rates were excessive. Access to
Medicare Advantage plans remains essentially universal among Medicare
beneficiaries, and the share of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a Medicare
Advantage plan has risen from 24 percent in 2010 to a projected 32 percent
in 2017, while average premiums are estimated to have fallen by 13 percent
from 2010 through 2017 (CMS 2016b).

Reforming the Structure of Medicare’s Payment Systems
A second approach to increasing the value produced by the health
care delivery system is to improve the structure of the payment systems that
public health care programs and private insurers use to pay medical providers. Historically, the U.S. health care system has been dominated by “fee-forservice” payment systems in which medical providers are paid separately for
each individual service they deliver, like an office visit, a diagnostic test, or
a hospital stay.
Fee-for-service payment undermines the efficiency and quality of
patient care in three important ways. First, fee-for-service payment encourages providers to deliver more services than necessary since each additional
service translates into additional revenue. Second, fee-for-service payment
encourages providers to deliver the wrong mix of services. In a system with
payment rates for thousands of different services, payment rates for some
services will inevitably end up being set too high relative to the underlying cost of some services and too low for others, biasing care toward those
services that happen to be particularly profitable, whether or not those
services create the most value for patients. Third, fee-for-service payment
fails to reward providers who improve health outcomes because payment is
completely independent of the outcomes they achieve for their patients.19
The perverse short-run incentives created by fee-for-service payment
may also distort the long-run trajectory of medical technology. Because
of the shortcomings catalogued above, fee-for-service payment tends to
encourage widespread use of resource-intensive new technologies, even if
they generate modest health benefits, while often failing to ensure equally
widespread use of less resource-intensive new technologies that generate
19 While health care professionals have other reasons to deliver high-quality care, including
their concern for their patients’ well-being and their desire to attract and retain patients, the
evidence summarized earlier demonstrates that this was not always sufficient to ensure that all
patients received high-quality care.

Reforming the Health Care System  |  249

large health benefits. When deciding what new technologies to develop,
potential innovators and investors are likely to favor technologies that they
expect to have a larger market, causing them to focus more on the former
type of technology than the latter. Over time, this bias may lead to larger
increases in health care spending and smaller improvements in health
outcomes than would occur under a payment system that rewards efficient,
high-quality care.
Largely using tools provided by the ACA, the Administration has
implemented two types of reforms in the Medicare program designed to
address the shortcomings of fee-for-service payment. The first was targeted
improvements to existing fee-for-service payment systems to encourage
more efficient, higher-quality care, which have the important advantage that
they can be implemented quickly at scale. The second was setting in motion
a longer-term shift away from fee-for-service payment and toward alternative payment models (APMs) that pay providers based on overall cost and
quality of the care they deliver, rather than the numbers and types of services
they provide. In addition, to facilitate continuous learning and progress
along both of these tracks, the ACA created the Center for Medicare and
Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) to develop and test innovative new payment
models. Importantly, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has the
authority to expand a payment model tested through CMMI nationwide if
the model is determined to reduce spending without harming quality of care
or to improve quality of care without increasing spending.
Targeted Reforms to Fee-For-Service Payment Systems
This Administration has implemented a range of targeted improvements to existing fee-for-service payment systems. One such improvement
is greater use of “value-based” payment systems, which adjust providers’ feefor-service payment amounts upward or downward according to how they
perform on measures of the quality or efficiency of care. For hospitals, the
ACA introduced value-based payment incentives aimed at encouraging hospitals to reduce their hospital readmission rates and their hospital-acquired
infection rates. The ACA also introduced broader value-based payment
programs for physicians and hospitals that reward providers that perform
well across a broad array of quality and efficiency measures. More recently,
CMMI began testing a value-based payment system for home health care
services, and the bipartisan Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization
Act (MACRA) introduced a new value-based payment system for physician
services that will consolidate existing value-based payment programs for
physicians into a single program starting in 2017.
Another type of improvement is beginning to pay providers to deliver
high-value services for which payment was not previously available. For
250  |  Chapter 4

example, through CMMI, the Administration tested the Medicare Diabetes
Prevention Program (MDPP), which provides coaching aimed at helping
participants transition to a healthier lifestyle and lose weight. The evaluation of this initiative demonstrated that MDPP both reduced spending and
improved quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries, and the Chief Actuary
of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has certified that
expanding the initiative would not increase Medicare spending (RTI 2016;
Spitalnic 2016; HHS 2016a). On this basis, CMS is now taking steps to begin
paying providers to deliver MDPP services to eligible Medicare beneficiaries
nationwide starting in 2018. The Administration has also used various
pre-ACA authorities to begin covering other high-value services under
Medicare in recent years, such as care management services for individuals
with chronic diseases and care planning services for patients with cognitive
impairments like Alzheimer’s disease or dementia.
Development and Deployment of Alternative Payment Models
Most important for the long term, the Administration has also
made substantial progress in deploying APMs that reorient payment to be
based upon the overall cost and quality of the care providers deliver. The
Administration has tested and deployed a range of different types of APMs
in Medicare. Two particularly important types of APMs are bundled payment models and accountable care organization (ACO) payment models,
each of which is discussed in greater detail below.
Under bundled payment models, sometimes called episode payment
models, Medicare makes a single payment for all care involved in a clinical
episode, rather than paying for each of those services separately.20 Bundled
payment models use a range of different approaches to define clinical episodes, but they generally start when a specified triggering event occurs and
then continue for a follow-up period. For example, in a bundled payment
model CMMI is currently testing for hip and knee replacement, the episode
begins when the patient is admitted to the hospital for surgery and continues
through 90 days after discharge. The bundled payment covers all the health
care services the patient receives during that time, including the initial hospital admission, the surgeon’s services, post-discharge home health services,
20 Some bundled payment models literally make a single payment for the episode and rely on
the providers involved in the patient’s care to split that payment among themselves. However,
most bundled payment models being tested by CMMI instead pay for care on a fee-for-service
basis during the episode, and then “reconcile” these payments after the fact. If fee-for-service
spending falls below the episode price, CMS makes a payment to the provider equal to the
savings, while if the fee-for-service spending exceeds the episode price, the provider makes
a corresponding payment to CMS. Either approach to bundled payment creates similar
incentives.

and any other services associated with the patient’s recovery, including those
triggered by complications.
Making a single payment for this broad array of services associated
with an episode allows providers to deliver the most appropriate combination of services to patients, without regard to how those individual services
are compensated, creating opportunities to improve the efficiency and
quality of care. Many bundled payment models further encourage quality
improvement by providing a higher payment per episode to providers who
perform well on specified measures of care quality. Medicare captures a portion of the savings generated by more efficient care by setting the bundled
payment amount at a discount relative to the costs historically associated
with each type of clinical episode.
CMMI is testing several different types of bundled payment models.
Through the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative, CMMI is
testing bundled payments for 48 different clinical episodes, and this model
has attracted nearly 1,500 participating provider organizations across the
country as of the middle of 2016. Similarly, CMMI is testing bundled payment for the full scope of care provided to beneficiaries receiving chemotherapy through the Oncology Care Model, which has enrolled 194 oncology
practices from markets across the country. CMMI has also begun tests of
bundled payment models that include all providers in randomly selected
metropolitan areas. Specifically, CMMI began this type of test of a bundled
payment model for hip and knee replacement in 67 metropolitan statistical areas across the country in early 2016 and recently proposed a similar
approach to testing bundled payment for additional orthopedic procedures
and certain types of cardiac care.
Testing models on a geographic basis, as these new bundled payment
models do, has two important advantages relative to other approaches. First,
randomly selecting metropolitan areas to participate in the model ensures
that participants will not differ systematically from non-participants, allowing the test to deliver particularly compelling evidence on how the model
affects the efficiency and quality of care. Second, participation by all providers in the randomly-selected geographic areas allows the test to provide evidence on how the model would perform if it were expanded program-wide;
evidence from tests that allow each individual provider to opt in or out of
the model are much more challenging to generalize in this fashion. In light
of these advantages, CBO recently noted that CMMI’s ability to conduct
geographically based tests is an important reason that CBO projects CMMI
to generate substantial savings for the Medicare program (Hadley 2016).
A second major category of APM deployed under this Administration
are ACO models, which go a step further than episode payment models and
252  |  Chapter 4

orient payment around the entirety of the care a patient receives during the
year, rather than just the care delivered during a particular episode of care.
Under an ACO model, a group of providers join together and agree to be
held accountable for the overall cost and quality of the care their patients
receive during a year. ACOs that reduce average per beneficiary spending
below a “benchmark” level share a portion of the savings, giving providers
a strong incentive to deliver care more efficiently. (Certain ACO models are
“two-sided,” meaning that providers also agree to repay a portion of any
spending in excess of the benchmark.) ACOs that perform well on a suite of
measures of the quality of the care they deliver are eligible for larger financial
rewards, giving them a strong incentive to deliver high-quality care and a
corresponding disincentive to limit access to necessary care.
ACOs are now widespread in the Medicare program. As of January
2016, 8.9 million traditional Medicare beneficiaries—nearly a quarter of
the total—were receiving care through more than 470 ACOs, as illustrated
in Figure 4-25. The substantial majority of these beneficiaries are aligned
with ACOs operating under the Medicare Shared Savings Program, the
permanent ACO program created under the ACA. A smaller number are
participating in ACO models being tested by CMMI that aim to improve
upon existing ACO models in a range of ways. These CMMI ACO models
include: the Next Generation ACO; the Comprehensive ESRD Care Model,
which aims to improve outcomes for patients with a particular high cost,
high risk condition; and the ACO Investment Model, which supports the
participation of small practices or practices in rural areas. Notably, an earlier
CMMI ACO model—the Pioneer ACO model—became the first model to
meet the criteria for expansion under the Secretary’s expansion authority
(L&M Policy Research 2015; Spitalnic 2015; HHS 2015). Features of the
Pioneer ACO model have now been incorporated into the Medicare Shared
Savings Program on a permanent basis.
Through CMMI, the Administration has also tested a range of other
innovative payment approaches in addition to bundled payments and
ACOs. For example, CMMI is testing medical home models that provide
additional resources to primary care practices that agree to engage in a set
of specified activities, including care management and care coordination
activities, and to be held financially accountable for the cost and quality of
the care their patients receive. CMMI began its first major test of medical
homes through the Comprehensive Primary Care Initiative, which began
operating in October 2012; currently, there are 442 participating practices
in seven states. In early 2016, CMMI announced an improved medical home
initiative, known as the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus model, which
will begin operating in 16 states in January 2017. In collaboration with the

states of Maryland and Vermont, CMMI is also testing statewide all-payer
initiatives aimed at making comprehensive changes in how providers in
those states deliver care.
In light of the potential of APMs to improve the performance of the
health care delivery system, the Administration set the goal of having 30
percent of traditional Medicare payments flowing through APMs by the end
of 2016, up from essentially none before the ACA. As illustrated in Figure
4-26, CMS estimates that this goal was reached ahead of schedule in early
2016. The Administration has set the goal of having at least 50 percent of
traditional Medicare payments flowing through APMs by the end of 2018.
Provisions included in the bipartisan MACRA will help accelerate
the Administration’s efforts to deploy APMs in Medicare. Under the law,
physicians who provide a sufficiently large fraction of their care through
“advanced” APMs will receive a bonus payment equal to 5 percent of their
annual Medicare revenue. Advanced APMs are a category that includes
most of CMS’ most ambitious APMs, including the two-sided ACO models operating through the Medicare Shared Savings Program and CMMI,
several of CMMI’s bundled payment models, and the new Comprehensive
Primary Care Plus medical home model. Additionally, CMS has committed

to developing new models that qualify as advanced APMs as well to revising
some existing models to meet the advanced APM criteria.

Engaging the Private Sector in Payment Reform
Reforming payment systems in Medicare is an important step, as
Medicare accounts for around a quarter of all health care spending in the
United States. However, more than half of Americans receive coverage
through private insurers, which have also historically relied upon fee-forservice payment systems. Ensuring that all Americans receive efficient, highquality care therefore requires improving private insurers’ provider payment
systems as well. In light of the substantial shortcomings of fee-for-service
payment systems, it may seem puzzling that private insurers had not already
done so. But insurers faced two major barriers: a serious collective action
problem and poor incentives created by the tax treatment of employersponsored health insurance coverage.
A collective action problem exists because developing and deploying
new payment models is a costly endeavor, requiring significant investments
by both payers and providers, but, as described below, many of the benefits
of investments made by any individual actor accrue to its competitors. As a
result, each individual payer’s return to investing in new payment methods

Reforming the Health Care System  |  255

is far below the overall return to the health care sector, leading private payers
to substantially underinvest in new payment approaches.
The benefits of one payer’s investment in alternative approaches to
provider payment spill over to other payers in two important ways. First,
once new approaches to payment have been developed and providers have
been induced to make the investments needed to deploy them, other payers can adopt those same payment structures at lower cost, but still realize
the resulting benefits for the efficiency and quality of care. Largely for this
reason, private payers have often elected to base their payment systems on
Medicare’s payment systems, at least in part (Ginsburg 2010). Private payers typically set payment rates for physicians by starting with the Medicare
physician fee schedule rates and increasing them by a specified percentage.
Consistent with this, recent research has documented that when Medicare
changes the relative amount it pays for different types of physician services,
private payers follow suit, at least on average (Clemens and Gottlieb forthcoming). For hospital services, there is far more diversity in the methods
used, though Medicare’s payment systems are a common starting point
(Ginsburg 2010).
A second reason spillovers occur is that medical providers often apply
a common “practice style” across all of their patients, so changes made in
response to payment changes implemented by one payer often affect patients
covered by other payers as well. For example, research examining the diffusion of managed care in the 1990s found that increases in the prevalence of
managed care in an area led to changes in treatment patterns for patients in
non-managed policies as well (Glied and Zivin 2002). Research has found
similar effects for the Alternative Quality Contract (AQC), an ACO-like
contract that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts has been experimenting with since 2009. McWilliams, Landon, and Chernew (2013) report that
patients who were treated by AQC-participating providers, but who were
not covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, also benefited from
lower costs and improved quality along some dimensions.
The Administration has taken several steps to overcome this collective action problem. The Administration’s aggressive efforts to improve
Medicare’s payment systems, described in detail in the previous section,
are one particularly important step. As discussed above, private payers
often pattern their payment systems after Medicare’s payment systems, so
transforming payment in Medicare can facilitate improvements in private
payment systems. The resulting trends in private payment approaches have
been encouraging. For example, recent years have seen rapid growth in private ACO contracts alongside the growth in Medicare ACO contracts, and
about 17 million—or roughly one in ten—private insurance enrollees were
256  |  Chapter 4

covered under ACO contracts at the beginning of 2016, up from virtually
none as recently as 2011 (Muhlestein and McClellan 2016). Looking across
all types of APMs, a recent survey of private insurers estimated that approximately one in four claims dollars paid by private insurers flowed through an
APM during calendar year 2015 (HCPLAN 2016).
The Administration has also taken a range of steps to directly
overcome the collective action problem described above by facilitating collaboration across payers in developing innovative payment models. The
Administration created the Health Care Payment Learning and Action
Network in 2015, a forum in which providers and payers can share best
practices on how to design and deploy new payment methods. Similarly, in
partnership with the members of the Core Quality Measure Collaborative,
a group that includes representatives of payers, providers, and consumers,
CMS released agreed-upon quality measures for six major medical specialties as well as for ACO and medical home models in early 2016. CMMI has
also directly included private payers in many of its model tests. For example,
the medical home interventions being tested through the Comprehensive
Primary Care initiatives is being implemented in parallel by CMS and other
payers in each of the test markets, and the all-payer models now being tested
in Maryland and Vermont involve multiple payers by definition.
These steps to facilitate collaboration across payers may have benefits
in addition to resolving a collective action problem. Notably, these efforts
have the potential to reduce the administrative costs to providers of participating in APMs. Reducing administrative costs is valuable in their own
right, but may also facilitate more rapid diffusion of these models. Aligning
incentives across payers may also make APMs more effective by ensuring
that providers do not face conflicting incentives from different payers.
In addition to the collective action problem discussed above, the
tax treatment of employer-sponsored health insurance coverage has been
a second important barrier to the adoption of better payment methods in
the private sector. In particular, employees pay income and payroll taxes
on compensation provided in the form of wages and salaries, but not on
compensation provided in the form of health care benefits. As discussed
earlier in this chapter, this treatment means that the Federal Government
provides an implicit subsidy of around 35 cents on the dollar to compensation provided in the form of health benefits that it does not provide to other
forms of compensation.
As also discussed earlier in this chapter, this subsidy plays a useful role
in helping make coverage affordable for many families, but it also distorts
employers’ incentives. Because the Federal Government subsidizes each
additional dollar of health benefits, employers have a strong incentive to
Reforming the Health Care System  |  257

provide excessively costly and inefficient health plans. This in turn undermines the business case for payers to make the plans they offer employers
more efficient, including by adopting new approaches to provider payment
developed in the public sector and making their own investments in better
benefit designs and better approaches to provider payment.
The ACA addressed this problem by including an excise tax on highcost employer-sponsored coverage. The tax, currently scheduled to take
effect in 2020, will levy a 40-percent tax on employer plan costs in excess
of about $29,000 for family coverage and about $10,700 for single coverage.
Plans with higher costs due to factors such as the age-sex mix of their enrollment or the industry in which their enrollees work are eligible for higher
thresholds. The tax applies only to the portion of plan costs in excess of the
threshold; for example, a family plan with a cost of $29,100 in 2020 would
pay just $40 in tax. For these very high-cost plans, this structure counteracts
the perverse incentives to offer overly generous coverage that existed under
pre-ACA law, while preserving strong incentives for employers to offer
appropriate coverage. The Treasury Department estimates that 7 percent of
enrollment in employer-sponsored coverage and around 1 percent of plan
costs will be affected when the tax takes effect in 2020.
The most direct effects of the tax will be on enrollees in the high-cost
plans affected by the tax. As their employers take steps to make their plans
more efficient, workers at these firms will see lower premiums and correspondingly higher wages, which Congressional Budget Office and Joint
Committee on Taxation estimates imply will be around $43 billion in 2026
alone.21 However, the benefits of this reform are likely to be felt throughout
the health care system, not just by enrollees in highly inefficient plans. Just
as improvements in Medicare’s payment systems generate spillover benefits
for the rest of the health care system, payment innovations adopted by inefficient plans are likely to generate benefits for enrollees in many different
types of coverage. Similarly, the excise tax on high-cost coverage will encourage plans and employers to engage in more aggressive price negotiation
with medical providers. By weakening the bargaining position of providers
relative to plans, the excise tax will help plans not directly affected by the tax
secure lower prices for their enrollees (Baker, Bundorf, and Kessler 2015).
21 This estimate was derived from an August 2016 estimate by the Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) and Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) that repealing the excise tax would increase the
deficit by $20 billion in 2026 (CBO 2016a). CBO/JCT assume that roughly three-quarters of the
fiscal effects of the tax arises from the increase in payroll and income tax revenue as workers’
wages rise (CBO 2015a). Calculations based on tables published by the Urban-Brookings Tax
Policy Center imply that the average marginal tax rate on labor income for individuals with
employer coverage is around 35 percent (see Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center Tables T130253 and T14-0091). Combining these estimates implies an increase in wage and salary income
of $43 billion (=[$21 billion * 0.75]/0.35).

258  |  Chapter 4

Additional Steps to Reform the Health Care Delivery System
This Administration has also taken a range of other steps to reform the
health care delivery system that complement the provider payment reforms
discussed in the rest of this section. One such effort aimed to accelerate the
deployment of health information technology (IT). Studies of health IT
adoption have found positive impacts on the quality and efficiency of patient
care (Buntin et al. 2011; Shekelle et al. 2015). For example, numerous studies
provide evidence that computerized physician order entry systems, which
can alert doctors to possible medication allergies or dosing errors, prevent
adverse drug events (Jones et al. 2014; Shamliyan et al. 2008).
To spur greater use of health IT, the Health Information Technology
for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 created financial
incentives for Medicare and Medicaid providers to adopt and make “meaningful use” of electronic health records (EHR). More recently, MACRA
updated the HITECH incentives for physicians to use health IT and integrated them into Medicare’s core physician payment system. Providers
participating in the value-based payment system for physicians established
under MACRA will be scored, in part, on their use of EHRs to improve the
quality of patient care. MACRA also incorporates the use of certified EHRs
(EHRs that meet certain criteria for capturing and sharing patient data) into
the determination of whether a payment model qualifies as an advanced
APM and thereby qualifies participating physicians for the bonus payments
described in the last section.
Recent years have seen substantial progress in deploying EHRs. As
illustrated in Figure 4-27, 84 percent of non-Federal acute care hospitals had
adopted a basic EHR (an EHR that can perform a certain set of core functions) as of 2015, up from just 16 percent in 2010. An even greater share of
hospitals possessed at least a certified EHR system. EHR use has also become
common among office-based physicians. In 2015, 78 percent of office-based
physicians had an EHR and more than a third had used their EHR system
to transmit patient health information to external providers (Jamoom and
Yang 2016). Focusing on hospitals, Dranove et al. (2015) found evidence
that the HITECH payment incentives had accelerated EHR adoption.
This Administration has also taken steps to improve the availability
of information on how cost and quality performance vary across medical
providers to help consumers, employers, and others make better-informed
choices about where to obtain care. For example, the Qualified Entity program, which was created by the ACA and expanded by MACRA, allows
organizations that agree to abide by rigorous privacy and security requirements to use Medicare claims data to create public reports comparing the
performance of different medical providers. CMS has also improved and

expanded the websites it operates to deliver information on provider performance directly to consumers; these websites now include information
on performance by hospitals, nursing homes, physicians, dialysis facilities,
home health providers, and Medicare Advantage and Part D prescription
drug plans. Additionally, CMS has begun releasing versions of Medicare’s
claims databases that have been stripped of beneficiary-identifying information as public use files. The availability of public use files can help researchers better understand patterns of care in the Medicare program in order
to evaluate the effectiveness of ongoing delivery system reform efforts and
develop new approaches to delivery system reform.
The ACA also created a streamlined process for implementing needed
changes to Medicare’s payment systems in the future. In detail, it established
an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) of 15 voting members
appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. If growth in
Medicare spending per beneficiary is projected to exceed a target growth
rate over a five-year period, IPAB is charged with recommending improvements in how Medicare pays providers to reduce Medicare spending growth;
IPAB is not permitted to recommend changes to Medicare’s benefit design,
including premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance. The Secretary of Health
and Human Services then implements IPAB’s recommendations unless

260  |  Chapter 4

legislation that overrides the recommendations is enacted. Over the long
run, the target growth rate for IPAB is the growth rate of per capita GDP
plus 1 percentage point. However, a more stringent target was set for years
through 2017: the average of projected growth in the overall Consumer Price
Index (CPI) and the CPI for medical care. Because of the exceptionally slow
growth in Medicare spending since the ACA became law, which is discussed
in greater detail in the next section, IPAB has not yet been called upon to
make recommendations despite this stringent target.

Recent Trends in Health Care Costs and Quality
As the reforms described in the last section have taken effect, the
United States has seen exceptionally slow growth in health care costs, as
well as promising improvements in the quality of care patients receive. This
progress has been seen in every part of the health care system, including
both public insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid and private
coverage. While the factors driving these encouraging trends are not fully
understood, there is clear evidence that the reforms introduced in the ACA,
together with other actions taken by this Administration, are playing an
important role. This section of the chapter provides a detailed description of
recent trends in health care costs and quality, as well as what is known about
the causes of these trends.

Recent Trends in Health Care Costs
Economists commonly focus on three distinct measures of health
care costs: unit prices; per enrollee spending; and aggregate spending. Unit
prices are the amounts paid for a single unit of a health care good or service,
such as a physician visit, a hospital admission, or a dose of medicine. Lower
unit prices, holding quality fixed, are unambiguously good for consumers
because they allow consumers to purchase the same medical care for less
money, leaving more money to purchase other valued goods and services.
Per enrollee spending refers to the average health care spending per
person enrolled in insurance coverage and is determined by both the unit
prices of health care and the average quantity of services used by enrollees.
Per enrollee spending is what ultimately determines what consumers pay
in the form of premiums and cost sharing. Slower growth in per enrollee
spending that reflects slower growth in health care prices is unambiguously
good for consumers, for the reasons described above. Slower growth in per
enrollee spending that reflects slower growth in utilization of services will
often benefit consumers as well, provided that slow growth is achieved without worsening the quality of care.

Reforming the Health Care System  |  261

Aggregate spending refers to the total amount the country spends
on health care and is influenced by both spending per individual enrolled
in coverage and the number of individuals enrolled in coverage. Faster
growth in aggregate spending can be a negative development if it reflects
faster growth in per enrollee spending that is not justified by concomitant
improvements in quality. However, it can also be a positive development
if, for example, it reflects improvements in access to care due to expanded
health insurance coverage. Aggregate spending is not directly relevant to
consumers.
Recent trends in each of these measures are examined below.
Health Care Prices
The period since the ACA became law has seen exceptionally slow
growth in health care prices, as depicted in Figure 4-28. From March 2010
through October 2016, prices of health care goods and services have risen at
an annual rate of 1.7 percent, far below the 3.2-percent annual rate seen over
the preceding decade and even farther below the 5.4-percent annual rate
over the preceding 50 years.22 In fact, the rate of health care price inflation
since the ACA became law has been slower than over any prior period of
comparable length since these data began in 1959.
The slow growth in health care prices in recent years is not merely
a reflection of slow inflation throughout the economy. Rather, the rate of
increase in health care prices has been unusually low relative to the rate
of increase in prices overall. Indeed, as depicted in Figure 4-29, the rate of
increase in health care prices has exceeded the rate of overall inflation by just
0.2 percentage point since the ACA became law, whereas the rate of increase
in health care prices exceeded overall inflation by 1 percentage point or more
in both the recent and longer-term past.
Health care prices have grown slowly in both of the two largest categories of health care spending: hospital and skilled nursing facility (SNF)
services and outpatient services. Real prices for outpatient services have
actually fallen during the post-ACA period, while real prices for hospital and
SNF services have barely risen. The one important exception to this pattern
22 The price index for health care goods and services reported here was derived from Personal
Consumption (PCE) Expenditures data produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Price indices for the outpatient services, hospital and nursing home services, pharmaceutical
products, other medical products, therapeutic appliances and equipment, and net health
insurance categories were combined to construct a Fisher index for the aggregate. The Bureau
of Labor Statistics also reports data on health care prices as part of the Consumer Price Index
(CPI). This chapter relies on the PCE price indices because they endeavor to measure trends in
health care prices throughout the economy, whereas the CPI encompasses a more limited set of
transactions. Both series, however, show broadly similar trends in health care prices.

is pharmaceutical prices, which have grown somewhat faster post-ACA than
they have historically.
For most categories of services, data limitations make it challenging to separately examine the prices paid by private insurance, Medicare,
and Medicaid. One important exception, however, is services provided by
general medical and surgical hospitals, which deliver the overwhelming
majority of hospital services and account for around a third of total health
care spending. As depicted in Figure 4-30, growth in prices paid to these
hospitals has been sharply lower during the post-ACA period for all three
payer categories, with a particularly large slowdown for services provided to
Medicare beneficiaries.
Per Enrollee Health Care Spending
The period since the ACA became law has also seen exceptionally slow
growth in overall per enrollee health care spending, as illustrated in Figure

4-31.23 Real per enrollee spending in private insurance has risen at an average rate of just 1.5 percent per year during the post-ACA period, well below
the pace recorded over either the five-year period that immediately preceded
the ACA or the five-year period before that. Medicare spending has followed
a similar pattern, with real Medicare spending per enrollee actually falling at
an average annual rate of 0.3 percent per year during the post-ACA period.
(Per enrollee spending growth in Medicaid has also fallen during the postACA period, although these trends are more complicated to interpret due
to significant compositional changes in the types of individuals enrolled in
Medicaid during both the pre-ACA and post-ACA periods.)
Per enrollee spending growth has slowed markedly across all major
service categories, including hospital services, physician services, and prescription drugs, as illustrated in Figure 4-32. Notably, where comparable
data are available, the decline in real per enrollee spending growth exceeds
the decline in the growth of real health care prices described previously,
indicating that much of the decline in per enrollee spending growth reflects
slower growth in the utilization of health care services. For example, the

Accounts reflect only the payments made by the insurer. They do not include amounts borne

not change the main conclusions reached here.

average growth rate of real per enrollee private insurance spending on hospital services has been 3.3 percentage points lower in the post-ACA period
than over the pre-ACA decade, whereas the growth rate of the prices private
insurers pay for hospital care has declined by only 0.8 percentage point over
the same period.24 Similarly, real per enrollee Medicare spending on hospital
services has fallen by 3.4 percentage points from the pre-ACA decade to the
post-ACA period, while the growth rate of the real prices Medicare pays for
hospital services has declined by only 2.5 percentage points.
Figures 4-31 and 4-32 extend only through 2015 because they rely
upon data from the National Health Expenditure Accounts, which only
report annual data. However, timely indicators of per enrollee health care
spending indicate that spending growth has remained low into 2016, as illustrated in Figure 4-33. CEA analysis of data on Medicare spending published
by the Treasury Department indicates that growth in Medicare spending
per beneficiary for the first 10 months of 2016 was roughly in line with 2015
and well below longer-term historical experience. Similarly, data from the
annual Employer Health Benefits Survey conducted by the Kaiser Family
Foundation and Health Research and Educational Trust’s (KFF/HRET)
indicate that growth in employer premiums remained near its post-2010
lows in 2016.
Trends in employer coverage merit particularly detailed attention
since well more than half of non-elderly Americans get coverage through an
employer. As illustrated in Figure 4-34, slow growth in underlying medical
costs has translated into slow growth in the premiums of employer plans,
with real premium growth dropping from an average annual rate of 5.6
percent in the pre-ACA period to an average annual rate of 3.1 percent
since the ACA became law. Notably, growth in the portion of the premium
paid directly by the worker has fallen by more than growth in the total
premium. While economists generally believe that the total premium is the
more relevant measure of the overall premium burden because workers ultimately pay for the employer’s contribution to premiums indirectly through
lower wages, workers’ direct contributions may be particularly salient to
individuals.
In principle, trends in premiums could be a misleading indicator of
the overall trend in the health costs for individuals with employer coverage
if the share of spending that enrollees bear in the form of out-of-pocket costs
like coinsurance, copayments, and deductibles is changing over time. As
24 This estimate of the slowdown in growth of real hospital prices differs modestly from what
is reported in Figure 4-28. This is because, to align with the estimates reported in Figure 4-31,
this calculation reflects the 2010–2015 period rather than the March 2010–March 2016 time
period and uses the GDP price index, rather than the PCE price index, to adjust for inflation.

discussed in greater detail in the next subsection of this chapter, there is no
evidence that out-of-pocket spending obligations have risen more quickly
during the post-ACA period than the preceding years. Indeed, the rightmost
columns of Figure 4-34 combine the KFF/HRET data on premiums with
data on the out-of-pocket share in employer coverage from the Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey’s Household Component. If anything, accounting for out-of-pocket costs makes the decline in cost growth for individuals
enrolled in employer coverage look slightly larger. While the extent to which
incorporating data on out-of-pocket costs magnifies the slowdown in cost
growth in employer coverage is somewhat sensitive to which data source
is used to measure out-of-pocket costs, the core finding appears relatively
robust.
Aggregate Health Care Spending
Driven by the very slow growth in per enrollee health care spending
documented above, the years immediately after 2010 saw exceptionally slow
growth in aggregate national health expenditures, with 2011, 2012, and 2013
seeing the slowest growth rates in real per capita national health expenditures on record, as shown in Figure 4-35. Growth in aggregate national
health expenditures increased in 2014 and 2015, driven in large part by the
historic expansion in health insurance coverage that began in 2014.

Indeed, Holahan and McMorrow (2015) estimate that the expansion in insurance coverage added between 1.4 percentage points and 2.1
percentage points to the growth of national health expenditures in 2014.
This implies that, absent the expansion in coverage, 2014 would have been
another year of historically slow growth in aggregate health care spending,
falling somewhere between the slowest and third-slowest year on record.
The coverage gains that occurred during 2015 were almost as large as those
occurring during 2014, and some of the upward pressure on spending
growth from coverage gains during 2014 may have appeared during 2015,
so expanding coverage likely placed a similar degree of upward pressure on
aggregate spending growth in 2015. Without this upward pressure, real per
capita spending growth would have been around 2 percent in 2015, also near
the bottom of historical experience.
Furthermore, as noted earlier, faster growth in aggregate health care
spending due to expanding coverage is not a cause for concern. Faster aggregate spending growth is the expected consequence of the major improvements in access to care that have occurred as coverage has expanded and
does not indicate that costs are rising more quickly for individuals who
are already covered. Moreover, faster growth in aggregate spending due
to expanding coverage will be temporary, continuing only until insurance
coverage stabilizes at its new higher level. Consistent with that expectation,
more timely data on health care spending from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis suggest that aggregate health care spending growth has begun to
moderate in recent months as the pace of coverage gains has slowed.

Understanding the Recent Slow Growth in Health Care Costs
An important question is what has caused the very slow growth in
health care costs under the ACA. Broader economic and demographic
trends do not provide a satisfactory explanation for recent trends. The Great
Recession cannot explain the slow growth in Medicare spending, nor can
it explain why spending growth in the private sector remains so low years
after the end of the recession. Similarly, demographic changes can explain
only a small portion of the slowdown in per enrollee health care spending
and actually make the slowdown in aggregate health care spending growth
look slightly larger.
This evidence implies that recent trends in health care spending primarily reflect developments internal to the health care sector. Changes in
the cost sharing obligations borne by individuals do not appear to explain
recent trends, suggesting that the main factor has been changes in the health
care delivery system. Within the delivery system, there are likely a number
of factors playing a role, but the ACA’s changes to provider payment have

270  |  Chapter 4

made a large, readily quantifiable contribution, and there is reason to believe
that the ACA’s effects on recent trends may go beyond what can be easily
quantified today.
Each of these factors is discussed in greater detail below.
The Great Recession and Its Aftermath
Some analysts have pointed to the economic disruptions caused by the
Great Recession as a possible explanation for the slow growth in health care
costs under the ACA. However, this explanation does not fit the available
data. Most fundamentally, the Great Recession does not appear to be able
to explain any meaningful portion of the slow growth in Medicare spending
in recent years. In addition, while it appears that the Great Recession did
dampen private sector spending growth in the years during and immediately
after the downturn, it is doubtful that the recession and its aftermath can
explain why spending growth has remained low all the way through the
present, more than seven years after the recession’s end.
The fact that health care spending growth has grown slowly in
Medicare, not just private insurance, is the clearest evidence that recent
health care spending trends reflect much more than just the Great Recession
and its aftermath. Medicare beneficiaries are generally not employed and
only around a fifth live in families that get more than half of their income
from earnings, so they are relatively insulated from developments in the
labor market. Likewise, only around a quarter of Medicare beneficiaries have
asset income in excess of $1,000 annually, suggesting that the typical beneficiary is relatively insulated from financial market developments as well.25
Empirical evidence strongly supports the view that the Great Recession
had little effect on trends in Medicare spending. Historically, weaker macroeconomic performance has not been associated with lower growth in
Medicare spending per beneficiary, either at the national level or when
comparing across states experiencing stronger and weaker macroeconomic
performance at a given point in time (Levine and Buntin 2013; Chandra,
Holmes, and Skinner 2013; Sheiner 2014). Similarly, Dranove, Garthwaite,
and Ody (2015) directly compare Medicare spending growth in areas of
the country that experienced larger and smaller reductions in employment
during the Great Recession. They conclude that the recession had only small
effects on Medicare spending growth.
It is more plausible that the Great Recession could have affected health
care spending among people under age 65. Non-elderly Americans generally depend on the labor market for their livelihoods, and those who have
health insurance overwhelmingly receive coverage through an employer, as
25 These estimates reflect CEA analysis of the Current Population Survey Annual Social and
Economic Supplement data covering 2015.

Reforming the Health Care System  |  271

illustrated in Figure 4-3. As a result, there many mechanisms through which
the Great Recession could have affected the health care spending of people
under age 65.
Most directly, an economic downturn could cause some individuals to
become uninsured. For example, reduced employment could reduce access
to employer coverage, and increased financial stress could cause families to
conclude that premiums are unaffordable. Alternatively, financial pressure
could cause employers to stop offering coverage or charge higher premiums.
The uninsured rate among non-elderly adults did indeed increase sharply
during and immediately after the Great Recession, as depicted in Figure 4-5.
Because the uninsured are much less likely to access health care, as discussed
earlier in this chapter, this development likely exerted downward pressure
on aggregate health care spending growth during this period. However, the
uninsured rate for non-elderly individuals peaked by 2010, so increases in
the number of uninsured cannot explain why health care spending growth
has remained low since that time. Furthermore, reductions in the number of
people with coverage through an employer cannot explain why per enrollee
health care spending, not just aggregate health care spending, has grown so
slowly.
There are, however, mechanisms by which an economic downturn
might affect spending by individuals who remain insured. Financial stress
could cause individuals to de-prioritize spending on health care or cause
employers to modify the coverage they offer in ways that reduce health care
spending, such as by increasing cost sharing. Whatever the mechanism,
there is empirical evidence that the Great Recession reduced the growth of
per enrollee health care spending in employer coverage in its immediate
aftermath. Ryu et al. (2013) find that the recession increased cost sharing
in employer coverage and estimate that those increases subtracted around 1
percentage point per year from the growth of per enrollee health care spending in employer coverage in both 2010 and 2011, with smaller reductions
in earlier years. Similarly, Dranove, Garthwaite, and Ody (2014) compare
growth in per enrollee spending in employer coverage in metropolitan
statistical areas that experienced larger and smaller reductions in employment during the Great Recession. They conclude that the Great Recession
subtracted an average of 1.8 percentage points per year from growth in per
enrollee spending in employer coverage in 2010 and 2011.
While this evidence demonstrates that the Great Recession exerted
downward pressure on growth in private insurance spending in the years
around 2010, it is doubtful that it can explain why per enrollee spending
growth in private coverage has remained low through the present, as was
illustrated in Figure 4-33. Research comparing health care spending growth
272  |  Chapter 4

in states experiencing weaker and stronger economic performance at a
given point in time has generally concluded that, to the extent economic
downturns affect health care spending growth at all, those effects fade almost
completely within a few years (Chandra, Holmes, and Skinner 2013; Sheiner
2014). Because the labor market reached its trough by early 2010 and has
recovered steadily since then, as illustrated in Figure 4-36, this evidence
would suggest that the recession can play only a limited role in explaining
why private health care spending growth has been so slow during the postACA period, particularly over the last few years.
One potential shortcoming of using cross-state comparisons to estimate the relationship between macroeconomic conditions and private health
insurance spending is that these types of analyses cannot capture effects of
economic downturns that operate at the national level, rather than state or
local level. It is possible that these types of national effects might persist for
a longer period of time. In an effort to capture these national effects, some
researchers have examined the correlation between economic growth and
growth in private health insurance spending at the national level over time.
Taken at face value, results from these “time series” analyses suggest
that economic growth has large effects on private health insurance spending
that emerge with a four- or five-year lag (Chandra, Holmes, and Skinner
2013; Sheiner 2014). However, analyses of this type have important methodological weaknesses. Unlike analyses that compare outcomes across different
geographic areas at the same point in time, time series analyses cannot control for unobserved factors that might cause health care spending to change
over time. As a result, these approaches are at much greater risk of mistaking
changes in private health insurance spending growth that coincided with an
economic downturn for change in private health insurance spending growth
that were caused by an economic downturn.
Moreover, it is unclear whether the results from these analyses are
economically plausible. In particular, the most plausible way an economic
downturn could generate long-lasting effects on health care spending
growth is by changing the development and diffusion of medical technology.
However, as noted by Sheiner (2014), four to five years may be too soon
for a downturn to have meaningful effects on the path of medical technology, given the long duration of the research and development process.
Furthermore, if economic downturns change the path of medical technology in the medium term, that should affect spending growth in Medicare
in addition to private insurance. However, there is little evidence that economic downturns affect spending growth in Medicare at any time horizon.

Demographic Changes
Demographic changes are another factor outside the health care
system that could affect health care spending trends. As illustrated in Figure
4-37, the United States population is currently aging. Because age is an
important determinant of health care spending, differences in how the age
distribution is changing at different points in time can cause differences in
health care spending growth over time.
Figure 4-38 reports estimates of how health care spending would
have changed in recent years based solely on changes in the age and sex

274  |  Chapter 4

distribution, holding fixed both spending and coverage patterns.26 Consistent
with the steady increase in the average age of the full population depicted
in Figure 4-37, demographic changes have consistently added to aggregate
health care spending growth in recent years. Over the decade preceding the
ACA, these demographic factors added an average of 0.5 percentage point
per year to growth of per capita health care spending in the full population.
Those effects have been slightly larger in the years following passage of the
ACA, averaging around 0.6 percentage point per year from 2010 through
2016. Thus, at the level of the population as a whole, demographic changes
cannot explain why growth has slowed.
On the other hand, demographic changes can explain a small portion
of the slowdown in the growth of per enrollee spending in private insurance
and Medicare. As illustrated in Figure 4-37, the aging of the baby boomers
drove a steady increase in the average age of the under 65 population during
the decade that preceded the ACA, which essentially stopped when the first
cohort of baby boomers reached age 65 in 2012. At that time, demographic
factors abruptly began placing less upward pressure on per enrollee spending growth in private insurance, as illustrated in Figure 4-38. Whereas
demographic changes added an average of 0.6 percentage point per year to
private spending growth from 2000 through 2010, they have added an average of just 0.2 percentage point per year since 2010. Thus, demographics
can explain a non-zero, but small portion of the decline in private health
insurance spending growth.
Demographic changes have had a related effect in Medicare. As the
early cohorts of baby boomers have turned 65, the average age among
26 The first step in producing these estimates was to allocate the population across private
coverage, public coverage, and uninsurance in each year, holding the age-specific propensity
to be enrolled in each type of coverage fixed, but allowing population demographics to change
over time. Age-specific enrollment propensities for private insurance, public coverage, and
uninsurance were set at the 2000-2015 average for each age, as estimated using the National
Health Interview Survey for those years. Data on the population by age and sex in each year
were obtained from various Census Bureau population estimates and projections. The second
step was to obtain data on spending by age and coverage type. Yamamoto (2013) reports data
on relative spending by single year of age for commercial coverage and traditional Medicare
coverage. Because Yamamoto (2013) reports relative spending by age within commercial and
traditional Medicare coverage, additional information is required to put the commercial and
traditional Medicare spending curves on the same absolute scale. To do so, CEA relied upon
an estimate from Wallace and Song (2016) that spending falls by 34 percent, on average,
for individuals converting from commercial coverage to traditional Medicare at age 65. The
commercial age curve was used for all individuals with private coverage, while the traditional
Medicare age curve was used for all Medicare enrollees. For individuals under age 65 with
public coverage, spending was assumed to reflect the commercial age curve scaled down by 20
percent. For individuals under age 65 who were uninsured, spending was assumed to reflect
the commercial age curve scaled down by 50 percent. The results are not particularly sensitive
to the approach used for these groups.

individuals among individuals 65 and older has declined, placing significant
downward pressure on growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary. As
reported in Figure 4-38, after having had little net effect on per beneficiary
Medicare spending growth over the decade preceding the ACA, demographic changes have subtracted around 0.3 percentage point per year during the post-ACA period. As with the effects reported above, this effect is
not trivial but still relatively small in relation to the overall slowdown in the
growth of Medicare spending.
Changes in Enrollee Cost Sharing
Changes in cost sharing obligations, such as coinsurance, copayments,
and deductibles, are another possible explanation for the slower growth
in health care spending since the ACA became law. It is well-established
that higher cost sharing causes individuals to use less care (for example,
Newhouse et al. 1993), so if cost sharing obligations had grown more rapidly
during the post-ACA period than during the pre-ACA period, this could
account for slower growth in health spending after the ACA’s passage. In
fact, there is no evidence that this has occurred.
Focusing first on individuals who get coverage through an employer,
Figure 4-39 plots out-of-pocket spending as a share of total spending in
employer coverage over time derived from three different data sets: the
Household Component of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)
and two different databases of health insurance claims.27 The MEPS estimates suggest that the out-of-pocket share has been declining steadily since
at least 2000 with, if anything, a faster pace of decline after 2010 than before
2010. The estimates from the two claims databases suggest that the outof-pocket share has been relatively flat, with small increases in the out-ofpocket share in the years before 2010 and little net change after 2010. Thus,
there is no evidence that cost sharing obligations have grown more quickly
after 2010 and, therefore, no evidence that faster growth in cost sharing can
explain slower growth in health care spending. If anything, these data suggest that cost sharing trends may have worked slightly against the slowdown
in health care spending growth observed in recent years.28
27 Each of these data series has strengths and weaknesses. The MEPS is nationally
representative, whereas the claims databases are not. On the other hand, the claims databases
offer larger sample sizes. They also offer more accurate information on each individual
transaction since they contain the actual transaction records.
28 This conclusion is even stronger if consumers’ decisions on whether to access care depend
on the dollar amounts they pay when they access care rather than the share of total spending
they pay. The absolute dollar amount of cost sharing has grown more slowly in the post-ACA
period than the pre-ACA period due to the combination of sharply lower overall spending
growth and the relatively steady trend in the out-of-pocket share.

The overall out-of-pocket share, reported in Figure 4-39, is the best
metric for evaluating trends in cost sharing in employer coverage because it
captures all types of cost sharing, including copayments, coinsurance, and
deductibles. Focusing on individual categories of cost sharing can provide a
misleading picture of the overall trend in out-of-pocket costs since different
components can grow at different rates. Notably, enrollees’ copayments
and coinsurance obligations have grown quite slowly in recent years, while
deductible spending has grown much more quickly (Claxton, Levitt, and
Long 2016). This is likely in part because deductibles have simply supplanted
these other types of cost sharing and in part because of the ACA’s reforms
requiring insurance plans to cover preventive services without cost sharing
and to limit enrollees annual out-of-pocket spending, which were discussed
earlier in this report.
Despite the limitations of doing so, public discussions have sometimes
focused narrowly on trends in deductibles to the exclusion of other out-ofpocket costs. Even looking solely at deductibles, however, provides little support for the view that recent years’ slow growth in health care spending can
be explained in part by faster growth in cost sharing. Average deductibles in
employer coverage have indeed risen steadily in recent years, as illustrated in
Figure 4-40. However, the pace of this increase since 2010 has been similar
to the increase prior to 2010, meaning it can do little to explain why growth

in overall health spending has been slower during the post-ACA period than
it was prior to the ACA.
There is also little evidence that changes in cost sharing are an
important explanation for the slow cost growth in types of coverage other
than employer coverage. The largest change in Medicare’s benefit design
in recent years was the creation of Medicare Part D in 2006. Creation of
Medicare Part D did drive temporarily faster growth in drug spending by
Medicare beneficiaries; however, the estimates of trends in per beneficiary
Medicare spending that were presented in Figures 4-31 through 4-33 already
adjusted for the large increase in drug spending associated with the creation
of Medicare Part D. With respect to Medicaid and CHIP, systematic data on
cost sharing obligations are not available, but both programs have historically included negligible beneficiary cost sharing, and there is no reason to
believe that this has changed in recent years. Thus, it is doubtful that changes
in cost sharing play a meaningful role in explaining slower spending growth
in those programs in recent years.
Non-ACA Trends in the Health Care Delivery System
The inability of factors affecting the demand for medical care—
including economic and demographic trends, as well as changes in cost
sharing—to explain the slow growth in health care spending under the ACA

suggests that changes in the health care delivery system have played the
predominant role in recent years’ slow health care spending growth. The
next section discusses the important role that the ACA’s changes in medical
provider payment have played in slowing health care spending growth, but
the fact that health care spending had started slowing prior to the ACA’s
passage, as documented in Figure 4-31, suggests that the ACA is not the
only reason that health care spending growth has been slower during the
post-ACA period than in the past. A pair of such factors is discussed below.
The slower growth under the ACA relative to the preceding decade
may, in part, reflect the removal of factors that put upward pressure on
spending growth during years preceding the ACA, particularly during the
early 2000s. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw a number of states pass
laws that restricted the ability of private insurers to use a range of so-called
“managed care” strategies, strategies that appear to have contributed to
slower health care spending growth during the 1990s (Cutler, McClellan,
and Newhouse 2000; Glied 2000). Recent economic research examining
these state laws has concluded that they put substantial, but temporary
upward pressure on health care spending in the years after they took effect
(Pinkovskiy 2014). This may partially explain why health care spending
growth under the ACA has been so much slower than the first half of the
2000s, though it cannot explain why spending growth has been slower under
the ACA than during the second half of the 2000s.
Another possible explanation for why health care spending has grown
more slowly in recent years is that the pace at which new medical technologies are being introduced has slowed. As noted earlier in this section,
economists generally believe that the development of resource-intensive
new medical technologies has been the main driver of the rapid growth in
health care spending over the long term (Newhouse 1992; Cutler 2004). If
these types of technologies are arriving at a slower pace than in the past, then
that could explain why health care spending has grown at a slower pace.
The trajectory of medical technology likely can account for much of
the recent swings in prescription drug spending growth. As illustrated in
Figure 4-41, per enrollee prescription drug spending in private insurance
grew very slowly in the years both immediately before and after passage of
the ACA after having grown quite rapidly in the early 2000s.29 Slow growth
during this period appears to have resulted from a slew of patent expirations
for blockbuster drugs that allowed less expensive generic versions of these
29 Figure 4-41 focuses on private insurance because Medicare generally did not cover
prescription drugs before 2006 and because, as noted previously, trends in per enrollee
Medicaid spending are more difficult to interpret due to changes in the composition of
program enrollment.

drugs to enter the market, combined with a dearth of new drug introductions (Aitken, Berndt, and Cutler 2009; IMS 2013). This period of slow
growth ended as a wave of costly new medications entered the market starting in 2014 (IMS 2016). Figure 4-41 and more-timely data from the Bureau
of Economic Analysis suggest that prescription drug spending growth has
begun to slow again as the effect of these new drug introductions on prescription drug spending has waned.
However, prescription drugs account for only a sixth of overall health
care spending (ASPE 2016c),30 and it is far from clear that changes in the
trajectory of medical technology can account for the reductions in growth
of other categories of health care spending that was documented in Figure
4-32. Chandra, Holmes, and Skinner (2013) document slower growth in
utilization of certain surgical procedures in the years prior to the ACA and
highlight similar evidence from Lee and Levy (2012) for certain imaging
services, which they argue implies that a slower pace of technological change
30 The estimate that prescription drugs account for one-sixth of total health care spending
cited here incorporates both prescription drugs sold directly to consumers and prescription
drugs purchased and administered by a physician or other medical provider. The other data
presented in this chapter only incorporate spending on prescription drugs sold to consumers
because non-retail spending on prescription drugs is not included in the prescription drug
category of the National Health Expenditure Accounts.

began restraining health care spending growth in the years prior to the
ACA’s passage. But this evidence primarily reflects changes in how existing
medical technologies were being used, not the pace at which new technologies are being introduced, so it is unclear that these data should be taken to
reflect a change in the trajectory of medical technology, as opposed to some
other change in medical practice that may have a wide variety of potential
causes.
ACA Reforms to Provider Payment
As discussed above, the ACA is not the only factor that explains why
health care spending has grown so much more slowly in the years since the
ACA became law than in the preceding years. However, there is also clear
evidence that payment reforms introduced in the ACA, plus the “spillover”
effects of those reforms on the private sector, have exerted substantial,
quantifiable downward pressure on health care spending growth since 2010.
Furthermore, there is reason to believe that the ACA’s efforts to change the
structure of provider payment have had additional effects that go beyond
what can be readily quantified.
The most direct effect of the ACA on health care spending growth has
been from the ACA’s provisions to better align the rates Medicare pays to
medical providers and private insurers with the actual cost of services; these
provisions were described in detail earlier in this chapter. CBO estimates
imply that these provisions have reduced the annual growth rate of Medicare
spending by 1.3 percentage points from 2010 through 2016, generating a
cumulative spending reduction of close to 8 percent in 2016.31 These provisions of the ACA, therefore, can account for around a third of the reduction
in per beneficiary Medicare spending growth relative to the pre-ACA decade
that was reported in Figure 4-32. Notably, more than half of this reduction
in spending growth—or around 0.8 percentage point per year—comes from
ACA provisions that reduce annual updates to various categories of medical
providers to reflect productivity growth. These provisions will continue to
31 These calculations account for the ACA’s reductions to annual updates in traditional feefor-service payment rates, reductions in Medicare Advantage benchmarks, and reductions
in Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital payments, but not other Medicare provisions
included in the ACA. The magnitude of the savings from these provisions were estimated using
CBO’s original score of the ACA (CBO 2010c); the percentage reductions reflect CBO’s March
2009 baseline projections for Medicare, which were the baseline projections used in scoring
the ACA (CBO 2009). These calculations use CBO’s original score of the ACA rather than its
subsequent estimates of ACA repeal because those subsequent scores assume that Medicare’s
payment rules would not return to exactly what they would have been without the ACA if
the ACA were repealed (CBO 2012a; CBO 2015a). For comparability with the other estimates
included in this chapter, the CBO estimates were converted to a calendar year basis by
assuming that the applicable amounts for a calendar years were three-quarters of the amount
for the corresponding fiscal year and one-quarter of the amount for the subsequent fiscal year.

282  |  Chapter 4

reduce the growth rate of Medicare spending to a similar extent in the years
to come.
In addition, recent research has concluded that reductions in
Medicare’s payment rates lead to corresponding reductions in the payment
rates that private insurers are able to secure from medical providers, as
discussed earlier in this chapter. If the magnitude of these spillover savings
matches the prior literature, then the ACA’s provisions reducing annual
payment updates have reduced growth of private insurance spending by
between 0.6 and 0.9 percentage point per year from 2010 through 2016,
generating a cumulative reduction in private insurance spending of between
3 and 5 percent in 2016.32 These spillover effects on private insurance can
account for half or more of the reduction in the growth of the prices private
insurers pay for hospital care that was reported in Figure 4-30; they can
explain between an eighth and a fifth of the reduction in the growth of
private insurance spending per enrollee relative to the pre-ACA decade that
was reported in Figure 4-32. Moreover, because the underlying Medicare
provisions permanently reduce the growth of Medicare payment rates, these
spillover effects on growth in private insurance spending would be expected
to continue indefinitely as well.
While assessing the aggregate effects of the ACA’s provisions to
deploy alternative payment models is more challenging, early evidence
is encouraging. Research examining the first three years of the Medicare
Shared Savings Program, Medicare’s largest ACO program, has estimated
that ACOs have reduced annual spending for aligned beneficiaries by 0 to 3
percent, with early evidence suggesting that ACOs start at the bottom of that
range and move toward the top as they gain experience (McWilliams et al.
2016; McWilliams 2016). Research examining the first two years of CMMI’s
smaller Pioneer ACO model found savings of a broadly similar magnitude
(Nyweide et al. 2015; McWilliams et al. 2015), while evidence from the first
two years of CMMI’s Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative,
CMMI’s largest bundled payment program, found savings of around 4
percent of episode spending among participating hospitals relative to nonparticipating hospitals (Dummit et al. 2016).
These results are encouraging, but they also suggest that APMs have
generated only modest direct savings to the Medicare program to date.
Importantly, the estimates reported above reflect the gross reduction in
Medicare spending under the APMs, before accounting for performance
32 The lower bound of this range reflects the White (2013) estimate that each dollar reduction
in Medicare payment rates reduces private payment rates by $0.77, while the upper bound
reflects the Clemens and Gottlieb (forthcoming) estimate that each dollar reduction in
Medicare’s payment rate reduces private payment rates by $1.12.

Reforming the Health Care System  |  283

payments made to providers. These performance payments have offset
much of the gross savings reported above, at least in the Medicare Shared
Savings Program (McWilliams 2016). In addition, while APMs have spread
rapidly in the Medicare program since 2010, they still account for a minority
of Medicare payments, so the savings estimates reported above apply to only
a portion of program spending.
While the direct savings to the Medicare program may be relatively
modest so far, these initiatives may be generating more substantial savings
in the rest of the health care system. As discussed earlier in this chapter,
research has suggested that providers use a common “practice style” with all
of their patients, causing payment interventions implemented by one payer
to generate savings for other payers whose enrollees see the same providers.
If that evidence applies in this case, then Medicare’s APM initiatives are
already generating meaningful savings for private payers. Notably, unlike
the savings that APM participants generate for Medicare, spillover savings
are not offset by performance payments to providers. For this reason, it is
conceivable that Medicare’s APM initiatives have generated larger net savings for private payers than for the Medicare program itself so far.
In addition, as noted earlier in this chapter, private payers appear to
have been making efforts to deploy APMs in parallel with Medicare, and it
is unlikely that these efforts would have occurred in the absence of efforts to
deploy these models in Medicare. While there is little systematic evidence on
how successful these private sector efforts have been at reducing costs, these
savings could be substantial. Furthermore, as also noted earlier in this chapter, one long-term benefit of transitioning to APMs is fostering the development of technologies and treatment approaches that generate the most value
for patients, rather than the technologies and treatment approaches that are
most profitable under fee-for-service payment. While changes of this type
are likely to take years or even decades to reach their full effect, if even small
shifts in this direction have already occurred, it would have large implications for total health care spending because these types of shifts would affect
all providers, not just those participating in APMs.
Finally, whatever has happened so far, there are several reasons to
believe that the savings generated by Medicare’s APM initiatives will grow
over time. First, as noted above, ACOs in the Medicare Shared Savings
Program appear to achieve greater gross savings as they gain experience;
similarly, research examining an earlier private ACO-like contract found
that savings grew steadily as providers gained experience with the contract
(Song et al. 2014). Second, the Administration has been making continual
improvements in its APMs, such as by improving the methodologies used to
align beneficiaries to ACOs and to set ACOs’ spending benchmarks. These
284  |  Chapter 4

improvements will strengthen ACOs’ ability to achieve savings and their
incentives to do so. Third, program rules for many APMs are structured so
that the performance payments earned for any given level of gross savings
will shrink over time, generating larger net savings to Medicare even if gross
savings remain constant. Fourth, as discussed previously, a larger share of
Medicare dollars are expected to flow through APMs in the coming years.

Recent Trends in Health Care Quality
The reforms implemented under this Administration were designed
to improve the quality of care, not just reduce health care costs. Reducing
costs in ways that worsen the quality of care will often reduce the total
value generated by the health care sector. By contrast, reducing costs while
maintaining or improving the quality of care, which the evidence presented
at the beginning of this section of this chapter suggested is often possible,
has the potential to greatly increase the total value generated by the health
care sector.
In practice, studying trends in health care quality is inherently more
challenging than studying trends in health care costs. The essential information about health care costs can be captured in a few key pieces of data—the
types of service used, the prices paid for those services, and the resulting total
spending—and these same basic measures are applicable across all health
care settings. By contrast, health care quality has many important dimensions, including a range of different aspects of patients’ experiences while
receiving care and myriad health outcomes. Furthermore, the most relevant
dimensions vary widely from one setting to another. As a result, indicators
of health care quality are unavoidably less comprehensive than indicators
of health care costs. In addition, whereas health care costs are measured
in dollars and so can be readily aggregated and compared across domains,
different dimensions of health care quality are measured in widely varying
units, which makes aggregation effectively impossible.
For both of these reasons, all-encompassing indicators of health care
quality like those that exist for health care costs do not exist. However, quality measures that capture particular important dimensions of care do exist,
and a few of these are discussed below. These measures indicate that recent
years’ slow growth in health care costs has been accompanied by important
improvements in health care quality, implying that ongoing changes in
health care delivery system are not just reducing health care spending, but
also increasing the total value that the health care system creates. Notably,
these improvements in the quality of care appear to be attributable, at least
in part, to reforms introduced by the ACA.

Reforming the Health Care System  |  285

Declines in the Rate of Hospital-Acquired Conditions
One of the most comprehensive ongoing efforts to monitor health
care quality on a system-wide basis is the Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality’s (AHRQ) work to track the incidence of 28 different hospitalacquired conditions, including pressure ulcers, several types of infections,
and complications due to medication errors, on a nationwide basis (AHRQ
2015; HHS 2016b). The AHRQ data series combines data from a variety of
sources, including reviews of medical charts, administrative hospital discharge records, and hospital reports to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
The AHRQ data indicate that the rate of hospital-acquired conditions
has fallen significantly since this data series began in 2010, as illustrated
in Figure 4-42. The rate of hospital-acquired conditions stood at 145 per
1,000 discharges in 2010 and had fallen to 115 per 1,000 discharges in 2015,
a decline of 21 percent. Using prior research on the relationship between
these hospital-acquired conditions and mortality, AHRQ estimates that the
reduction in the rate of hospital-acquired conditions since 2010 corresponds
to approximately 125,000 avoided deaths cumulatively from 2010 through
2015. AHRQ similarly estimates that these reductions in hospital-acquired
conditions have generated cost savings of around $28 billion cumulatively
from 2010 through 2015.
The factors that are driving the reduction in hospital-acquired conditions have been less thoroughly studied than the factors driving recent
years’ slow growth in health care costs, but there is reason to believe that
the ACA has played an important role here as well. Two of the value-based
purchasing reforms implemented under the ACA—the Hospital ValueBased Purchasing Program and the Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction
Program—tie hospitals’ Medicare payment rates to a range of quality
measures, including rates of hospital-acquired conditions. The first year
of incentive payments under these programs were based on performance
during 2011 and 2013, respectively, and hospitals may also have begun
adjusting their behavior even earlier. In addition, drawing on funding from
CMMI, the Administration created the Partnership for Patients initiative,
which set up mechanisms to help hospitals identify and share best practices
for improving the quality of patient care. Hospital industry participants
have reported that the Partnership was highly effective in achieving its goals
(AHA/HRET 2014). The Partnership was recently incorporated on a permanent basis into CMS’ Quality Improvement Network-Quality Improvement
Organization program.

Declines in the Rate of Hospital Readmissions
Another valuable indicator of health care quality is the rate of hospital
readmissions, instances in which a patient returns to the hospital soon after
discharge. Hospital readmissions often result from the occurrence of a serious complication after discharge, so hospital readmission rates are a useful
indicator of the health outcomes patients achieve after leaving the hospital
(Jencks, Williams, and Coleman 2009; Hines et al. 2014). Evidence suggests
that many readmissions also reflect low-quality care during the initial hospital stay or poor planning for how a patient will receive care after discharge,
which means that readmission rates are also a useful indicator of the quality
of the care being provided during that initial stay (MedPAC 2007).
Hospital readmission rates have declined sharply in recent years.
After several years of stability, the 30-day hospital readmission rate among
Medicare patients began falling sharply starting in late 2011, as illustrated
in Figure 4-43. This decline continued at a rapid pace through early 2014,
with modest additional declines since then. The readmission rate for the
12 months that ended in July 2016 was 1.3 percentage points (7 percent)
below the average rate recorded for 2007 through 2011. Cumulatively, the
decline in hospital readmission rates from April 2010 through May 2015
corresponds to 565,000 avoided hospital readmissions (Zuckerman 2016).

The ACA appears to have played a major role in reducing hospital
readmission rates. The ACA’s Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program
(HRRP) reduces payment rates for hospitals in which a relatively large
fraction of patients return to the hospital soon after discharge. Notably, the
decline depicted in Figure 4-43 began around the time that the rules governing the payment reductions under the HRRP were finalized in August
2011.33 In addition, Zuckerman et al. (2016) also document that the reduction in readmission rates has been particularly large for the specific conditions targeted under the HRRP, which is also consistent with the hypothesis
that the HRRP was the main driver of this decline. Alongside the changes in
financial incentives created by the HRRP, the Partnership for Patients may
also have helped reduce readmissions during this period by helping hospitals
identify and adopt best practices for doing so.
Importantly, recent declines in hospital readmission rates reflect real
reductions in patients’ risk of returning to the hospital after discharge, not
mere changes in how patients who return to the hospital are being classified, as some analysts have suggested (for example, Himmelstein and
33 While the first payment reductions under this program did not occur until October 2012,
hospitals’ incentives to reduce readmissions began as soon as the rules were finalized (or
earlier, to the extent that hospitals anticipated the structure of the payment rules) because
payment reductions are based on performance in prior years.

288  |  Chapter 4

Woolhandler 2015). These analysts argued that some hospitals had tried to
circumvent the HRRP’s payment reductions by re-classifying some inpatient
readmissions as outpatient observation stays. As a result, they argued, the
observed decline in hospital readmissions rates substantially overstated the
actual decline in patients’ risk of returning to the hospital after discharge.
However, Zuckerman et al. (2016) demonstrate that no such shift to
observation status has occurred. Although there has been a decade-long
trend toward greater use of outpatient observation stays among patients
who return to the hospital, there was no change in this trend after introduction of the HRRP, contrary to what would have been expected if the HRRP
had caused inpatient readmissions to be re-classified as observations stays.
Similarly, the authors find no correlation between the decline in a hospital’s
readmission rate and the increase in the share of a hospital’s patients who
experience an observation stay following discharge, which is also inconsistent with the re-classification hypothesis.
Quality Performance in Alternative Payment Models
Early evidence from evaluations of the APMs being deployed under
the ACA also provides an encouraging picture of how these models will affect
quality of care. The evaluation of the Medicare Shared Savings Program that
was discussed in the last subsection found that ACOs improved quality of
care along some dimensions, while not worsening it on others, at the same
time as ACOs generated reductions in spending (McWilliams et al. 2016).
Evaluations of the first two years of the Pioneer ACO model found broadly
similar results: improvements on some measures of quality performance,
with no evidence of adverse effects on others (McWilliams et al. 2015;
Nyweide et al. 2015). Similarly, evidence from the first two years of CMMI’s
Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative, found that the savings
achieved under that initiative came at no cost in terms of quality of care
(Dummit et al. 2016). This evidence implies that APMs will be successful in
improving the overall value of the care delivered, not just reducing spending.

Economic Benefits of a Better Health Care Delivery System
Recent progress in improving the health care delivery system is
already having major economic benefits. Most visibly, slower growth in the
cost of health care generates large savings that are then available for other
valuable purposes, raising Americans’ overall standard of living. Recent
shifts in projections of aggregate national health expenditures illustrate the
magnitude of these savings. Relative to the projections issued just before
the ACA became law, national health expenditures are now projected to
be 1.7 percentage points lower as a share of GDP in 2019 than projected

just before the ACA became law, as illustrated in Figure 4-44, despite the
fact that tens of millions more Americans are now projected to have health
insurance.34 Over the ACA’s entire first decade, national health expenditures
are now projected to be $2.6 trillion lower than projected before the ACA
became law. The remainder of this subsection discusses the downstream
consequences of lower health care costs, including increased employment in
the short run, higher wages in both the short and long run, lower premiums
and out-of-pocket costs, and an improved fiscal outlook for Federal and
State governments.
While this subsection focuses primarily on the economic benefits of
reductions in the cost of health care, it is important not to lose sight of the
fact that improvements in the quality of care also have important economic
benefits. Most importantly, higher-quality care ultimately allows people to
live longer, healthier lives, which is immensely valuable in its own right. In
addition, as noted in the discussion of the benefits of expanded insurance
coverage in the first section of this chapter, better health also appears to
improve the likelihood that individuals are able to work and increases their

productivity on the job. These benefits, while not as readily quantifiable as
the benefits discussed below, are also important.

Higher Wages, Lower Premiums, and Lower Out-of-Pocket Costs for
Workers
Roughly half of Americans see the benefits of a more efficient health
care system in the form of lower costs for the coverage they get through
an employer. Health care for individuals enrolled in employer coverage is
financed through a combination of premiums and out-of-pocket costs, so
when the underlying cost of health care falls, premiums and out-of-pocket
costs fall as well. Reductions in out-of-pocket costs and the portion of
premiums paid by employees accrue directly to workers. The remaining savings, which initially accrue to employers as lower premium contributions,
ultimately benefits workers as well; economic theory and evidence demonstrate that reductions in the amounts employers pay toward premiums
translate into higher wages in the long run (for example, Summers 1989;
Baicker and Chandra 2006).
The slow growth in health costs under the ACA has generated substantial savings for workers. The average premium for employer-based
family coverage was nearly $3,600 lower in 2016 than it would have been if
nominal premium growth since 2010 had matched the average rate recorded
over the 2000 through 2010 period, as estimated using data from the KFF/
HRET Employer Health Benefits Survey and illustrated in Figure 4-45.
Incorporating data on out-of-pocket costs makes these savings considerably
larger. Combining these KFF/HRET data on premiums with data on out-ofpocket costs from the Household Component of the Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey using the methodology described in Figure 4-34 implies that
the average total spending associated with an employer-based family policy
is $4,400 lower in 2016 than if trends had matched the preceding decade.35
As noted above, both economic theory and evidence imply that workers will receive the full amount of these savings in the long run. In practice,
however, compensation packages take time to adjust, so it is conceivable
that some of employers’ savings on their portion of premiums have not
fully translated into higher wages in the short run. To the extent that is the
case, then slower growth in health care costs has had the effect of reducing
employers’ per-worker compensation costs in the short run, increasing their
incentives to hire and potentially boosting overall employment. The empirical evidence on these effects is limited, but some studies have found evidence
35 As depicted in Figure 4-39 and discussed in the main text, different data sources report
somewhat different trends in the out-of-pocket share. However, this calculation is not very
sensitive to which data source is used.

that slower growth in health care costs is associated with faster employment
growth (Baicker and Chandra 2006; Sood, Ghosh, and Escarce 2009).

Lower Premiums and Out-of-Pocket Costs in Other Forms of Coverage
Slow growth in health care costs has also reduced premiums and
out-of-pocket costs for people who get coverage outside the workplace. For
example, due to recent years’ slow health care cost growth, per beneficiary
Medicare spending has come in well below earlier projections. As discussed
in detail in the next section, this development is generating major savings
for the Federal Government. However, this development is also reducing
the premium and cost-sharing obligations borne by Medicare beneficiaries.
Focusing first on premiums, Medicare beneficiaries generally pay a
premium to enroll in Medicare Part B, which covers outpatient services,
and Medicare Part D, which coverage prescription medications.36 The
standard Medicare Part B premium is set to cover approximately 25 percent
of program costs, while the base Medicare Part D premium is set to cover
25.5 percent of the cost of a standard plan design. Consequently, when per
36 Very few beneficiaries pay a premium to enroll in Medicare Part A (which covers inpatient
hospital services and certain other services) because almost all beneficiaries are entitled to
coverage based on their prior work history.

beneficiary spending in those portions of the Medicare program falls, the
Part B and Part D premiums fall roughly proportionally.
Indeed, 2016 premiums for both of these parts of Medicare are
substantially below projections issued with the 2009 Trustees Report, the
last report issued before the ACA became law, as illustrated in Figure 4-46.
Whereas the standard monthly premium for Part B for 2016 was projected
to be $135.80 per month under the policies then in place, the actual 2016
Part B premium was $121.80 per month, a reduction of 10 percent (Clemens,
Lizonitz, and Murugesan 2009).37,38 Similarly, the base Medicare Part D premium was projected to be $48.10 in the 2009 Trustees Report, but the actual
37 This 2009 projection of the Part B premium cited here is from a scenario in which physician
payment rates were assumed to remain fixed in nominal terms, rather than being cut sharply as
prescribed under the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula then in law. Congress routinely
blocked the SGR cuts, so this provides a more accurate picture of the spending trajectory
under the policies in place in 2009. Projections for this alternative scenario are available in a
supplemental memo published by the CMS Office of the Actuary alongside the 2009 Medicare
Trustees Report (Clemens, Lizonitz, and Murugesan 2009).
38 Most Medicare beneficiaries paid a lower Part B premium in 2016 because of the application
of the Medicare program’s “hold harmless” provision, which limits the Part B premium
increases for certain beneficiaries when there is a low Social Security cost-of-living adjustment.
The higher premium is used here because it is more reflective of underlying program costs.
These estimates are therefore conservative.

Reforming the Health Care System  |  293

2016 Part D premium was $34.10 per month, a reduction of 29 percent
(Medicare Trustees 2009). For a typical beneficiary enrolled in both parts of
the program, the annual premiums savings will total $336 in 2016.
Medicare beneficiaries are also responsible for cost sharing when
they access services. Enrollees receiving Part A services through traditional
Medicare pay fixed dollar cost sharing amounts when they use specified services; these dollar amounts are updated annually based on changes in provider payment rates under Part A. For Part B, traditional Medicare enrollees
are responsible for a deductible, which is updated annually based on the
overall trend in Part B costs, and, once the deductible is met, 20 percent
coinsurance for most services. Because of the structure of these cost sharing obligations, they vary roughly in proportion to average per beneficiary
spending in these parts of the program.
The rightmost columns of Figure 4-46 reports estimates of the average
Part A and Part B cost sharing obligations incurred by individuals enrolled in
traditional Medicare under projections issued with the 2009 Trustees Report
and the most recent estimates for 2016.39 Cost sharing obligations through
Medicare Part A in 2016 are on track to be 23 percent lower than projected
in 2009 and cost sharing obligations through Medicare Part B are on track to
be 13 percent lower. Across both Parts A and B, the total estimated reduction
in average cost-sharing obligations in 2016 is $372, bringing the combined
reduction in premium and cost sharing obligations to $708.
The incidence of the cost sharing savings reported in Figure 4-46 will
vary across beneficiaries depending on whether they have supplemental coverage in addition to their Medicare coverage that covers all or part of their
cost sharing. Roughly a fifth of traditional Medicare beneficiaries have no
supplemental coverage and will benefit directly from reduced cost sharing
39 To create these estimates, projections of Medicare’s average cost of providing Part A and
Part B coverage through traditional Medicare in 2016 were obtained from the 2009 and 2016
Medicare Trustees Reports, as were projections of the Part B deductible (Medicare Trustees
2009; Medicare Trustees 2016). For 2009, the estimates were then adjusted to reflect a scenario
in which physician payment rates remained fixed in nominal terms, rather than being cut
sharply as prescribed under the Sustainable Growth Rate formula then in law; projections
for this alternative scenario were published by the CMS Office of the Actuary along with the
2009 Medicare Trustees Report (Clemens, Lizonitz, and Murugesan 2009). Congress routinely
blocked the SGR cuts, so this provides a more accurate picture of the spending trajectory under
the policies in place in 2009. To estimate Part A cost sharing obligations, it was then assumed
that beneficiary cost sharing constituted 8 percent of the total cost of Part A services. This
percentage was estimated using information included in CMS’ annual announcement of Part
A cost sharing parameters; this approach slightly understates actual cost sharing obligations
because it does not account for cost sharing for some small categories of services (CMS 2016c).
To estimate Part B cost sharing liabilities, it was assumed that all beneficiaries use enough
services to pay their full deductible and pay 20 percent coinsurance for all other services; this
approach very slightly overstates actual cost sharing obligations.

294  |  Chapter 4

(KFF 2016). Another fifth of traditional Medicare beneficiaries purchase
individual Medigap coverage and so will see a portion of the cost sharing
savings through lower cost sharing and a portion through lower premiums
for their Medigap plan. Around three-fifths of traditional Medicare beneficiaries receive supplemental coverage through a State Medicaid program or
a former employer. In these cases, a portion of the cost sharing savings may
accrue to the sponsor of that supplemental coverage, although the extent to
which that occurs will depend on each individual’s particular circumstances.
Medicare beneficiaries will see savings in scenarios beyond those
considered here. Beneficiaries enrolled in Part D of Medicare are seeing substantial additional cost sharing savings due to the combination of the ACA’s
provisions closing the coverage gap, which were discussed earlier in this
chapter, and lower-than-expected prescription drugs costs. Those amounts
are not included here because cost sharing obligations vary among Part D
plans, which makes quantifying these savings more challenging. Similarly,
this analysis does not examine cost sharing obligations for Medicare
Advantage enrollees because the structure of cost sharing obligations in
Medicare Advantage varies from plan to plan. In general, however, lower
health care costs will tend to reduce cost sharing obligations for Medicare
Advantage enrollees as well.

A Better Long-Term Fiscal Outlook
Federal and State governments finance a substantial fraction of health
care spending in the United States, primarily through the Medicare and
Medicaid programs, so reductions in health care costs also generate major
savings in the public sector. Indeed, in large part because of the ACA’s
provisions reducing health care spending over the long term, the law has
generated major improvements in the Federal Government’s fiscal outlook,
as depicted in Figure 4-47. CBO estimates imply that the ACA will reduce
deficits by more than $300 billion over the 2016-25 period (CBO 2015a).40
Those savings grow rapidly over time and average 1 percent of GDP—
around $3.5 trillion—over the subsequent decade.
The slowdown in health care cost growth more broadly has led to
additional large improvements in the fiscal outlook. Between August 2010
and August 2016, CBO reduced its projection of net Medicare spending
40 CBO (2015a) estimates how repealing the ACA would affect the deficit. CBO notes that the
deficit increase due to ACA repeal is not exactly equal to the deficit reduction due to the ACA’s
enactment. Most importantly, CBO assumes that, even if the ACA were repealed, reductions in
Medicare payment rates that have already been implemented under the ACA would remain in
place. CBO estimates that these payment rate reductions will generate savings of $160 billion
over the 2016-2025 period. Thus, the estimates presented in Figure 4-47 likely understate the
deficit reduction attributable to the ACA’s enactment.

under current policy in 2020 by $125 billion or 15 percent (CBO 2010a;
CBO 2016a).41 CBO has indicated that the reductions in its projections of
Medicare spending in recent years largely reflect the persistent slow growth
in health care costs (Elmendorf 2013). That $125 billion reduction in projected spending constitutes 0.6 percent of CBO’s current projection of 2020
GDP.
The combination of the deficit savings directly attributable to the
ACA and the savings attributable to the broader slowdown in health care
costs have greatly improved the United States fiscal outlook. In its most
recent long-term budget projections, CBO estimated that the fiscal gap
over the next 30 years—the amount of deficit reduction required to hold
debt constant as a share of GDP over that period—was 1.7 percent of GDP
(CBO 2016b). Without the ACA and the additional reductions in projected
Medicare spending described above, the fiscal gap over this period would
41 For the purposes of this comparison, CBO’s August 2010 baseline projections were adjusted
to reflect the continuation of routine fixes to the Sustainable Growth Rate formula used to
set Medicare physician payment rates. This adjustment was based upon the nominal freeze
scenario reported in CBO’s April 2010 Sustainable Growth Rate menu (CBO 2010b).

have been approximately 1.5 percent of GDP larger, nearly doubling the
fiscal gap over that period.42
These improvements in the long-run fiscal outlook will have important benefits for the economy. Reductions in long-term deficits increase
national saving, which increases capital accumulation and reduces foreign
borrowing, and thereby increase national income and living standards
over time. Alternatively, reduced spending on health care could obviate the
need to take other steps that would damage overall economic performance
and well-being, such as reducing spending on infrastructure, education, or
scientific research or increasing taxes on low- and middle-income families.
42 For this calculation, the ACA’s effect on the deficit was estimated based on CBO’s June 2015
estimate of ACA repeal (CBO 2015a). For 2016-2025, the year-by-year deficit effects reported
in the CBO estimate were used directly. For subsequent years, the ACA was assumed to reduce
the deficit by 1 percent of GDP, consistent with CBO’s statement that ACA repeal would
increase the deficit by around 1 percent of GDP on average over the decade starting in 2026;
this assumption is conservative since the ACA’s deficit reducing effects are likely to continue
to grow beyond the second decade. The path of deficit savings associated with the reductions
in projected Medicare spending from August 2010 to August 2016 reflects the difference in the
year-by-year savings through 2020. Thereafter, these savings are assumed to grow at the rate
projected for net Medicare spending in CBO’s most recent long-term budget projections (CBO
2016b). All calculations reported here use the economic assumptions reported in those longterm budget projections.

Reforming the Health Care System  |  297

The reforms included in the ACA and the broader slowdown in health
care cost growth have also improved the fiscal outlook for the Medicare
program. In 2009, the year before the ACA became law, Medicare’s Trustees
forecast that the trust fund the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund
would be exhausted in 2017. As of the Medicare Trustees most recent report,
that date has been pushed back 11 years, to 2028, as depicted in Figure 4-48.

Conclusion
The evidence presented in this chapter demonstrates that the United
States has made historic progress in expanding health insurance coverage
and reforming the health care delivery system and that those gains are
due in large part to the ACA and other actions implemented under this
Administration. Recent years’ reforms have also succeeded in creating the
tools needed to support further progress on both of these dimensions. As
the President has noted, however, fully seizing that opportunity will require
continued thoughtful implementation by the Executive Branch, targeted legislative improvements by Congress, and constructive engagement by states
and localities (Obama 2016). Whether and how policymakers rise to that
challenge will have profound implications for the health care system and, by
extension, Americans’ health and economic well-being in the years to come.

IN VESTING IN HIGHER
EDUCATION
Introduction

T

he Obama Administration has been committed to ensuring that all students, regardless of their background, have access to a college education
that prepares them for success in the workplace and in life. A high-quality
education is often more than just the first step in one’s career; it can be one
of the most important investments young people can make in their futures.
College graduates enjoy an earnings premium that is at a historical high,
reflecting a trend over several decades of increasing demand for skilled
workers (Figure 5-1). In 2015, the median full-time, full-year worker over
age 25 with a bachelor’s degree (but no higher degree) earned roughly 70
percent more than a worker with just a high school degree (CPS ASEC, CEA
calculations). Moreover, people with a college degree are more likely to be
employed—benefitting from both lower unemployment rates and higher
rates of labor force participation.
But despite the high average returns to a college degree, Federal policy
in higher education has had to confront several longer-term challenges.
Research shows that college enrollments have not kept up with the rising
demand for college-related skills in the workplace (Goldin and Katz 2008).
This suggests that, on the whole, Americans are investing too little in higher
education. At the same time, some students who attend college do not reap
the high returns, especially when they attend low-quality programs or fail
to complete a degree. The challenges of investing in higher education are
particularly acute for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, who are
less likely both to enroll in college and to complete a high-quality program.
And as a growing number of students borrow to finance their education, too
many struggle to manage their debt.

As President Obama took office, the challenges to ensuring broad
access to a quality college education were intensified by the Great Recession.
Rising unemployment lowered the implicit cost of forgoing earnings to
attend college, and many sought to invest in higher education to improve
their skills and job prospects. But at the same time, State budgets declined,
exacerbating the trend of rising tuitions at public institutions and stretching
funding capacity at low-cost community colleges. The changing market also
fostered further expansion of the for-profit college sector, where many colleges offer low-quality programs.
Over the past eight years, the Obama Administration has met these
challenges with a complementary set of evidence-based policies and reforms.
These policies have been instrumental in helping students from all backgrounds finance investments in higher education and in helping to improve
the quality of those investments. To help expand college opportunity, the
President doubled investments in grant and scholarship aid through Pell
Grants and tax credits. To help more students choose a college that provides
a worthwhile investment, the Administration provided more comprehensive
and accessible information about college costs and outcomes through the
College Scorecard, simplified the Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA), and protected students from low-quality schools through a package of important consumer protection regulations including the landmark
300  |  Chapter 5

Gainful Employment regulations. To help borrowers manage debt after college, income-driven repayment options like the President’s Pay As You Earn
(PAYE) plan have capped monthly student loan payments at as little as 10
percent of discretionary income to better align the timing of loan payments
with the timing of earnings benefits.
The benefits of some of these policies are already evident today, while
many more will be realized over the coming decades. For example, Council
of Economic Advisers’ (CEA) analysis finds that the Pell Grant expansions
since 2008–09 enabled at least 250,000 students to access or complete a college degree during the 2014–15 award year, leading to an additional $20 billion in aggregate earnings (CEA 2016c). This represents a nearly 2:1 return
on the investment. In addition, millions more will benefit from lower college
costs and improved college quality in the future.
This chapter begins by surveying the evidence on the individual and
societal returns to higher education, as well as the challenges to ensuring
that all students have an opportunity to benefit from attending college
regardless of their background. It then describes the many ways in which the
Administration’s policies have addressed these challenges, concluding with a
discussion of next steps to build on this progress.

The Economic Rationale for Federal Policies
and Reforms to Support Higher Education
A large body of evidence shows that, on average, college attendance
yields high returns to individuals and, importantly, benefits society as well.
Typically, the individual returns far exceed the costs of a degree, offering
individuals a strong incentive to invest in higher education. Even in good
economic times, however, individuals face many barriers that deter investment, and the potential benefits of higher education would often go unrealized in the absence of Federal policies. The barriers to finding, financing, and
accessing high-quality education options are especially high for those from
low-income families, first-generation college families, and other disadvantaged groups. As President Obama took office in 2009, the Great Recession
intensified these challenges. Although more Americans than ever wished to
enroll in college, they were stymied by financial hardship, rising tuitions,
variation in program quality, lack of information to help them make good
choices, and a Federal student aid system that had become so complex that
many eligible students did not apply (Page and Scott-Clayton 2015). This
setting called for a new set of policies and reforms to the existing system of
Federal student aid.

Individual Returns to Higher Education
While research suggests that college graduates experience a wide range
of non-monetary benefits such as greater health and happiness (Oreopoulos
and Salvanes 2011), a primary benefit that motivates most students is the
expected gain in future earnings (Eagan et al. 2014; Fishman 2015). Over a
career, the median full-time, full-year worker over age 25 with a bachelor’s
degree earns nearly $1 million more than the same type of worker with just
a high school diploma (CPS ASEC, CEA calculations). That worker with an
associate degree earns about $330,000 more. The present values of these earnings premiums are also high, amounting to roughly $510,000 and $160,000
for bachelor’s and associate degrees, respectively.1 As shown in Figure 5-2
below, the present value of the additional lifetime earnings far exceeds the
cost of tuition. Although tuition does not capture all of the costs of a college
education—in particular, it does not capture the opportunity cost of forgone
earnings while in school—even when those costs are included, the present
value of added earnings typically exceeds the cumulative total cost of college
by an order of magnitude (Avery and Turner 2012).
The earnings differentials shown in Figure 5-2 are caused, at least in
part, by factors other than educational attainment. For example, students
who attend college may have been more skilled or have better networks
and, thus, would earn more regardless of their education. But a body of
rigorous economic research supports the conclusion that higher education does indeed cause large increases in future earnings. Using a range of
sophisticated techniques to compare individuals who differ in their educational achievement but who are otherwise similar in their earnings potential,
researchers have estimated that individuals who attend college earn between
5 to 15 percent more on average per year of college than they would if they
had not gone to college.2
Importantly, some research also suggests that the returns to college
have been just as high, if not higher, for “marginal students”—that is, students who are on the border of either attending or completing college versus
not doing so. These students often come from low-income families and
their decisions hinge on the perceived cost or accessibility of college. Early
studies used variation in college proximity to identify the returns to college
and found especially large returns to students for whom proximity was a
decisive factor (Kane and Rouse 1993; Card 1995). A more recent study by

percent, corresponding with the current interest rate on undergraduate loans.

Zimmerman (2014) compares students whose GPAs are either just above or
just below the threshold for admission to Florida International University,
a four-year school with the lowest admissions standards in the Florida
State University System. This study finds that “marginal students” who are
admitted to the school experience sizable earnings gains over those who just
miss the cutoff and are thus unlikely to attend any four-year college, translating into meaningful returns net of costs and especially high returns for
low-income students. Using a similar methodology, Ost, Pan, and Webber
(2016) study the benefit of completing college among low-performing
students whose GPAs are close to the cutoff for dismissal at 13 public universities in Ohio. They find substantial earnings benefits for those who just
pass the cutoff and complete their degree. Turner (2015) similarly finds that
women who attend college after receiving welfare benefits experience large
and significant earnings gains if they complete credentials.
In addition to higher earnings, college graduates are also more likely
to work than high school graduates. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
summarized in Figure 5-3, show that college graduates with at least a bachelor’s degree participate in the labor force at a higher rate than high school

graduates (74 vs. 57 percent in 2015)3 and also face a lower unemployment
rate among those who participate (2.6 vs. 5.4 percent in 2015). As a result,
people over the age of 25 with a bachelor’s degree or higher are 30 percent
more likely to be working than those with only a high school degree. A
somewhat smaller but still sizeable employment premium is seen for those
with some college but without a bachelor’s degree.4 Consistent with college
premiums in both earnings and employment, Haskins, Isaacs, and Sawhill
(2008) find that individuals with college degrees have increased odds of
moving up the economic ladder to achieve a higher level of income compared with their parents.
Overall, higher education helps Americans become more productive
in the labor market, building the skills our economy demands and establishing a stronger foundation for the economic prosperity and security of our
families and communities. Although the large individual returns to college
imply that individuals have strong incentives to invest in higher education,
much of the potential benefit of higher education would go unrealized in
the absence of Federal policies to support these investments due to positive

about educational attainment and labor force participation (CEA 2014, 2016e).

externalities, credit constraints, and information failures and procedural
complexities.

Positive Externalities
An individual’s postsecondary education level has spillover benefits
to others in society that the individual does not capture; that is, positive
“externalities.” Since individuals usually do not consider the societal benefits
when deciding whether to attend college, such externalities are an important
motive for Federal student aid.
These societal benefits, while hard to quantify, are numerous and
potentially very large (Baum, Ma, and Payea 2013; Hill, Hoffman, and Rex
2005; OECD 2013). Higher individual earnings yield higher tax revenue
and lower government expenditure on transfer programs. Further, research
shows that increased educational attainment can lead to higher levels of volunteering and voting (Dee 2004), lower levels of criminal behavior (Lochner
and Moretti 2004), and improved health (Cutler and Lleras-Muney 2006;
McCrary and Royer 2011). Individual investments in education can benefit
other members of society through reduced victimization, and lower health
care and law enforcement costs. Other social contributions associated with
higher education—such as teaching, inventions, or public service—also are
not fully captured by the individual’s wages. Finally, research shows that
when individuals invest in their own college education, they can actually
make other workers more productive. A study by Moretti (2004) finds that
increasing the share of college graduates in a labor market leads to significant increases in the productivity and wages of others where those college
graduates live and work. Indeed, research using international comparisons
suggest that the cognitive skills or “knowledge capital” of a nation are essential to long-run prosperity and growth (Hanushek and Woessmann 2015).

Credit Constraints
While the social benefits of education provide a strong justification
for Federal support, equally important is the fact that, even when the private
returns to a college education are high, the private market is often unwilling to supply educational loans—especially to students from low-income
families. A key reason for this market failure is that the knowledge, skills,
and enhanced earnings potential that a student obtains from going to college
cannot be offered as collateral to secure the loan. The lack of a physical asset
makes educational loans very different from mortgages or automobile loans,
which provide lenders with recourse in the form of foreclosure or repossession if the borrower is unable to repay. For this reason, the private market

Investing in Higher Education  |  305

alone would supply an inefficiently low amount of credit for the purpose of
financing education.
From an individual’s perspective, attending college makes financial
sense whenever the present value of the benefits outweighs the present value
of the costs, when both are discounted based on preferences for current outcomes versus future outcomes. But while the benefits of attending college are
spread out over a long future, most of the costs—including both the direct
cost of tuition and fees and the foregone earnings while in school—must be
paid up front. While some students are able to finance their college educations through savings or help from their families, many need to borrow to
make the investment.
A major function of the Federal student loan system is to ease the
credit constraints caused by imperfections in the private loan market,
thereby ensuring broad access to affordable college loans and a means to
invest in one’s future earnings potential.5 However, while the student loan
system has helped to alleviate credit constraints at the time of college enrollment, the traditional standard repayment plan’s 10-year repayment period,
with equal payments due each month, does not account for income volatility or dynamics once the student has left school. As a result, this standard
plan—in which students are enrolled by default—may adversely affect some
students’ investment decisions and hinder others from successfully managing their debt.
The constraint imposed by the 10-year repayment plan is illustrated
in Figure 5-4, which shows the lifetime earnings trajectory of a typical
bachelor’s degree recipient working full-time and year-round from age 25
to retirement. As the Figure shows, there is a strong positive relationship
between age and earnings. This relationship is especially strong for those
with a bachelor’s degree and it persists for at least 15 to 20 years after many
students graduate from college. In short, a college investment pays off over
several decades, and a 10-year repayment window forces borrowers to pay
the costs at a time when only a small share of the benefits have been realized. Indeed, the discounted values for the earnings levels used in Figure 5-4
suggest that less than a third of the earnings gains over a 40-year career are
realized during the standard repayment window.
5 Although a private loan market exists, the loans typically require a co-signer and often do not
come with the consumer protections that Federal loans have, including discharge in instances of
death or permanent disability. Today the private market constitutes only a small share of student
loans—in 2012, 6 percent of undergraduates used private loans to finance their education
(NPSAS 2012, CEA tabulations). In the 2000s, private student loans accounted for a larger share
of student loans; see CFPB (2012) for a detailed analysis about how and why the private market
for student loans has changed over the last decade.

While many borrowers who work when they leave school earn enough
to pay their student debt on the standard 10-year plan,6 there is significant
variation both in the size of student loans and in the returns to college.
Further, because borrowers may face temporary unemployment or low
earnings—especially at the start of their career (Abel and Deitz 2016)—some
borrowers are needlessly constrained if they remain on the standard plan.
Such considerations are especially pertinent to recent cohorts of students
who graduated during or shortly after the Great Recession. Research shows
that college graduates entering the labor market during a recession tend to
experience sizeable negative income shocks, and that it can take years to
recover (Kahn 2010; Oreopoulos, von Wachter, and Heisz 2012; Wozniak
2010). Young workers are often the ones affected more severely by recessions (Hoynes, Miller, and Schaller 2012; Forsythe 2016; Kroeger, Cooke,
and Gould 2016). A short repayment window could therefore lead to poor
loan outcomes for these students despite a longer-term ability to repay.
6 CEA calculations using the CPS ASEC and NPSAS 2012 show that at age 25, the earnings
premium seen by a typical bachelor’s degree recipient working full-time and year-round is
$16,000 a year, well above the $3,500 annual payment corresponding to a typical debt amount of
about $27,000. Similarly, for an associate degree, the annual earnings premium of roughly $3,000
is above the annual payment of $1,500 associated with the typical amount of about $11,000 that
students borrow for this type of degree.

Investing in Higher Education  |  307

The economics literature provides some evidence that credit constraints faced by students upon graduation can affect career choices. In
particular, Rothstein and Rouse (2011) find that having more debt to repay
reduces the probability that graduates choose lower-paid public interest
jobs, especially jobs in education. Similarly, Luo and Mongey (2016) estimate that larger student debt burdens cause individuals to take higher-wage
jobs at the expense of job satisfaction, likely due to credit constraints after
graduating, and that this reduces their well-being.

Information Failures and Procedural Complexities
Yet another obstacle that prevents some individuals from making
high-return investments in college is limited information about the associated benefits and costs, which leads to poor decisions and to underinvestment. Survey-based research yields mixed findings on whether students
underestimate or overestimate the returns to college (Betts 1996; Wiswall
and Zafar 2013; Baker et al. 2016) but suggests that students generally view
their future earnings as uncertain (Dominitz and Manski 1996). Consistent
with this view, one study estimates that only 60 percent of the variability
in returns to schooling can be forecasted (Cunha, Heckman, and Navarro
2005).
Underlying this uncertainty about the return to college is the fact
that, while this return is high on average, it is also quite variable. This variation is illustrated in Figure 5-5, which shows the distribution of earnings
by educational attainment. For example, while workers with a bachelor’s
degree are far more likely to have greater earnings than those with only a
high school diploma, there is a fraction whose earnings are similar to the
earnings of those with only a high school diploma. Ten percent of workers
age 35 to 44 with a bachelor’s degree had earnings under $20,000, compared
with 25 percent of workers with only a high school diploma (CPS ASEC,
CEA Calculations).
The variation in the returns to college is driven by a number of
factors; however, one important determinant of both the variability and
student uncertainty about these returns is the large variation in the quality
of schools and programs of study—which can be hard for potential students
to assess. A growing body of literature shows that college quality matters
both for completion and for earnings,7 with some pointing to relatively poor
returns at for-profit institutions (Cellini and Turner 2016). Studies have
also estimated highly variable returns by college major for bachelor’s degree
recipients (for example, Altonji, Blom, and Meghir 2012), and others have
7 For example, see Bound, Lovenheim, and Turner (2010); Cohodes and Goodman (2014);
Goodman, Hurwitz, and Smith (2015); Hoekstra (2009).

found that students’ forecast errors regarding earnings differences across
majors can affect their major choice (Arcidiacono, Hotz, and Kang 2012).
The effects of poor information and large, difficult-to-forecast variation in earnings can be particularly detrimental since students cannot diversify their college enrollment selections. That is, students generally attend
only one school at a time and focus on one or two programs. If they make a
poor selection of college or major, it is costly to switch, as it can be difficult
to transfer credits. This can potentially lock students into a low-quality program. For some students, the uncertainty of returns itself may prevent them
from enrolling in the first place if they are sufficiently risk-averse (Heckman,
Lochner, and Todd 2006). The combination of high variability and uncertainty with limited ability to diversify means that some students will realize
small, or even negative returns, from college even if the expected return
is high. The associated uncertainty may also cause risk-averse students to
invest less than they otherwise would in their education.
Prospective students also lack good information about costs. Students
often overestimate college costs—with low-income and first-generation prospective students overestimating the cost by as much as two or three times
the actual amount (Avery and Kane 2004)—and parents overestimate costs
as well (Grodsky and Jones 2007). Moreover, Hastings et al. (2015) find that

Investing in Higher Education  |  309

students who overestimate costs are less likely to enroll in, and complete, a
degree program, confirming that misinformation about costs can be a barrier to investing in college.
When attempting to assess the costs of college, an important obstacle
for many students is the complexity of the financial-aid system (Lavecchia,
Liu, and Oreopoulos 2015). Behavioral economics show that onerous processes can impact choices, especially when the individuals making decisions
are young (Thaler and Mullainathan 2008; Casey, Jones, and Somerville
2011), and can therefore prevent some students who would benefit from
investing in college from doing so. In a study of Boston public school
students, Avery and Kane (2004) find evidence that low-income students
are discouraged by the procedural complexity of applying both financial
aid and admission into college, even if they are qualified and enthusiastic
about going to college. These findings are consistent with those of Dynarski
and Scott-Clayton (2006), who use lessons from tax theory and behavioral
economics to show that the complexity of the FAFSA is a serious obstacle
to both the efficiency and equity in the distribution of student aid. Page and
Scott-Clayton (2015) calculate that 30 percent of college students who would
qualify for a Pell Grant fail to file the FAFSA, which is required to receive a
Pell Grant.

The Role of Family Income
Overall, the evidence points to a number of factors—including social
externalities, credit constraints, poor information, and complexity—that
cause some individuals to invest too little in their educations or to otherwise
make poor education investment choices. Importantly, these factors do not
affect all students equally; they are all more likely to affect disadvantaged
individuals. First, students from low-income families, with lower levels of
savings, are more likely to be credit constrained and, thus, in need of student
loans. Further, the costs of financial-aid complexity also fall most heavily
on disadvantaged students, who may have fewer resources available to help
them navigate the system (Dynarski and Scott-Clayton 2006). Similarly,
research shows that low-income students are less likely to accurately estimate the costs and returns to college (Avery and Kane 2004; Grodsky and
Jones 2007; Horn, Chen, and Chapman 2003; Hoxby and Turner 2015). In
part, this may reflect the lack of detailed information in popular sources like
U.S. News and World Report on many colleges disproportionately attended
by low-income students. In addition to the barriers they face specific to
higher education, low-income students are less likely to receive a PreK-12
education that prepares them for college, making college access and success
an even greater challenge for these individuals. New research shows that,

Box 5-1: Anti-Poverty Efforts and Educational Attainment
Research suggests that this Administration’s anti-poverty efforts
will help expand college access and success, either directly through
improving college outcomes or indirectly through improved childhood
health and academic performance. Clear evidence supports the expansions of Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP),
the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP).
Medicaid/CHIP improves early childhood health and protects
families facing health problems from financial hardship (Currie 2000;
Kaestner 2009; Kaestner, Racine, and Joyce 2000; Dave et al. 2015;
Finkelstein et al. 2012), both of which are positively associated with
higher educational attainment (Case, Fertig, and Paxson 2005). Cohodes
et al. (2016) find that a 10 percentage-point increase in Medicaid/CHIP
eligibility for children increase college enrollment by 0.5 percent and
increases the four-year college attainment rate by about 2.5 percent.
Brown, Kowalski, and Lurie (2015) also find that female children with
more years of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility are significantly more likely
to attend college. In his first month in office, President Obama signed
the Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, which
provided additional tools and enhanced financial support to help states
cover more children through Medicaid and CHIP, and subsequent legislation has extended funding for CHIP through fiscal year (FY) 2017. In
parallel, the Affordable Care Act’s comprehensive coverage expansions
through Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplaces are helping
to ensure all children and their families have access to affordable, highquality health insurance coverage.
The EITC reduces the amount of taxes that qualified working
people with low to moderate income owe and provides refunds to many
of these individuals. It has been shown to raise student test scores (Dahl
and Lochner 2012) and future educational attainment. Research finds
that raising the maximum EITC by $1,000 increases the probability of
completing one or more years of college by age 19 by 1.4 percentage
points (Maxfield 2013) and of completing a bachelor’s degree among
18–23 year olds by 0.3 percentage point (Michelmore 2013). For families
whose household income lies near the EITC eligibility cutoff, another
study provides evidence that a $1,000 increase in credits received during
the spring of their senior year of high school increases college enrollment
the following fall by 0.5 percentage point (Manoli and Turner 2014).
Through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the Recovery
Act), President Obama expanded the EITC for families with more than
two children and for working couples, and he made these expansions

Investing in Higher Education  |  311

permanent in 2015; the refundable portion of the Child Tax Credit
(CTC) was also expanded in parallel with these changes. Together, the
EITC and CTC improvements reduce the extent or severity of poverty
for about 8 million children each year.
Research has found that lower family food budgets are associated
with greater discipline problems and lower test scores among school-age
children (CEA 2015b). SNAP provides nutrition assistance to millions of
eligible, low-income individuals and families and helps to combat these
problems. A study by Almond, Hoynes, and Schanzenbach (2016) finds
that early childhood access to the Food Stamp Program (as SNAP was
previously known) led to higher rates of high school completion among
children who grew up in disadvantaged households. By expanding SNAP
benefits in the Recovery Act, President Obama prevented hundreds of
thousands of families from experiencing food insecurity (Nord and Prell
2011), enabling more children to be well-nourished and prepared for
school.

among individuals with similar ability, those from low socioeconomic backgrounds are less likely to complete college than their higher socioeconomic
peers and, as a result, they tend not to realize their full potential in the labor
market (Papageorge and Thom 2016).
In light of the evidence, many of the Administration’s policies have
been targeted at removing barriers to education for those who face the
greatest challenges, and so represent the largest opportunities for improved
efficiency and equity. The remainder of this chapter describes the set of evidence-based policies enacted and proposed by the Obama Administration
to help correct market failures and to improve the investment decisions and
outcomes of all students who wish to invest in higher education.

Key Accomplishments
Over the last eight years, the Obama Administration has made great
strides to help students make more effective investments in higher education.
These efforts have been guided by the available evidence and have addressed
the challenges identified above by helping to offset the cost of college, reducing credit constraints and improving student debt outcomes, providing
better information about the costs and benefits of colleges, simplifying the
financial aid application process, and holding the most poorly performing
colleges accountable. In addition, Administration efforts to improve PreK12 outcomes have aimed to better prepare students for college and their
312  |  Chapter 5

careers. Some of the effects of these policies are already evident today, while
many more will be realized over the coming decades. Despite these important steps, more work remains to ensure that all interested students have the
opportunity to pursue higher education, and that they can do so affordably.

Helping Students Pay for College
At the onset of the Great Recession, the college earnings premium was
near a historical high and the number of Americans who wished to attend
college was rising. But at the same time, falling tax revenues and State budget
shortfalls led to sharp declines in State funding for public institutions, which
in turn contributed to rising tuitions and fees (Figure 5-6; Mitchell, Palacios,
and Leachman 2014). While the costs of college were increasingly shifted to
students through higher tuition, rising unemployment and financial hardship also meant more families faced credit constraints and uncertainty as to
whether a college investment was feasible. With large returns at stake, reducing the cost of college became an urgent priority and an early cornerstone of
this Administration’s higher education policy.

Investments in Grant and Tax Aid
Since coming into office, President Obama has worked aggressively
with Congress to increase the maximum Pell Grant award, the primary form
of financial aid for many students. On average, Pell Grants reduced the cost
of college by $3,700 for over 8 million students last year. Pell Grant funding
increased by more than $12 billion from award year 2008–09 to 2014–15, a
67 percent increase, and the maximum Pell Grant award has increased by
roughly $1,000 (Figure 5-7). Moreover, for the first time, Pell Grant funding
has been tied to inflation to ensure the value of the aid does not fall over
time.
A growing body of research confirms the potential for need-based
grants to improve college access and success.8 For example, Dynarski (2003)
examines the elimination of the Social Security Student Benefit Program in
1982, and her estimates suggest that an offer of $1,000 in grant aid increases
the probability of attending college by about 3.6 percentage points and
appears to increase school completion. Abraham and Clark (2006) find similar impacts on college attendance in their study of the District of Columbia
Tuition Assistance Grant Program instituted in 1999. A more recent study
that examines the effects of a need-based program in Florida with a strict
8 A few early studies focusing on the initial implementation of the Pell Grant find mixed results
(Hansen 1983; Kane 1996; Seftor and Turner 2002; Bettinger 2004); however, the initial benefits
of the program may have been limited by the newness of the program and the complexity of the
eligibility rules and application process. These complexities have been reduced in recent years.

eligibility cutoff likewise finds significant increases in four-year college
enrollment and completion (Castleman and Long 2013).
Using these studies to estimate the effects of this Administration’s
expansions of Pell Grants, CEA analysis finds that the Pell Grant expansions
since the 2008–09 award year led at least 250,000 students to attend college
or complete a college degree in 2014–15 who would have not otherwise
done so. The increase in educational attainment among these students
translates to an additional $20 billion in aggregate earnings, representing
a nearly 2:1 return on the investment. However, the actual returns on the
Administration’s Pell Grant investments are likely even larger, as this estimate does not account for social externalities from increased educational
attainment nor for other benefits to those receiving larger Pell Grants,
including the opportunity to select from a broader range of options, spend
more time on school instead of work, and finish sooner (see the Appendix
of CEA 2016c for more details on this calculation).
The Administration has also reduced taxes for low- and middleincome families that attend college. Under the 2009 Recovery Act, the
Administration established the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC),
which provides a maximum credit of $2,500 a year—or up to $10,000 over
four years—to expand and replace the Hope higher education credit. Along
with providing a more generous credit, the AOTC also is partially refundable and thus provides more benefits for low-income households that do not
owe any income taxes. Before the AOTC, only 5 percent of credit and tuition
deduction dollars went to filers with incomes under $25,000; by 2014, that
share had risen to 23 percent (Dynarski and Scott-Clayton 2016; College
Board 2016b). Although research shows that the AOTC has little impact on
college enrollment (Hoxby and Bulman 2015; Bulman and Hoxby 2015), the
credit lowers the costs of college for millions of students and their families;
in 2016, the AOTC cut taxes by over $1,800 on average for nearly 10 million
families. The bipartisan tax agreement that President Obama signed into law
in 2015 made the AOTC permanent as part of a package that collectively
provided about 24 million working and middle-class families a year each
with a tax cut of about $1,000.
Due in part to the Administration’s historic investments in grant and
tax aid, the net price of college that students are responsible for paying grew
far more slowly than the published cost of attendance between award years
2008–09 and 2016–17 (Figure 5-8). Although more work remains to make
college more affordable, the impact of the Administration’s Pell Grant and
tax credit expansions have helped lower the cost of college for millions of
students and their families.

America’s College Promise
Although investments in grant and tax aid have helped make college
more affordable for many students, too many families still feel as if college
is out of reach. To ensure that all responsible students are able to attend
college, President Obama unveiled his America’s College Promise (ACP)
plan in January 2015 to make two years of community college free for
hard-working students. Over 1,300 American community colleges provide
over 40 percent of undergraduates with educations that deepen their knowledge, make them more informed citizens, and lead to a quality, affordable
degree or credential that improves their opportunities in the labor market.
If all states participate in the President’s ACP plan, an estimated 9 million
students could benefit from such an education, and a full-time community
college student could save an average of $3,800 in tuition each year.
In fewer than two years since the President challenged more states and
communities to make America’s College Promise a reality for their students,
at least 38 Promise programs—or free community college programs—have
launched in states, cities, and community colleges in all corners of the United
States (Figure 5-9), increasing the total estimated number of Promise programs to more than 150 across the country. Altogether these new programs
are raising more than $150 million in new public and private investments

316  |  Chapter 5

Box 5-2: Federal Investments in K-12 Education during the Recession
As the effects of the Great Recession set in, public universities were
not alone in suffering the consequences of declining State revenues;
almost all states found that their projected revenues were insufficient to
achieve their education plans. As a result, since State and local governments provide about 90 percent of school funding, officials were preparing for significant funding cuts for K-12 teachers, principals, and support
staff, in addition to higher education personnel. Such cuts would have
severely disrupted educational services for many of America’s students
(EOP 2009).
In response to the fiscal crisis, the Recovery Act appropriated more
than $60 million to State education agencies. In doing so, it shielded
schools from the worst effects of their States’ budgetary shortfalls (Evans,
Schwab, and Wagner 2014). While funding alone is not a panacea for
solving problems in K-12 education, research suggests it is a necessary
component. If invested in the most productive inputs, it can contribute
to improved educational outcomes, especially for students living in
poverty (Jackson, Johnson, and Persico 2016; LaFortune, Rothstein, and
Schanzenbach 2016). A key way in which increased Recovery Act funding helped improve outcomes was by keeping experienced teachers in
the classroom and staving off increases in class sizes. It enabled states to
save or create more than 400,000 jobs, most of which were for teachers,
principals, and other school staff. Research finds that students in smaller
classrooms in the early grades perform higher on standardized tests, earn
higher wages, and are more likely to attend college than peers in larger
classrooms (Chetty et al. 2011), and that the effects may be larger for
minorities and low-income students (Krueger 1999). Due to the swift
action of the Obama Administration, states were provided the resources
to keep teachers in the classroom and ensure that students had the educational services necessary to succeed.
In addition, the Recovery Act was able to catalyze a wave of reform
through targeted investments. The Race to the Top initiative, which
offered incentives to states willing to spur systemic reform to improve
teaching and learning in their schools, led nearly every state to raise the
bar on expectations for student learning, and an independent analysis
found that Race to the Top led to significant changes in education policy
across the United States (Howell 2015). Other Administration programs,
such as the Investing in Innovation Fund (i3), focused funding on
evidence-based interventions that could be validated by high-quality
evaluations and, if proven successful, could be scaled up.

in community colleges to serve at least 180,000 students; and the number
of free community college programs continues to grow. Additionally, at the
Federal level, both the House and the Senate have proposed legislation to
expand Promise programs nationwide.
Free community college promotes college access not only by reducing
financial barriers,9 but also by eliminating barriers related to misinformation
about college costs (Baum and Scott-Clayton 2015). By clearly messaging that
a post-secondary education is within reach, Promise programs help students
cross the first hurdle to applying and enrolling in college. Removing such
barriers at community colleges is especially important, as community college
students tend to be poorer than students attending four-year schools—over
half of community college students have family incomes below 185 percent
of the Federal poverty line—and are less likely to have parents who attended
college to help them navigate the student aid application process (NPSAS
2012, CEA tabulations). Indeed, research shows that Promise programs have
been highly effective, which is why the President proposed his vision for free
community college in America’s College Promise.
9 Researchers have found that students facing lower community college prices are more likely to
enroll in college (Denning 2016b; Martorell, McCall, and McFarlin 2014).

318  |  Chapter 5

Evaluations of early local Promise programs show that these programs
can significantly improve high school graduation, college enrollment, and
college graduation rates. A number of research studies have examined
the effects of Kalamazoo Promise, the first place-based Promise program.
Initiated in 2005, Kalamazoo Promise offers full in-state college tuition to
graduates of the Kalamazoo Public Schools in Michigan who have enrolled
in the district for at least four years. Using variation in high school eligibility,
length of enrollment in the school district, and/or the timing of the program’s announcement and implementation, researchers have found that the
program reduced suspensions in high school, improved high school credit
completion, led to students sending their test scores to more selective instate institutions, and substantially increased college enrollment and graduation (Andrews, DesJardins and Ranchhod 2010; Bartik and Lachowska 2013;
Bartik, Hershbein, and Lachowska 2015; Miller-Adams 2009). Research suggests that the program has had a high rate of return, particularly for African
American students (Bartik, Hershbein, and Lachowska 2016).
Carruthers and Fox (2016) likewise find large positive effects of
another Promise program. Knox Achieves covered the gap between tuition
and fees and grant aid from Federal, State, and institutional sources to firstyear community college students making an immediate transition between
high school and one of Tennessee’s public community colleges or technology centers. Comparing outcomes before and after the program began
between students in eligible districts and students in non-eligible districts,
Carruthers and Fox find large impacts on high school graduation and college
enrollment, with some shift from the four-year to two-year sector. The positive effects of high school graduation and college enrollment were strongest
for lower-achieving and lower-income students. Given the success of Knox
Achieves, 27 counties adopted the program to expand eligibility to nearly
half of Tennessee’s population in 2014, and the program became the model
for the state-wide Tennessee Promise program rolled out in 2015, which
guarantees free community college tuition and fees to high school seniors
who sign up, apply for financial aid, and meet with a mentor. Analyses of
Promise programs in New York, Pittsburgh, El Dorado, and New Haven also
show sizeable effects on educational outcomes (Scrivener et al. 2015; Page
and Iritri 2016; Ritter and Ash 2016; Gonzalez et al. 2014; Daugherty and
Gonzelez 2016).
The economics literature suggests that program design matters, and
some Promise initiatives may see less success. For example, LeGower and
Walsh (2014) suggest that merit-based Promise programs may have more
limited effects on college access as they disproportionately benefit wealthier
and white households. An analysis of one program, which provides free

Box 5-3: Expansions of Early Education Programs
The Administration has been committed to helping students access
a high-quality education at all levels of schooling, and the President’s calls
for universal preschool and a child care guarantee for working families
with young children serve as critical complements to his other proposals. Gaps in educational achievement occur early in life and grow over
time, so it is critical to ensure that all children receive the educational
foundation to succeed in school and life. On nearly every measure of
school readiness, from health to early human capital, children born into
low-income households enter kindergarten at a substantial disadvantage
relative to their higher-income peers. Indeed, disparities in physical
and mental health, cognition, and socio-emotional and behavioral skills
develop in children as young as 9 months (Halle et al. 2009). By the time
children enter school around age 5, those in poor households are nearly
four times more likely to score “very low” on assessments of math skills
and over four times more likely to score “very low”’ on reading skills than
their peers in more well-off households (Isaacs 2012). This gap remains
relatively constant through the beginning of high school, suggesting that
achievement gaps in later years are established in the earliest years of
childhood (CEA 2016a).
Research shows that enrollment in high-quality early childhood
education accelerates cognitive and non-cognitive development during
primary school years (see CEA 2016a for a review), and can lead to
significantly better outcomes later in life—such as greater educational
attainment and earnings and less involvement with the criminal justice
system (for example, Heckman et al. 2010; Reynolds et al. 2011; Campbell
et al. 2012). That is why, in addition to calling for preschool for all and
high-quality care for all infants and toddlers, the Obama Administration
has worked with Congress to increase investments in early childhood
programs by over $6 billion from FY 2009 to FY 2016, including highquality preschool, Head Start, early Head Start, child care subsidies,
evidence-based home visiting, and programs for infants and toddlers
with disabilities. Since 2009, 38 States and the District of Columbia have
increased investments in preschool programs by more than $1.5 billion.

community college only to students with at least a 3.0 high school GPA
who test out of remediation, found that these conditions limited eligibility
to only about 15 percent of the city’s high school graduates (Page and ScottClayton 2015; Fain 2014). Additionally, research finds that reducing the cost
of lower-quality options can worsen outcomes for students, so attention
to college quality in the context of lowering prices to students is essential
(Peltzman 1973). A recent Department of Education report (2016a), the
320  |  Chapter 5

America’s College Promise Playbook, outlines the best evidence available
to inform design features that localities creating Promise programs should
consider. The report exemplifies the Administration’s commitment to
expanding quality free community college through Promise programs at the
local, State, and National level.

Reducing Credit Constraints and Improving Student Debt
Outcomes
While the Administration has worked aggressively to lower the cost
of college, it has also taken important steps to ensure that students can
access credit to finance their college educations. For a growing number of
Americans, Federal student loans are an essential means to realizing the benefits of higher education. In fall 2013, over 20 million students enrolled in an
institution eligible for Federal aid, and roughly half of these students used
Federal student loans to help finance their education. Both economic theory
and empirical evidence suggests that without access to Federal student loans,
financially constrained students are less likely to attend college, more likely
to work while in school, and less likely to complete a degree (Denning 2016a;
Wiederspan 2015; Dunlop 2013; Sun and Yannelis 2016).
Key policies signed into law by the President have maintained the
accessibility and affordability of student loans for borrowers. In 2010,
President Obama signed student loan reform into law, which ended student
loan subsidies for private financial institutions and banks and shifted over
$60 billion in savings back to students. Before the reform, banks and other
private financial institutions provided Federally guaranteed loans, meaning
that these institutions provided the underlying loan principal and earned
a profit when students paid back their loans but were compensated by the
government when the students failed to repay. To remove this subsidy
to financial institutions, the 2010 reform required that all new loans be
financed directly by the Federal Government as Direct Loans, eliminating
the middleman and saving money for taxpayers and students. In 2013,
President Obama signed into law further reforms that lowered interest rates
on student loans for nearly 11 million borrowers, saving them on average
$1,000 over the life of their loan. To date, interest rates have remained low
and currently stand at 3.76 percent for undergraduate borrowers.
As an increasing number of students have been borrowing to finance
a college education, the volume of outstanding Federal debt has risen,
standing at a high of $1.3 trillion dollars today. This rise in debt has made
it especially important to ensure that loans serve students well and do not
present a burden to borrowers once they leave college.

Investing in Higher Education  |  321

The evidence suggests that, on average, student loans continue to
facilitate very high returns for college graduates, and most borrowers are
able to make progress paying back their loans (CEA 2016d). In addition,
though there has been an increase in the typical amount of debt that borrowers accumulate, most students accumulate only modest amounts of debt.
Fifty-nine percent of borrowers owed less than $20,000 in debt in 2015, with
undergraduate borrowers holding an average debt of $17,900. Large-volume
debt remains more prevalent among graduate loans, for which loan limits
are much higher, and among borrowers who completed their undergraduate degrees. Consistent with their greater educational attainment, borrowers
with greater debt tend to have larger earnings and therefore tend to be wellequipped to pay back that debt (Figure 5-10; Looney and Yannelis 2015).
However, borrowers who attend low-quality schools or fail to complete their degrees face real challenges with repayment. In fact, the highest rates of student loan default occur among students with the smallest
amounts of debt because these students are much less likely to have completed, having left school before paying for the full cost of a degree, as shown
in Figure 5-11.10
The Great Recession also created some acute challenges for student
loan borrowers. During the recession, many borrowers went back to school
to shelter from the collapsing labor market, but a disproportionate number
of these students attended schools that had relatively low graduation rates
and did not provide affordable pathways to good jobs. Along with this
change in the quality of schools they attended, changes in the demographics
of borrowers entering repayment and the challenges they faced when entering the labor market during a deep recession contributed to rising default
rates during the recession and in the period that followed. Over the last few
years, the number of students attending low-quality schools has declined,
labor market conditions have improved, and default rates, as measured by
the official three-year Cohort Default Rate, have gone down (Figure 5-12).
In response to rising default rates, the Administration has worked
to ensure that students attend high-quality schools and that borrowers who
have left school and entered repayment have affordable loan payments. The
following section focuses on this Administration’s efforts to expand flexible
repayment plans, while later sections describe efforts to improve the quality of schools that borrowers attend. In addition, the Administration has
focused on strengthening loan servicing to support Americans struggling
with student loan debt. In 2015, the Administration released a Student Aid
10 Loans of less than $10,000 accounted for nearly two-thirds of all defaults for the 2011 cohort
three years after entering repayment. Loans of less than $5,000 accounted for 35 percent of all
defaults.

Bill of Rights reflecting the President’s vision that every borrower has the
right to quality customer service, reliable information, and fair treatment,
even if they struggle to repay their loans. And, in 2016, the White House
announced new actions to help Americans with student loan debt understand their repayment options and to ensure they have access to high-quality
customer service, strong consumer protections, and targeted support to
repay their student debt successfully. 	

Providing More Flexible Repayment Plans
As described above, the constraint imposed by the standard 10-year
student loan repayment plan (in which students are enrolled by default) can
hinder debt management since it requires the same monthly payment at the
beginning of a borrower’s career, when earnings are lowest, as it does midcareer when earnings are higher. This can create repayment difficulties and
dissuade students from investing in their education even when the investment has large net benefits over a lifetime. In response, the Administration
has made payment plans more flexible and loan payments more manageable
through the expansion of income-driven repayment plans. These plans
increase flexibility in several ways. First, by expanding the period of repayment, they allow borrowers to spread their student loan payments over a
longer period of time, while retaining the option of paying sooner with no
324  |  Chapter 5

pre-payment penalty. Second, by tying payments to borrowers’ incomes,
income-driven repayment plans link the timing of repayment more closely
to the time path of earnings gains from higher education, and they remove
needless credit constraints in times when income is temporarily low. Finally,
income-driven repayment plans can serve as a form of insurance against
uncertain returns to college, helping to address some barriers associated
with risk.
With the new repayment plans, borrowers will never have to pay
more than 10 percent of their discretionary income to repay debt. The
Administration initially expanded income-driven repayment by passing
into law the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) plan in 2012, which reduced monthly
payments to 10 percent of borrowers’ discretionary income—lower than
the 15 percent required under the original Income Based Repayment plan.
Under PAYE, borrowers could also have their remaining loan balances forgiven after 20 years of qualifying payments, 5 years earlier than the original
Income Based Repayment plan. PAYE extended more affordable loans to
1.6 million borrowers; however, many borrowers remained ineligible. That
is why, in 2015, the Administration expanded PAYE with regulation creating the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) repayment plan that provides
eligibility to all Direct Loan student borrowers, including any student with
a consolidated loan (excluding PLUS loans to parents). With REPAYE,
these borrowers can cap their monthly payments at 10 percent of their
discretionary income, regardless of when they borrowed and, after making
the appropriate number of qualifying payments, will have any outstanding
balance forgiven. Under REPAYE, borrowers with only undergraduate loans
can have their remaining loan balances forgiven after 20 years of qualifying
payments; borrowers with any graduate school loans can have their remaining balances forgiven after 25 years of qualifying payments.
Figure 5-13 below illustrates how the theoretical repayment curve
for the standard 10-year plan differs from REPAYE for a typical borrower
graduating with a four-year degree.11 Data from the Baccalaureate and
Beyond study show that seniors graduating college in 2008 held a median
debt of $17,125 and earned a median income of $31,000 upon leaving school.
The Figure assumes an interest rate of 3.76 percent consistent with the 2016
student loan rate, real earnings growth consistent with trends in Figure 5-4,
2-percent inflation, and a single-person family (for ease of REPAYE calculations). The “Standard” line corresponds to the standard 10-year repayment
plan with an initial income of $31,000 and an initial debt of $17,125, consistent with the Baccalaureate and Beyond data for all students who borrowed.
11 It should be noted that a number of alternative repayment plans also exist, some of which have
longer payment schedules.

amounts, with REPAYE 2 corresponding with a higher debt amount.

The line labeled “REPAYE 1” uses the REPAYE formula with the same
initial income and debt, while “REPAYE 2” uses the same initial income but
an initial debt of $31,000 to show how repayment patterns differ by debt
amounts. The Standard plan line is relatively flat, reflecting the constant rate
at which the principal balance is paid off under this plan. In contrast, both
REPAYE lines show that principal repayment is initially slow and accelerates over time. In some cases, such as in “REPAYE 1,” borrowers may pay
off their debt faster under REPAYE than the Standard plan if their wages
are sufficiently high. Further, a comparison of the two REPAYE lines shows
that the larger the debt is in comparison to income (or the smaller income is
in comparison to debt), the less the REPAYE repayment curve will look like
the Standard curve.
Continuing to expand enrollment in income-driven repayment
plans for students who would benefit remained a key priority for this
Administration. As of the third quarter of FY 2016, about 5.5 million
(more than 1 in 5) borrowers with Federally managed debt were enrolled
in income-driven repayment plans. The share of borrowers with Federally
managed debt who are enrolled in income-driven repayment has more than
quadrupled from 5 percent in the first quarter of FY 2012 to 23 percent in the
third quarter of FY 2016 (Figure 5-14). To help borrowers access this debt
management tool, the Administration has improved loan servicer contract
326  |  Chapter 5

requirements, pushed efforts associated with the President’s Student Aid Bill
of Rights, put forward a student debt challenge to gather commitments from
external stakeholders, and increased and improved targeted outreach to key
borrower segments who would benefit from PAYE or REPAYE. Although
barriers related to recertifying income and interfacing with the incomedriven repayment enrollment tools online persist, the Administration continued to explore options for how to address these remaining shortcomings.
Recent data suggest that income-driven repayment plans appear to be
drawing in many of those borrowers who may most benefit (Figure 5-15).
In general, the data show that income-driven repayment borrowers tend
to have lower reported family incomes than borrowers on the standard
repayment plan. Among borrowers with undergraduate loans who were
enrolled in income-driven repayment as of the third quarter of FY 2015, the
average family income (in real 2014 dollars) based on the first FAFSA filed
was $45,000, compared with $57,000 for those on the standard repayment
plan. For borrowers with graduate loans, the average income among those
enrolled in income-driven repayment was $60,000, compared with $74,000
for borrowers on the standard plan. Even within sectors of educational institutions, borrowers enrolled in income-driven repayment tended to come
from lower income backgrounds than those enrolled in the standard plan,
suggesting that these plans are reaching the students who may need them
the most. One factor contributing to lower incomes among undergraduate
income-driven repayment enrollees was that these borrowers were more
likely to be classified as independent, and independent borrowers tend to
have lower reported incomes since their parents’ incomes are not counted
as part of their family’s income. Overall, 52 percent of borrowers in incomedriven repayment were classified as independent, as opposed to 42 percent
of borrowers under the standard repayment plan.
Given that income-driven repayment plans tend to change repayment
schedules more dramatically for borrowers whose debt is high relative to
their incomes, it is perhaps unsurprising that borrowers in income-driven
repayment tend to have larger loan balances outstanding (Figure 5-16). As
of the third quarter of FY 2015, the median debt for these borrowers was
$34,000, while the median was just $10,000 for borrowers in the standard
plan. This difference partly reflects a larger share of graduate borrowers;
30 percent of income-driven repayment borrowers had graduate loans,
compared with 10 percent of borrowers under the standard plan. However,
substantial differences remain even among graduate and undergraduate
borrowers. Differences in outstanding balances also remained when looking
within sector, and data for the 2011 repayment cohort suggest they were
partly driven by the fact that borrowers entering income-driven repayment

typically have larger principal loan balances than borrowers in the standard
repayment plan.
Consistent with both the larger debt and the prevalence of graduate
student debt among borrowers in income-driven repayment, these borrowers are more likely to have completed their undergraduate degrees than borrowers in the standard repayment plan. Among those in the 2011 repayment
cohort, 64 percent of borrowers in income-driven repayment had completed,
compared with only 48 percent of borrowers in the standard plan. Many of
those who completed their undergraduate degree accumulated more debt
because they subsequently enrolled in graduate school. But even among
borrowers with no graduate school debt, those enrolled in an income-driven
repayment plan were still slightly more likely to have completed a degree.
The positive relationship between completion and income-driven
repayment enrollment suggests that students who enroll in income-driven
repayment are more likely to have large long-run returns to their college
investments and to be able to eventually pay off their loans. However, data
on prior repayment behavior also show that individuals with short-run
repayment difficulties are using income-driven repayment. Among borrowers entering repayment in FY 2011, a sizeable fraction that enrolled in
income-driven repayment had experienced difficulty in repaying their loans

Investing in Higher Education  |  329

before entering income-driven repayment, with slightly higher signs of
distress compared with borrowers under the standard plan. Over 40 percent
of these borrowers had defaulted, had an unemployment or economic hardship deferment, or had a single forbearance of more than 2 months in length
before entering their first income-driven repayment plan. A much smaller
fraction of these borrowers, roughly 10 percent, experienced difficulty in
repayment after entering income-driven repayment.
A key way that income-driven repayment helps to improve outcomes
for borrowers is by reducing monthly payments, since payment amounts
are spread over a longer time period and are tied to earnings. For the 2011
repayment cohort, Figure 5-17 shows that borrowers in income-driven
repayment had lower monthly payments across all sectors, despite serving
borrowers who accumulated larger amounts of debt.
Some borrowers in income-driven repayment plans may have zerodollar monthly payments. These plans allow borrowers who attended lowquality schools and subsequently experienced low earnings to stay out of
default, and give borrowers who experience temporary periods of economic
difficulty time to get back on their feet. Data show that the same types of borrowers who have more difficulty repaying their loans in terms of college sector, debt size, and borrower characteristics are also more likely to have zerodollar scheduled payments, highlighting the importance of income-driven
repayment in helping these borrowers manage their debt. It is important
to note, however, that another factor driving the group of income-driven
repayment borrowers with zero-dollar scheduled payments is that, on average, borrowers in income-driven repayment entered repayment relatively
recently. As of the end of FY 2015, income-driven repayment borrowers had
been in repayment for an average of about three years. As Figure 5-4 above
shows, earnings increase over a career, so as borrowers progress through
their careers, their scheduled payments are also likely to increase.
To further expand income-driven repayment to borrowers who could
benefit from more manageable monthly payments, the Administration has
announced a series of new actions to enroll 2 million more borrowers into
income-driven repayment plans. Data about the characteristics of borrowers enrolled in income-driven repayment highlight the importance of these
initiatives. For example, though low-balance borrowers and borrowers who
did not complete school are more likely to default on their loans, they represent a relatively smaller share of borrowers in income-driven repayment.
Enrolling more of these types of borrowers in flexible repayment plans like
income-driven repayment will help make their debt more manageable and
help them to avoid costly and unnecessary defaults.

At the same time, as research has shown, college choice is a crucial
factor. It is critical to help borrowers avoid investing in colleges that are
unlikely to increase their lifetime earnings and might leave them with high
debt and low earnings. This Administration’s policies have focused on
strengthening the information available to students and ensuring college
accountability to help students make good decisions.

Improving Information and Reducing Procedural Complexities
When students have better information, they can make better choices
about their education. When choosing a college, students need information
on college quality and cost to know whether their investment in higher
education will pay off. Research shows that, for high-achieving low-income
students, providing information about college cost and quality, like semicustomized net price and graduation rates, enables students to attend and
progress at schools that better match their qualifications (Hoxby and Turner
2013). Further research shows that clear and detailed information about
earnings can lead students to revise their employment expectations (Ruder
and Van Noy 2014; Wiswall and Zafar 2013; Oreopoulos and Dunn 2012)
and change their major choice (Ruder and Van Noy 2014; Baker et al. 2016).
Accessible information about costs and economic outcomes thus plays a
Investing in Higher Education  |  331

crucial role in encouraging students to make informed decisions about
enrolling in higher education and choosing the best college for their needs.
At the same time, evidence suggests that, while prospective students
can benefit from improved information, procedural complexities may
prevent some individuals from using the information and other resources
available to them. In particular, as described above, the complexity of the
FAFSA has created barriers to efficiency and equity in the distribution of
student financial aid, deterring many students who would benefit from
aid from applying. It follows that reducing this complexity should help
students access Federal student aid to better invest in their education, and
the research supports this conclusion. In an experiment that provided
low-income families with personalized aid eligibility information and, in
some cases, assistance completing the FAFSA, only families who got both
assistance and information were more likely to see the benefits of greater
financial aid and college enrollment (Bettinger et al. 2012). This section
details key Administration initiatives to improve information and reduce
procedural complexities for students.

College Scorecard
In 2015, the Department of Education launched the redesigned
College Scorecard to help empower Americans to select colleges based on
what matters most to them. The online Scorecard provides reliable, unbiased,
comprehensive, and nationally comparable data on college outcomes for all
institutions. These outcomes include former students’ earnings, student debt
for graduates, and debt repayment rates; the data are also broken down by
demographic group, which allow students to assess how well colleges are
serving similar students to themselves before deciding where to apply and
attend. Figure 5-18 highlights the importance of these data, showing the
large variation in outcomes at two- and four-year colleges. CEA’s technical
report on using Federal data to measure and improve the performance of
U.S. institutions of higher education provides more information about the
Scorecard, including a guide to the available measures, methods for assessing college quality, and data-driven lessons for performance management
(CEA 2015c).
Within its first year, the College Scorecard has reached students and
families across the country (Figure 5-19), and students now have multiple
opportunities to use Scorecard to make better decisions. For example, the
College Scorecard data will be clearly featured in the hundreds of millions of Google searches related to colleges and universities taking place in
the United States each year, and other companies like College Board are
integrating the data into their college application products and programs.

College rankings like Forbes, Money, Brookings Institution, Economist, Wall
Street Journal, and Washington Monthly are also using new outcomes data
included in the Scorecard. Since the College Scorecard initially launched, the
data have been accessed nearly 13 million times by API users and through
the website. Additionally, more than 700 developers have accessed College
Scorecard’s Application Programming Interface (API), which allows users
to create tools and insights that will help prospective college students make
important decisions.
The revised College Scorecard contains a variety of information that
is useful for students, parents, and administrators when considering the
right college for a particular student. For example, though earnings and
employment are primary motivations for students to attend college, students also care about cost, completion rates, and debt repayment outcomes,
as well as broader goals like becoming a better person (Eagan et al. 2014;
Fishman 2015). Based on academic literature and consumer testing, the
Administration developed a series of measurable outcomes that students
had identified as important. Because students value each factor differently
depending on their own circumstances and preferences, the Scorecard
presents each indicator independently so that students can emphasize and
compare the attributes most important to them.
Additionally, because students come from a variety of backgrounds,
it is helpful to provide information about how prospective institutions serve
students like them. Ideally, a single measure of college quality would isolate
the effect that attending an institution has on its students’ outcomes from
other inputs such as the types of students it enrolls. However, it is very
difficult to disentangle these effects since they tend to be closely related,
as demonstrated in Figure 5-20. This Figure shows that low-income students tend to have lower outcomes both because they disproportionately
attend schools with poorer outcomes for all students and because of other,
unobservable characteristics, such as academic preparation. In light of these
challenges, the College Scorecard presents information on both student outcomes as well as characteristics of the students attending a university to help
users assess quality. Moreover, the Scorecard includes data disaggregated by
student subgroup to help researchers and policymakers assess institutions’
successes and failures in serving disadvantaged students.
The Scorecard includes a combination of short-term measures, which
are more responsive to changes in school practices, and long-term measures, which may better represent the more permanent outcomes associated
with attending a particular institution. It also notes the program mix of
the institution and other factors that may relate to wide variation in outcomes, and makes efforts to ensure the reliability of performance measures

and information for smaller schools where small changes could lead to
substantially different results. Overall, the College Scorecard—released in
September 2015 and updated September 2016—represents a significant
step forward in providing transparent and comprehensive data on college
costs and outcomes and has encouraged the research community to focus
on developing a Federal and State data agenda for postsecondary education.
The Administration has also focused on more directly getting information into the hands of students in key areas of high impact, such as when
they are applying for student aid or in the form of disclosures related to
accountability measures. These initiatives are discussed in further detail in
the following sections.

FAFSA Simplification
In light of the evidence about the benefits of simplifying aid, the
Administration has undertaken a number of administrative reforms to
streamline the FAFSA process so that it can better serve students and their
families. Many initiatives have focused on reducing the number of questions
presented to students and families and by making it easier for applicants
to directly transfer tax and income information from the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS). The Administration has revamped the online form for all

Investing in Higher Education  |  335

Box 5-4: Improving Information to Drive Evidence-Based Policies
Building an evidence base to determine what works and what
does not work has been a cornerstone of this Administration’s education policy. Educational leaders, Federal and State policymakers, and
researchers are increasingly interested in questions of institutional
outcomes to better share and adopt best practices, steward taxpayer
dollars, and determine how resources can be more efficiently allocated
to benefit students. Efforts to improve data quality and facilitate research
and innovation have also helped educators to learn both from their own
experiences and from others and to ensure that resources are spent on
the most effective practices.
In higher education, the Administration has encouraged greater
innovation and a stronger evidence base around effective strategies
to promote college access and success through 42 First in the World
(FITW) grants. These grants support the development, replication,
and dissemination of innovative and evidence-based interventions at
institutions of higher learning across the Nation. Although the program
has since been de-funded by Congress, the grants already made to
institutions target adult learners, working students, part-time students,
students from low-income backgrounds, students of color, students
with disabilities, first-generation students, and other students at risk
of not persisting in or completing college. In addition, through the
Experimental Sites Initiative, the Administration has tested innovative
practices in the delivery of Federal student aid dollars and has used the
resulting evidence to inform higher education policies. Some of these
experiments include, on a limited basis, making Pell Grants available to
low-income high school students that dually enroll in college programs
and to eligible incarcerated individuals.
Through investments in the Recovery Act, the Administration was
also able to advance the use of data through three critical investments:
Investing in Innovation Fund (i3); Race to the Top; and the Statewide
Longitudinal Data Systems grant program. With similar goals as FITW
but targeted at the K-12 level, the i3 program was designed to fund school
districts and nonprofits developing and scaling innovative and evidencebased strategies that address challenges in K-12 classrooms, particularly
those serving disadvantaged students. Since its establishment in 2009,
more than $1.3 billion of grant money has been invested in 157 projects.
Additionally, the Administration’s Race to the Top program provided support to states implementing data system improvements in four
areas, including the use of data systems and technology to inform and
enhance instruction. Recent research has shown that better integration
of data in the classroom can help teachers tailor instruction according

336  |  Chapter 5

to student needs and improve test scores (Dobbie and Fryer 2011; Fryer
2014). Furthermore, by relying on data to inform daily instruction,
researchers can compare what is and is not effective across districts and
provide teachers with new insights on how to address the academic needs
of their students. In addition, under this Administration, the Statewide
Longitudinal Data Systems program has expanded support for states to
create and link data systems across early learning, K-12, postsecondary,
and labor systems so that states have better information on what works.
Several states, such as Florida, North Carolina, and Texas, have collected
and maintained extensive PreK-12 population-level data on public
school students that have been used to study the long-term impact of
schooling over time on post-secondary education, the labor market, and
even the criminal justice system (Figlio, Karbownik, and Salvanes 2015).
Finally, in an effort to better understand where educational
inequities currently exist, through executive action in 2011–12, the
Administration changed the Department of Education Civil Rights Data
Collection (CRDC) from a sample to universe collection, requiring every
U.S. public school and school district to participate. The CRDC provides
data on leading civil rights indicators related to access and barriers to
educational opportunity at the PreK-12 levels. Having access to a full set
of data helps policymakers to make more informed decisions concerning
how Federal resources should be expended and to what extent schools
are making progress in closing achievement and opportunity gaps.

families so they can skip questions that are not relevant to them. In addition,
over 6 million students and parents took advantage of the ability to electronically retrieve their income information from the IRS when completing their
2014–15 FAFSA, an innovation that improves both speed and accuracy.
These efforts have translated to a meaningfully simpler FAFSA for students.
Additionally, in 2015, the Administration announced an earlier and
easier process for applying for Federal financial aid, allowing students to
apply to colleges and for financial aid in tandem. Beginning in 2016, FAFSA
applicants have been able to complete the form on October 1 for the following academic year, three months earlier than the original January 1 start
date, and use income information from two-years prior to fill out the form.
This reform benefits students in two key ways:
First, students and their families can now have a reliable understanding of their Federal aid eligibility as early as the fall—the same time that
many high school students are searching for, applying to, and even selecting
colleges. An earlier FAFSA helps clear an important hurdle in reducing

information barriers related to cost. Importantly, the Administration is also
working with states and colleges to provide financial aid award information on this earlier timeline. Moreover, the earlier FAFSA cycle presents
an opportunity to provide students with more timely information about
the schools where they are applying. Starting with the 2018–19 application
year, the Department of Education will present Scorecard data through
the FAFSA so that students can make more informed decisions about the
schools at which they plan on applying for admission and student aid based
on both cost and student outcomes.
Second, more students and families can complete their FAFSAs using
information retrieved electronically directly from the IRS. In past years, a
significant portion of FAFSA filers were unable to electronically retrieve
their income and tax information from the IRS because they had not yet
filed their tax returns before completing their FAFSA forms (Figure 5-21).
For example, 34 percent of parents of dependent students had not yet filed
their 2013 tax returns when they were initially completing their 2014-15
FAFSA. Such applicants had to manually input their estimated income and
tax information into their FAFSA, or worse, did not submit a timely FAFSA
because they erroneously believed that they were not allowed to do so unless
then had filed their tax returns. By utilizing tax information from two years

Box 5-5: Making Sure Students Enter College Well-Prepared
Too many students enter college unprepared to tackle college-level
courses and benefit from their higher education. A recent study found
that half of all undergraduate students will take at least one remedial
course before enrolling in a college-level course, averaging to an annual
national cost of nearly $7 billion dollars (Scott-Clayton, Crosta, and
Belfield 2014). This Administration has implemented a number of
policies to help ensure that all Americans graduate from high school
prepared for college and their careers, and over the past 7 years, students
have seen important gains. Today, high school graduation rates are at an
all-time high and dropout rates at an all-time low. This Administration
has also seen National test scores in reading and math for fourth and
eighth graders reach new highs (NCES 2016).
Encouraging Reform with Flexibility: When President Obama
entered office, No Child Left Behind (NCLB) was two years overdue for
reauthorization and in serious need of repair. In the absence of congressional action, the Department of Education offered states relief from the
most onerous requirements in NCLB in exchange for a commitment to
engage in needed reforms. Between 2011 and 2015, more than 40 states
and the District of Columbia applied for and received this flexibility
while working to improve their schools using many of the policy options
detailed below. Many of these reforms were codified in the bipartisan
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which the President signed in
December 2015.
Higher Standards: The Administration encouraged all states to
adopt high standards and aligned high-quality assessments based on college- and career-ready expectations through incentives in the Recovery
Act funding provided to states through the Administration’s Race to the
Top program. In 2016, 49 states and the District of Columbia now have
higher standards than before. In the future, every state will be required
to hold students to standards that prepare them for college and career as
a result of ESSA. Higher standards have been linked to higher test scores
(Wong, Cook, and Steiner 2011) and can help identify whether students
are well-equipped with the skills and content knowledge necessary for
college-level coursework.
Excellent Teachers: This Administration has supported teacher
development and excellence by encouraging the expansion of highquality educator evaluation and support systems that help equip schools
to use multiple measures, which are fair and reliable, to provide timely
and meaningful feedback to educators. Economics research highlights
that teacher quality can be measured as a predictor of student achievement (Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff 2014a; Bacher-Hicks, Kane, and

Investing in Higher Education  |  339

Staiger 2014), and feedback from evaluations can help teachers substantially improve their methods and performance (Taylor and Tyler 2012;
Kane et al. 2011). The long-term impacts of improving teacher quality
on outcomes such as college attendance and earnings are large (Chetty,
Friedman, and Rockoff 2014b).
STEM Initiatives: The Obama Administration has made Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education in K-12 schools a
national priority. In 2011, the President pushed to recruit 100,000 excellent STEM teachers to work in public schools over the next 10 years, and
by 2016, we have exceeded in reaching 30 percent of that goal and are
on track to achieve it. The future of America’s workforce will require a
growing number of workers with an education in STEM fields (Sargent
2014; Rothwell 2014), and research shows that exposure to and training
in advanced math and science courses during high school are linked with
higher earnings and later labor market outcomes in STEM fields (Rose
and Betts 2004; Black et al. 2015; Levine and Zimmerman 1995).
Closing Gaps: The racial and socioeconomic gaps in educational
inputs and outcomes hold back too many American students from
reaching their potential, and the Administration worked to close these
gaps by targeting support among those who need it most.
•	 The Administration issued School Improvement Grants (SIG)
to more than 1,800 of the Nation’s persistently lowest-achieving public
schools since the program’s creation in the Recovery Act. A study of
California schools by Dee (2012) found that SIG contributed to closing
performance gaps between on-target schools and schools considered
“lowest-achieving” by 23 percent.
•	 In 2014, President Obama established the My Brother’s Keeper
(MBK) Task Force to address academic, disciplinary, and economic
disparities for disadvantaged youth, particularly young men of color.
CEA’s 2015 analysis finds that closing these gaps would potentially yield
significant economic gains, with an estimated increase in U.S. GDP of at
least 1.8 percent (CEA 2015a).
•	 The President has also focused on developing underserved
communities via the Promise Neighborhood program that was created
in 2010 appropriations, building on evidence that neighborhood quality
plays an important role in children’s outcomes (Chetty and Hendren
2015; Chetty, Hendren, and Katz 2016). Through this program, the
Administration has partnered with local public and private organizations
and invested nearly $270 million in low-income communities, producing significant gains in English and math test scores (Department of
Education 2016b).

340  |  Chapter 5

prior, the early FAFSA reform helps eliminate the barrier presented to individuals who have not yet filed their taxes. This not only simplifies the aid
application process for students and their families and reduces the burden
on institutions, it also improves the accuracy of the information used in the
determination of students’ aid eligibility.
With this change, about 4 million more students and families can use
this IRS Data Retrieval Tool from the start, eliminating the need to send
tax information to the government twice. This enhancement can ensure
that hundreds of thousands more families receive the aid for which they
are eligible, that students and families save well over half a million hours
in paperwork, and that schools can transfer 3 million hours from verifying
information to advising students and making financial aid awards.

Protecting Students from Low-Quality Programs and Encouraging
Schools to Improve
As described in the previous section, better information can help students to choose higher-quality institutions, and Administration efforts have
significantly improved the information available to students. However, some
colleges fail to meet baseline levels of college quality, and this Administration
has targeted its more rigorous accountability efforts on those schools in
order to protect students and taxpayers. In particular, it has strengthened
accountability efforts in higher education by setting standards for career
training programs, including many programs offered in the for-profit sector
where high costs and poor outcomes are more highly concentrated.
Descriptive analysis comparing students who attended for-profit colleges to those who attended community colleges or non-selective four-year
schools shows that those who attend for-profits have lower earnings on
average, and hold larger amounts of debt. These students are also more likely
to be unemployed, to default on their loans, and to say that their education
was not worth the cost (Deming, Goldin, and Katz 2012, 2013). Loan default
data presented in Figure 5-22 also show similar patterns, especially when
disaggregated by completion status.
Additionally, research that compares earnings of the same students
before and after attending college—including a recent analysis using individual-level administrative and tax data for Federal student aid recipients
enrolled in Gainful Employment programs (Cellini and Turner 2016)—finds
that for-profit colleges offer lower returns than the returns that have been
estimated for other sectors (Cellini and Chaudhary 2013; Liu and Belfield
2014).12 These lower returns are especially concerning in light of evidence
12 However, one study, which focuses on the returns to for-profit colleges in the State of Ohio,
finds more positive results (Jepsen, Mueser, and Jeon 2016).

Box 5-6: The Rise of the For-Profit Sector
The for-profit sector represents a small share of college enrollment,
but it has grown rapidly in recent years. At its peak in 2010, for-profit
enrollment reached over 2 million students, up from only 240,000 in
1995 (Figure 5-i), in part driven by funding constraints at community
colleges (Deming, Goldin, and Katz 2012, 2013). Since then, for-profit
enrollment has ticked down, standing at 1.6 million in 2014 and representing 8 percent of total enrollment at degree-granting institutions.
The total amount of student loan dollars disbursed at for-profit colleges
has also declined, standing at $15.7 billion in award year 2014–15, down
from the 2009–10 peak of $24.3 billion.
Coupled with the rise in for-profit enrollment has been an increase
in the number of for-profit institutions. The number of for-profit institutions, including branch campuses, increased from 345 in 1995 to 1,451
at its peak in 2012–2013 (Figure 5-ii). As with for-profit enrollment,
for-profit institution counts have declined in recent years. The growth of
the for-profit sector has presented a challenge to ensuring that students
receive a high-quality education. A growing body of research, described
in the section above, has found that outcomes for students at for-profit
colleges are on average worse than at similar institutions they might
otherwise attend.

that for-profit colleges are more expensive than community colleges, even
when adding in the value of the extra government support community colleges receive (Cellini 2012). Experimental evidence from resume-based audit
studies further suggests that despite their relatively high cost, degrees from
for-profit institutions are valued less by employers than degrees from nonselective public institutions (Deming et al. 2014; Darolia et al. 2015). Despite
these poor outcomes, for-profit institutions have accounted for a large share
of enrollment growth since the early 2000s.

Gainful Employment Regulations
While some career college programs are helping to prepare America’s
workforce for the jobs of the future, far too many students at these schools
are taking on unsustainable debt in exchange for degrees and certificates
that carry limited value in the job market. With the landmark Gainful
Employment regulations, the Administration will eliminate Federal aid to
career college programs that consistently fail accountability standards.
Under the Gainful Employment regulations, programs whose graduates have annual loan payments of less than 8 percent of total annual earnings, or less than 20 percent of discretionary annual earnings, are considered
to have passed the requirements. Programs whose graduates have annual

loan payments between 8 and 12 percent of total earnings, or between 20 and
30 percent of discretionary earnings, are considered to be “in the warning
zone” and at risk of failing the requirements. Programs are deemed to have
failed the requirements if their graduates have annual loan payments greater
than 12 percent of total earnings and greater than 30 percent of discretionary earnings. Programs that fail in two out of any three consecutive years, or
are in the zone for four consecutive years, are no longer eligible for Federal
student aid for a minimum of three years.
Based on data available at the time of rulemaking in 2014, the
Department of Education estimated that about 1,400 programs serving
840,000 students—of which 99 percent are at for-profit institutions—would
not pass the accountability standards. Initial data for students who completed during FY 2011 and 2012 confirm that students who completed
certificate programs at for-profit colleges tend to earn less than those who
completed programs at public colleges (Figure 23). The data suggest that
for-profit colleges have higher proportions of graduates in less lucrative
programs of study than public colleges and that graduates of for-profit colleges have lower earnings compared to those who graduated from similar
programs of study at public colleges. All programs will have the opportunity
to make immediate changes that could help them avoid sanctions; but if

these programs do not improve, they will ultimately become ineligible for
Federal student aid—which often makes up nearly 90 percent of the revenue
at for-profit institutions.
The Gainful Employment regulations also require institutions to provide disclosures to current and prospective students about their programs’
performance on key metrics, like earnings of former students, graduation
rates, and debt accumulation of student borrowers. This disclosure requirement complements the accountability measures in the regulation and
provides additional program-level detail to the institution-level information
provided in the College Scorecard.

Protecting Against Fraud and Deception
In addition to improving the information available to students, the
Administration has worked to directly protect students and taxpayers from
the subset of institutions of higher education who engage in fraud, deception, and other misconduct that harms students. A two-year investigation by
the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions published in 2012 revealed such practices occurring in the for-profit sector. The
investigation found that the 30 for-profit colleges examined spent about 30
percent more per student on marketing, advertising, recruiting, and admissions staffing than on instruction. The report also highlighted a number of
Investing in Higher Education  |  345

tactics (consistent with a 2010 Government Accountability Office report)
that misled prospective students about program costs, the availability of aid,
and information about student success rates and the school’s accreditation
status.
In 2010, the Obama Administration released a comprehensive set of
rules—known as Program Integrity and Improvement rules—to strengthen
the Department of Education’s authority to protect students from aggressive
recruiting practices fueled by incentive compensation; to take action against
colleges engaging in deceptive advertising, marketing and sales practices;
and to clarify minimum requirements for states to oversee postsecondary
programs and handle student complaints. The Obama Administration is
also proposing new Borrower Defense to Repayment regulations to protect
borrowers and taxpayers against fraud, deception, and other misconduct by
postsecondary institutions. The proposed regulations would create a clear,
consistent, and transparent process for borrowers who have been harmed
by their school’s misconduct to seek debt relief. In addition, the proposed
regulations include measures that would require new warnings to help
students steer clear of poorly performing for-profit schools and financially
risky schools. They would also end the use of both so-called “pre-dispute,
mandatory arbitration agreements” and of class action bans that prevent
students from having their day in court.
These regulations build upon a record of action by this Administration
that has encouraged states to step up oversight in their role as authorizers,
encouraged accreditors to focus on student outcomes, and created a new
Student Aid Enforcement Unit to respond more quickly and efficiently to
allegations of illegal actions by higher education institutions.

Next Steps
Despite the substantial progress made by the Obama Administration
to expand a high-quality college education to all Americans, some challenges
remain.
First, the costs of college remain too high for too many individuals, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Expanding this
Administration’s work to provide free community college for responsible
students will be a critical next step to make sure that all Americans can access
a college education. However, at the same time, policymakers, community
colleges, and other stakeholders will also have to work to improve student
success at community colleges so that students who enroll receive the supports needed to complete a degree that raises their labor market prospects.

346  |  Chapter 5

Additionally, Pell Grants can be better structured to put more
low- and moderate-income students on the path to success, and the
Administration’s 2017 budget identifies various ways to improve the current program. To begin, the proposed budget further simplifies the FAFSA
by eliminating burdensome and unnecessarily complex questions to make
it easier for students and families to access Federal student aid and afford a
postsecondary education. The Administration has also called upon Congress
to indefinitely index Pell Grants to inflation in order to protect and sustain
their value for future generations. Furthermore, it has included two key proposals to promote completion, creating incentives supported by academic
research (MDRC 2016). The first would make additional Pell Grant funds
available for an additional semester to full-time students, and the second
would increase students’ Pell Grants by $300 each year if they take at least 15
credit hours per semester, the amount typically needed to complete a two- or
four-year degree on time. Finally, the Administration has requested that Pell
Grants be expanded to incarcerated individuals eligible for release, with the
goals of helping them complete college, get jobs, support their families, and
strengthen their communities.13
There are also important changes to the education tax code that
could reduce barriers to college access and success. In particular, the
Administration has proposed streamlining and further expanding education tax benefits by: first, consolidating the Lifetime Learning Credit into
an expanded AOTC, which would be available for five years and refundable
up to $1,500 for students enrolled half-time or more; second, exempting
Pell Grants from taxation and the AOTC calculation; and third, eliminating
the tax on student loan debt forgiveness, while repealing the complicated
student loan interest deduction for new borrowers.
Work is also needed to make sure that all borrowers can pay back their
debt with an affordable repayment plan. Income-driven repayment plans
are helping millions of borrowers stay on track with their payments, but too
many borrowers do not take advantage of these plans, as described above.
Complexities related to repayment plan selection, income verification, and
recertification all present barriers to enrollment. In its 2017 budget, the
Administration called upon Congress to improve and streamline PAYE and
other income-driven repayment plans to create a single simple and bettertargeted plan for borrowers. Academics have also proposed innovative ways
to reduce the complexity of income-driven repayment plans (for example,
Dynarski and Kreisman 2013). Such improvements will be critical to help
borrowers manage their debt and stay out of default.
13 See CEA’s 2016 criminal justice report for a more detailed overview of the importance of this
policy (CEA 2016b).

Better information and regulation of low-quality schools will also help
students attend colleges that serve them well and enable them to pay back
the debt they incur. The College Scorecard was a significant achievement,
but additional efforts to improve the data’s usage, the consumer tool, and
the underlying data will help to expand the impact of the Scorecard. The
Administration’s efforts to protect students from low-quality schools have
likewise been important accomplishments, and future policymakers must
continue to be responsive to an ever-changing higher education landscape.
Lastly, work remains to continue strengthening outcomes at earlier
levels of education to help ensure that students enter college well prepared to benefit from their investment in higher education. Despite this
Administration’s accomplishments, racial and socioeconomic gaps in
PreK-12 educational inputs and outcomes remain, and these disparities
must be addressed in tandem with the inequities in higher education access.
ESSA has codified into law many initiatives created and championed by the
Obama Administration to set the stage for this future policy, but further
progress will require additional effort by policymakers.

Conclusion
The Obama Administration has enacted policies over its two terms
to lower college costs, improve information, simplify student aid, and cap
monthly student debt payments at a manageable portion of borrowers’
incomes. The Administration has also promoted excellence and equity in
PreK-12 education to better prepare students for college and their careers.
Together, these policies represent a significant step forward in building an
educational system that supports and encourages all Americans who wish to
invest in an affordable, high quality college education to do so. Still, more
work is needed to address the challenges that remain.

STRENGTHENING THE
FINANCIAL SYSTEM
Introduction

T

he financial system plays an important role in any modern economy,
providing key services that not only match savers with borrowers but
also provide services that facilitate such economic activity as safekeeping
of financial assets and payment processing. While the markets for financial
services generally succeed in providing these services, there are situations in
which financial markets do not function well; referred to as market failures.
Due to the existence of market failures, regulation plays an important role
in helping to ensure that financial service providers continue to effectively
provide necessary services to the economy.
The 2008-09 financial crisis highlighted several such market failures.
Responding quickly, the President, Congress, and regulators addressed
these failures by adopting necessary reforms to the financial system. These
measures were designed to address three areas of concern: (1) increasing
the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions; (2) identifying
and mitigating sources of systemic risk – the risk that a threat to one firm
or small number of firms could incite widespread panic in financial markets
and threaten the entire financial system; and (3) improving transparency,
accountability, and protections for consumers and investors.
During the Obama Administration, the passage and implementation
of financial reform has worked to address these issues with measurable
impact on the safety and soundness of financial markets. Although there is
still work to be done, considerable progress is evident. The financial system
in 2016 is more durable and able to perform its necessary and important
functions without undue risk.
The reforms involved a substantial reshaping of the financial regulatory landscape in the United States. Rules were changed to make banks
349

hold more capital and have better access to liquidity. The ability of banks to
engage in risky trading was reduced. Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
trading is now better regulated and more transparent. The rules governing credit ratings agencies that many investors rely on were substantially
reformed. Importantly, two new institutional structures were created: the
Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) that brings together different
regulators to consider and respond to systemic risks and the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau aimed at making sure financial institutions
interact in a fair manner with their clients.
This chapter focuses on the steps taken during the Obama
Administration to reform the financial system, starting with a discussion of
the economic rationale for regulation, particularly as it applies to financial
market failures. The state of financial markets just prior to, and during, the
financial crisis is detailed, followed by an outline of specific financial reforms
undertaken in response to the crisis and the measurable impact of those
reforms. A final section provides a snapshot of the state of financial markets
in the fall of 2016 after the implementation of most of the financial reforms
discussed below.

Economic Rationale for Regulating
Financial Markets
The financial system —commercial banks, along with insurance companies, investment banks, mutual funds, and all the other institutions where
individuals and firms put their savings or borrow funds—plays an integral
role in any modern economy. Providers of financial services stand between
savers who seek a return on their savings and borrowers who are willing
to pay to use those savings to start a company or buy their first home. The
U.S. financial system, among other things, provides financial intermediation
between savers and borrowers; yet the infrastructure to perform that function is necessarily complex and costly. While the markets for financial services generally succeed in facilitating the matching of those wishing to lend
or invest their savings with those wishing to borrow or invest those savings,
there are situations in which financial markets do not function well — often
referred to as market failures — or may not achieve the desired outcome
from society’s point of view. Due to the existence of market failures, regulation plays an important role in helping to ensure that financial service providers continue to effectively intermediate between savers and borrowers.
Without a financial system, the modern economy could not function. In the short run, people could keep their savings in their homes, and
the only apparent losses would be the forgone interest and dividends. But
350  |  Chapter 6

with no easy way to get the funds from savers into productive investment,
the economy would face bigger problems very quickly. Entrepreneurs with
ideas would find it difficult to get capital, large companies in need of money
to restructure their operations would have no way to borrow against their
future earnings. Young families would have no way to buy a house until
they had personally saved enough to afford the whole thing. Workers saving
for retirement, and firms and individuals attempting to insure against risk,
would find it hard to do so.
As part of collecting savings and making them available to borrowers,
financial firms perform several important functions. The first is to evaluate
the potential borrower and the reasons they wish to borrow, and to make
reasonably sure that the loan will be repaid and that the investment will perform as promised. This includes the continued monitoring of the borrower
to ensure the money is being used as promised. When the system works
well, the financial service provider acts on behalf of the saver – and in the
process helps ensure that capital is allocated more efficiently in the economy.
Savers or investors may lack information about the quality of a firm looking
to borrow money. Figuring out the creditworthiness of potential borrowers
and supervising the borrower after a loan is made is costly. By specializing
in making loans or providing funds, the financial service provider typically
has better information than savers about potential and actual borrowers as
well as the likelihood that loans will be repaid and investments will perform
as expected. Problems may develop, however, if or when the financial service
provider puts its interests ahead of the saver. Economists refer to this as an
example of the principal-agent problem.
Another important function of financial service providers is to supply liquidity and maturity transformation. Borrowers often wish to borrow
for a long period of time to invest in a home or a new business. However,
savers may wish to have the ability to cash out of their investment should
they desire to use their funds for other purposes. An example of maturity
transformation is when a credit union that aggregates the savings deposits of
many customers to make a mortgage loan that will be repaid over 30 years.
Financial service providers also facilitate diversification. Savers who
invest through an intermediary typically have a small investment in many
large projects rather than having “all their eggs in one basket.” The financial system allows investors not only to have ready access to their funds if
needed, but also to spread a relatively small amount of money across a wide
range of investments.
Finally, the financial system plays a key role in the way payments are
made in our economy. While people can always use cash for their purchases,
it is not always the most convenient method. Checks, transfers, credit cards,
Strengthening the Financial System | 351

and other non-cash payment methods offer effective alternatives. People
depend on the financial system to make these alternatives possible.
“Financial institution” often means a commercial bank, but there
are many other types of financial institution. Investment banks help firms
sell stakes in the company directly to investors as well as borrow money
directly from investors. Rather than taking a loan from a bank, a firm could
issue stock to build a new factory. Brokers allow investors to access equity
and bond markets to make it possible to buy and sell stocks and bonds.
Rather than rely on a bank, investors can access liquidity through secondary
markets. Over time, financial firms have learned to pool various types of
individual loans or debt obligations and combine them into different securities that they can sell, a process known as securitization, allowing further
diversification. Derivative contracts allow hedging, or other types of investing behavior. Various insurance products on real life or financial events can
also play an important role by allowing for hedging of many different types
of risk.
Financial institutions effectively provide services to their customers
much of the time; however, fragility, instability, or disruption in financial
markets can cause those institutions to fail. Individuals or firms, acting
independently, may not be able to effectively address these market failures
because there is often a conflict between the individual’s or firm’s best interest and the aggregate best interest of all market participants. Economists
refer to this as a collective action problem. In such cases, it may be efficient
for government to step in to regulate, including the monitoring and supervision of financial firms.
An example of fragility in the financial system that can lead to a
market failure involves liquidity and maturity transformation. A financial
service provider that offers liquidity and maturity transformation may have
illiquid long-term assets and liquid short-term liabilities. If creditors all call
these liabilities at the same time, the financial service provider may find itself
unable to raise the cash to meet those calls. The classic example is a bank run,
where depositors all “run” at the same time to withdraw their funds, leaving banks unable to sell the illiquid business loans and mortgages quickly
enough to meet those demands. So-called “run-risk” can occur in a wide
variety of nonbank institutions as well.
Runs can occur when all individuals are acting in their own best interests. The fact that they lack full information about a financial institution’s
investments means that if they believe the institution may be in trouble, the
rational response may be to withdraw their funds. Once the run starts, it
makes even more sense for others to try to withdraw their funds before the
institution runs out of liquidity (Diamond and Dybvig 1983). Because the
352  |  Chapter 6

public has limited information, runs on an individual institution may spread
to other institutions. People could worry that whatever problem afflicts the
first institution may also affect others, or they could worry that the failure of
the first institution may cause problems in others with which it does business. These other institutions, even though solvent, may not have sufficient
liquid assets on-hand to meet the demands of depositors. In the absence of
a mechanism that either stops the initial run or the contagion effects, a run
on a single institution can become a run on the broader financial system.
One lesson driven home by the financial crisis is that actions taken by
a single systemically important financial institution can negatively impact
the stability of the entire system, particularly if the financial system is already
threatened. Threats to the systemic stability can pose costs on society, and
such societal costs are typically not considered in the decision-making of the
firm. Thus, regulations that seek to limit the risk that the failure of a single
institution can pose to the financial system are warranted when the social
costs of the failure of a financial institution exceeds the private costs.
Systemic risk issues have traditionally been central to the regulation
of banks due in part to the danger banks face from runs. A bank run has the
potential to cause significant harm to the economy because of the pivotal
position of banks in the financial system, including in clearing and payment
systems, and because a run on one bank has the potential to impact the
health of other banks. The dangers resulting from bank runs and issues of
adverse selection and moral hazard associated with safety-net arrangements
designed to lower the risk of a run, such as deposit insurance and access to
the central banks as a lender-of-last resort, are common justifications for
bank regulation.1 However, run-risk can occur in financial institutions other
than banks if there is a liquidity and maturity mismatch between assets and
liabilities.
Run risk may be mitigated through government insurance schemes,
regulations that limit the ability of financial institutions to engage in liquidity and maturity transformation, regulations that limit the ability of financial institutions to take risks, or by requiring financial institutions to keep
enough loss-absorbing capital to lower the chance of a run. The government
or central bank could also act as a lender of last resort — providing loans
to financial firms that have good, but illiquid assets during a crisis. Each of
1 Adverse selection occurs when one party to a transaction has better information than the
other and will participate in trades which benefit it the most, typically at the expense of the
other party. A bank that takes advantage of a lender-of-last-resort arrangement may be a
much less creditworthy borrower than a typical bank.
Moral hazard occurs when the one party is more likely to take risks when another party bears
part or all of the cost of a bad outcome. For example, a bank may be more likely to make loans
to risky borrowers at high interest rates if deposits are insured.

Box 6-1: Financialization of the U.S. Economy
Since the late 1970s, financial deregulation, innovation, and
advances in information technology have fueled an expansion of the
financial services industry. The growth of the financial services industry
relative to the economy, referred to as “financialization,” accelerated
since the 1980s, peaking before the global financial crisis that began in
2007. Most industrial countries have experienced financialization, joined
more recently by emerging market economies as they liberalize their
domestic capital markets.
Expanded financial markets bring many potential benefits. For
example, households today have more access to financial services which,
in turn, gives them greater ability to finance the purchase of homes and
automobiles, and to save at low cost in diversified portfolios. Increased
trading activities can enhance market liquidity and aid in price discovery.
These gains may be magnified when financial activity occurs across
larger and more inclusive markets.
However, there are a number of reasons to be concerned that, past
a certain point, a larger financial sector could be economically costly.
First, a larger financial sector may threaten the overall economy if its
size is coupled with fragility as, the larger the sector, the more problematic the spillovers may be to the broader economy if a crisis does hit.
Second, financial services may have expanded beyond their social value,
effectively capitalizing on information asymmetries to oversell unneeded
services to an unwitting population. Finally, if the financial sector is
earning excess profits and some of that is used to raise the pay of those
who work in the sector, the higher pay could draw talent away from
alternative activities that would provide social value.
Size of the Financial Sector
A common measure of financial-sector size is the share of GDP
contributed by financial services – consisting of (1) insurance, (2)
securities trading, and (3) credit intermediation.1 This measure does not
capture asset stocks, such as outstanding mortgage credit; rather, it gives
the flow of value added (the flow of compensation, depreciation, profits,
rent, and other income streams) from the financial service activities.
Financial services comprised 4.5 percent of GDP in 1977, crested above
7.5 percent in the mid 2000’s, before crashing in the financial crisis. The
1 In what follows, “Insurance” is defined as the NAICS code 524, which includes insurance
carriers, agencies, brokerages, and related activities; “Securities Trading” as NAICS codes
523 and 525, which include securities and commodity contracts intermediation and
brokerage, as well as funds, trusts, and other financial vehicles; “Credit Intermediation” as
NAICS code 521 which includes monetary authorities, depository credit intermediation,
non-depository credit intermediation, and related activities.

354  |  Chapter 6

value added of the sector has gradually climbed since then to approximately 7 percent in 2015 (Figure 6-i).
Note that this measure may inflate financial sector growth. For
example, the shift from defined benefit pension funds, often managed
by the pension sponsor, to defined contribution pension plans, typically
managed by a financial services firm, could result in activity shifting
from the sector of the sponsor to financial services.
As the financial sector grows, any associated risks may generate
larger risks to society as a whole. This is not purely a function of size,
but a question of size combined with fragility. In some countries where
financialization has far outpaced that of the United States, the burden of
a failing financial system has been quite large. In Ireland, for example,
cleaning up the financial sector following the global financial crisis
required a sizable government intervention, contributing to fiscal deficits
as high as 30 percent of GDP in 2010. The U.S. financial sector, though
smaller relative to GDP, was still able to generate large economic costs,
helping propel the economy into a protracted recession. When wellregulated and smoothly functioning, the raw size may be unimportant,
but when problems strike, the size can matter.
The Value of Financial Services
Almost half of the growth in financial services as a share of GDP
from 1980 to its peak in 2006 has been in the securities trading category.
The asset management subcomponent of the securities trading category

accounted for half of the industry’s gross output by 2007. The Credit
Intermediation subcomponent that includes many traditional banking
services has grown as well but more slowly. Transactional services, particularly fees related to consumer and mortgage credit, account for nearly
all the growth in Credit Intermediation, approximately a quarter of the
financial industry’s growth. Thus, in many ways, the question of the
value of this growth rests on the value of the asset management services
and the expansion of credit to households.
Professional Asset-Management
Management fees account for most of the growth in professional
asset management. Greenwood and Scharfstein (2013) estimate these
fees to be relatively flat as a percent of assets under management, fluctuating between 1.1 and 1.6 percent. The growth in the total dollar amount
of these fees is due to the growth in both the value of assets and the
share of these assets that are professionally managed. Figure 6-ii below
illustrates the growth in the value of total U.S. financial assets, relative to
both GDP and U.S. nonfinancial (tangible) assets.
Greenwood and Scharfstein find the growth in the share of assets
under professional management puzzling because there is considerable
evidence that active managers tend to underperform when compared
with passively managed funds, after controlling for risk. For example,
Fama and French (2010) find little evidence of skill in fund management, particularly when examining returns net of fees charged by fund

managers. Thus, after fees, savers on average earn less when they invest
in actively managed funds vs. passively managed funds. Households
often misunderstand the pricing of the financial products they purchase,
which could mean individuals do not recognize the overpricing of active
management. Index funds, automated investment advice, and substantially less trading and lower fees might leave people better off.
Cochrane (2013) notes that financially sophisticated managers of
endowments typically invest in actively managed funds. He argues that
basing an explanation of the growth of active management on investor
naïveté ignores the behavior of such sophisticated investors, though it is
also possible that sophisticated institutional investors simply have access
to better fund managers than regular investors. Further, he points to academic literature (see, for instance, Berk and Green 2004) that proposes
explanations for both rational investors pursuing an active investing
strategy and the observed absence of evidence in support of superior performance of active managers highlighted by Greenwood and Scharfstein.
The growth of professional asset management may also provide
benefits to ordinary Americans as mutual funds or employer-sponsored
retirement plans have made it easier for households to participate in
securities markets and diversify their wealth. The share of households
between the 20th and 80th income percentiles owning stock (including
through retirement accounts) rose from 29 percent in 1989 to 49 percent
in 2013, having peaked at 55 percent in 2001 (Figure 6-iii).
Credit Intermediation
Fees associated with consumer and mortgage credit largely have
driven the growth in credit intermediation. Jorda, Schularick and Taylor
(2016) point out this is a trend across 17 advanced economies where the
bulk of credit growth over the second half of the 20th century came in the
form of bank financed mortgages, not business investment.
Household credit, mainly in the form of mortgage debt, grew
dramatically from 48 percent of GDP in 1980 to 99 percent in 2007.
Meanwhile, household debt held by banks as a share of GDP was stable
at 40 percent, meaning the broader financial market, not just banks,
held the assets that were generated by this expansion of mortgage debt.
Household credit that was not held by traditional banks was packaged
into asset-backed securities. The expansion of the securitization market,
and the plentiful assets associated with it, helped increase the supply
of credit available in the housing market. However, this form of credit
expansion also increased the vulnerability of the financial system to the
housing collapse by creating highly-rated securities backed by portfolios
of mortgages supposedly protected by equity tranches that would absorb
losses in the event some mortgages in the portfolio defaulted. This loss

absorbing layer proved inadequate when it became clear the mortgages
in the portfolio were of questionable quality.
Greenwood and Scharfstein provide evidence that mortgage securitization extended the number of intermediaries between initial borrowers and investors who ultimately assumed the risk of the mortgage
defaults. The increase in credit intermediaries resulted in information
asymmetries, where intermediate investors knew less about the original
borrowers than the initial lender who created the loans. In this market,
there was an incentive for original lender to grant loans to sub-optimal
borrowers, knowing intermediaries would purchase the loan. When
individuals began defaulting on loans, intermediaries were unable to
distinguish between low-risk loans and loans at risk of default. Several
studies note that this mechanism is at the core of what made the financial
sector fragile.
As Cochrane points out, the problem was not strictly with the size
of this market as a function of GDP but with its fragility. He also points
out that this financial innovation has potentially large social benefits.
Securitization of mortgage debt allows loan originators to create portfolios of loans and sell them to investors with greater ability and willingness to bear the associated risk. Securitization thus could increase risk in
the market by making the credit chain longer and more opaque, but may
also spread that risk in possibly efficient ways and make funds available
for lending to homeowners, possibly at a lower price.

358  |  Chapter 6

Too Many Resources in Finance?
Beyond the question of the size of the financial sector or the value
it creates is the question of whether the United States dedicates too many
resources—such as talent and capital—to reallocating funds from savers
to borrowers. On the income side, there is concern that financialization
is driving up financial sector wages relative to other industries. Philippon
and Reshef (2012) find that between 1950 and 1980 wage profiles of
finance and other sectors were similar. However, in 2006, the average
finance worker earned 50 percent more than the average private-sector
worker, adjusted for education. In high management, executives in
finance earned 250 percent more than other private-sector executives in
2005. According to Benaubou and Tirole (2016), high wages in financial
services may be luring talent (highly-educated individuals) away from
more productive industries, which can be costly in terms of economic
growth. However, Philippon and Reshef finds evidence that the highskill high-compensation nature of our current financial system is not
inherent to finance. They suggest instead that financial deregulation
“may increase the scope for skilled workers to operate freely and to use
their creativity to produce new complex products.” Philippon and Reshef
find that periods of financial deregulation in the United States see talent
inflows to the financial sector, while periods of regulation see talent
outflows.
The financial sector attracts not only talent, but huge, arguably
excessive, amounts of capital in activities whose social benefits are
unclear. For example, companies have spent billions of dollars creating
slightly faster trading platforms to beat competing trades to the market
by milliseconds. The returns of imperceptibly faster trading to the fastest trader may be immense, but the social value is difficult to discern.
As some traders become faster, the cost of adverse selection increases
for all traders, increasing incentives for investing in faster technology.
Ultimately, trading becomes more expensive for all traders, with little
evidence of substantially increasing benefits to society (Biais, Foucault,
and Moinas 2015). Liquidity provision, price discovery, and opportunities for diversification have benefits; however, the important questions
for policymakers are whether financialization implies too much talent
is being drawn into the creation and sale of these new products and
whether these products generate benefits broadly or just allow the accumulation of excess profits for the most successful financial firms.
While the financial sector has indeed grown and the global
financial crisis exposed distortions in financial markets, not all financial
market distortions are associated with financialization. As the country
has seen, distortions caused by the growth of securitization of mortgages

Strengthening the Financial System | 359

are due in part to information asymmetries, which are not necessarily
characteristics of a large financial sector. Distortions stemming from
inefficient consumer behavior may be due to a lack of information or
insufficient consumer protection. Thus, carefully considered regulation
that focuses on eliminating distortions will improve the overall system.
The goals of such reforms should not necessarily focus on the size of
the financial system or individual institutions per se. Reforms should
instead focus on the reduction of market distortions so that resources
find their most productive use, which may or may not impact the size of
the financial sector.

these methods has benefits and drawbacks and may be used in combination
to lower the systemic risk posed by run risk.
One notable risk of insurance schemes, lenders-of-last-resort, or the
widespread belief that the government will not allow a particular financial
firm to fail is the moral hazard it introduces into the behavior of both
consumers and firms. Consumers may be less careful in the selection of
financial institutions or even seek high-risk firms that offer higher returns
because, if the firm fails they will be compensated by a government-backed
insurance scheme. The firm is incentivized to take more risk because resulting profits may be retained while losses are born by the insurance provider.
The incentive to engage in such behavior becomes stronger the closer the
firm comes to failing. This is similar to what occurred during the savings
and loan (S&L) crisis of the 1980s and 1990s that resulted in the failure of
almost one-in-three S&L institutions. Depositors were unconcerned about
risky loans and investments made by S&Ls because the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corporation insured their deposits. Such insurance schemes
protect against bank runs and may also reduce the problem of a single firm’s
failure posing significant risk to the larger financial system; however, deposit
insurance also requires rules to reduce incentives to take on too much risk
and continual monitoring for compliance.
Financial regulation can also be necessary to correct for specific market imperfections or failures that reduce consumer welfare. These include
consumers having inadequate information available to make well-informed
decisions, agency costs, and the difficulties consumers face in assessing
the safety and soundness of financial institutions. Many of these problems
arise because of the information advantage held by financial institutions
and because financial contracts are long-term in nature. This results in the
inability of the consumer to ascertain the quality of a contract at the time
of purchase, potential moral hazard that may emerge in that the behavior
360  |  Chapter 6

of the firm after the purchase affects the value of the contract, and the firm
may have incentives to behave opportunistically. The purpose of required
information disclosures is to reduce the information advantage of financial
institutions, to make consumers more confident that they possess the information necessary to make well-informed decisions, and to reduce costs of
making poor decisions.
Information asymmetries may reduce demand for financial services. If
consumers know there are good and bad firms and products but are unable
to distinguish between them, a cautious consumer may simply not purchase
such products. This means families may make poor investment choices leaving them with less wealth for retirement or may not purchase products such
as life insurance that may protect the family’s future should tragedy strike.
Similarly, firms may not take advantage of opportunities to hedge business
risks or reduce financing costs, putting their financial health, and therefore
the jobs of their employees, at risk.
The financial system plays a key role in the economy, but because of
these various market failures, it cannot be relied upon to do so safely without
regulation. The next section summarizes the state of U.S. financial markets
leading up to the crisis.

U.S. Financial Markets in 2007-08
Financial crises result from the collapse or serious disruption of financial intermediation. In a crisis, the ability of the financial system to move
savings into investment is severely impaired with far reaching repercussions
for the economy. The 2007-08 crisis and the recession that followed resulted
in millions of lost jobs, trillions in lost output, and hardship for many who
lost homes, savings, or financial security. As a result of declining asset prices,
U.S. households lost a total of $13 trillion in wealth, 19 percent of total U.S.
household wealth from its peak in 2007 to its trough in 2009. The decline in
wealth was far more than the reduction in wealth experienced at the onset of
the Great Depression (Figure 6-1).
While the vulnerabilities that created the potential for crisis were
years in the making, the collapse of housing prices ignited a string of events
that led to a full-blown crisis in the fall of 2008.2 Banks took advantage of
securitization opportunities to institute relaxed lending standards that drove
a boom in mortgage lending. In particular, as seen in Figure 6-2, there was
significant growth in mortgage loan types — Alt-A and subprime — that
were typically made to riskier borrowers during the pre-crisis period.

encouraged it, both fueled an unsustainable rise in housing prices and filled
the financial system with risky assets that left financial firms over-leveraged
and vulnerable. Publicly traded government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)
including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac used leverage as high as 75-to-1 to
build a $5 trillion mortgage exposure. This included the purchase of a growing fraction non-GSE subprime mortgage-backed securities, rising from
10.5 percent in 2001 to 40 percent in 2004. Trillions of dollars in mortgages
were held directly and indirectly by many different types of market participants as mortgage-related securities were packaged, repackaged, and sold to
investors around the world. When housing prices collapsed, hundreds of
billions of dollars in losses in mortgages and mortgage-related securities
caused problems for financial institutions that had significant exposures to
those mortgages and had borrowed heavily against them. What had been
excessively loose lending quickly became tight, and impacts started spilling
into other sectors of the economy.
Uncertainty about exposure to losses from mortgage-related securities
as well as derivatives based on those securities led to uncertainty about the
creditworthiness of major financial institutions. Short-term wholesale funding became more challenging. The crisis intensified in September 2008 with

the failure of Lehman Brothers and the near collapse of the insurance giant
American International Group (AIG) shortly thereafter.
A particularly noteworthy event occurred in money markets during the crisis. The net asset value of the Reserve Primary Fund, a money
market mutual fund with significant holdings of commercial paper issued
by Lehman Brothers, declined below $1, the usual share price of this type
of fund. In industry jargon, the fund “broke the buck.” Investors in money
market funds often thought of them as safe and risk-free as a bank account
and, while they did in fact provide investors with immediate access to their
funds, they were not in fact regulated banks with insured deposits. When a
major money market fund returned less than what investors had deposited,
it stood as a stark reminder that such seemingly low-risk investments could
decline in value and this caused investors effectively to stage a run on this
portion of the financial system. This further drove down the prices of assets
as funds sold their holdings to meet investor redemption requests. These
events highlighted the risks of non-banks conducting the traditional banking functions of credit, maturity, and liquidity transformation without the
safety-net of the banking sector.
Additional uncertainty about the exposures of surviving financial
institutions to those that had either already failed or were thought to be
close to failure, and the lack of transparency of the balance sheets of those

financial institutions coupled with a tangle of interconnections among
financial institutions caused credit markets to seize up. Trading in many
securities ground to a halt, the S&P 500 stock market index lost more than
half its value between early December 2007 and March 2009, and as the
financial collapse disrupted the functioning of the real economy, the nation
plunged into a deep recession.
There were many signs of potential instability in financial markets
in the years leading up to the crisis. As shown in Figure 6-3, the fraction of
mortgages that were subprime rose rapidly in the years directly preceding
the financial crisis. This was accompanied by widespread reports of egregious and predatory lending practices. Easy access to credit contributed to a
near doubling of housing prices in the eight years ending in February 2007
(see Figure 6-4). The rise in housing finance activity resulted in a dramatic
increase in household mortgage debt as a percentage of disposable personal
income, as shown in Figure 6-5.
There were also warning signs within the financial services sector.
The relatively less regulated shadow banking sector was growing considerably faster than the traditional banking sector. Shadow banks are financial
intermediaries that conduct maturity, credit, and liquidity transformation
without explicit access to central bank liquidity or public sector credit
guarantees. Examples of shadow banks include finance companies, assetbacked commercial paper (ABCP) conduits, structured investment vehicles

(SIVs), credit hedge funds, money market mutual funds, securities lenders,
limited-purpose finance companies (LPFCs), and government-sponsored
enterprises (GSEs). Pozsar et al. (2012) estimate the size of the shadowbanking sector over time using flow-of-funds data.3 Figure 6-6 uses the same
methodology and shows that net liabilities of the shadow-banking sector
grew at almost 1.5 times the growth rate of traditional banking sector liabilities in the decade preceding the financial crisis. By 2007, the net liabilities of
the shadow-banking sector were substantially larger than the gross liabilities
of banking institutions.
As shown in Figure 6-7, there was rapid growth in financial firms’
trading in unregulated over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Many institutions took on too much risk with, as it is now known, with too little capital
and with too much dependence on short-term financing. Although the rise
in trading volume in these markets may have been a rational response to
financial and technological innovations, the financial crisis made clear that
there was a lack of transparency and market oversight that required carefully
considered regulatory solutions.

securitization activity (MBS, ABS, and other GSE liabilities), as well as all short term money
market transactions that are not backstopped by deposit insurance (repos, commercial paper,

counting.

Impact of Reforms to Establish a More
Sustainable Financial System
The new Administration’s highest priorities were (1) to cushion the
blow to the economy, (2) stabilize the financial system, and (3) get the
economy growing again. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
of 2009 provided substantial fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts, direct
aid to states or affected individuals, along with important investments in
transportation, clean energy, and other long-term priorities.4 (For a more
detailed discussion of the Administration’s response to the crisis, including
the Recovery Act, see Chapter 1.) At the same time, the Federal Reserve
used its authority to provide monetary accommodation to support the broad
economy and to provide liquidity in particular financial markets where
private markets were frozen.
Congress had passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of
2008, creating the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), and the Bush
and Obama Administrations used the authorities in TARP to provide
capital injections to banks, aid to homeowners, as well as support for the
automobile industry. The financial rescue was followed by stress tests of the
largest banks that revealed information to the markets about the health of
4 See 2014 Economic Report of the President, Chapter 3 “The Economic Impact of the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act Five Years Later.”

Strengthening the Financial System | 367

these financial institutions and the magnitude of their capital needs. Banks
with shortfalls under the stress tests were able to subsequently raise private
capital. Many smaller banks that were unable to raise private capital, as well
as many large banks, were recapitalized through TARP funds. These actions
aimed to stabilize the economy and the financial system, but were not solutions to the underlying problems in the regulatory framework that the crisis
revealed.
At the same time, President Obama did not wait to push for longer-run
changes to address the risk of future financial crises; in July 2010, he signed
into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
(Dodd-Frank Act) whose stated purpose was “to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in
the financial system, to end ‘too big to fail,’ to protect the American taxpayer
by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services
practices, and for other purposes.”5 There have been multiple other efforts
to identify opportunities for regulatory solutions to improve the functioning
of financial markets and promote financial stability. The Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision, for example, recommended a set of international
banking regulations, Basel III, to strengthen the regulation, supervision, and
risk management of the banking sector.
In many ways these longer-run reforms have reshaped the financial
regulatory system of the United States. Banks and other financial institutions
now face different rules designed to make them safer and less of a threat to
the overall system. With the creation of FSOC, regulators now have a way
to pool knowledge and insights about risks to the financial system. With the
creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), consumers
now have a regulator whose sole job is to look out for the interests of consumers in the financial system.
The many individual components of financial reform over the past
eight years can be classified into three broad overlapping categories. The first
includes measures aimed to improve the safety and soundness of individual
financial institutions by not only increasing their capital and liquidity but
also decreasing risky behavior. These reforms should increase the banking
sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress.
The second category of reforms includes measures aimed at reducing systemic risk in the financial system by bringing more of the financial system
under a regulatory umbrella, improving financial regulatory coordination,
and ensuring that individual financial institutions can fail without derailing
the system. The third includes measures designed to increase transparency and accountability in financial markets as well as provide additional
5 Dodd-Frank Act preamble

consumer and investor protections. These include reforms designed to
improve risk management, governance and transparency of the financial
system by strengthening banks’ transparency and disclosures, improving
consumer protections, and better regulating credit rating agencies. These
three categories of longer-run reforms are the focus of this section.

Increasing the Safety and Soundness of Individual Financial
Institutions
The crisis revealed clear fault lines in the financial system. Many
financial firms lacked the ability to absorb losses because they had inadequate levels of capital or lacked the ability to survive runs because they
lacked sufficient liquid assets. In fact, these two issues are related because
fears about solvency or insufficient liquidity can lead to runs. Moreover,
many firms engaged in excessively risky trading and lending activity while
at the same time enjoying the benefits of federally insured deposits and
access to borrowing at the Federal Reserve. Financial reform has helped
make the financial system more secure by requiring financial firms to have
less unstable funding, more liquid assets, higher capital levels, and reduced
risk-taking.

Capital Levels
An important step toward increasing the safety and soundness of
individual financial institutions was the publishing of the Basel III recommended reforms in December 2010. These reforms recommended both
higher minimum capital ratios and capital buffers for banks and a stronger
definition of what counts as regulatory capital. In July 2013, the Federal
Reserve implemented important parts of the Basel III recommendations
by finalizing rules that strengthened the definition of regulatory capital,
mandated that common equity tier 1 capital must be 4.5 percent of riskweighted assets, and introduced a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent
of risk-weighted assets.6 The Federal Reserve’s final rules implementing
Basel III also usefully constrained the role of bank internal models in the
bank regulatory capital framework.
Dodd-Frank-required stress testing is a means for regulators to assess
whether the largest bank holding companies (BHCs) have enough capital to
weather another financial crisis. The Federal Reserve uses the results of the
6 Tier 1 capital consists primarily of common stock and retained earnings, but may also include
certain types of preferred stock. Risk-weighted assets are the bank’s assets or off-balancesheet exposures weighted according to risk. For example, a corporate bond would typically
have a higher risk weight than a government bond reflecting the higher risk of default. A
capital conservation buffer is extra capital built up when business conditions are good so that
minimum capital levels are less likely to be breached when business conditions are bad.

Box 6-2: A Cross-Country Comparison of Bank Size
The financial crisis refocused attention on the challenges posed
by large financial institutions that could threaten the financial system
should they become insolvent, otherwise known as “too-big-to-fail”
(TBTF), (see Box 6-4). Because increases in size may bring additional
risk and managerial challenges, some argue that certain U.S. banks are
so large that, in the event of another financial crisis, there is still a significant risk that investor uncertainty may force governments to intervene to
prevent another financial crisis.
There may be certain advantages associated with bank size that
help balance the potential risks. For example, large banks enjoy economies of scale in both operations and in the management of credit and
liquidity risks by holding diversified portfolios of these risks (Hughes
and Mester 2013). Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and Levine (2006) also provide
evidence suggesting that concentrated banking systems tend to be more
stable and better able to withstand a financial crisis because banks in concentrated banking systems are more diversified and easier to monitor.
However, healthy large banks may threaten competition and, when near
failure, may threaten the stability of the financial system. One approach
to evaluating whether large U.S. banks are “too large” and subsequently
“too risky” is to compare them with the size, concentration, and systemic
risk of banks of other advanced economies.
How Big is “Big?”
The five largest U.S. banks account for a large share of the U.S.
banking sector’s total assets, market capitalization, and revenue. In a
Bloomberg ranking of the largest banks by total assets as of December
2015, four of the top 20 are based in the United States, with the largest
U.S. bank ranked sixth in the world. However, these U.S. banks do not
appear as large when scaled by measures of the size of the economy.
For example, in Switzerland, Sweden, France, the United Kingdom, and
Belgium, total assets of the top five banks were about two to four times
as large as their home country’s GDP, while in the United States, they
were about half the size of GDP in 2015 (Figure 6-iv). Even if scaled to
the aggregated Eurozone GDP (though this is not the approach used in
Figure 6-iv because the repercussions of these banks’ failure likely would
predominantly fall on the individual country), the top five Eurozone
banks still make up a greater share of their economy than do the top
five U.S. banks (nearly 80 percent of GDP for the former and about 50
percent for the latter).
Beyond the traditional measures of total assets, a number of other
benchmarks may be used to assess the size of banks. Across these mea-

sures, U.S. banks also do not appear to be particularly large compared
with those of other advanced economies.
When is “Big” Bad?
Large banks pose several potential risks to the economy. First, large
banks have the potential to engage in monopolistic and rent-seeking
behavior, crowding out smaller institutions. Economists often measure
the potential for such behavior by the concentration of large firms
within a sector. Several studies show that in the run-up and immediate
aftermath of the financial crisis, large banks increasingly dominated the
global financial sector. For example, International Financial Services
London Research found that the share of assets of the 10 largest global
banks compared with the largest 1000 rose from 14 percent in 1999 to
26 percent in 2009 (Goldstein and Veron 2011). However, there is some
evidence that this trend may have changed in recent years in the United
States. World Bank data shows that bank concentration (assets of the five
largest banks as a share of total banking assets) in the United States rose
until 2010 before stabilizing at about 47 percent. In the United Kingdom,
Eurozone, and Switzerland, bank concentration has been considerably
higher than in the United States and increased sharply between 2013 and
2014 (Figure 6-v).
Second, the failure of a large financial institution could cause the
failure of other financial institutions with which it has business relationships. Economists refer to the risk that the failure of one bank may pose

Strengthening the Financial System | 371

to the larger financial system as systemic risk. For example, though
Lehman Brothers was only the fourth largest investment bank in 2008
and only about a third the size of the largest, its failure created repercussions throughout the financial sector and the larger economy (Wiggins,
Piontek, and Metrick 2014). Recognizing that large or highly interconnected financial institutions may pose systemic risk, the Financial
Stability Board designates firms that meet certain criteria as “systemically
important financial institutions.”

Glasserman and Loudis (2015) evaluate the risk of large banks
using the five factors employed by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision for designating global systemically important banks
(G-SIBs): size, cross-jurisdictional activity, interconnectedness, substitutability, and complexity.1 The methodology assumes that the distress

of banks. Banks in the sample include: the 75 largest global banks based on financial yearend Basel III leverage ratio exposure, banks designated as G-SIBs in the year before, and
banks added by national supervisors using “supervisory judgement.” The cutoff score is then
used to allocate banks to four buckets with different level of loss absorbency requirements,
determined on an annual basis. There were about 90 banks in the sample in the end of 2014

cult to replace with services from other providers (for example, payment
processing), and have more complex operations, pose greater risk to
the global economy (Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 2013).2
Figure 6-vi shows that when this overall score is decomposed into its
five components, U.S. banks stand below those of several other countries
in size and cross-jurisdictional activity and above those in many other
countries in substitutability and complexity (particularly in the operation of payment systems), suggesting that size is not the decisive factor
contributing to the systemic risk of the largest U.S. banks. This does not
mean the largest U.S. banks pose no risks, but it suggests their size may
not be the main issue.

capital shortfall in the event of a financial crisis (SRISK%) (Engle 2012,
Glasserman and Loudis 2015).3 Firms with a high SRISK% in a crisis are
not only the biggest losers in a crisis but also are the firms that create or
extend the crisis. The measure, plotted in Figure 6-vii, shows that the top
four U.S. financial institutions with the highest SRISK% average less than
16 percent contribution consistently from 2005 to 2016, which is well
below the average percent contribution of the top four banks of France,
Germany, and Switzerland over this same time period (Acharya, Engle,
and Richardson 2012; Acharya et al. 2016).

posed by the largest financial institutions in the United States as well as

limiting the ability of very large financial institutions to grow through
acquisition. In addition, the President has proposed a financial fee on
the liabilities of the largest financial institutions, which would reduce
the incentive for such institutions to leverage, reducing the cost of externalities arising from financial firm default as a result of high leverage
(Department of Treasury 2016).

Are U.S. Banks Too Big?
The question of whether individual banks are too big is separate
from the question of whether the financial system as a whole is too large
relative to the economy that could come about, for example, with many
smaller firms. This issue is discussed in Box 6-1. Viewed individually,
large U.S. banks do not appear disproportionate to the scale of the economy when compared with those in other advanced economies. However,
their interconnection highlights the importance of global cooperation
in regulating these large institutions, ensuring that the comparative
benefits of large banks outweigh their risks, and enhancing the resiliency
of the financial sector in the face of an economic downturn. Moreover,
it is important that the size of banks reflects the underlying economics,
including any external risks posed by size, and that there not exist any
implicit subsidies related to size.

stress tests as a complement to its annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis
and Review, a thorough qualitative and quantitative assessment of each
BHC’s capital plan. Within the quantitative assessment, the Federal Reserve
examines the effects of various simulated financial stress scenarios on a
BHC’s capital ratios. The Federal Reserve also examines qualitatively the
BHC’s internal controls, contingency planning, governance, and the overall
robustness of its capital planning process. Those banks that do not pass
the annual review may not make any capital distributions such as dividend
payments and common stock repurchases unless expressly permitted by the
Federal Reserve.
The overall quantity and quality of capital has increased at BHCs since
the crisis. As seen in Figure 6-8, from March 2009 to June 2016, aggregate
tier 1 common equity capital for the largest banks and the BHCs increased
from 4.8 percent to 12.7 percent of risk-weighted assets, well above the
minimum required total capital ratio of 8 percent that the Federal Reserve
adopted in 2013. In the most recent annual review, completed in June 2016,
30 of the 33 BHCs passed the Federal Reserve’s test. The Federal Reserve
objected to the capital plans of two banks, and did not object to the plan of a
third, but required it to resubmit its plan with revisions by the end of 2016.

Liquidity
Federal banking regulatory agencies have also instituted reforms that
help banks survive periods of financial stress by improving their ability to
withstand acute short-term liquidity stress and improve their long-term
funding positions. To better manage short-term liquidity stress, regulators
have raised the quality and stability of the assets that banks hold to ensure

that they will not run out of cash, or liquidity, during times of financial
stress. In September 2014, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(OCC), the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC) finalized a rule that mandates minimum Liquidity Coverage Ratios
(LCR) to be consistent with Basel III for large banks and BHCs. LCR is the
ratio of a bank’s high-quality liquid assets to its projected cash outflows during a 30-day stress period. The Federal Reserve defines high quality liquid
assets as assets that a bank can easily convert into cash within 30 days such
as central bank reserves and government or corporate debt. Mandating a
higher LCR will reduce the likelihood that banks face a short-term liquidity
crisis.
To improve the longer-term funding resilience of banks, the three
regulatory agencies proposed a rule in May 2016 to require large banks and
BHCs to have a Net Stable Funding Ratio of at least 1. This ratio is calculated
by assigning scores to each type of funding based on the price “stability”
of the funding source. Equity capital and long-term deposits earn higher
scores, while very short-term funding (such a repurchase agreements) earn
the lowest score. They then calculate the bank’s required amount of stable
funding based on the quality and stability of its assets. Banks must maintain
the ratio of their available stable funding to required level of stable funding
at a specified level, thus lowering their liquidity risk profiles.

376  |  Chapter 6

The three federal banking agencies have tailored both the LCR and
the Net Stable Funding Ratio rules to a bank’s riskiness and complexity. The
full requirements of each rule would apply to BHCs with $250 billion or
more in total assets while less stringent versions of these rules would apply
to BHCs with more than $50 billion but less than $250 billion in assets.
These rules do not apply to community banking institutions.7 The LCR rule
became effective on January 1, 2015, starting with an LCR of 80 percent and
increasing to 100 percent by January 1, 2017. The Net Stable Funding Ratio
requirement will not become effective until January 1, 2018. Despite criticism of the expected negative impact of Net Stable Funding Ratio requirements, the Federal Reserve Board found that, as of the end of 2015, nearly
all covered companies were already in compliance with the standard. The
Federal Reserve Board also found that because the aggregated stable funding
shortfall amount would be small relative to the size of these companies, the
costs connected to making changes to funding structures to comply with the
NSFR requirement would not be significant.
The result of the new bank liquidity requirements has been a general
improvement in the liquidity positions of U.S. banks. The liquidity ratio
reported in Figure 6-9 is similar to LCR but calculated using only publicly
available data.8 Figure 6.9 shows the average liquidity ratio of the largest
one percent of U.S. BHCs has risen from its trough at the beginning of the
financial crisis to well above levels observed before the crisis. Further, Figure
6-10 shows that BHCs reporting LCR using either the standard or modified
methods of calculating the LCR show marked improvement in the liquidity
available to them.
Thus, banks appear to be in a better position to weather a crisis or
liquidity event than they were on the eve of Lehman’s collapse. They have
more stable funding and more liquid assets than before, and hence the risks
that runs could cause an institution to seize up have been moderated.

7 The LCR rules apply to all banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total
consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in on-balance sheet foreign exposure and to these
banking organizations’ subsidiary depository institutions that have assets of $10 billion or
more. The rule also will apply a less stringent, modified LCR to bank holding companies and
savings and loan holding companies that do not meet these thresholds, but have $50 billion or
more in total assets.
8 This figure is reproduced from Choi and Choi (2016) with permission. The liquidity ratio is
similar to LCR, which is the ratio of the stock of high quality liquid assets (HQLA) to potential
net cash outflow over a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario. However, there are differences
in the liquidity adjustments for certain assets and liability classes from those used in the LCR
because the liquidity ratio uses only publicly-available data. Derivative exposures are ignored
due to data limitations.

Risk Taking
The Dodd-Frank Act took a number of steps to limit risky behavior
by financial firms. One component dubbed “the Volcker Rule” is named for
Former Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker. As required by Dodd-Frank,
the SEC, CFTC and banking regulators finalized the Volcker Rule in 2013
to restrict federally insured banking entities from engaging in proprietary
trading or investing in or sponsoring private equity or hedge funds. As seen
in Figure 6-11, activities related to trading and securities contributed to
significant losses during the crisis. The Volcker Rule is meant to mitigate
the moral hazard inherent in access to federally insured deposits by limiting
high-risk-taking activities. Banks have until July 2017 to conform investments in, and relationships with, covered funds. In the meantime, banks are
recording and reporting certain quantitative measurements to regulators,
and divesting their proprietary positions, including those in hedge funds.
Banking regulations typically require firms to meet a minimum ratio
of capital to risk-weighted assets. A risk-weighting system assigns a weight
to each asset or category of assets that reflects its relative risk. Figure 6-12
shows a general decline in risk-weighted assets as a fraction of total assets,
reflecting declining relative risk of bank assets over time. Both Basel 2.5,
effective in January 2013, and Basel III, effective in January 2016, revised
the risk-weighting methodology and are reflected in the Figure as discrete
increases on these dates.
The Dodd-Frank Act included several reforms of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to better protect depositors and stabilize the
financial system. First, it permanently raised the level of deposits insured for
each depositor from $100,000 to $250,000 for each insured bank. Second, it
altered the operation of deposit insurance. Since its founding in 1934, the
FDIC has maintained a Deposit Insurance Fund, a pool of assets meant to
prevent bank runs by insuring the deposits of member banks and finance
the resolution of failed banks. The FDIC maintains funds in the Deposit
Insurance Fund by charging insurance premiums, or assessments, to banks
whose depositors it insures. Specifically, Dodd-Frank required two changes
in the methodology for calculating these premiums that provided direct
relief to small banks with more traditional business models by making large
banks bear more of the costs of deposit insurance.
The first change required by the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the
deposit insurance assessment base. When this change took effect in spring
2011, total assessments for small banks with less than $10 billion in assets
fell by a third — an annualized decrease of almost $1.4 billion. The second
change required by Dodd-Frank raised the minimum Designated Reserve
Ratio—the Deposit Insurance Fund balance over total estimated insured

Box 6-3: The Performance of Community Banks1
Community banks, defined generally here as banks with less than
$10 billion in assets, are an important part of the U.S. banking landscape,
providing access to banking services for millions of Americans and
serving as the only local source of brick-and-mortar traditional banking services for many counties, as well as key sources of credit for rural
communities and small business loans.2 The number of community
bank institutions has declined steadily over the last two decades, yet
the passage of Dodd-Frank in 2010 does not appear to have affected
this long-term trend. Community banks face a challenging competitive
and macroeconomic environment, but since Dodd-Frank was passed,
the growth rate of lending has rebounded, market share has stabilized
for some important types of community bank lending, profitability
(measured by return on assets) has returned to pre-crisis levels for the
smallest community banks, geographic coverage across counties has
remained stable, and the largest community banks have been expanding
their geographic reach.
The Dodd-Frank Act is designed to prevent excessive risk-taking
and protect consumers from exploitative bank lending practices. It also
distinguishes between banks on the basis of size—many rules include
exemptions and tailoring for financial institutions with less than $10
billion in assets—to help keep it from being an undue burden on small
banks.
Economic evidence shows that community banks remain healthy
and have recovered together with big banks since 2008. The annual
growth rates of lending by community banks in each asset range have
returned to levels seen prior to the crisis and are well above the negative
rates seen following the crisis (see Figure 6-viii). Since 2008, community
banks’ market share of total loans has held steady at around 20 percent.
Access to community banks has remained steady since 1994 at the
county level. About 99 percent of counties have a community bank office
(either a main office or a brick-and-mortar branch office), something
that has not materially changed since 2010. About 1 in 4 counties rely
exclusively on community banks for brick-and-mortar services within
county lines. The steady decline in the number of community bank institutions over the past two decades has largely been offset by an increase
in the number of brick-and-mortar branch offices per main office. The

number of brick-and-mortar branch offices per main office has also
increased slightly since 2010.
The decline in the number of community bank institutions in
recent years reflects decreased entry rather than increased exit. The number of exits each year has been roughly steady since 2004. In most years,
mergers with other community banks are the most common reason for
exit. These merged banks are living on as community banks, but as part
of a larger parent group. Entry began falling in 2006 and has been nearly
zero since 2010.
Recent research suggests that macroeconomic conditions likely
explain much of the drop in bank entry in recent years (Adams and
Gramlich 2016). All new bank entry (both de novo and branch expansion
by incumbent banks) has fallen considerably since 2006. The profitability
of new entrants is typically lower on average than an established bank of
comparable size. For younger banks, a larger proportion of their loans
were originated in the current macroeconomic environment, which
includes low equilibrium interest rates.3 This depresses profit margins on
traditional lending activity. The profitability of the youngest community
banks fell precipitously relative to incumbent banks between 2001 and
2009, but by 2015 all cohorts have achieved a level of profitability roughly
equal to or exceeding what they earned prior to the financial crisis (see
Figure 6-ix). Although not shown here, the same holds true for community banks with assets between $100 million and $1 billion.
3 See CEA (2015b) report “Long-Term Interest Rates: A Survey” for a discussion of factors
contributing to the decline of the equilibrium interest rate.

The Dodd-Frank Act has helped to remove some cost disadvantages for community banks. Dodd-Frank has forced large and complex
banks and BHCs to better internalize the costs that their failure may have
upon the broader financial system, and therefore has helped to reduce
any funding cost advantages that such banks may have held in the past.
Moreover, banking agencies continue to take steps to lessen and simplify
the regulatory burden on community banks, while directing the burden
on those banks whose riskiness Dodd-Frank has sought to reduce.
In implementing the provisions of Dodd-Frank, the Administration
has taken important steps to ensure that regulatory requirements are
implemented in an efficient manner. The banking agencies have begun
and are continuing to tailor regulatory requirements to reflect the different level of financial risk that community banks pose. Some steps
include allowing for longer exam cycles for smaller banks that are well
capitalized, streamlining the regulatory reports that community banks
must file, and continuing to develop a simpler and shorter regulatory
reporting procedure for community banks. Furthermore, the banking
agencies continue to consider the written and oral comments made
by community banks in the banking agencies’ nationwide meetings,
working to reduce unnecessary regulatory burden under the Economic
Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act. The Administration
strongly supports these ongoing efforts by the banking agencies to fairly
tailor the regulatory requirements for community banks and avoid any
unnecessary and inefficient burdens.

deposits—from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent. The FDIC issued a final rule
increasing the reserve ratio in March 2016 and paid for the increase by levying a surcharge on top of regular assessment fees for banks with more than
$10 billion in assets, effectively requiring large banks to bear the full cost.

Have Big Banks Become Safer?
Recent research by Sarin and Summers (2016) documents that most
regulatory measures of major banks such as capital levels or liquidity suggest banks are safer; however, market-based risk measures that reflect bank
equity volatility and default probability seem to suggest that, though risk has
decreased since its crisis peak, it is not in fact lower than the period prior
to the crisis. This is consistent with evidence from sources like the NYU
Volatility Lab, discussed below, that use market measures of risk and finds
that, while risk in the financial system is down considerably from the crisis,
based on market measures, it is not lower than prior to the crisis.
It may be the case that either risk was mispriced or markets lacked the
information necessary to price the risk of individual banks before the crisis.
If either is the case, better information concerning the risks the banks face
could make them appear riskier today relative to the pre-crisis period, when
we had a poorer understanding of banks’ risk. Another explanation for this
finding is that banks may simply be worth less because of the present macroeconomic environment, regulations that limit banks’ ability to take risky
positions, and loss of the implicit TBTF guarantee.
A central argument of the Sarin and Summers paper, and work like it,
is that the franchise value of banks has fallen. Markets value bank assets and
their business models as being worth less over the past few years than they
were before the crisis. Consequently, one would expect the bank to appear
riskier based on market metrics. Hence, a comparison of market-based
measures pre- and post-crisis reflects the impact of financial reform on bank
safety and soundness and the impact on banks’ profitability. The rules that
made banks better capitalized almost certainly made banks safer and better
able to withstand future crises; however, constant vigilance is necessary to
make sure that, in a changing environment, risks are adequately managed.

Systemic Risk and Identifying Sources of Risk in the System
The crisis revealed the impact that the failure, or threatened failure,
of even a single financial institution can pose to the larger financial system.
Financial reform has helped make the financial system more secure by
identifying firms that pose such a risk and subjecting them to additional
regulatory oversight and other mitigation strategies. In part, it has accomplished this by improving the coordination of regulatory oversight such that
384  |  Chapter 6

regulators can take a more holistic view of the financial system and properly
identify and act on sources of risk to the system.
Individual bank failures can have negative impacts on their customers
and the communities that they serve. Deposit insurance is meant to protect
depositors and mitigate run-risk while FDIC resolution is meant to mitigate
the impact of a bank failure on customers and communities. Regulation also
seeks to minimize the impact of a bank failure on the financial system more
broadly.
Promoting financial stability requires identifying potential sources of
risk to the financial system. One issue the crisis revealed was the patchwork
nature of U.S. financial supervision. While regulators may have been able to
consider the safety of a particular institution, they often lacked the perspective to consider systemic issues.9 The Dodd-Frank Act established a new
body to fill this regulatory gap, the Financial Stability Oversight Council
(FSOC). The FSOC has a clear mandate that creates for the first time collective accountability for identifying risks and responding to emerging threats
to financial stability. It is a collaborative body chaired by the Secretary of the
Treasury that brings together the expertise of the Federal financial regulators, an independent insurance expert appointed by the President, and state
regulators. Dodd-Frank also established the Office of Financial Research
(OFR) to support the FSOC by looking across the financial system to measure and analyze risk, perform essential research, and collect and standardize
financial data.

Shadow Banking and Regulatory Gaps
Since its establishment by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FSOC has worked
to identify non-bank financial institutions that are systemically risky to
9 The U.S. financial regulatory apparatus consists of numerous agencies, each of which has a
distinct, though quite closely related, jurisdiction. A useful way to organize these agencies is
to categorize them into prudential bank regulators and market regulators. Prudential bank
regulators focus on specific financial institutions and ensure compliance with applicable risk
management and prudential rules. Within this category, the Federal Reserve Board regulates
all banks that are part of the Federal Reserve System and regulated BHCs. It also sets reserve
requirements, serves as the lender of last resort to banks, and assesses the overall soundness
of bank and BHC balance sheets, often in concert with other regulators. The Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides deposit insurance for depositors and regulates state
banks that are not Federal Reserve System members. The Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency (part of the Treasury Department) regulates national banking institutions and seeks
to foster both safety and competition within the national banking system. The main market
regulators are the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC). The SEC regulates securities exchanges, brokers, dealers, mutual
funds and investment advisers among other market participants. It enforces securities laws
and regulates the buying and selling of securities and securities-based derivatives. The CFTC
specifically regulates futures, commodity, options, and swap markets, including the exchanges,
dealers, and other intermediaries that constitute these markets.

U.S. financial stability, subjecting each designated company to enhanced
prudential standards and supervision by the Federal Reserve. While any
financial institution that performs maturity transformation faces run-risk, in
traditional banking the risk is mitigated through the use of deposit insurance
and the Federal Reserve’s availability as a lender of last resort. On the other
hand, many non-bank financial institutions engage in financial intermediation and therefore maturity and liquidity transformation, without explicit
public-sector guarantees, access to liquidity from the Federal Reserve, or
regulatory oversight.
Such non-bank financial institutions gather funds from those wishing
to invest, typically by issuing commercial paper, engaging in repurchase
agreements (repo), or issuing debt instruments.10 Money market mutual
funds (MMFs) or other types of investment funds, often purchase these
debt instruments on behalf of investors. Institutions engaged in such activities include large securities dealers, finance companies, and asset managers
who use such funds to invest in other assets that have longer maturity, less
liquidity, or both.
As discussed above, the size of the shadow-banking sector grew much
faster than the traditional banking sector in the decade leading up to the
financial crisis. Following the crisis, the sector shrank to the level seen earlier
in the 2000s and continued to decrease in the following years. Two other
important components of the shadow-banking sector, repo and commercial
paper, grew rapidly in the years prior to the crisis before falling in the years
following the crisis and ensuing recession. Figure 6-13 shows the repo market is well below its size in the years immediately preceding the crisis. As
Figure 6-14 shows, the commercial paper market has stabilized at a level well
below its peak in recent years. By adding additional oversight of the sector,
Dodd-Frank has reduced the likelihood of shadow-banking entities being
the source of financial instability.
As part of its mandate to identify risks to financial stability, in July
2013 the FSOC designated four non-bank firms as Non-Bank Systemically
Important Financial Institutions. These firms became subject to heightened
prudential requirements and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board.
This additional regulatory scrutiny, along with pressure from investors
and analysts, has led some firms to consider actions that will reduce their
10 A repurchase agreement, or repo, is a type of short-term loan where the “borrower” sells
securities to the “lender” with an agreement to buy them back at a future date at a slightly
higher price. This is similar to a collateralized loan except ownership of the collateral passes
between the borrower and lender. The difference in the selling price and the buyback price
represents the interest on the loan and is referred to as the ‘repo rate’.

systemic footprint. In April 2015, one of these firms, General Electric Capital
Corporation (GE Capital), announced that it would be selling off most of its
financing arm to “create a simpler, more valuable company,” and committed to working with the FSOC and the Federal Reserve to “take the actions
necessary to de-designate GE Capital as a Systemically Important Financial
Institution” (General Electric 2015). These actions resulted in the FSOC
rescinding the “systemically important financial institution” designation for
GE Capital on June 28, 2016.
Private funds can contribute to systemic risk in similar ways to other
large financial institutions.11 Losses at a large private fund may result in
default to creditors and the financial institutions with which the fund does
business. In addition, private funds often employ high levels of leverage.
Although leverage is not a perfect proxy for risk, there is ample evidence that
the use of leverage, in combination with other factors, can contribute to risks
to financial stability. These risks are likely to be greater if an elevated level
of leverage is employed; borrowing counterparties are large, highly interconnected financial institutions; counterparty margining requirements are
limited or lax and positions are infrequently marked to market; the underlying assets are less liquid and price discovery is poor; or other financial
institutions with large positions are involved in similar trading strategies.12
In 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) adopted new Form
PF, required by the Dodd-Frank Act to help the SEC, CFTC, and the FSOC
monitor hedge funds and other private funds, and identify potential systemic risks associated with their activities. The SEC makes available a summary report each quarter of the information reported on Form PF. As seen
in Figure 6-15, the number of private funds reported on Form PF has risen
from just over 20,000 to more than 26,000 including almost 9,000 hedge fund
filings. In addition to using these reports to identify systemic risks within the
United States, the SEC has provided certain aggregated, non-proprietary
Form PF data to the International Organization of Securities Commissions
(IOSCO) on large hedge funds to provide it with a more complete overview
of the global hedge fund market.
11 Private Funds are excluded from the definition of an investment company and are, therefore,
not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Private funds may be excluded
from the definition of an investment company by having fewer than 100 shareholders or
only being open to “qualified purchasers” (such as institutional investors or high-net worth
individuals) as defined by the SEC. Examples of private funds include hedge funds and private
equity funds.

Money market mutual funds (MMFs) are a particular type of mutual
fund that invests in debt securities with short maturities and very low credit
risk. These funds typically maintain a net asset value (NAV) of $1 even
when the actual value is slightly above or slightly below that value. As MMF
shares may be redeemed at $1 each on demand, the funds are still engaged
in maturity transformation. The funds face run-risk if the value of the
fund portfolio is thought to be less than $1, particularly because there is an
advantage to being the first to redeem. In 2010, the SEC adopted rules that
make structural and operational reforms to address risks of investor runs in
money market funds, while preserving the benefits of the funds. The purpose of these rules was to reduce the interest rate, credit and liquidity risks
of money market fund portfolios.
In 2012, as part of its efforts to identify and address systemic risks to
financial stability, the FSOC issued proposed recommendations for how the
SEC might address the risks to financial stability that money market mutual
funds (MMFs) continue to present. In 2014, the SEC finalized MMF reforms
that required structural and operational changes that address risks of investor runs in MMFs during times of financial stress but preserved the benefits
of such funds for investors and companies. Changes included requiring a
floating NAV for institutional prime money market funds, which allows
the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the
market-based value of fund assets and provides non-government money

market fund boards new tools – liquidity fees and redemption gates – to
address run-risk.13 Figure 6-16 shows the weighted-average maturity of
MMFs have declined by roughly ten days since the new regulations became
effective, increasing liquidity and reducing the sensitivity of net asset value
to changes in interest rates.14

Measures of Systemic Risk
The FSOC’s mandate includes identifying risks and responding to
emerging threats to financial stability, often referred to as systemic risk.
Scholars have proposed several different measures of systemic risk, each of
which measures an aspect of the tendency for the performance of financial
institutions to move together when the market is under stress. ∆CoVaR
measures the difference between the value at risk (VaR) for the financial
system when an institution is in distress and the VaR of the financial system
when the firm is in its median or typical state (Adrian and Brunnermeier
2014).15 The higher the ∆CoVaR, the more systemic risk is endemic within
the financial system. The distress insurance premium (DIP) is calculated as
the insurance premium that protects against the expected losses of a hypothetical portfolio of the liabilities of all large banks (Huang, Zhou, and Zhu
2011). Additionally, the Systemic Expected Shortfall (SES) estimates how
likely a certain institution is to be undercapitalized when the financial system as a whole is undercapitalized (Acharya et al., 2016). Figure 6-17 shows
the measures have receded since the financial crisis but remain above levels
prior to the crisis.
SRISK, measured by the New York University Volatility Laboratory,
translates systemic expected shortfall for the banking system into a dollar
figure in a simulated period of financial stress. This shortfall may be interpreted as the amount of capital required to absorb a large negative shock. As
shown below, the level of SRISK has come down since the financial crisis and
is approaching pre-crisis levels. Similar to the systemic risk measures above,
13 “Fees and redemption gates” refer to the fund board’s ability to impose liquidity fees or
to suspend redemptions temporarily, also known as “gate,” if a fund’s level of weekly liquid
assets falls below a certain threshold. This provides the ability to stop temporarily a run on the
mutual fund.
14 Many institutions withdrew funds from prime MMFs as the effective date for new SEC rules
that mandated a floating share price for institutional MMFs approached in October 2016. In
anticipation of additional withdrawals from these prime MMFs, managers kept an unusually
high portion of the portfolio in cash, reducing the weighted-average maturity. This is evident
in the rapid decrease in average maturity of these funds toward the end of the period in the
figure.
15 VaR is a measure of the likelihood of a big loss. If the 1 month 1% VaR is $10 million, then
there is only a 1 percent chance that there will be a loss greater than or equal to $10 million
over the month.

Resolving Failure
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, bankruptcy is the first, and preferred,
option to resolve a failing financial institution and protect the financial stability of the United States. To that end, the Act requires systemically important financial institutions to periodically submit living wills to the Federal
Reserve and the FDIC that detail a process for their orderly resolution under
the bankruptcy code in the event of material financial distress or failure. If
the banks’ plans are determined not to be credible and the banks do not
remedy those shortcomings in the allotted period of time, the regulators
may require the banks to take certain actions to simplify their structures,
including divestment of certain assets or operations. As a result, banks have
increased their focus on their resolvability.
The Federal Reserve and FDIC finalized rules relating to living wills
in October 2011. The latest round of evaluations by the agencies, completed
in April 2016, examined each living will of the eight systemically important
domestic banks. The agencies jointly determined that five of the eight
institutions’ living wills were “not credible or would not facilitate an orderly
resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,” and issued split determinations on two institutions’ living wills (FRB 2016). Only one bank, Citigroup,
did not fail both the Fed and FDIC’s evaluations. Those banks receiving
joint negative determinations were given until October 2016 to address
the specified deficiencies. If these firms do not mitigate the deficiencies by
the October deadline, the agencies may jointly impose stricter prudential
requirements, which may include measures to restrain the growth of these
firms. The two banks that received split determinations must address their
plans’ shortcomings by the next filing deadline of July 1, 2017. While the
2016 determinations revealed that much work remains, it was also a step
forward from the previous round of feedback given in August 2014 that had
identified broad shortcomings across 11 banking institutions evaluated.
The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new resolution mechanism, the
Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA), that could be used to resolve a failing
firm while limiting systemic risk and imposing all losses on the firm’s creditors. Together with financial reforms that are intended to increase the safety
and soundness of individual financial firms, these reforms are intended to
lower the risk to the broader financial system should a particular firm fail,
thus lowering the necessity of a bail-out. The DFA also restricts the Federal
Reserve’s emergency lending powers, making it harder for the Fed to lend
to a particular insolvent firm or remove toxic assets during a financial crisis.

Ending the Problem of Too-Big-To-Fail
Another component of systemic risk has been the view that some
firms may be too large to fail without threatening the whole financial system.
If these firms are indeed “too big to fail” (TBTF) it gives them a substantial
advantage as their counterparties in transactions will know they are less
likely to fail than similar firms without an implicit government guarantee.
(See Box 6-4 on the TBTF premium.) The implicit guarantee may also make
these firms more willing to take large risks as both the owners and managers
of these firms do not truly face the risk of downside scenarios as they may
feel they can count on the government to bail them out. The existence of
TBTF firms can also be a source of risk because their counterparties may
be wrong about which firms are TBTF. For example, some assumed the
government would never allow a firm like Lehman Brothers to fail and were
left exposed when Lehman declared bankruptcy.
The reforms of the last six years that the implementation of Basel III
and Dodd-Frank Act put in place included a number of measures to address
the risks posed by TBTF. First and foremost, these reforms have subjected
the largest and most complex financial institutions to enhanced supervision
designed to require these firms’ equity and debt holders to bear the costs
of the firms’ failures. These enhanced supervisions increase in stringency
based upon size and other risk factors. The most stringent rules apply

Strengthening the Financial System | 393

Box 6-4: Have We Ended “Too-Big-To-Fail”?
A financial institution that is “too-big-to-fail” (TBTF) is so large
and interconnected with the financial system that market participants
believe the government will intervene to prevent its failure. One of the
goals of recent financial reform is to eliminate TBTF by making systemically risky banks less likely to fail, reducing the government’s ability to
aid insolvent firms, and reducing the damage a failure would cause so
that such firms could be allowed to fail. Major credit rating agencies
have cited financial reform and the reduced likelihood of a government
bailout when downgrading the credit ratings of major U.S. banks. For
example, in November 2013, Moody’s lowered the so-called government
support component of its credit ratings for global systemically important
banks. In December 2015, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s
downgraded eight of the largest U.S. banks by a notch, saying it believes
the banks are less likely to receive a government bailout if they find
themselves in financial trouble. While ratings are not necessarily reflective of general market expectations, these actions suggest that financial
reform has been successful in reducing TBTF.
A widely studied measure of TBTF is whether certain institutions
are able to borrow more cheaply because of the perception that they will
ultimately be bailed out if they fail. It was clear that many large financial
firms were able to borrow more cheaply both shortly before and during
the Financial Crisis because market participants did not believe that such
institutions would be allowed to fail. Several more recent estimates of this
funding advantage find it to be much reduced or eliminated. Although
financial reforms have likely had an impact on TBTF, the improved macroeconomic atmosphere may make any existing funding advantage very
difficult to detect, so a definitive measure of whether the TBTF advantage
still exists may not be apparent until another crisis appears.
The costs of TBTF go beyond the direct costs of bail-outs. TBTF
creates incentives that many consider socially harmful. Investors are
willing to provide their funds to a TBTF bank without evaluating the
safety and soundness of their investment because they believe that the
government will bail them out should the bank get into trouble. This
allows managers to engage in risky investment behavior, with the bank
keeping the gains should those investments pay off but with taxpayers
bearing the loss in the event of a near failure. These institutions also
enjoy a TBTF discount on their funding costs, allowing them to borrow
at lower interest rates than similar institutions that are not considered by
investors to be TBTF. This discount is anticompetitive as it gives large
or more systemically connected firms an advantage over smaller or new
institutions.

394  |  Chapter 6

In the absence of another financial crisis, it is difficult to definitively prove that financial reform has reduced or eliminated TBTF. Much
has changed from the pre-crisis to the post-crisis period. First, today’s
macroeconomic environment is more benign than during the crisis, suggesting that the difference in the probability of default with and without
an expected bail-out is small. This may make it more difficult to find
evidence of changes in TBTF. Second, Sarin and Summers (2016) provide evidence that market-based measures of risk are not lower during
the post-crisis period, perhaps because financial reform has lowered the
franchise value of banks. This may impact funding costs in the post-crisis
period making it difficult to detect a reduction in TBTF. Finally, financial
reform has mandated increases in capital and liquidity that may impact
funding costs. Nevertheless, one approach to evaluating the effectiveness
of the reforms on reducing or eliminating TBTF is to analyze the borrowing costs of large banks. A firm’s borrowing cost should reflect the firm’s
credit risk. A financial institution that the market views as TBTF should
enjoy a lower cost of borrowing than an otherwise identical institution.
It is important to distinguish between TBTF and a bank’s size.
A bank that is TBTF will likely be big, but not every large bank will be
TBTF. There is evidence that larger banks benefit from economies of
scale (Hughes and Mester 2013, Wheelock and Wilson 2016). Large
banks have global reach and more diversified services, and can provide
financial products and services that small banks cannot offer (Bernanke
2016). The tradable debt of larger financial institutions tends to be more
liquid. Each of these factors would likely reduce the borrowing cost of a
large bank for reasons other than TBTF.
Scholars have taken several approaches to measure the TBTF
premium. One approach uses a statistical technique to see if a bank’s cost
of borrowing varies with its size or designation of being “systemically
important” after controlling for other variables related to credit risk.
Examples include GAO (2014); Acharya, Anginer and Warburton
(2016); and Balasubramnian and Cyree (2014). A second approach
compares the market price of a contract that protects a bond holder from
losses should the bond issuer default, known as a credit default swap
(CDS), with the theoretical fair value of such a contract. An example of a
study that uses such an approach is IMF (2014). A third approach compares the credit rating of a firm as a stand-alone enterprise with one that
includes the possibility of government support. The difference between
these two ratings may be interpreted as an indication of the size of the
TBTF premium. Examples of studies using such an approach include
IMF (2014) and Ueda and Weder di Mauro (2013).

Strengthening the Financial System | 395

Scholars using each of these methodologies have generally shown
that the TBTF premium was positive but low in the 20 years before the
crisis, illustrated by Figure 6-x (Acharya, Anginer, and Warburton 2016).
During the financial crisis the TBTF subsidy spiked to approximately
100 basis points (bps). By 2012, the estimated subsidy had declined to
roughly 25 bps. This illustrates an important point: the TBTF premium
varies with time as market expectations change, especially regarding
the likelihood of a government bailout. During a financial crisis, the
probability of a financial firm’s failure increases as does the probability
that the government will rescue a TBTF firm, increasing the difference
between the borrowing costs of a TBTF and a comparable non-TBTF
financial firm.
While Acharya, Anginer, and Warburton (2016) are skeptical
about the effects of post-crisis regulation on TBTF, several studies
find that since the crisis, the TBTF premium either has effectively
disappeared or has decreased to levels comparable with those pre-crisis.
Balasubramnian and Cyree (2014) found the funding cost advantage of
banks subject to the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis
and Review declined from 244 bps in the six-month period preceding
passage of the Dodd-Frank Act to a statistically insignificant 6 bps in the
six-month period following the law’s passage. GAO (2014) uses 42 different econometric models to estimate the TBTF premium each year from
2006 to 2013. They find that while systemically important banks enjoyed

lower funding costs in 2007-09, “such funding cost differences may have
declined or reversed in recent years.”
Using the CDS approach, IMF (2014) finds that the TBTF premium rose from near zero bps in 2005 to over 50 bps during the crisis. As
of 2013, the premium had declined to around 15 bps, an improvement
since 2009 but not yet as low as levels in 2005 through 2007 and still
indicative of a funding advantage. The United States appears to have
been more successful than other advanced economies in narrowing the
TBTF premium, though; the advanced economy average as measured by
CDS spreads is approximately 40 bps as of the start of 2014, well above
the level in the U.S. (as shown in Figure 6-xi).
The credit ratings-based approach also shows that the TBTF
premium for systemically important institutions fell from a high of 30
bps to 15 bps, close to but still about 9 bps above the level in 2005. The
ratings approach can also decompose the TBTF premium into effects
from the probability that a firm becomes distressed and the expectation
of bail-out when that firm is in distress. Using ratings for systemically
important firms that are sub-investment grade, IMF (2014) finds that,
despite a marked decline from crisis levels, the TBTF premium in 2013
was more than 10 bps above its level in 2005. Ratings, however, are slow
to adjust to market conditions and suffer from conflicting views among
different credit rating agencies.

Overall, the funding advantage of global systemically important
banks has declined since the crisis. While measures of the TBTF
premium still vary across the academic literature, several studies have
found that the premium as of 2013 was either statistically insignificant
or significantly narrower than the levels during, and in, the three
years after the financial crisis. Further, while the benign financial and
macroeconomic conditions of the post-crisis period could be partially
driving this decrease in the TBTF premium, studies such as IMF (2014)
and Balasubramnian and Cyree (2014) that examine changes in borrowing costs around announcements of policy reforms find that they
have driven up borrowing costs for systemically important institutions,
suggesting that policy changes have had at least some effect in narrowing
the TBTF premium.

to systematically important financial institutions and global systemically
important banks (G-SIBs), which have become designated under recent
reforms. Such a designation in no way guarantees a bailout or codifies a firm
as TBTF, but rather adds rules to minimize the risk that the institution will
fail and adds additional responsibilities so that it is possible for the institution to fail without endangering the broader system.
These enhanced rules include significantly higher standards for
capital, stress-testing, liquidity, loss-absorbing capability, and resolution. In
particular, the establishment of the OLA is meant to allow such firms to be
resolved without taxpayer support and without endangering the rest of the
financial system.

Transparency, Accountability, and Protecting Consumers and
Investors
Beyond the broad measures needed to make financial institutions
safer and to limit systemic risk, the crisis highlighted a number of issues of
transparency and fairness within the financial system. As noted previously,
information asymmetries may mean that financial professionals and firms
likely have substantial information advantages relative to their customers or
investors. This may require regulation that can improve the transparency of
the actions of those financial firms, and the accountability of those firms to
their investors, or simply to protect consumers from bad behavior.
Protecting consumers is warranted both to preserve their confidence in
the financial system and because consumers ill-informed concerning financial products may be more likely to take on inappropriate loans and increase
risk in the system more broadly. The Administration took numerous steps
398  |  Chapter 6

through the Dodd-Frank Act and other measures to improve the information available in the financial system through reforms to derivatives markets,
credit rating agencies, investor accountability, and through the creation of a
new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Improving Transparency and Oversight of Derivatives
Increased transparency in the financial system promotes investor
protection and better enables market participants to price assets, risk, and
other relevant inputs to financial decisions. Part of the cause of the financial
crisis was a lack of critical information about counterparties. As the crisis
unfolded, the potential exposures of large financial institutions to other
financial institutions that were either known or suspected to be near bankruptcy led to a general unwillingness to enter into any additional transactions. This contributed to the seizing up of credit markets.
A number of measures showed how acute the problem was in late
2008. When there is fear of counter-party risk, banks will charge one another
more than the safe interest rate to lend in overnight markets. One such
measure of perceived credit risk in the interbank market is the TED spread,
which is the difference between the three-month London Interbank Offered
Rate (LIBOR)16 and the three-month yield on U.S. Treasury bills. Figure
6-19 shows the TED spread for the years 2007 through October 2016. The
TED spread jumped in the summer of 2007 when stress in the markets began
to show and then again after Lehman Brothers’ collapse in September 2008.
An important part of making the system more stable was improving transparency among firms so that they could lend to one another more freely.17
One important way in which financial institutions had financial exposure to each other was through over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts.
Just ahead of Lehman’s collapse, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was
collecting information on the exposures created by Lehman’s more than
900,000 derivative contracts. The volume of outstanding contracts and the

16 LIBOR is an average of the rates at which large banks in London are willing to lend to
each other in dollars. Collected by survey, LIBOR has been the focus of investigations
of manipulation by individuals within the participating banks who were responsible for
responding to the survey in cooperation with traders.
17 The LIBOR increase in 2016 is likely due to money market reform rather than increased
credit risk of large banks. New SEC rules for money market mutual funds that as of Oct. 14,
2016 mandated a floating share price for institutional MMFs that invest in commercial paper
and bank CDs had driven the increase. As that date approached, many institutions withdrew
from those funds in favor of those funds that only invest in government securities and whose
NAV will not float. The effect was a reduction in funds that provide a source of short-term
funding for banks, pushing up rates such as LIBOR.

difficulty in creating a complete picture of such exposures highlighted the
need for better data.
Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are determined
by reference to other “underlying assets,” and include forwards, futures,
options, and swaps. These instruments are useful to investors and businesses seeking to hedge risks. For example, an airline may need to hedge its
exposure to oil price fluctuations or a pension fund may need to hedge its
exposure to interest rate changes. Derivatives often create leverage because
changes in the value of the underlying asset can be magnified many times in
the value of the derivative contract. Thus, while they can be used to hedge
against risks, derivatives can also be used to increase exposure to risky assets
and can concentrate risk rather than dispersing risk among many market
participants. Many derivatives have standardized terms, are traded on
exchanges, and are cleared through central counterparties (CCPs). Exchange
trading and central clearing create a record of prices and transactions that
can be used by the public in the price discovery process and by regulators
to measure the exposures of market participants. Central clearing also helps
mitigate counter-party credit risk.

400  |  Chapter 6

Prior to the financial crisis, one category of derivatives, swaps, was not
standardized and was traded over-the-counter.18 The trading volume and
outstanding notional value of these swaps, particularly the type known as a
credit default swap, grew rapidly prior to the financial crisis and formed a
complex network of exposures among large financial institutions.19,20 Only
the two parties to the transaction were typically aware that the transaction had occurred, resulting in an opaque market in which there was little
transparency around either prices or exposures. The lack of transparency
in exposures could result in a concentration of risk in particular financial
institutions as occurred with AIG just prior to the financial crisis. As Figure
6-20 shows the rapid growth in several types of OTC derivatives in the years
leading up to the financial crisis.21
The Dodd-Frank Act took a number of steps to reform the OTC
market in derivatives, including the reporting of all swap trades to a trade
repository, the public reporting of certain trade information, the posting of
margin against possible losses resulting from counterparty default, the mandatory clearing of standardized swap contracts through registered central
counterparties, trading on exchange-like trading facilities, and registration
and regulation of swap dealers and certain large market participants. These
steps were intended, among other purposes, to reduce the opaque nature
of the derivatives market, to improve price transparency and to reduce
systemic risk.
Under Dodd-Frank, swap and security-based swap dealers and major
swap and security-based swap participants are required to register with and
be subject to supervision by the CFTC and SEC. As of November 2016,
more than 100 swap dealers were provisionally registered with the CFTC.
The SEC estimates that as many as 50 security-based swap dealers, many of
18 A swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange sequences of cash flows for a set
period of time. Types of swaps include interest rate, foreign exchange, and credit default. For
example, in an interest rate swap one party pays a fixed amount and the counterparty pays an
amount determined by a variable interest rate such as LIBOR.
19 A credit default swap (CDS) is a particular type of swap designed to transfer the credit
exposure of a fixed income security from the buyer to the seller. The CDS buyer makes
periodic payments to the seller, who, in the event of default, pays the buyer the difference
between the face value and the defaulted value of the security. CDS are often used by buyers
to hedge the credit risk of bond positions and by sellers to create positions that are similar to
holding the underlying bond. Dodd-Frank reforms have ensured that most such transactions
are required to have collateral posted to insure performance of the contract.
20 The notional value of a swap contract is the nominal or face value and is used to calculate
payments made on the instrument. With respect to CDS, the notional value represents the face
value of the debt security whose credit risk is transferred from buyer to seller of the CDS.
21 It is important to look at global trading activity for several reasons. These include the fact
that a sizeable fraction of these transactions are between parties in different jurisdictions and
many participants in these transactions, particularly dealers, have a global presence and the
jurisdiction in which they book the transaction is often a matter of choice.

22 After a trade is executed between a buyer and a seller, the CCP steps between the two
counterparties and becomes the buyer to the seller and the seller to the buyer. Thus the CCP
assumes the credit risk that used to be borne by the original counterparties. This can reduce
risk in a number of ways including standardizing collateral requirements for all participants,
allowing for the regulation of risk management practices, and promoting trade compression
which reduces the total amount of trades outstanding. For example, if firm A buys a certain
CDS (buys protection) from firm B on Monday and then firm A sells the same contract (sells
protection) to firm C on Tuesday, because both trades have the CCP as the counterparty, they
would “compress” resulting in no position for firm A.

basis.24 One of the advantages of central clearing is the increased ability of
market participants to reduce their total exposure through trade compression – the canceling of equal and offsetting positions – that reduces the total
amount of derivative positions outstanding. Figure 6-21 shows the rapid
increase in trade compression in interest rate swaps as rules requiring their
mandatory clearing came into effect.
Twenty-three swap execution facilities are now registered with the
CFTC and the application of one additional swap execution facility is
pending. The SEC estimates that as many as 20 security-based swap execution facilities will register with the SEC when its applicable rules become
effective, many of which will also be registered with the CFTC. According
to information compiled by the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (ISDA), in the first 10 months of 2016, 55 percent of total interest rate derivative notional value and 76 percent of total CDS notional value
takes place on swap execution facilities, the exchange-like electronic trading
platforms required by Dodd-Frank.
The Dodd-Frank Act improved the ability of regulators to oversee this
market by requiring that all swap transactions be reported to registered swap
data repositories (SDRs) and that summary information be periodically
reported to the public. As of the fall of 2016, there are four SDRs provisionally registered with the CFTC and the SEC estimates that two SDRS will
be registered with it when its rules become effective. In addition, there are
many more trade repositories registered and operating overseas, including
six registered with the European Securities and Market Authority, making a
previously opaque market significantly more transparent.

Credit Rating Agencies
Credit rating agencies play an important role in the financial system.
When a bank makes a loan, the bank is responsible for assessing the credit
quality of the borrower and monitoring the performance of the loan. In a
capital market, borrowers seek to raise funds by issuing bonds or other debt
obligations to numerous investors. In this case, investors must either make
their own determinations as to the borrower’s creditworthiness, which is
made more difficult given the information asymmetries between the borrower and the investors, or rely on third parties to perform this function.
This is the role of credit rating agencies: they rate the creditworthiness of
borrowers and the probability of default of bonds and other debt instruments, and provide surveillance on borrower’s performance.
24 A single-name CDS is a contract that pays the difference between the face value of a
particular bond and the market value of that bond when the issuer defaults.

financial systems. Many regulations referred to specific credit ratings, many
investment funds limited themselves to holding only assets with a certain
minimum rating, and ratings were a crucial part in determining what collateral was permissible in a number of transaction types, including repo transactions. In exchange for adhering to various reporting requirements, the
SEC provides interested and eligible credit rating agencies with a Nationally
Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) designation. The designation is particularly important because a variety of State and Federal laws
and regulations reference NRSRO ratings.
One concern that emerged from the crisis was the problems with the
incentives of the ratings agencies themselves. Although investors are the
primary users of ratings, issuers hire and pay most rating agencies. The socalled issuer-pay compensation model raises conflicts of interest issues and
can lead to “rating shopping.” If an issuer believes a credit rating agency
is likely to rate its debt lower than other agencies, the issuer would be less
likely to hire that rating agency. This structure provided incentives for credit
rating agencies to inflate ratings, and is compounded by the highly concentrated nature of the industry.
The Dodd-Frank Act created the Office of Credit Ratings within the
SEC to oversee and conduct annual examinations of each NRSRO. The

404  |  Chapter 6

findings from the NRSRO examinations are described in annual public
reports published by the SEC. The examinations have shown a number
of improvements, but have also identified continuing concerns, including
those about the management of conflicts of interest, internal supervisory
controls, and post-employment activities of former staff of NRSROs.
To improve transparency over the ratings process, the Dodd-Frank
Act required enhanced public disclosure of NRSROs’ credit rating procedures and methodologies, certain business practices, and credit ratings performance. According to the SEC, in 2014, “there [was] a trend of NRSROs
issuing unsolicited commentaries on solicited ratings issued by other
NRSROs, which has increased the level of transparency within the credit
ratings industry” (SEC 2014). The SEC reported that this trend continued in
2015. In addition, some NRSROs have issued unsolicited commentaries on
an asset class, rather than a specific transaction.
The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated references to credit ratings in certain
Federal laws and required all Federal agencies to remove references to credit
ratings from their regulations. To that end, the financial regulators adopted
rule changes that removed references and, where appropriate, substituted
alternative standards of creditworthiness.

Improved Accountability to Shareholders
The financial crisis led to policy concerns about a possible link
between excessive financial firm risk taking and executive compensation
practices. For example, a financial executive considering a very risky investment might weigh the potential personal benefit if the investment pays off
against the personal loss if the investment fails. If the benefit, say a very large
bonus, is more valuable to the executive than the potential loss, perhaps the
risk of getting fired, then the executive has an incentive to make the risky
investment. The best interest of the shareholders or the risks to either the
firm or the financial system might only be of secondary importance to the
executive.
Policymakers were concerned about what economists call “misaligned
incentives” in 2008, one of the motivations for the Troubled Asset Relief
Program subjecting recipients to various executive pay restrictions and
corporate governance requirements. Soon after, the Federal Reserve issued
guidelines for reviewing banks’ pay structures to identify any compensation
arrangements that provide incentives to take excessive risk.
In accordance with requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC
adopted rules in 2011 that require public companies subject to the Federal
proxy rules to provide shareholder advisory ‘say-on-pay,’ ‘say-on-frequency,’
and ‘golden parachute’ votes on executive compensation. Say-on-pay refers

Strengthening the Financial System | 405

to a shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation, say-on-frequency
refers to the frequency of say-on-pay votes, and golden parachute to advisory votes on compensation arrangements and understandings in connection with merger transactions. In 2015, 2,157 Russell 3000 companies had a
say-on-pay vote, providing shareholders with the information they need to
monitor potential abuses and an opportunity for shareholders to voice their
opinion concerning steep increases in executive compensation packages.
Sixty-one Russell 3000 companies (2.8 percent) had shareholders reject their
2015 say-on-pay vote.
In accordance with requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC
adopted rules in 2012 directing the national securities exchanges and
national securities associations to prohibit the listing of any equity security
of an issuer that does not comply with new compensation committee and
compensation adviser requirements. To conform their rules to the new
requirements, national securities exchanges that have rules providing for
the listing of equity securities filed proposed rule changes with the SEC.
The Commission issued final orders approving the proposed rule changes
in January 2013.
Sponsors of asset-backed securities are now required to provide
consistent, asset-level information to investors, improving clarity regarding
the risks associated with these securities. Sponsors are also now required to
retain a portion of the credit risk associated with the assets collateralizing
the securities, better aligning the behavior of originators, securitizers, and
investors, and addressing many of the perverse incentives that contributed
to the financial crisis.
Wall Street reform recognized that markets require transparency to
work properly. By shining a light on hidden business structures and increasing information for all participants, Wall Street reform has helped to realign
incentives so that markets work for everyone.

Protecting Consumers
Consumers often know less about the investment or financial service
they are considering than the financial industry professional with which they
are doing business. Protecting consumers from this problem of asymmetric
information by providing consistent and rigorous consumer protections is
important to preserve consumer confidence in the financial system. If the
consumer believes he or she cannot get a fair deal then the consumer is
less likely to take advantage of the many beneficial financial services that
are available for financing major purchases as well as saving for college or
retirement.

406  |  Chapter 6

Prior to the crisis, enforcement of laws meant to protect consumers from predatory practices was divided among multiple agencies. The
Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
“to ensure that important fair lending, debt collection, consumer credit,
and other borrower protections were updated in response to quickly
changing markets and consistently enforced nationwide” (U.S. House of
Representatives, 2015). The financial crisis revealed that laws meant to
protect consumers from predatory practices are meaningless if they are not
enforced, and that consumers needed a government agency focused on their
needs and experiences.
As of November 2016, the CFPB has returned $11.7 billion to more
than 27 million harmed consumers —including homeowners, students,
seniors, and service members. As of July 2016, millions of consumers have
also taken advantage of the Bureau’s financial resources at consumerfinance.
gov and 930,700 complaints have been submitted to a database for collecting
consumer complaints against service providers that have proved otherwise
unresponsive.
The CFPB has been establishing and enforcing clear rules of the
road and consumer protections to prevent the kinds of predatory behavior
that contributed to the financial crisis. The CFPB protects consumers of a
wide range of financial products and services, including mortgage loans,
credit cards, student loans, car loans, and deposit products. The CFPB is
developing landmark consumer protections for products often targeted to
the unbanked and underbanked, such as prepaid accounts, payday loans,
and car title loans. The CFPB also protects consumers with respect to other
industry activities, such as debt collection and credit reporting.
In the lead up to the financial crisis, abusive lending practices and
poor underwriting standards resulted in risky mortgages that hurt borrowers across the country. Wall Street reform addresses abusive practices in
mortgage markets, including by improving disclosure requirements, curbing
unfair servicing practices, restricting compensation practices that created
conflicts of interest, and establishing protections for high-cost mortgage
loans. In addition, mortgage lenders are required to make reasonable, good
faith determinations that a borrower is able to repay her mortgage loan.
More than 16 million mortgages are covered by the CFPB’s Ability-to-Repay
rule’s protections and that number grows every month. Reforms also protect
service members from deceptive mortgage advertising practices, predatory
lending schemes, and hidden fees for automatic bill pay services.

Additional Investor Protections
The SEC’s Whistleblower Office, created by the Dodd-Frank Act,
became fully operational in 2011. In fiscal year 2014, the SEC received over
3,600 tips, covering a variety of securities law violations including those
relating to corporate disclosures, financial statements, security offering
fraud, market manipulation, investment adviser fraud, and broker-dealer
rule compliance. Whistleblowers that provide the SEC with original information that leads to a successful enforcement action with monetary sanctions exceeding $1 million are eligible to receive an award ranging from 10 to
30 percent of the amounts collected in the action. As of November 2016, 34
whistleblowers have received awards with the total exceeding $110 million,
with the highest award being over $30 million.
The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the CFTC’s ability to prosecute
manipulation by prohibiting, among other things, manipulative and deceptive devices that are intentionally or recklessly employed, regardless of
whether the conduct in question was intended to create, or did create, an
artificial price. This authority provides the CFTC with more flexibility to go
after reckless manipulation and fraud. The first case brought by the CFTC
using this authority was against Panther Energy Trading LLC in 2013 for
engaging in the disruptive practice of “spoofing” by using a computer algorithm to illegally place and quickly cancel bids and offers in futures contracts
without ever intending to buy or sell those contracts. The CFTC also used
this authority to bring charges against Navinder Singh Sarao for his role in
contributing to the May 6, 2010 Flash Crash and in 2013 against JPMorgan
Chase Bank in connection with its “London Whale” swaps trades.
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC established the Office
of the Investor Advocate, charged with identifying investor protection
concerns and proposing to the SEC and Congress any administrative or
legislative changes necessary to mitigate those concerns. Similarly, the
Dodd-Frank Act also established the Investor Advisory Committee (IAC)
comprised of the Investor Advocate, a representative of state securities commissions, a representative of the interests of senior citizens, and no fewer
than 10 and not more than 20 members appointed by the SEC to represent
the interests of various types of individual and institutional investors. The
IAC may submit findings and recommendations for review and consideration by the Commission, which must promptly issue a public statement
assessing those findings or recommendations and disclosing the action,
if any, the SEC intends to take. Since its inception, the IAC has issued 14
recommendations covering: shortening the trade settlement cycle in U.S.
financial markets, the definition of an accredited investor, impartiality in
the disclosure of preliminary voting results, crowdfunding, decimalization,

Box 6-5: Addressing the Problem of Conflicted
Investment Advice for Retirement Savings
In April 2016, the Department of Labor (DOL) finalized a rule
that substantially expanded the number of providers of financial advice
required to adhere to a fiduciary standard, which requires them to put
their clients’ best interest before their own profits. The rule makes considerable progress in upholding consumer protections in the retirement
savings marketplace.
Individuals saving for retirement usually make use of one or more
of three major types of retirement plans. First, defined benefit (DB) plans
provided by many public and private employers promise specified payments to the retiree that depend on characteristics of their work history,
such as age, years of service and salary of the employee. The employer
that sponsors the plan is typically responsible for making contributions
to the plan adequate to finance the promised payments. If investment
returns are less than expected, the plan sponsor is required to make up
the difference. Another type of employer-sponsored plan is the defined
contribution (DC) plan, such as a 401(k), which pays a retiree an amount
based on how much the beneficiary and employers have contributed
in his or her working years and the investment return earned on those
contributions. The beneficiary typically has several investment options
to choose from within the plan but bears the risk of lower retirement income if the investment returns are less than expected. Lastly,
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA) are savings accounts composed
solely of an individual’s contributions during his or her working years.
IRAs require individuals to make all investment decisions. In terms
of investing retirement savings, employer-sponsored defined benefit
(DB) plans generally delegate retirement savings of all participants to
investment professionals who must serve the best interests of their
clients. Employer-sponsored defined contribution (DC) plans typically
give employees a list of investment options from which to choose. While
IRAs offer individuals the most freedom to invest their retirement
assets, it also means they must interact directly with those who provide
investment products and investment advice. This has become more
important as IRA assets have grown from 2 percent to 31 percent of all
retirement assets from 1978 to 2015 (Figure 6-xii) During this period,
the investment landscape has become much more complex and as a
result, financial advice has become increasingly important to individual’s
investment strategies. One survey found that roughly half of households
that own a traditional IRA have a retirement strategy created with the
help of an investment adviser (Holden and Schrass 2015).

A growing body of academic and industry literature shows that
such investment advice is not always in the best interest of clients. Table
6-i shows that savers may obtain advice from one of two main types of
investment professionals: registered investment advisers (RIA), who
have a fiduciary duty to clients; and broker-dealers, who are required
to give only “suitable” investment advice. In addition, only registered
investment advisers may give holistic advice on a client’s investments,
whereas broker-dealers primarily transact in financial markets and may
provide only incidental advice to clients (SEC 2011).
Compensation structures for professionals who give financial
advice often introduce conflicts of interest. Some investment advisers receive conflicted payments, which is compensation that depends
directly on the actions taken by the advisee, such as trading shares of a
company or selling shares of a fund. Certain types of mutual funds share
a higher proportion of their revenues with advisers that sell them, or
pay advisers relatively high fees per share that they sell to clients. These
types of compensation structures incentivize advisers to steer investors
into such products even if they are not optimal for a client’s investment needs. Alternative compensation schemes such as an hourly rate
or a yearly management fee charged as a percentage of assets provide
payments that depend less on investment decisions and provide less
opportunities for conflict of interest. Advisers not subject to a fiduciary
standard may direct clients into funds that while meeting a “suitability”
standard, are not in the best interests of the client.

A substantial body of academic literature shows that conflicted
advice leads to lower investment returns.1 In previous work, CEA estimated that savers receiving conflicted advice earn returns roughly one
percentage point lower than they would have otherwise and these losses
amounted to $17 billion annually.2
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), enacted
in 1974, regulates the provision of financial advice to retirement investors. Prior to the finalization of the new rule in 2016, the rules governing
retirement advice had not changed meaningfully since 1975 despite the
significant changes in the retirement savings marketplace. Starting in
2009, DOL started a reform effort to combat the problems stemming
from conflicted investment advice. It proposed a new fiduciary rule in
2015, and after receiving stakeholder comment, adopted a revised rule
in April 2016.
In its new rule, the DOL extends the fiduciary duty broadly to
financial professionals giving investment advice for retirement plans
subject to ERISA, including broker-dealers. The new rule requires that
financial advisors who receive commissions and other transaction-based
payments provide advice that is in the best interest of the client and commit to a set of policies and procedures that ensures that the advisor meets
this standard. The intent of the rule is to protect retirement investors and
ensure that the advice they receive is in their best interest. Though this

(2014), and Christofferson, Evans, and Musto (2013).

report “The Effects of Conflicted Investment Advice on Retirement Savings.”

rule does not ban such “conflicted payments,” it does stipulate that those
institutions still receiving such transaction-based compensation must
have clients sign a best interest contract exemption, which pledges that
the adviser will act in the client’s best interest.
While the rule will only apply to transactions beginning in April
2017, the effects will become evident sooner as investment advisers
adjust their business practices to comply with the new regulations.
Analysts anticipate that the effects will be large. Morningstar estimates
that the rule will require that accounts with more than $800 billion of
defined contribution plan assets that are receiving some form of advice
be checked for compliance. In addition, wealth management firms will
need to justify that over $200 billion of IRA rollovers are in the clients’
best interest. Commentators envision that the plan will place the highest costs on independent broker-dealers, formerly obliged only to offer
suitable investment advice. Registered investment advisors (RIAs) will
bear smaller costs given they are already under a fiduciary standard. The
additional liability of a best interest contract exemption will likely incentivize broker-dealers to switch to fee-based compensation structures.
Since fee-based compensation may make small accounts less profitable,
advisers could decide either to drop small retirement accounts or shift
them into automated advice accounts —so called “robo-advisors.” While
the results of these regulations will become more apparent in the coming
year, the initial commitment of some firms toward lower fee, passive
products, should then lower costs to consumers, consistent with the
original intent of the DOL rule.

legislation to fund investment adviser examinations, broker-dealer fiduciary
duty, data tagging, and target date mutual funds.

International Cooperation
The U.S. financial system does not exist in a vacuum. Massive volumes
of capital flow between U.S. financial markets and those abroad. Over the
course of a month, foreign residents buy and sell trillions of dollars’ worth
of U.S. assets to or from U.S. residents. European banks were major borrowers from U.S. money market funds and subsequently major investors
in U.S. asset markets. Foreign domiciled financial institutions play sizable
roles in many aspects of U.S. financial markets. In addition, U.S. financial
firms compete for business in financial markets around the world with firms
regulated by other countries’ rules. Reforming the U.S. financial system and
regulatory architecture alone would be insufficient to ensure the safety of the
U.S. financial system if there were not important steps to ensure the global

412  |  Chapter 6

financial system and the systems of those of our partners were also better
regulated.
In September 2009, the G-20 met in Pittsburgh to discuss, among
other things, the measures the member nations had taken to address the
global crisis and the additional steps necessary to build a stronger international financial system. The international financial reform agenda that
came from the Pittsburgh and subsequent G-20 meetings aimed to ensure
a “race to the top” to raise the quality of regulation and thereby the safety
of the international financial system as well as level the playing field across
major and emerging financial centers. To this end, G-20 leaders called for
the establishment of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to serve a key role in
promoting the reform of international financial regulation and to promote
financial stability and endorsed its original charter at the Pittsburg meeting.
The Dodd-Frank Act is fully consistent with — and in a number of areas
surpasses —the G-20 recommendations. Initiatives proposed in Pittsburgh
and subsequent G-20 meetings include: 1. Strengthening bank capital and
liquidity; 2. Reducing the risk posed by large systemically important financial institutions; 3. Making derivatives markets safer and more transparent;
4. Establishing higher capital margins for non-centrally cleared derivatives;
and 5. Identifying parties to financial transactions.
Consistency of regulatory approach across jurisdictions is important
because so much financial activity occurs between financial institutions
located in different jurisdictions. To the extent that financial market activity can move to the jurisdiction with the weakest regulation and with the
interconnected nature of the world economy, a financial crisis that begins in
one country can quickly spread to others. A consistent regulatory approach
across countries makes the financial system in every country safer.
The FSB produces a semiannual report that tracks the progress of
regulatory reform around the world.25 As seen in Figure 6-22, within the
24 FSB member jurisdictions, progress in implementing banking regulation
reform has been widespread with considerable progress having been made
in the reform of OTC derivative markets. Other initiatives have not yet been
implemented beyond a few jurisdictions though progress continues.
25 The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is an international body that monitors and makes
recommendations about the global financial system. It was established after the 2009 G-20
London summit in April 2009. The FSB includes representatives from 24 countries plus The
World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Bank for International Settlements, Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development, European Central Bank, European Commission,
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, International Association of Insurance Supervisors,
International Organization of Securities Commissions,  International Accounting Standards
Board, Committee on the Global Financial System, and Committee on Payments and Market
Infrastructures.

The United States has made substantial progress in implementing the
priority reforms identified by the FSB. The United States has fully implemented reforms in nearly all of the priority areas and is making progress in
others. Many major advanced economies with large financial systems that
are highly interconnected with the U.S. financial system —in particular the
United Kingdom and the euro area —are also making substantial progress.

U.S. Financial Markets in 2016
Seven years after the end of the financial crisis, the purpose of financial reform remains the same: to reduce as much as possible the likelihood
of another financial crisis and the incalculable costs that it would inflict on
the economy, the financial markets, and society. The recovering economy
and implementation of financial reform have been accompanied by strong
performance of a wide variety of financial market indicators. Not only have
financial markets recovered from the losses suffered during the crisis, but
banks are healthier and stronger, regulators are on the lookout for systemic
risk, once-opaque derivative markets are safer and more transparent, credit
ratings agencies are subject to more effective oversight and increased transparency, and investor protections have been strengthened.
A variety of measures show the renewed health of the financial
markets. Equity prices and housing prices have rebounded, rebuilding

Box 6-6: The JOBS Act
While it was an imperative to correct the market failures and
excesses in the pre-2008 financial system, an important aspect of
financial regulatory reform is ensuring funds can be channeled to
entrepreneurs who have productive uses for capital. In April of 2012, the
President signed into law the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS)
Act, a bipartisan bill that enacts many of the President’s proposals to
encourage startups and support the nation’s small businesses. The Act
allows for “crowdfunding”, expands “mini-public offerings,” and creates
an “IPO on-ramp”, all of which allow for easier funding of small businesses while maintaining important investor protections.
As implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission,
“crowdfunding” allows startups and small businesses to raise up to $1
million annually from many small-dollar investors through web-based
platforms, democratizing access to capital. Investor protections include
a requirement that crowdfunding platforms must be registered with
a self-regulatory organization and regulated by the SEC. In addition,
investors’ annual combined investments in crowdfunded securities are
limited based on an income and net worth test. SEC rules implementing
the crowdfunding portion of the JOBS Act became effective in May 2016
making it possible for entrepreneurs across the country to raise smalldollar investments from ordinary Americans.
Prior to the JOBS Act, the existing “Regulation A” exemption from
certain SEC requirements for small businesses seeking to raise less than
$5 million in a public offering was seldom used. The JOBS Act raises this
threshold to $50 million, streamlining the process for smaller innovative
companies to raise capital consistent with investor protections. The SEC
rules implementing this portion of the Act became effective in the summer of 2015.
The JOBS Act makes it easier for young, high-growth firms to go
public by providing an incubator period for a new class of “Emerging
Growth Companies.” During this period, qualifying companies will have
time to reach compliance with certain public company disclosure and
auditing requirements after their initial public offering (IPO). Any firm
that goes public already has up to two years after its IPO to comply with
certain Sarbanes-Oxley auditing requirements. The JOBS Act extended
that period to a maximum of five years, or less if during the on-ramp
period a company achieves $1 billion in gross revenue, $700 million in
public float, or issues more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in the
previous three years.
Additionally, the  JOBS Act  changed some existing limitations on
how companies can solicit private investments from “accredited inves-

Strengthening the Financial System | 415

tors,” tasked the SEC with ensuring that companies take reasonable
steps to verify that such investors are accredited, and gave companies
more flexibility to plan their access to public markets and incentivize
employees.
Taken together, the components of the JOBS Act has the potential
to enable entrepreneurs and small businesses to raise capital not previously available to them, increasing overall levels of capital formation in
the economy.

Americans’ net wealth. Measures of volatility or financial market stress are
all largely contained as well. Finally, there is evidence – from firm loans to
home mortgages – that capital is being channeled towards productive uses.
Implementation of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act (see
Box 6-6) has made it easier for entrepreneurs and small businesses to raise
capital and grow. Performance in financial markets is driven by economic
fundamentals as well as factors related to the markets themselves. The fact
that markets have been up does not mean that the Dodd-Frank Act has
been a success any more than would declining markets represent a failure
of financial reform. But the recovery of markets and their ability to serve
the core roles they play in the economy is an indicator of the success of the
financial rescue and reform efforts in this Administration.

General Measures of Financial Sector Health
The stock market has more than recovered from the losses suffered
during the financial crisis. One broad measure of U.S. stock market performance, the S&P 500 index, fell from a peak of over 1,500 in Fall 2007 to a
trough below 700 in March 2009, a decline of more than 50 percent. Since
then the market has recovered all of that loss and risen above 2,150 in Fall
2016 (Figure 6-23).
Forward-looking measures of equity market volatility are relatively
low. Derived from options on the S&P 500 index, the VIX is a measure of
expected volatility over the life of the option. The VIX, also referred to as the
“fear index”, is well below the crisis peak of over 60 percent (Figure 6-24). As
of November 2016, the VIX was at 15.2 percent, which is below its 17-year
pre-crisis average of almost 19 percent.
Measures of bond market health have also recovered from the financial crisis. The bond market analogue of the VIX, the Merrill Lynch Option
Volatility Estimate (MOVE) Index, is a yield curve weighted index of the
implied volatility on 1-month Treasury.  The MOVE has fallen from its

peak above 200 in the fall of 2008 to below 80 in Fall 2016, a level below the
17-year pre-crisis average of approximately 100 (Figure 6-25).
Measures of housing-market health, the sector in which the financial
crisis began, have also improved. The Case-Shiller national index of house
prices has regained almost all of the ground it lost during the crisis (Figure
6-4).
Mortgage lending has stabilized. The four-quarter moving average of
mortgage originations for new home purchases fell from a pre-crisis peak
of $381 billion in 2006:Q1 to a trough of $117 billion in 2011:Q2 (Figure
6-26). Since then, mortgage originations have risen steadily to $245 billion
in 2016:Q3.
For existing loans, the fraction of mortgages with payments more than
90 days past due or in foreclosure continues to fall from the peak during the
crisis. Mortgage payments more than 90 days past due have fallen steadily
from a peak of 5.0 percent in 2010:Q1 to 1.4 percent in 2016:Q3. The fraction of mortgages in foreclosure has also fallen steadily from a peak of 4.6
percent in 2010:Q4 to 1.6 percent in 2016:Q3 (Figure 6-27). Both measures
of troubled mortgages, suggest substantial progress since the crisis.
One of the most important functions of capital markets is to facilitate
the formation of capital for business. Businesses have raised record amounts
in the capital markets as corporate bond issuance has risen above pre-crisis
levels (Figure 6-28).

Conclusion
The financial crisis revealed a number of fault lines in the U.S.
financial system. Banks were inadequately capitalized, did not have enough
liquidity, and took too many risks. Non-bank financial firms faced many of
the same risks as banks, but lacked the same regulatory supervision or protection against runs. In addition, gaps in the regulatory architecture meant
that financial regulators lacked a holistic view of the risks in the system.
The Administration has taken numerous steps to make the financial
system safer, most of all through the Dodd-Frank Act, which has helped
correct a number of market failures that arose in financial markets during
the crisis. It helps generate safety and soundness of financial markets by
requiring that banks hold more capital, have adequate liquidity, and do not
take excessive risk because they have access to government deposit insurance or access to emergency liquidity provision from the Federal Reserve.
Dodd-Frank takes steps to limit systemic risk by bringing unregulated parts
of the financial system that were effectively performing banking functions
without the necessary backstops or regulation under a regulatory umbrella.

420  |  Chapter 6

It created the FSOC to consider risks to the overall financial system and
better coordinate regulatory action. And it took steps to limit the problem
of financial institutions that are too-big-to-fail by imposing additional regulatory requirements on such institutions and creating an architecture that
would allow these systemically significant institutions to be unwound if they
were to fail. Finally, Dodd-Frank improved the transparency, accountability,
and consumer protections in our financial system. These measures will help
consumers and investors engage with the financial system in a way that is
beneficial to them.
Although implementation of Basel III and Dodd-Frank go a long
way toward reforming the financial system, there are important issues that
remain unresolved. These include reform of government sponsored enterprises Fannie (Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie (Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) in a manner that ensures they do not
return to a status as private entities that operate for profit but with implicit
public guarantees, and ensuring that a sufficient resolution framework exists
for systemically important insurance companies and systemically important
financial companies with worldwide operations. And as the financial system
evolves over time, the regulatory architecture will need to evolve as well to
ensure that a financial crisis like the one from 2007 to 2009 does not wreak
havoc on the economy in the future.

ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE
Introduction

A

ddressing climate change and transitioning to a clean energy system
is one of the greatest and most urgent challenges of our time. If left
unchecked, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions threaten future national and
global welfare and economic output. The impacts of climate change are real
and being felt today. Fifteen of the sixteen warmest years on record globally
have occurred between 2000 and 2015, and 2015 was the warmest year on
record. Although it is difficult to link specific weather events to climate
change, some extreme weather events have become more frequent and
intense, consistent with climate model predictions. The number of weather
events that have led to damages in excess of $1 billion has been increasing
in recent years due to both climate change and economic development in
vulnerable areas.
Without proactive steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
slow the climate warming already being observed, future generations will
be left with—at a minimum—the costly burden of facing the impacts of a
changed climate on our planet, and potentially with catastrophic climate
impacts. From an economic perspective, the causes of global climate change
involve a classic negative environmental externality. The prices of goods and
services in our economy do not reflect their full costs because they do not
incorporate the costs of the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions associated
with their production and consumption. Policies that internalize these costs
will improve social welfare while reducing the odds of catastrophic climate
events. In addition to the costs incurred to date, delaying policy action
can increase both future climate change damages and the cost of future
mitigation.
Addressing the environmental externalities from climate change
involves changing the long-run trajectory of our economy toward a more

423

energy efficient and lower greenhouse gas-emitting path. Since President
Obama took office, substantial strides have been made toward achieving
this goal. Between 2008 and 2015, the U.S. energy system has shifted considerably toward cleaner energy resources. Energy intensity, which refers to
energy consumed per dollar of real gross domestic product (GDP), declined
by 11 percent from 2008 to 2015, following a pattern of steady decline over
the past four decades. Carbon intensity, the amount of carbon dioxide
emitted per unit of energy consumed, has declined by 8 percent from 2008
to 2015, and carbon dioxide emitted per dollar of GDP has declined by 18
percent over this period. In fact, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from the
energy sector fell by 9.5 percent from 2008 to 2015, and in the first 6 months
of 2016 they were at the lowest level in 25 years. These trends, in combination, are favorable for climate change mitigation, and all have occurred while
the economy recovered from the Great Recession. The economy has grown
by more than 10 percent since 2008, and by more than 13 percent from its
recession low point in 2009.
Since mitigating climate change serves a public good benefiting all
countries, it also involves working with other countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. In addition to mitigation, addressing
climate change involves building resilience to current and future impacts,
developing adaptation plans and preparing for the changing frequency and
severity of extreme events. Steps taken by the United States, along with
extensive outreach to other countries, subsequently helped pave the way
for the 2015 Paris Agreement in which more than 190 countries committed to take concrete steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris
Agreement establishes a long-term, durable global framework with the aim
of keeping climate warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius.
Given that the impacts of climate change are already being felt today
and, that even with aggressive mitigation, impacts will continue into the
future, the optimal response to climate change includes not only mitigation,
but also adaptation. Building resilience to the current and future impacts of
climate change is akin to insuring against the uncertain future damages from
climate change. In parallel with domestic mitigation and global cooperation,
Administration policies have also promoted resilience.
This chapter reviews the economic rationale for the Administration’s
efforts on climate change and the transformation of the energy system. It
provides an overview of a selection of the most important policy efforts
and then examines the key economic trends related to climate change and
energy, many of which have already been influenced, and will be increasingly
influenced going forward by policy measures under the Administration’s
2013 Climate Action Plan. These trends include increases in electricity
424  |  Chapter 7

generation from natural gas and renewable energy resources, improvements
in energy efficiency, and shifts in transportation energy use. The chapter also
analyzes the sources of these trends, by decomposing emissions reductions
in the power sector as attributable to lower-carbon fossil-fuel resources and
renewable energy generation, as well as by decomposing emissions reductions in the entire economy as attributable to lower energy intensity, lower
carbon intensity, and a lower than expected level of GDP due to economic
shocks, primarily the Great Recession. Understanding the driving forces
behind these trends allows for an assessment of how the multitude of policy
mechanisms utilized in this Administration have helped the United States
pursue a more economically efficient path that addresses environmental and
other important externalities.
Consistent with long-standing policy, the Administration has worked
to ensure that regulations that affect carbon emissions and other climaterelated policies are undertaken in an efficient and cost effective manner.
Rigorous regulatory impact analyses demonstrate that economically efficient
mechanisms were used to achieve climate goals. Policies put in place since
2008 will generate substantial net benefits. The first-ever carbon pollution
standards for power plants would reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly and, depending on the methods states use to comply, could generate
net benefits of $15 billion to $27 billion just in 2025. Greenhouse gas standards for light-duty cars and trucks are also estimated to have sizable net
benefits. The first-ever national greenhouse gas and fuel economy standards
for commercial trucks, buses, and vans should generate hundreds of billions
of dollars in net benefits over the life of the vehicles affected by the rule.
Other policies will either make energy cleaner or reduce energy use.
The Administration extended tax credits for wind and solar projects, first
in the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the Recovery Act)
and again in 2015. The Recovery Act included substantial funding for both
energy efficiency and renewables development (CEA 2016c). In addition,
stronger energy efficiency standards for residential and commercial appliances, and many others, are projected to generate substantial net economic
benefits to the U.S. economy.
The long time horizons for these policies, reinforced by the
Administration’s substantial investments in research and development for
clean energy technologies, will continue to spur innovation and ensure that
recent energy-sector shifts will have a durable impact on the economy and
the climate.
The Administration’s climate policies go well beyond what is discussed in this chapter. Rather than provide a comprehensive review of
implemented and planned policies, this chapter focuses on the economics
Addressing Climate Change | 425

of domestic actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to
cleaner sources of energy. Additional Federal policies and programs are
assessed in other Administration documents.1 The chapter also draws on
analyses from energy and climate chapters in prior Economic Reports of the
President (CEA 2013, 2015a).

The Economic Rationale for Climate Action
Climate change is not just a future problem—the costly impacts of
changing weather patterns and a warming planet are being felt now (U.S.
Global Change Research Program 2014). Fifteen of the sixteen warmest
years on record globally have occurred between 2000 and 2015, and the
2015 average temperature was the highest on record (NOAA 2016a). Each
of the first 8 months in 2016 set a record as the warmest respective month
globally in the modern temperature record, dating to 1880; in fact, August
2016 marked the 16th consecutive month that the monthly global temperature record was broken, the longest such streak in 137 years of recordkeeping (NOAA 2016b). Not only are temperatures rising on average, but heat
waves—which have detrimental human health impacts—have also been on
the rise in Europe, Australia, and across much of Asia since 1960 (IPCC
2013). Among extreme weather events, heat waves are a phenomenon for
which the scientific link with climate change is fairly robust. For example,
studies suggest that climate change doubled the likelihood of heat waves like
the one that occurred in Europe in 2003, which is estimated to have killed
between 25,000 and 70,000 people, and that deadly heat in Europe is 10
times more likely today than it was in 2003 (Christidis et al. 2015; Stott 2004;
Robine et al. 2008; D’Ippoliti et al. 2010).
Wildfires and certain types of extreme weather events such as heavy
rainfall, floods, and droughts with links to climate change have also become
more frequent and/or intense in recent years (Department of State 2016b;
U.S. Global Change Research Program 2014). As illustrated in Figure 7-1,
the annual number of U.S. weather events that cause damages exceeding $1
billion has risen dramatically since 1980, due both to climate change and to
increasing economic development in vulnerable areas (NOAA 2016c).2 An
intense drought that has plagued the West Coast of the United States since
2013 led to California’s first-ever statewide mandatory urban water restrictions (California Executive Department 2014).

Act, see CEA (2016c). For additional reviews of the Administration’s climate policies, see DOE
(2015), EPA (2015a), and Department of State (2016b).
2 Regional economic development can increase the magnitude of damages from weatherrelated events because economic growth increases the assets (and population) at risk.

As atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide have increased, the amount of
carbon dioxide dissolved in the ocean has risen all over the world, increasing
ocean acidification and threatening marine life. Further, over the past 100
years, the average global sea level has risen by more than 8 inches, leading
to greater risk of erosion, flooding, and destructive storm surges in coastal
areas (U.S. Global Change Research Program 2014).
Growing research also links climate change with diminished health
and labor productivity in the United States, due to both temperature and
pollution increases (EPA 2015a; Crimmins 2016). For example, recent
research finds that when daily maximum temperatures exceed 85 degrees
Fahrenheit, U.S. labor supply is reduced by as much as one hour a day (relative to the 76- to 80-degree range) for outdoor industries such as construction and farming (Graff Zivin and Neidell 2014). Studies also suggest strong
links between warming and mortality—an additional day of extreme heat
(above 90 degrees Fahrenheit) can lead to an increase in annual age-adjusted
U.S. mortality rates of around 0.11 percent relative to a day in the 50- to
60-degree range (Deschênes and Greenstone 2011).3 Warmer temperatures
can also lead to higher urban levels of ozone, an air pollutant that affects
3This study and the others cited here analyze inter-annual weather variation to estimate climate
impacts. As such, they may overstate climate impacts, because less-costly adaptation activities
may be available over longer time horizons in response to permanent climate changes than are
available in response to short-term weather shocks.

people and vegetation (U.S. Global Change Research Program 2014). For
example, in the California agricultural sector, a decrease in ozone concentration by 10 parts per billion can lead to a more than 5-percent increase in
worker productivity (Graff Zivin and Neidell 2012). These studies represent
just a small selection of the growing body of evidence on the economic costs
of climate change.
Based on the current trajectory and the results of climate science
research, the economic costs from warmer temperatures and changing
weather patterns are expected to grow in the coming years. Increased
temperatures due to climate change could lead to a 3-percent increase in
age-adjusted mortality rates and an 11-percent increase in annual residential energy consumption (as demand for air conditioning increases) in the
United States by the end of the century (Deschênes and Greenstone 2011).
Average U.S. corn, soybean, and cotton yields may decrease by 30 to 46
percent by 2100, assuming no change in the location and extent of growing
areas, and assuming that climate warming is relatively slow (Schlenker and
Roberts 2009).4 Extreme heat is also expected to affect labor productivity
and health: by 2050, the average American will likely see the number of
95-degree Fahrenheit days more than double relative to the last 30 years,
and labor productivity for outdoor workers may fall by as much as 3 percent
by the end of the century (Risky Business Project 2014). Within the next 15
years, assuming no additional adaptation, higher sea levels and storm surges
will increase the estimated damage costs from coastal storms by $2 billion
to $3.5 billion annually in the United States, and these costs are projected
to increase to $42 billion annually by the end of the century (Risky Business
Project 2014). Based on emissions trajectories in 2014, by 2050 existing U.S.
coastal property worth between $66 billion and $106 billion could be at risk
of being inundated, with the Eastern and Gulf coasts particularly affected
(again, assuming no additional adaptation) (Risky Business Project 2014).
The impacts of climate change will also affect the U.S. Federal Budget.
For example, an increase in the frequency of catastrophic storms, along
with rising seas, will require more disaster relief spending, flood insurance
payments, and investments to protect, repair, and relocate Federal facilities.
Changing weather patterns and extreme weather events will affect American
farmers and thus expenditures on Federal crop insurance and disaster
payments. Health impacts of climate change will increase Federal health
care expenditures. An increase in wild-land fire frequency and intensity
4 Like the studies on human health, economic estimates of the agricultural impacts of climate
change are based on inter-annual weather variation and may overstate climate impacts, if less
costly adaptation activities are available over long time horizons in response to permanent
climate change.

428  |  Chapter 7

will strain Federal fire suppression resources. In addition to these likely
increases in expenditures, climate change is expected to reduce economic
output and diminish Federal revenue. A recent report by the U.S. Office of
Management and Budget projects that the combined detrimental impacts of
climate change on Federal revenues and expenditures by 2100 could easily
exceed $100 billion annually, when the estimates are expressed in terms of
their equivalent percentage of current U.S. GDP (OMB 2016).

Addressing Externalities
The impacts of climate change present a clear economic rationale for
policy as a means to both correct market failures and as a form of insurance
against the increased risk of catastrophic events. Climate change reflects
a classic environmental externality. When consumers or producers emit
greenhouse gases, they enjoy the benefits from the services provided by
the use of the fuels, while not paying the full costs of the damages from
climate change. Since the price of goods and services that emit greenhouse
gases during production does not reflect the economic damages associated
with those gases, market forces result in a level of emissions that is too
high from society’s perspective. Such a market failure can be addressed by
policy. The most efficient policy would respond to this market failure by
putting an economy-wide price on the right to emit greenhouse gases. In
the absence of a uniform carbon price to regulate emissions, however, other
climate policy mechanisms can improve social welfare by pricing emissions
indirectly. For example, putting in place emission limits and incentivizing
low-carbon alternatives can make carbon-intensive technology relatively
more expensive, shifting demand toward less carbon-intensive products,
and thus reducing emissions. Energy efficiency standards can reduce energy
use, implicitly addressing the external costs of emissions and resulting overconsumption of energy. Gasoline or oil taxes help to directly address the
external costs due to emissions from the combustion of oil.

Correcting Other Market Failures
Some policies to address the climate change externality have an additional economic benefit from addressing other market failures. For example,
reducing carbon dioxide emissions through lower carbon electricity generation often also reduces the emissions of local and regional air pollutants that
cause damage to human health, a second environmental externality.
There are also innovation market failures where some of the returns
from investment in innovation and new product development spill over
to other firms from the firm engaged in innovation. For example, there is
substantial evidence that the social returns from research and development
Addressing Climate Change | 429

investment are much higher than the private returns due to some of the
knowledge spilling over to other firms.5 Though in principle these positive
spillovers can be good for society, they prevent the innovating firms from
capturing the full returns to their investments in technological innovation,
resulting in less than the efficient level of investment. While not specific to
the energy area, the failure to internalize the positive spillovers to research
into technologies that would reduce carbon emissions is compounded by the
failure to take into account the external cost of carbon emissions.
Other market failures that may be partly addressed by climateoriented policies include information market failures due to inadequate
or poor information about new clean energy or energy-efficient consumer
technologies, and network effects (such as, a situation where the value of a
product is greater when there is a larger network of users of that product)
that consumers do not consider in their decisions on the purchase of new
clean energy technologies. While not market failures, per se, vulnerability
to supply disruptions and the potential macroeconomic effects of oil price
shocks provide additional reasons to invest in clean transportation technologies. These factors, taken together, can lead to an underinvestment in
research, as well as underinvestment in energy efficiency and deployment of
clean energy, and can provide additional economic motivations for policy.
For example, energy efficiency standards may help address information
market failures that hamper consumers’ ability to understand the energy
costs of different product choices, and policies promoting clean transportation infrastructure may reduce vulnerability to oil supply disruptions.

Insurance against Catastrophe
Despite a large body of research on how human activities are changing the climate, substantial uncertainty remains around the amount and
location of damages that climate change will cause. This is because there are
cascading uncertainties from the interplay of key physical parameters (such
as the exact magnitude of the global temperature response to the atmospheric buildup in greenhouse gases), the local and regional manifestations
of global climate change, the vulnerabilities of different economic sectors,
and the adaptation measures that could decrease impacts. For example,
climate scientists have developed probability distributions of the sensitivity
of the climate to increases in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere, and there is some small, but non-zero probability of very high

5 See Jaffe and Stavins (1994) or Gillingham and Sweeney (2012) for more on innovation
market failures in the context of clean energy.

430  |  Chapter 7

climate sensitivity.6 With the possibility of significant climate sensitivity,
coupled with the possibility of high future greenhouse gas emissions, the risk
of irreversible, large-scale changes that have wide-ranging and potentially
catastrophic consequences greatly increases. The term “tipping point” is
commonly used to refer to a “critical threshold at which a tiny perturbation
can qualitatively alter the state of development of a system” (Lenton et al.
2008). When it comes to climate, at a tipping point, a marginal increase in
emissions could make a non-marginal—and potentially irreversible—impact
on damages. Hypothetical climate tipping points could lead to catastrophic
events like the disappearance of Greenland ice sheets and associated sea level
rise, or the destabilization of Indian summer monsoon circulation.
It is impossible to know precisely how likely or how costly these lowprobability, high-impact events, or “tail risks” are, but we do know that the
associated costs and impacts on human society would be very substantial
and that their likelihood increases with higher atmospheric concentrations
of greenhouse gases. Economists have been increasingly interested in understanding how these tail risks should be incorporated into policy choices. A
series of papers by Martin Weitzman lay out an analytical framework for
understanding policy under conditions with catastrophic fat tail risks (such
as the risk of a catastrophe that has more probability weight than it would in
a normal distribution).7 Weitzman’s analysis points out that, under certain
conditions, the expected costs of climate change become infinitely large.8
While there has been an active debate in the literature on the conditions
under which Weitzman’s findings may apply, his work both underscores
the importance of understanding tail risks, and provides an economic
rationale for taking early action to avoid future, potentially very large risks.9
Just as individuals and businesses routinely purchase insurance to guard
against risks in everyday life, like fire, theft, or a car accident, and just as
conservative safety standards guard against catastrophic failures at major
infrastructure like nuclear plants and highway bridges, climate policy can be
seen as protection against the economic risks—small and large—associated
with climate change.
6 According to the IPCC, equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C
(high confidence), extremely unlikely less than 1°C (high confidence), and very unlikely greater
than 6°C (medium confidence) (IPCC 2013).
7 For example, a Student’s t-distribution is a fat-tailed distribution.
8 Weitzman’s “Dismal Theorem” is presented and discussed in several papers: Weitzman
(2009), Weitzman (2011), and Weitzman (2014). Further analyses of the “theorem” include
Newbold and Daigneault (2009), Nordhaus (2009), and Millner (2013).
9 In fact, Weitzman’s conditions are not necessary for there to be an economic motivation:
there is a broader economic motivation for a precautionary policy with a sufficiently risk averse
or loss averse decision-maker.

Delaying Action on Climate Change Increases Costs
When considering climate change policy from an economic perspective, it is critical to consider not just the cost of action but also the cost of
inaction. Delaying climate policies may avoid or reduce expenditures in the
near term, but delaying would likely increase costs substantially in the longer
run. The economic literature discusses two primary mechanisms underlying
the substantial increase in costs from delayed action.
First, if delay leads to an increase in the ultimate steady-state concentration of greenhouse gases, then there will be additional warming and
subsequent economic damages in the long run. Using the results of a leading climate model, CEA (2014) estimates that if a delay causes the mean
global temperature to stabilize at 3 degrees Celsius above preindustrial
levels instead of 2 degrees, that delay will induce annual additional damages
of approximately 0.9 percent of global output. (To put that percentage in
perspective, 0.9 percent of output in the United States in 2015 alone was over
$160 billion.) The next degree increase, from 3 degrees to 4 degrees, would
incur even greater additional costs of approximately 1.2 percent of global
output. It is critical to note that these costs would be incurred year after year.
Second, if the delayed policy aims to achieve the same carbon target
as a non-delayed policy, then the delayed policy will require more stringent
actions given the shorter timeframe. More stringent actions will generally
be more costly, though technological innovation can make future mitigation
cheaper than it is today, lowering the future cost of low-carbon technologies needed to meet the target. In addition, since investment in innovation
responds to policy, taking meaningful steps now sends a long-term signal to
markets that the development of low-carbon technologies will be rewarded.
At the same time, this signal creates a disincentive for investing in new
high-carbon infrastructure that would be expensive to replace later on. CEA
(2014) estimates the costs of delaying the achievement of a specific target—
by these calculations, if the world tries to hit the goal stated in Paris of less
than a 2-degree increase in the global mean surface temperature relative to
pre-industrial levels, but waits a decade to do so, the cost of limiting the
temperature change would increase by roughly 40 percent relative to meeting the goal without the decade delay.10

Administration Climate Policies
Since President Obama took office in 2009, the Administration has
undertaken numerous steps toward both mitigating climate change and
10 These estimates, as further described in CEA (2014), are developed from a meta-analysis of
research on the cost of delay for hitting a specific climate target.

responding to its effects. Greenhouse gas emissions in the United States
amounted to 6,870 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2014
(the most recent inventory), and these emissions are spread over several
sectors, as shown in the left chart of Figure 7-2.11 In 2014, carbon dioxide
emissions made up 82 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions; methane,
10 percent; nitrous oxides, 5 percent; and fluorinated gases, 3 percent (right
chart of Figure 7-2) (EPA 2016a). The electricity sector in 2014 generated the
largest share of emissions—nearly a third—which together with the fact that
some of the least-expensive marginal emissions reductions opportunities are
in the power sector (Kaufman, Obeiter and Krause 2016) motivate the Clean
Power Plan and clean energy investments (discussed below). Transportation
follows with 26 percent of emissions, motivating a variety of efficiency and
innovation policies in the transportation sector.12
The Administration’s steps to address greenhouse gases cover nearly
all sectors and gases. These steps help reduce emissions both now and in the
longer term by promoting low-carbon electricity generation, dramatically
improving energy efficiency for many products, facilitating the transition
to a cleaner transportation system, reducing emissions of high-potency
greenhouse gases, and bolstering our land-sector sink (the capacity of land

reduction targets are based on GHG emissions, net of carbon sinks.

programs focused on adapting to a changing climate. This section highlights
just a few of the Administration’s many climate and energy initiatives. The
next section discusses outcomes.

Supporting Growth of Renewable Energy
President Obama has made substantial investments in renewable
energy supported by Federal policies that promote research, development,
and deployment of renewable energy. These policies help address the
underinvestment in renewable energy due to environmental externalities
as well as the underinvestment in R&D due to knowledge spillovers. The
Administration signaled its strong support for clean energy from the beginning by making a historic $90 billion investment in clean energy in the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The macroeconomic demand
shock of the Great Recession required a bold policy response that included
stimulus spending along with tax cuts and aid to affected individuals and
communities. The Administration’s decision to focus an important part of
that spending (about an eighth of the total) on clean energy was a vital step
in pushing the economy toward a cleaner energy future, and a foundational
step for supporting continued progress throughout the President’s eight
years in office.
The Recovery Act extended and expanded the Production Tax
Credit (PTC) and the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), critical policies directly
focused on renewable energy. These policies provide subsidies for renewable
energy production and installation to help address the unpriced externalities that place renewable energy at a disadvantage. In December 2015, the
Administration secured a five-year extension of the PTC and ITC, signaling to developers that renewable energy continues to be an area worthy of
greater investment (Bailey 2015).
The Recovery Act also created two new programs to support renewable energy generation: a set of loan guarantees for renewable energy project
financing (the 1705 Loan Guarantee Program) and cash grants for renewable energy projects (the 1603 Cash Grant Program). The 1705 program
supported construction of the first five solar PV projects over 100 MW in
the United States. The 1603 program provided $25 billion to support total
installed renewable energy capacity of 33.3 GW (CEA 2016c). The Act also
included funding for energy efficiency projects, clean transportation, grid

modernization, advanced vehicles and fuels, carbon capture and storage,
and clean energy manufacturing.13
Since its actions to mitigate the Great Recession, the Administration
has undertaken a set of efforts to help ensure that renewable energy is
accessible to all Americans and underserved communities, in particular.
Launched in July 2015, the National Community Solar Partnership, part of
the Administration’s SunShot initiative, is fostering innovation in financing
and business models and spreading best practices to facilitate adoption of
solar systems in low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities.14 The U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development is facilitating Property
Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing to make it easier and more affordable for households to finance investments in solar energy and energy efficiency. The Administration has set a goal to bring 1 gigawatt (GW) of solar
to low- and moderate-income families by 2020, and the U.S. Department
of Agriculture has awarded almost $800 million to guarantee loan financing and grant funding to agricultural producers and rural small businesses
(USDA 2016). USDA programs focusing on renewable energy have resulted
in support for the construction of six advanced biofuel production facilities,
more than 4,000 wind and solar renewable electricity generation facilities,
and more than 100 anaerobic digesters to help farm operations capture
methane to product electricity (Vilsack 2016). The Administration has also
set a goal for the U.S. Department of the Interior to approve 20,000 MW
of renewable energy capacity on public lands by 2020, and has set ambitious annual goals for the U.S. General Services Administration to purchase
minimum percentages of its electricity from renewable sources, reaching 100
percent in 2025; both of these update and expand on earlier such goals in
the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EOP 2013, EOP 2015). The Administration
has also expanded opportunities to join the solar workforce with programs
like the Solar Instructor Training Network, AmeriCorps funding, and Solar
Ready Vets to help reach the goal of training 75,000 workers to enter the
solar industry by 2020.

13 See CEA (2016c) for more on the impacts of these policies and more detail on clean energy
support provided by ARRA. Some funded programs were extended or had greater take-up than
anticipated, so the total allocation of ARRA-related clean energy programs will be more than
$90 billion; CEA calculations indicate that just under $90 billion of ARRA clean energy-related
dollars had been spent by the end of 2015.
14 The SunShot initiative in the U.S. Department of Energy, launched in 2011, has the goal of
making solar electricity cost competitive with conventional forms of electricity generation by
2020.

Carbon Pollution Standards for Power Plants
In August 2015, the President and the EPA announced the finalization of the Clean Power Plan (CPP)—the first-ever national carbon pollution standards for existing power plants. This historic action by the United
States to address environmental externalities from carbon dioxide emissions
focuses on the power sector, the source of just under a third of all greenhouse gas emissions and the largest source of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions
in 2014 (EPA 2015c).
Consistent with the framework set out in the Clean Air Act, the CPP
sets emission performance rates for fossil fuel-fired power plants based on
the best system of emission reduction the EPA found was available, considering cost, energy impacts, and health and environmental impacts. The CPP
translates those rates into state-specific goals and provides states with broad
flexibility to reach the goals. For example, a state can choose a mass-based
standard, which limits the total number of tons of carbon dioxide from
regulated plants and can be achieved with a cap-and-trade system or another
policy approach of the state’s choice. As an alternative, the state can comply
with a rate-based standard, whereby the state requires regulated sources
to meet a specified emissions rate (the amount of emissions generated per
unit of electricity produced) through a number of policy approaches. This
flexibility allows states to choose cost-effective approaches to reducing emissions that are tailored to meet the state’s own policy priorities.15 Further,
for greater economic efficiency gains, the CPP permits emissions trading
across states; affected electric generation units (EGUs) can trade emissions
credits with EGUs in other states with compatible implementation plans
(EPA 2015c).
When the CPP is fully in place,16 CO2 emissions from the electric
power sector are projected to be 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030,
resulting in 870 million tons less carbon pollution in 2030, equivalent to
the annual emissions of 166 million cars (EPA 2015b, 2015c). Not only will
the CPP help mitigate climate change, but it will also protect the health of
American families by reducing asthma attacks in children and preventing
premature deaths and non-fatal heart attacks by reducing emissions of other
harmful air pollutants, and will help to provide an incentive for further
15 From an economic perspective, the mass-based approach may be preferable because it does
not create incentives to expand electricity production to facilitate compliance and does not
require verification of demand reductions due to energy efficiency policies and investments
(Fowlie et al. 2014).
16 Implementation of the CPP has been stayed by the Supreme Court. The Administration is
confident that it will be upheld in court as it is consistent with Supreme Court decisions, EPA’s
statutory authority, and air pollution standards that EPA has put in place to address other air
pollution problems.

innovation to lower the costs of low-carbon energy (EPA 2015b). Given
the combined effects of changes in average retail electricity rates and lower
electricity demand, EPA projects that average electricity bills will decline
by 3-4 percent in 2025, and by 7-8 percent in 2030, due to the CPP (EPA
2015c). Figure 7-3 shows the projected emissions reductions under the CPP.
The base case bars refer to a world with all other current policies, while the
rate-based and mass-based bars indicate what carbon dioxide emissions
from the power sector are projected to be under the CPP if all states opt for

it would generate substantial net benefits to the U.S. economy. Given the
flexibility afforded states in compliance with the CPP’s emissions guidelines,
estimates of benefits and costs are not definitive—both benefits and costs
will depend on the compliance approaches states actually choose. Using
Federal estimates of the social cost of carbon dioxide (SC-CO2), discussed
further below, along with estimates of the co-benefits from the CPP’s reductions in health damages from fine particulate matter and ozone, the CPP’s
regulatory impact analysis projects net benefits to the U.S. economy in 2020
of $1.0 billion to $6.7 billion, depending on the compliance approaches
states choose. Net benefit estimates increase significantly in later years, with

billion in 2030 (EPA 2015c).17

Improving Energy Efficiency and Conservation
Improved energy efficiency reduces emissions and, by correcting
environmental externalities or information market failures, can also improve
economic efficiency. Administration initiatives have already succeeded
in improving energy efficiency in millions of homes around the country,
reducing energy costs, and cutting energy use by the Federal Government,
with greater improvements expected in future years. Technological shifts
have aided greatly in efficiency improvements. For example, LED lighting
has seen a nearly 90 percent decrease in cost per kilolumen since 2008. The
costs of lithium-ion battery packs for electric vehicles have fallen from above
$1,000/kWh in 2007 to under $410/kWh in 2014, with estimates for leading
manufacturers coming in as low as $300/kWh (Nykvist and Nilsoon 2015;
DOE 2015).
In the President’s first term, the departments of Energy and Housing
and Urban Development completed energy efficiency upgrades in over 1
million homes, saving families on average more than $400 each on their
heating and cooling bills in the first year alone (EOP 2016). The President
also launched the Better Buildings Challenge in 2011, a broad, multi-strategy
initiative to improve energy use in commercial, industrial, residential, and
public buildings by 20 percent by 2020 (DOE 2016b). More than 310 organizations have committed to the Better Buildings Challenge, and the partners
have saved over 160 trillion Btus of energy from 2011 to 2015, leading to $1.3
billion in reduced energy costs (DOE 2016d).
Since 2009, the Department of Energy’s Building Technologies
Office has issued 42 new or updated energy efficiency standards for home
appliances, which are projected to save consumers more than $540 billion
on their utility bills through 2030, and to cut carbon dioxide emissions by
2.3 billion metric tons (DOE 2016a). The products covered by standards
represent about 90 percent of home energy use, 60 percent of commercial
17 The regulatory impact analysis for the CPP reports estimates in constant 2011 dollars. In
2015 dollars, the net benefits to the U.S. economy would be $1.1 to $7.1 billion in 2020, $17 to
$27 billion in 2025, and $26 to $47 billion in 2030. The CPP applies to existing power plants.
In October 2015, the EPA issued final carbon pollution standards for newly constructed,
modified, or reconstructed fossil-fuel-fired power plants. Due to projected market conditions
(particularly the expectation of continued low natural gas prices, which make it likely that any
new plants would comply with the rule’s requirements even if it were not in place), analyses
performed by the EPA and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) indicate that the
new source standards will have negligible impacts on emissions, as well as negligible economic
benefits and costs. Should gas prices rise significantly, the rule is projected to generate
significant net benefits (EPA 2015d).

Box 7-1: Quantifying the Benefits of Avoided Carbon Emissions
Benefit-cost analysis is the well-known approach to determining
whether any given policy will provide net benefits to society. Benefit-cost
analysis of a policy that yields reductions of greenhouse gas emissions
requires an estimate of the benefits of those reductions. The question
is non-trivial, as estimating the impact of marginal increases in emissions requires calculations over long time spans and distributions of
climate sensitivities and socioeconomic outcomes. To take on this task,
the Obama Administration established a Federal Interagency Working
Group (IWG) in 2009 to develop estimates of the value of damages per
ton of carbon dioxide emissions (or, conversely, the benefits per ton
of emissions reductions). The resulting social cost of carbon dioxide
(SC-CO2) estimates, developed in 2009-10, provide consistent values
based on the best available climate science and economic modeling, so
that agencies across the Federal Government could estimate the global
benefits of emissions reductions. Before these estimates were available,
impacts of rules on greenhouse gas emissions had been considered qualitatively, or had been monetized using values that varied across agencies
and rules. Creating a single SC-CO2 was an important step in ensuring
that regulatory impact analysis of Federal actions reflects the best available estimates of the benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
The IWG updated the original 2010 SC-CO2 estimates in May
2013 to incorporate refinements that researchers had made to the
underlying peer-reviewed models. Since then, minor technical revisions
have been issued twice—in November 2013 and in July 2015. Both of

these resulted in insignificant changes to the overall estimates released
in May 2013. The IWG also sought independent expert advice from the
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) to
inform future updates of the SC-CO2 estimates. In August 2016, the
IWG updated its technical support document to incorporate January
2016 feedback from the NAS by enhancing the presentation and discussion of quantified uncertainty around the current SC-CO2 estimates.
The NAS Committee recommended against a near-term update of the
estimates. Also in August 2016, the IWG issued new estimates of the
social costs of two additional GHGs, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide
(N2O), applying the same methodology as that used to estimate the
SC-CO2 (IWG 2016a).
To estimate the SC-CO2, SC-CH4, and SC-N2O, three integrated
assessment models (IAMs) are employed. IAMs couple models of
atmospheric gas cycles and climate systems with aggregate models of the
global economy and human behavior to represent the impacts of GHG
emissions on the climate and human welfare. Within IAMs, the equations that represent the influence of emissions on the climate are based
on scientific assessments, while the equations that map climate impacts
to human welfare (“damage functions”) are based on economic research
evaluating the effects of climate on various market and non-market
sectors, including its effects on sea level rise, agricultural productivity,
human health, energy-system costs, and coastal resources. Estimating the
social cost of emissions for a given GHG at the margin involves perturbing the emissions of that gas in a given year and forecasting the increase
in monetized climate damages relative to the baseline. These incremental
damages are then discounted back to the perturbation year to represent
the marginal social cost of emissions of the specific GHG in that year.
The estimates of the cost of emissions released in a given year represent the present value of the additional damages that occur from those
emissions between the year in which they are emitted and the year 2300.
The choice of discount rate over such a long time horizon implicates
philosophical and ethical perspectives about tradeoffs in consumption
across generations, and debates about the appropriate discount rate in
climate change analysis persist (Goulder and Williams 2012; Arrow, et
al. 2013; Arrow, et al. 2014). Thus, the IWG presents the SC-CO2 under
three alternative discount rate scenarios, and, given the potential for
lower-probability, but higher-impact outcomes from climate change, a
fourth value is presented to represent the estimated marginal damages
associated with these “tail” outcomes (IWG 2015, IWG 2016b). All four
current estimates of the SC-CO2, from 2010 to 2050, are below.

building use, and 30 percent of industrial energy use, which taken cumulatively, represented around 40 percent of total primary energy use in 2015.18
By 2030, the cumulative operating cost savings from all standards in effect
since 1987 will reach nearly $2 trillion, with a cumulative reduction of about
7.3 billion tons of CO2 emissions (DOE 2016a).
Pricing the external costs from greenhouse gas emissions would
increase the likelihood of consumers adopting these options on their own,
but when the greenhouse gas-emitting energy is underpriced, then programs to help move consumers toward a more energy-efficient outcome
can improve economic efficiency. Each of these standards has been subject
to rigorous benefit-cost analysis, and each has economic benefits in excess
of costs. This demonstrates that such standards not only reduce GHG emissions, but do so in an economically efficient way. For example, new rules
for commercial air conditioning and heating equipment sold between 2018
and 2048 are projected to have net economic benefits of $42 billion to $79
billion (DOE 2016c).19

Addressing Transportation Sector Emissions
Since 2009, President Obama has implemented policies that reduce
emissions from the transportation sector—one of the largest sources of
U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (EPA 2016a). Again, these policies can help
internalize environmental externalities and address information market
failures. Through improvements to the fuel economy of gasoline- and
diesel-powered cars and trucks, and the technological progress that has been
made on hybrid and electric drivetrains, the transportation sector has made
substantial improvements to date, and the Administration has put policies
in place to increase the likelihood that these improvements will continue for
years to come. In addition, the Administration has continued to implement
rules on Renewable Fuel Standards in ways that reduce the carbon intensity
of our transportation sector.
Under this Administration, the EPA and the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration have issued GHG emission and fuel economy
standards for light-duty passenger vehicles and the first-ever GHG and fuel
economy standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks. The latest set of
standards for passenger vehicles will reduce new vehicle GHG emissions by
nearly a half and approximately double the average new vehicle fuel economy

(MER), Table 2.1.
19 The net benefits of these new rules are represented in 2014 dollars. In 2015 dollars, these
rules are expected to have slightly higher net benefits that round to the same figures ($42 to
$79 billion).

(NHTSA 2012). Combined, the Phase 1 and Phase 2 GHG and fuel economy
standards for light-duty vehicles are projected to reduce GHG emissions by
6 billion metric tons over the lifetime of vehicles sold from 2012 to 2025
(EPA 2012). Building on the first-ever GHG and fuel economy standards
for new medium- and heavy-duty vehicles built between 2014 and 2020,
issued in 2011, EPA and NHTSA finalized “Phase 2” standards in 2016 that
will further raise fuel economy for these vehicles through 2027. Combined,
the Phase 1 and Phase 2 heavy-duty vehicle standards are expected to reduce
GHG emissions by 2.5 billion metric tons over the lifetime of vehicles sold
from 2014 to 2029 (EPA and NHTSA 2016).
Achieving these goals will require a variety of innovations and investments by automobile firms that have been challenging thus far because
emissions carry no price, consumers often undervalue fuel efficiency, and
vehicle purchasers are not always the entities paying for the fuel.20 These
investments may unlock new technologies to further reduce transportation
emissions. For example, firms with innovative low-emissions technologies
may sell compliance credits or license technology to other firms, given
the flexibility provisions in the vehicle emissions standards, providing an

20 The lack of investment may be due to multiple market failures including from the unpriced
positive externalities from innovation (Bergek, Jacobsson, and Sandén 2008).

Box 7-2: Investing in Clean Energy Research and Development
Research and development in clean energy is essential to climate
change mitigation because improved technologies will reduce the cost of
producing and distributing clean energy. The research and development
(R&D) market failure from imperfect appropriability of innovations—in
which innovations spill over to other firms and the innovative firm
cannot fully capture the returns—is particularly important in early stage
R&D because the private return to basic innovation is relatively low and
the social return is high. The gap between social and private returns to
clean energy innovations is magnified by the additional environmental
externalities that private firms do not internalize (Nordhaus 2011).
Since many clean energy technologies are in fledgling stages and require
foundational developments, the R&D market failure leads to significant
underinvestment in R&D for those technologies, suggesting a role for
policy.
The Obama Administration has made significant investments
in clean energy R&D. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
directed a substantial amount of its $90 billion in clean energy funding
to research and development. This included funding for the Advanced
Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E) program, which funds
clean energy projects that are in early innovation stages and have high
potential societal value. ARPA-E’s first projects were funded by the
Recovery Act, and it has since sponsored over 400 energy technology
projects. The Recovery Act set a precedent for continued investment
in clean energy R&D; subsequent fiscal budget proposals have included
significant funding to continue such programs.
The 2013 Climate Action Plan structured the Administration’s
continuing commitment to investment in clean energy R&D. Consistent
with the goals of the Plan, the DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and
Renewable Energy (EERE) launched the SunShot Initiative, which funds
solar energy R&D. The EERE Wind Program funds R&D activity in wind
energy technologies, including offshore and distributed wind. EERE’s
Geothermal Technologies Office conducts research on geothermal systems in order to lower the risks and costs of geothermal development and
exploration. Additionally, EERE supports R&D in cleaner transportation
technologies through a variety of programs: the Hydrogen and Fuel Cells
Program funds basic and applied research to overcome the technical
barriers of hydrogen production, delivery and storage technologies as
well as fuel cell technologies. The Bioenergy program supports R&D in
sustainable biofuels, with a focus on advanced biofuels that are in earlier
stages of development but can take advantage of existing transportation
infrastructure by providing functional substitutes for crude oil, gasoline,

diesel fuel and jet fuel. The Vehicles Technologies Office funds R&D to
encourage deployment of electric cars by developing advanced batteries,
electric drive systems and lightweight vehicles. These efforts combined
represent billions of dollars invested in clean energy R&D.
Public investment in R&D helps correct for private underinvestment due to market failures and moves investment toward efficient levels, allowing for cost reductions in clean energy use. Clean
energy technology costs have declined significantly since 2008, and the
Administration’s R&D investments supported this trend. More importantly, these investments will help to ensure that positive trends in clean
energy penetration and greenhouse gas emissions reductions continue
into the future, since the economic benefits of R&D—particularly in
early stage innovations—accrue over a very long time horizon.

incentive for innovation.21 Figure 7-4 shows fuel economy standards over
time, including the major increase since 2008, and further increases projected through 2025.
In March 2012, the Administration launched “EV Everywhere,” an
electric vehicle Grand Challenge that seeks to make electric vehicles as
affordable and convenient to own as gasoline-powered vehicles within the
next decade (DOE 2012). Much of the focus of this initiative is to foster
early-stage innovation, an endeavor that helps to address innovation market
failures since the social return from such innovation is greater than the
private return. EV Everywhere has already spurred dramatic technological
and cost improvements in EV technology. In addition, since 2010, DOE
investments through the Grand Challenge have contributed to a 50-percent
reduction in the modeled high-volume cost of electric vehicle batteries, and
DOE has invested in industry, national laboratory, and university projects
that explore how to make EV batteries even more efficient and cost-effective
(Brescher Shea 2014). Since the program’s launch, hundreds of employers
have joined the Workplace Charging Challenge pledging to provide charging access for their employees (DOE 2016f). These policies are examples
of some of the incentives the Administration has implemented to support
EVs; others include tax credits for purchase of electric vehicles, support for
domestic electric vehicle battery manufacturing, and more than $6 billion in
Recovery Act funds for programs to promote research and development of
21 Economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that trading and other market-based
approaches provide greater incentives for technological innovation than do prescriptive
regulations that would achieve the same level of emissions reduction (Keohane 2003; Popp
2003).

advanced vehicle technologies (CEA 2016c). Much like owning a car was difficult until enough people had cars that gas stations were plentiful, the network effects of electric vehicles provide an economic case for a policy push
supporting the necessary services to move the industry toward critical mass.

Reducing Emissions from High Potency Greenhouse Gases
To further help address the environmental externality from greenhouse gas emissions, the Administration has also developed policies to
reduce the emissions of other potent greenhouse gases, such as hydro-fluorocarbons (HFCs) and methane. When the President launched his Climate
Action Plan in June 2013, he pledged to reduce emissions of HFCs through
both domestic and international leadership (EPA 2016b). Through actions
like leader-level joint statements with China in 2013 and with India in 2016,
the United States has led global efforts to secure an ambitious amendment
to the Montreal Protocol to phase down HFCs. In October 2016, the 197
Parties to the Montreal Protocol agreed to amend the Protocol to phase
down HFC use in developed countries beginning in 2019, and to freeze
HFC use in developing countries in 2024, though some will wait until 2028
(UNEP 2016).
At the same time, the Administration has taken important steps
to reduce HFC consumption domestically under EPA’s Significant New
Alternatives Policy, a Clean Air Act program under which EPA identifies and evaluates substitutes for industrial chemicals and publishes lists
of acceptable and unacceptable substitutes. The Administration has also
announced a suite of private-sector commitments and executive actions that
are projected to reduce HFCs equivalent to more than 1 billion metric tons
of carbon dioxide emissions globally through 2025.
The President has also taken steps to reduce methane emissions,
which accounted for 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2014.22
In January 2015, the Administration set a goal of reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent from 2012 levels by
2025, which would save up to 180 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2025—
enough to heat more than 2 million homes for a year. The Administration’s
commitment to this goal was reaffirmed and strengthened in March 2016 in
a joint statement with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, in which
both countries pledged to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas
sector and to explore new opportunities for additional reductions. In May
2016, EPA finalized methane pollution standards for new and modified
22 This is based on the U.S. EPA’s emissions inventory, for which the most recent data are from
2014. More recent research suggests that U.S. methane emissions may be much higher than the
estimates underlying EPA’s 2014 inventory (Turner et al. 2016; Schwietzke et al. 2016).

Box 7-3: Building Resilience to Current and
Future Climate Change Impacts
The Obama Administration has implemented many policies and
actions to support and enhance climate resilience. For example, in 2013,
the President signed an Executive Order that established an interagency
Council on Climate Preparedness and Resilience and a State, Local, and
Tribal Leaders Task Force made up of governors, mayors, county officials, and Tribal leaders from across the country. The Task Force developed recommendations on how to modernize Federal Government programs to incorporate climate change and support community resilience
to its impacts. The Administration has responded to a number of these
recommendations, for example, by implementing the National Disaster
Resilience Competition that made nearly $1 billion available for resilient
housing and infrastructure projects to states and communities that had
been impacted by major disasters between 2011 and 2013. Government
agencies have also provided additional support for Federal-Tribal
Climate Resilience and support for reliable rural electric infrastructure.
In addition, the Administration developed and launched a Climate Data
Initiative and Climate Resilience Toolkit to improve access to climate
data, information, and tools. A new Resilience AmeriCorps program was
also established; through this program, AmeriCorps VISTA members
are recruited and trained to serve low-income communities across the
country by developing plans and implementing projects that increase
resilience-building capacity.
The Department of Transportation (DOT) now includes improving resilience to the impacts of climate change as a primary selection criteria for its Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery
(TIGER) grants, which provide $500 million in Federal funds to improve
transportation infrastructure while generating economic recovery and
enhancing resilience in communities (DOT 2016). Similarly, the newly
created FASTLANE grant program includes improving resilience to
climate impacts as a primary selection criterion. In 2014, USDA created
Climate Hubs in partnership with universities, the private sector, and all
levels of government to deliver science-based information and program
support to farmers, ranchers, forest landowners, and resource managers
to support decision-making in light of the increased risks and vulnerabilities associated with a changing climate.
President Obama has also used executive action to establish a
clear, government-wide framework for advancing climate preparedness,
adaptation, and resilience, and directed Federal agencies to integrate
climate-risk considerations into their missions, operations, and cultures.
As of 2016, 38 Federal agencies have developed and published climate

adaptation plans, establishing a strong foundation for action (Leggett
2015). These plans will improve over time, as new data, information,
and tools become available, and as lessons are learned and actions are
taken to effectively adapt to climate change through agencies’ missions
and operations.
The Administration is developing government-wide policies to
address shared challenges where a unified Federal approach is needed.
For example, the Federal Government is modernizing its approach to
floodplain management through the establishment of the Federal Flood
Risk Management Standard (pursuant to E.O. 13690, Establishing a
Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and a Process for Further
Soliciting and Considering Stakeholder Input), in part to ensure that
Federally funded projects remain effective even as the climate changes
and flood risk increases. To promote resilience to wildfire risks, E.O.
13728, Wildland-Urban Interface Federal Risk Mitigation, directs Federal
agencies to take proactive steps to enhance the resilience of Federal
buildings to wildfire through the use of resilient building codes. E.O.
13677, Climate Resilient International Development, promotes sound
decision making and risk management in the international development
work of Federal agencies. Pursuant to E.O. 13677, the Department
of the Treasury, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the
Millennium Challenge Corporation, the State Department, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, and other Federal agencies with international development responsibilities have established guidelines and
criteria to screen projects and investments against potential climate
impacts, with a goal of making these investments more climate resilient.
In March 2016, the President signed a Presidential Memorandum:
Building National Capabilities for Long-Term Drought Resilience with
an accompanying Action Plan. Drought routinely affects millions of
Americans and poses a serious and growing threat to the security of
communities nationwide. The Memorandum lays out six droughtresilience goals and corresponding actions, and permanently establishes
the National Drought Resilience Partnership (NDRP) as an interagency
task force responsible for coordinating execution of these actions. These
actions build on previous efforts of the Administration in responding to
drought and are responsive to input received during engagement with
drought stakeholders, which called for shifting focus from responding to
the effects of drought toward supporting coordinated, community-level
resilience and preparedness.

sources in the oil and gas sector, and the agency has taken the first steps
toward addressing existing sources under forthcoming standards. EPA
regulations promulgated in July 2016 will substantially reduce emissions of
methane-rich gases from municipal solid waste landfills.

Promoting Climate Resilience	
Even with all of the efforts to reduce emissions, the impacts of climate
change are already occurring and will continue into the future. From an
economic perspective, optimal responses to climate change would balance
the costs of mitigation, the costs of adaptation, and the residual damages of
climate change. Moreover, ideally, policies to encourage climate resilience
would be informed by research on the degree of anticipated private investment in adaptation, and any anticipated gaps in such investment based on
market failures or other factors. Relative to research on climate change damages and the impacts of mitigation, economic research on resilience is less
developed, however, making it difficult to quantify the impacts of specific
policies.
The economic literature suggests that some impacts of climate
change, particularly the rise in extreme temperatures, will likely be partly
offset by increased private investment in air conditioning (Deschênes 2014;
Deschênes and Greenstone 2011; Barreca et al. 2016), and that movement
to avoid temperature extremes, either spending more time indoors in the
short run, or relocating in the long run, could also reduce climate impacts
on health (Deschênes and Moretti 2009; Graff Zivin and Neidell 2014).
Similarly, in the agricultural sector, farmers may switch crops, install or
intensify irrigation, move cultivated areas, or make other private investments to adapt to a changing climate. Farmers are likely to make at least
some investments that yield net benefits in the long run, though existing
evidence is mixed regarding the likely extent and impact of private adaptive
responses in agriculture (Auffhammer and Schlenker 2014; Schlenker and
Roberts 2009; Fishman 2012). In terms of extreme events, countries that
experience tropical cyclones more frequently appear to have slightly lower
marginal damages from a storm (Hsiang and Narita 2012), suggesting some
adaptive response. Recent work finds no evidence of adaptation to hurricane
frequency in the United States, but significant evidence exists of adaptation for other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) countries (Bakkensen and Mendelsohn 2016).
Private adaptation measures are costly, and the extent to which they
will mitigate climate impacts is uncertain. The costs of not enhancing resilience to climate impacts, though also uncertain, may be higher. From an
economic perspective, building resilience to the current and future impacts
448  |  Chapter 7

of climate change—a critical component of the President’s Climate Action
Plan—is prudent planning and akin to buying insurance against the future
damages from climate change and their uncertain impacts.

Progress To-Date in Transitioning
to A Clean Energy Economy
In recent years, the U.S. energy landscape has witnessed several
large-scale shifts, with technological advances greatly increasing domestic
production of petroleum and natural gas while renewable energy sources,
particularly wind and solar energy, have concurrently seen a sharp rise in
production. These shifts provide important context for the progress on
decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, energy intensity, and carbon intensity.
For example, renewable production provides zero carbon energy, while the
rise in natural gas electricity generation, a relatively lower-carbon fossil fuel,
has displaced some coal-based energy generation that had higher carbon
content.
In the past decade, the United States has become the largest producer
of petroleum and natural gas in the world (EIA 2016). U.S. oil production
increased from 5 million barrels a day (b/d) in 2008 to a peak of 9.4 million
b/d in 2015, which sizably reduced U.S. oil imports. More importantly for
climate outcomes, U.S. natural gas production increased from 20 trillion
cubic feet (Tcf) in 2008 to 27 Tcf in 2015. Both increases were largely due to
technological advances combining horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing,
and seismic imaging.
The U.S. energy sector has simultaneously undergone a transformation toward lower-carbon energy resources. The United States has both
reduced the energy intensity of its economic activity and shifted toward
cleaner energy sources, both of which have reduced emissions. This section
documents the progress made to date in the transition to a clean energy
economy and analyzes the contribution of different factors to that transition.
The analysis considers the role of increased renewable energy production
that provided additional zero carbon energy; increased energy efficiency
that reduced energy consumption for a given amount of economic output;
domestic natural gas production that reduced gas prices relative to coal; and
shocks to the economy that affected the level of GDP, most notably the Great
Recession.

Reduced Growth in Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Greenhouse gas emissions, dominated by carbon dioxide emissions,
grew fairly steadily until 2008 (EPA 2016a). Since 2008, both carbon dioxide
Addressing Climate Change | 449

emissions and total greenhouse gas emissions have been declining (Figure
7-5). Although the economic downturn in 2008-09 certainly contributed,
Figure 7-5 shows that emissions have declined since 2008, while GDP has
risen after a drop in the beginning of the period. Figure 7-6 shows that the
decline since 2008 in carbon dioxide emissions from the electric power sector, which made up roughly 30 percent of total emissions in 2014, has been
particularly noticeable (EPA 2016a). In fact, carbon dioxide emissions from
electricity generation in 2015 were the lowest since 1992, after peaking in
2007; and in the first half of 2016, carbon dioxide emissions from the U.S.
energy sector were at the lowest level in 25 years (EIA 2016b).
The decline in emissions, which has continued even as the economy
has recovered, largely stemmed from two major shifts in U.S. energy consumption patterns over the past decade: a decline in the amount of energy
that is consumed per dollar of GDP and a shift toward cleaner energy. The
amount of energy used to produce one dollar of real GDP in the United
States, or the energy intensity of real GDP, has declined steadily over the past
four decades and, in 2015, stood at less than half of what it was in the early
1970s (Figure 7-7). Since 2008, the energy intensity of real GDP has fallen
by almost 11 percent (Figure 7-8).23 Meanwhile, cleaner energy sources like
natural gas and zero-emitting sources like renewables have increasingly
displaced the use of dirtier fossil fuel sources. This shift has led to an even
larger decline in carbon emissions per dollar of real GDP, which was more
than 18-percent lower in 2015 than it was in 2008 (Figure 7-8).
The next subsections discuss these trends, followed by an analysis of
how each trend contributed to the decline in carbon dioxide emissions.

Declining Energy Intensity
Total U.S. energy consumption has been falling—with consumption
in 2015 down 1.5 percent relative to 2008. The fact that the U.S. economy
is using less energy while continuing to grow reflects a decline in overall
energy intensity that is due to both more efficient use of energy resources to
complete the same or similar tasks and to structural shifts in the economy
that have led to changes in the types of tasks that are undertaken. The continuation of these changes, which have been occurring for decades (Figure
7-7), is spurred by market forces, and the increasing efficiency in the use of
energy resources is supported by energy efficiency policies.
This continual trend of declining economy-wide energy intensity
was also predictable based on historical projections from the U.S. Energy

23 The uptick in 2012 in Figure 7-8 is due to a number of early nuclear plant closures.

Information Administration (EIA).24 Figure 7-9 plots both the observed
decline in energy intensity in the U.S. economy, as well as EIA projections of
the decline in energy intensity going back to 2003.25 Not only has the decline
in energy intensity been relatively steady, but it has tracked closely with
predictions. Changes in energy intensity come from policy as well as technological and behavioral shifts. The fact that it has been predicted to decrease
over time comes from assumptions that technology will continue to develop
and policies will continue to encourage efficiency. With the extensive energy
efficiency policies implemented by the Administration since 2009, EIA projects energy intensity to decline another 17 percent by 2025 (EIA 2016a).26
Although the aggregate energy intensity has been steadily and predictably moving downward, aggregation masks differences across sectors of
the economy. One notable example is the transportation sector, which has
driven a decline in U.S. petroleum consumption relative to both recent levels
and past projections.
24 EIA forecasts do include existing policies, as well as finalized policies with impacts in the
future that have been projected at the time of the forecast.
25 Figures 7-9, 7-12, 7-13, and 7-14a to 7-14c use an index, with actual U.S. energy intensity in
2003 set equal to 1.0, and actual and projected energy intensity since 2003 expressed relative
to that baseline. Projections use annual (negative) growth rates for energy intensity from the

Petroleum consumption was 2 percent lower in 2015 than it was in
2008 (EIA 2016b), while the economy grew more than 10 percent over this
same period. In fact, petroleum consumption peaked in 2004, and the subsequent decline over the next several years surprised many analysts (Figure
7-10). The actual consumption of oil in 2015 was more than 25 percent
below EIA projections made in 2003 for consumption that year. Moreover,
the surprising decline in consumption relative to past projections is expected
to grow over the next decade to 34 percent in 2025 (Figure 7-11). This trend
through 2014 was primarily attributed to a population that was driving less
and to rising fuel economy in the light-duty fleet.27
With this petroleum consumption surprise, the energy intensity in the
transportation sector has declined beyond that which was projected by EIA
in 2003, as seen in Figure 7-12.
In contrast, the residential sector showed less of a decline in energy
intensity than was projected by EIA in 2003, and even than in some later
projections (Figure 7-13). The actual residential energy intensity did decline
substantially—likely due in part to energy efficiency standards—but sits
above the level that was projected in most prior years for 2015. This greaterthan-expected energy intensity in the residential sector may be due to factors
such as new electronic appliances being plugged in, a slow-down of replacement of older appliances after the economic recession began in 2008, or a
shift in preference for house size or energy consumption at home.
Energy intensity in the electric power and commercial sectors (Figures
14a and 14c, respectively) in 2015 tracked quite closely to prior projections. Actual 2015 energy intensity in the industrial sector (Figure 7-14b)
was below what would have been predicted in 2003, though closer to later
predictions.

Declining Carbon Intensity
While the energy intensity of the economy has continued a relatively
steady downward trend, carbon intensity—carbon emissions per unit of
energy consumed—has had a much more dramatic shift, relative to projections, in the past decade. Projections made in 2008 and in prior years showed
carbon intensity holding relatively steady. However, since 2008, carbon
intensity has fallen substantially and continues to fall—leading to revised
projections nearly every single year. Figure 7-15a shows the observed carbon
27 See CEA (2015b) for a more detailed analysis. In 2015-16, low gasoline prices have led to
significant increases in vehicle miles travelled (VMT); VMT reached a 6-month record high in
the first half of 2016. Since low oil (and thus low gasoline) prices are expected to continue at
least through the end of 2016 (EIA 2016), the upward trend observed in 2015 may continue in
2016.

emissions intensity of energy use in the U.S. economy, as well as several EIA
projections. Beginning in 2008, these projections are all noticeably above
the observed carbon intensity. Figure 7-15b shows that carbon emitted per
dollar of GDP has also declined over this period, and that declines exceed
predictions.
There are two primary reasons for the declining carbon intensity: a
considerable shift to natural gas (a lower-carbon fossil fuel) and a remarkable growth in renewable energy, especially wind and solar.
The shift to lower carbon fossil fuels can be seen in Figure 7-16. Since
2008, coal and petroleum consumption have fallen 30 and 4 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, natural gas consumption has risen by almost 19 percent,
with much of this increase displacing coal for electricity generation. This
is due, in large part, to the surge in U.S. natural gas production discussed
earlier. In fact, the share of electricity generation using natural gas surpassed
the share produced from coal in 2015 for the first time on record (Figure
7-17). As natural gas is a much lower-carbon fuel than coal for electricity
generation, this shift has contributed to lower carbon intensity.
Clean energy has undergone notable trends since 2008: electricity
generation from renewable energy has increased, and costs of key clean
energy technologies have fallen as there have been sizable efficiency gains
in renewable energy. As seen in Figure 7-18, the share of non-hydropower
renewables in U.S. electricity generation has increased from 3 percent in

2008 to 7 percent in 2015. Figure 7-19 shows that at the end of 2015, the
United States generated more than three times as much electricity from
wind and 30 times as much from solar as it did in 2008. Many factors have
contributed to this growth, including improved technologies and falling
costs, state renewable portfolio standards, other State and local policies, and
the major Federal initiatives discussed earlier.
This rapid growth in new electricity generation from renewable
sources comes from rapid growth in renewable energy capacity. Electric
generation capacity refers to the maximum output that a generator can
produce, while electricity generation refers to the actual electricity produced.
As illustrated in Figure 7-20, non-hydro renewable energy capacity in the
United States more than tripled between 2008 and 2015, from less than 30
gigawatts to almost 100 gigawatts. Most of the increase was driven by growth
in wind and solar capacity, and deployments in the first half of 2016 suggest
a continuing trend. From January through June 2016, no new coal capacity was installed; solar, wind and natural gas added 1,883 MW, 2,199 MW,
and 6,598 MW of new installed capacity, respectively, over the same period
(Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 2016).
One reason for increases in renewable electricity generation and
capacity is the decline in the cost of renewable energy and other notable clean
energy technologies. A common metric for comparing cost competitiveness
between renewable and conventional technologies is the “levelized cost of
electricity” (LCOE). The LCOE can be interpreted as the per-kilowatt-hour
cost (in real dollars) of building and operating a generating plant over an
assumed financial life and duty cycle. Several key inputs are taken into
account when calculating LCOE, including capital costs, fuel costs, fixed and
variable operations and maintenance costs, financing costs, and an assumed
utilization rate for each plant type (EIA 2015). Because solar and wind technologies have no fuel costs, their LCOEs are highly dependent on estimated
capital costs of generation capacity and can vary substantially by region.
While using the LCOE as a measure of technology cost has drawbacks, and
energy project developers may not always rely on this metric when assessing
project costs, it provides a helpful benchmark for understanding changes in
technology costs over time.
Wind and solar LCOEs have fallen substantially since 2008. Figure
7-21 shows that the LCOE for onshore wind technologies has decreased
on average by almost 40 percent from 2008 to 2014, based on unsubsidized
LCOE; that is, the cost of wind electricity without considering the benefits

from Federal tax incentives. Installation costs for solar PV have decreased by
60 percent, and LCOE for solar has fallen by almost 70 percent. 28
In Figures 7-21 and 7-22, the measure of LCOE does not include local,
State and Federal tax credits or other incentives for renewable energy. When
these incentives are also considered, the cost declines described above mean
that in many locations renewable energy costs are at or below the cost of fossil fuels. Renewables are truly reaching “grid parity,” which means that the
cost of renewables is on par with the cost of new fossil-generated electricity
on the grid. Although wind and solar have been considered more expensive
forms of new generation, current ranges of unsubsidized costs are showing some wind and solar projects coming in at lower costs than some coal
generation. Further, forecasts show a trend toward increasing grid parity in
the future. For example, forecasts for wind and solar PV costs from the EIA
and the International Energy Agency (IEA) suggest that the unsubsidized
technology cost of new wind and solar will be on par with or below that of
new coal plants by 2020 (Figure 7-22).29 Moreover, there are already places
28 LCOE for wind is estimated by average power-purchase agreement (PPA) prices plus
estimated value of production tax credits available for wind, and average PPA prices for solar
PV.
29 The larger bounds in costs for some renewable technologies, such as solar and off-shore
wind, reflect a range of potential technology options that are being considering for future
commercial deployment of these developing technologies.

or lower cost than new coal.30 Note that EIA projections suggest that the
unsubsidized LCOE for wind and solar will continue to be above that for
natural gas (conventional combined cycle), on average across the United
States, in 2018 and 2022 (EIA 2016a).
To better understand what is driving the declining carbon intensity,
CEA estimates the portion of carbon intensity in electricity generation
decline due to two factors: a reduced carbon intensity of fossil-fuel generation driven by a shift toward natural gas resources, and an increase in electric
generation from renewable resources. To do so, CEA uses an analytical
approach that develops estimates of counterfactual emissions holding constant the carbon intensities of the electric generating portfolio in 2008.
In particular, CEA first considers the case where the emissions factor
associated with the portfolio of fossil-fuel electric generation; that is, the
emissions per unit of energy generated from a fossil-fuel resource, in 2008
is held constant through 2015. As the emissions factor reflects the mix of
resources in the fossil-fuel electric generating portfolio in 2008, this factor
reflects the composition and efficiency of coal, natural gas, and petroleum
generation resources in 2008. Applying this factor to the total electricity
generated from fossil-fuel resources from 2009 to 2015 develops a counterfactual level of emissions had the portfolio of fossil-fuel resources remained
constant in mix and efficiency over this time. Then, the difference between
the quantity of emissions in the counterfactual and the observed emissions from electricity generated by fossil fuels during this time provides an
estimate of emissions saved as a result of the reduction in carbon intensity
of fossil-fuel electricity generation.31 This reduction in carbon intensity is
expected to stem primarily from increased natural gas generation, though
would also include improvements in technical efficiency from fossil fuel
resources. Much of the shift toward natural gas comes from rising supplies
and falling prices of natural gas in the United States, though some may stem
from policies that have aimed to account for and internalize some of the
externalities of coal combustion.
Next, in a similar fashion, the analysis considers the emissions outcomes if the emissions factor from the entire portfolio of electricity generating resources in 2008 were held constant through 2015. The difference
between these counterfactual emissions and total actual emissions from
30 Wind: DOE (2015), Wiser and Bolinger (2014); Solar: Galen and Darghouth (2015), Bolinger
and Seel (2015).
31 This analytical approach holds fixed the observed kWh demand from fossil fuels and total
power when estimating counterfactual emissions. To the extent that the shift to natural gas led
to an increase in electricity demand, this approach would overstate the impact of coal-to-gas
switching on reducing emissions.

electricity generation would then represent the total avoided emissions from
changes in the carbon intensity of the entire electricity portfolio. By subtracting total avoided emissions attributed to reduced carbon intensity from
fossil fuel resources calculated as described above, the remaining difference
between actual and counterfactual emissions can be attributed to an increase
in resources with zero-carbon footprints; that is, an increase in the share of
renewable energy resources.32 For 2015, 284 million metric tons (MMT) (66
percent) of 428 MMT total avoided emissions was due to reduced carbon
intensity from lower-carbon fossil resources, leaving 144 MMT (34 percent)
attributable to increased generation from renewables. Figure 7-23 shows this
decomposition from 2008 to 2015.

Decomposition of the Unexpected and Total Declines in Emissions
This section summarizes overall contributions to the observed emissions decline by decomposing reductions into those attributable to lower
energy intensity, lower carbon intensity, and the difference from projections
32 While this could include increased generation from nuclear power, the EIA shows that
net generation from nuclear power remained fairly constant over the period, with an overall
reduction in 2015 compared to 2008. Year-to-year fluctuations in nuclear or hydro power
can affect annual changes in the contribution of non-carbon energy, but the overall result of
significant contribution from non-hydro renewables over time is not altered by these sources,
as both hydro and nuclear power saw small declines over the 2008-15 window.

on the size of the economy in 2015. The decomposition analysis follows the
methodology in CEA (2013), but with the added component of considering
emissions from both “expected” and “unexpected” trends. The emissions
considered in the analysis are energy-related carbon dioxide emissions,
which comprised 97 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions and 83.6 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2014 (EPA 2016a).
As an initial step, one could simply look at GDP growth, energy
intensity, and the carbon intensity of energy production to see what has
influenced changes in emissions (Figure 7-24). Rising GDP, all else equal,
causes an increase in emissions, but the declining energy intensity of output (energy usage per dollar of GDP) and the declining carbon intensity
of energy (carbon emissions per energy usage) both pushed down on this
tendency of emissions to rise as the economy grows.
Alternatively, one can use expectations for the paths of these three
variables to understand what drove emissions relative to a reasonable
expectation in 2008. The general approach of this decomposition is to ask
the following: starting in a given base year, what were actual or plausible
projections of the values of GDP, energy intensity, and the carbon intensity
of energy out to the current year. These three values imply a projected value
for the current level of carbon emissions. Then, relative to this forecast,
what were the actual emissions, and what were the actual values of these

Addressing Climate Change | 467

three determinants of emissions? If, hypothetically, the forecasts of energy
and carbon intensity were on track, but the GDP forecast differed from
projections because of the (unexpected) recession, this would suggest that
the unexpected decline in carbon emissions was a consequence of the recession. In general, the forecasts of all the components will not match the
realized outcomes, and the extent to which they vary—that is, the contribution of the forecast error of each component to the forecast error in carbon
emissions—allows analysts to attribute shares of the unexpected decline in
carbon emissions to unexpected movements in GDP, unexpected shifts in
energy intensity, and unexpected shifts in carbon intensity.33
In the 2013 Economic Report of the President, this approach was performed to decompose emissions reductions from 2005 to 2012 (CEA 2013).
The analysis found that actual 2012 carbon emissions were approximately
17 percent below the “business as usual” baseline projections made in 2005,
with 52 percent due to the lower-than-expected level of GDP, 40 percent
from cleaner energy resources, and 8 percent from increased energy efficiency improvements above the predicted trend.
CEA has completed this new decomposition approach in a similar
fashion as in the 2013 Economic Report of the President, but over a different time frame: from 2008 to 2015 instead of from 2005 to 2012. In this
decomposition, emissions in 2015 are compared to projections of emissions
in 2015 made in 2008, based on the EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook from
2008. Then, emissions reductions here can be seen as reductions above and
beyond projections, or “unexpected” emissions reductions. As discussed
above, energy intensity was projected to decline significantly over this time
frame, and emissions reductions from energy intensity occurred largely as
predicted. Thus, in this decomposition, energy intensity does not account
for any of the “unexpected” emissions reductions, though it fell notably over
the relevant time frame and contributed to realized declines in emissions.
CEA’s analysis suggests that 46 percent of unexpected emissions reductions
in 2015 are attributable to a lower-than-predicted carbon intensity of energy,
with the remaining 54 percent due to a lower level of GDP than projected
in 2008. The role GDP plays in the decomposition largely reflects the fact
that the major financial crisis and recession were not anticipated in early
2008, when EIA’s projections were made. However, a larger-than-expected
decline in carbon intensity also contributes substantially and reflects other
33 Specifically, CO2 emissions are the product of (CO2/Btu)×(Btu/GDP)×GDP, where CO2
represents U.S. CO2 emissions in a given year, Btu represents energy consumption in that year,
and GDP is that year’s GDP. Taking logarithms of this expression, and then subtracting the
baseline from the actual values, gives a decomposition of the CO2 reduction into contributions
from each factor.

developments in recent years (for example, the shifts toward natural gas and
renewables discussed earlier).
Figure 7-25 takes the same decomposition approach using the forecast of 2015 GDP to determine a “GDP surprise” but considers emissions
reductions in 2015 compared with observed emissions in 2008, rather than
projections for 2015. That is, the projections hold energy intensity and
carbon intensity in 2008 constant over the period from 2009 to 2015. In this
manner, Figure 7-25 decomposes total emissions reductions since 2008 in
a way that includes expected, as well as unexpected, movements in either
energy intensity or carbon intensity.
Considering total emissions reductions compared with 2008, Figure
7-25 shows that 40 percent of total emissions reductions can be attributed
to lower energy intensity, 29 percent to lower carbon intensity, and 31 percent to a lower level of GDP. The impact of lower energy intensity, while
expected, was substantial.
To further understand the decline in emissions since 2008, CEA
considers emission declines separately by sector—residential, commercial,
industrial, and transportation—and decomposes total emission impacts
from reduced energy intensity, reduced carbon intensity, and a lower level of
GDP (due to unanticipated shocks, most notably the Great Recession) separately by sector. To perform the sector-by-sector analysis, CEA estimates

the GDP contributions from each sector using data from the U.S. Bureau of
Economic Analysis.34 Then, CEA performs the same decomposition of total
emissions reductions that was done for the economy as a whole in Figure
7-25.
Results of the sectoral decomposition analysis are reported in Figure
7-26. In the residential sector, a lower level of GDP, lower energy intensity,
and lower carbon intensity each played a similar role in reducing emissions from 2008 to 2015. For the transportation sector, a majority of emissions reductions (more than 60 percent) were due to a decrease in energy
intensity. This finding could reflect the impact of increased fuel efficiency
from light-duty vehicle fuel efficiency standards implemented by the
Administration over this time, though the analysis cannot establish a causal
link.35 Reductions in energy intensity also played important roles (48 to 52
percent) in emissions reductions from the commercial and industrial sectors, possibly reflecting shifts toward less energy-intensive industries. Any
influence of Administration energy efficiency policies (such as, appliance
standards) could also be captured here, though no causal link is established
in this analysis.
34 See the Appendix for more detail.
35 Phase 1 of the first-ever medium- and heavy-duty vehicle standards, finalized in 2011,
affected model years 2014-2018, so fuel economy standards for these larger vehicles could only
have contributed to the energy intensity share at the very end of the period.

Lower carbon intensity also played a role in emissions reductions
in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, responsible for 38,
29, and 28 percent of emissions reductions, respectively. In the residential
sector, lower carbon intensity in regional electricity supply portfolios from
shifts toward natural gas and zero-carbon energy resources would translate
to reduced emissions from end-use electricity consumption. This impact
would occur similarly for electricity-intensive commercial and industrial
activities. Lower carbon intensity in the industrial sector could also result
from substitution of lower-carbon natural gas for coal or oil in industrial
processes.

How Administration Policies Meet
Future Emissions Reductions Targets
In 2009, the President set a goal to cut emissions in the range of
17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, a goal that was re-affirmed by
the U.S. pledge at the 2009 United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties in Copenhagen.
Subsequently, in 2015 the United States submitted its target to the UNFCCC
to reduce emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. In the 2016
Second Biennial Report of the United States of America, the U.S. presented
results from an interagency effort to project the trajectory of GHG emissions
through 2030, including the impact of U.S. policies and measures that have
either been implemented or planned consistent with the Climate Action
Plan. The report found that the implementation of all finalized, and planned,
additional policies, including measures that at the time had been proposed
but not yet finalized, would lay the foundation to meet those targets.
The estimates of U.S. GHG emissions take into account factors
such as population growth, long-term economic growth, historic rates of
technological change, and usual weather patterns. Projections for future
emissions are modeled based on anticipated trends in technology adoption,
demand-side efficiency gains, fuel switching, and implemented policies and
measures. The report’s estimates synthesize projected CO2 emissions, nonCO2 emissions, and CO2 sequestration based on data from the Department
of Energy, the Energy Information Administration, the Environmental
Protection Agency, and the Department of Agriculture. The main source of
uncertainty in emission projections is the range of land use, land-use change,
and forestry projections, which approximate the ability of the land sector to
remove CO2 emissions from the atmosphere. The report therefore produces
a range of projections using a set of modeling techniques from various agencies, which reflect differing perspectives on macroeconomic outlook, forest

characteristics, and management trends. However, in part due to actions
undertaken by the United States to bolster the forest carbon sink, the authors
of the 2016 report believe that the United States is trending toward a more
high-sequestration (“optimistic”) pathway.
The report estimates two emissions projection scenarios. The first,
the Current Measures scenario, reflects the impact of those policies and
measures that have been established up to mid-2015. This includes, most
notably, the Clean Power Plan, more stringent light-duty vehicle economy
standards, recent appliance and equipment efficiency standards, and actions
to reduce agricultural emissions and bolster our forest carbon sink.
However, the Current Measures scenario does not include measures that
were not final at the time of the publication, such as then-draft standards
for oil and gas methane, phase two heavy-duty vehicle standards, and the
five-year extension of tax credits for wind and solar. Therefore, the Current
Measures scenario underestimates the full impact of policies undertaken
under the President’s Climate Action Plan. Under the Current Measures
scenario, GHG emissions are projected to decline 15 percent below the 2005
level in 2020 with an optimistic land sector sink (Figure 7-27). The effects
of policies implemented under the Obama Administration are clear when
comparing the 2015 projections to the 2006 projections, in which emissions
were expected to increase by about 20 percent above 2005 levels by 2020.
Clear progress in driving down projected GHG emissions can be seen since
2010 and even since 2014. The 2016 projections mark the first time a U.S.
Climate Action Report has projected GHG emissions to fall based on existing policies. This reflects the large number of policies implemented in the
prior two years.
Also in the 2016 Second Biennial Report is an Additional Measures
scenario that includes measures consistent with the Climate Action Plan that
were planned, but not implemented, when the Report was completed, such
as policies to cut methane and volatile organic compound emissions from
oil and gas systems, and a proposed amendment to the Montreal Protocol
to phase down production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons. The
report estimates the impact of planned policies separately on emissions of
carbon dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons, methane, and nitrous oxide. These
estimates are synthesized and presented as a range due to uncertainty in
policy implementation. The report projects that the Additional Measures
scenario with an optimistic land sector sink will lead to emission reductions
of at least 17 percent from 2005 levels in 2020, and 22 to 27 percent below
2005 levels in 2025 (Figure 7-28). Note that some of the policies included in
the report as “additional measures” (for example, new GHG emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles, and methane standards for new sources in the

by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol to phase down global hydrofluorocarbon use (UNEP 2016). If included, these would move the 2016 projection
below its current position in Figure 7-28.
These projections show that recent Administration actions on emission-reduction policies are already moving the United States toward its targets. The additional implementation of policies planned as of 2016 will put
the economy on track to meet the 2020 target and will build a foundation for
meeting the 2025 target. Under this scenario, this level of emission reduction
will occur even while the economy is projected to grow by 50 percent.

	

American Leadership in
International Cooperation

As climate change mitigation is a global public good, international
cooperation is essential for an effective and economically efficient solution.
The President’s ambition and dedication to addressing climate change have
helped accentuate the United States’ position as a global leader on this
issue. On December 12, 2015, more than 190 countries agreed to the most
ambitious climate change mitigation goals in history. The Paris Agreement
entered into force in November 2016, 30 days after the date on which the
required threshold (at least 55 Parties, accounting for at least 55 percent of
global greenhouse gas emissions) was officially met. The Agreement establishes a long-term, durable global framework to reduce global greenhouse
gas emissions where, for the first time ever, all participating countries commit to putting forward nationally determined contributions. The Agreement
lays the foundation for countries to work together to put the world on a path
to keeping climate warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, while pursuing
efforts to limit the increase even more. The nationally determined contributions agreed to in Paris, though historic, will not halt climate change on their
own, but the Paris Agreement provides a framework for progress toward
that goal.36
In the lead up to the Paris Agreement in 2015, the United States
worked bilaterally with many countries to build support for an ambitious
agreement. Most notably, starting in 2013, the United States and China
intensified their climate cooperation and, in November 2014, President
36 Building on the historic Paris Agreement, in October 2016, 191 members of the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) meeting in Montreal, Canada adopted a market-based
measure to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from international aviation – aviation comprises
two percent of global carbon emissions, but was not covered by the Paris Agreement. Like
other aspects of climate change mitigation, reducing aviation emissions requires international
cooperation.

474  |  Chapter 7

Obama and President Xi made a surprise announcement of their countries’
respective post-2020 climate targets. President Obama announced the
ambitious U.S. goal to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005
levels by 2025, and China committed for the first time to implement policies leading to a peak in its carbon dioxide emissions around 2030 and an
increase in the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption.
Further, in September 2015, President Obama and President Xi reaffirmed
their commitment to a successful outcome in Paris, a shared determination to move ahead decisively in implementing domestic climate policies,
strengthening bilateral coordination and cooperation on climate change and
promoting sustainable development. In addition to working closely with
China, the United States worked hand-in-hand with a broad range of countries to increase support for international climate action and an ambitious
agreement in Paris, including with Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Mexico,
small islands, and many others.
The United States has remained a leader in the global effort to mobilize public and private finance for mitigation and adaptation. Since the
15th Conference of the Parties (COP-15) to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change in December 2009, the United States
has increased its climate financing by fourfold for developing countries
(Department of State 2016a). In November 2014, President Obama pledged
that the United States would contribute $3 billion to the Green Climate
Fund to reduce carbon pollution and strengthen resilience in developing
countries, the largest pledge of any country. This strong U.S. pledge helped
increase the number and ambition of other countries’ contributions, and
U.S. leadership helped propel initial capitalization of the fund to over $10
billion, a threshold seen by stakeholders as demonstrating serious donor
commitment.
At the Paris Conference, Secretary of State John Kerry announced
that the United States would double its grant-based public climate finance
for adaptation by 2020. As of 2014, the United States had invested more
than $400 million a year of grant-based resources for climate adaptation in
developing countries, providing support to vulnerable countries to reduce
climate risks in key areas including infrastructure, agriculture, health, and
water services. The commitment that the United States and other countries
have shown to mobilizing climate finance will help to support developing
countries’ transitions to low-carbon growth paths.
One of the most important components of the landmark Paris
Agreement is that, by sending a strong signal to the private sector that the
global economy is transitioning toward clean energy, the Agreement will
foster innovation to allow the United States to achieve its climate objectives
Addressing Climate Change | 475

while creating new jobs and raising standards of living. The submission of
ambitious national contributions in five-year cycles gives investors and technology innovators a clear indicator that the world will demand clean power
plants, energy efficient factories and buildings, and low carbon transportation both in the short term and in the decades to come.
Another example of U.S. diplomatic leadership to drive global action
on climate change mitigation is the Administration’s work over several
years toward an amendment to the 1987 Montreal Protocol to phase down
the global production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons, potent
greenhouse gases. This work included the development of leader-level joint
statements with China in 2013 and with India in 2015. In October 2016, the
197 Parties to the Montreal Protocol agreed to amend the Protocol to phase
down HFC use in developed countries beginning in 2019, and to freeze and
subsequently phase down HFC use in the vast majority of developing countries in 2024 (UNEP 2016). The agreement could avoid up to 0.5 degrees
Celsius of warming by the end of the century, and it also provides financing
to developing countries to help them transition to new air conditioning and
refrigeration technologies that do not use HFCs.
The United States helped found the Clean Energy Ministerial, an ambitious effort among 25 governments representing around 75 percent of global
greenhouse gas emissions and 90 percent of global clean energy investments.
Through annual ministerial meetings (the United States hosted in 2010
and 2016), collaborative initiatives, and high-profile campaigns, the CEM
is bringing together the world’s largest countries, the private sector, and
other stakeholders for real-world collaboration to accelerate the global clean
energy transition. Twenty-one countries, the European Union, nearly 60
companies and organizations, and 10 subnational governments, made more
than $1.5 billion in commitments to accelerate the deployment of clean
energy and increase energy access at the June 2016 Clean Energy Ministerial.
On the first day of the Paris Conference, President Obama joined
19 other world leaders to launch Mission Innovation—a commitment to
accelerate public and private global clean energy innovation. Twenty-two
governments, representing well over 80 percent of the global clean energy
research and development (R&D) funding base, have now agreed under
Mission Innovation to seek to double their R&D investments over five years
(Mission Innovation 2016). In addition, a coalition of 28 global investors
committed to supporting early-stage breakthrough energy technologies in
countries that have joined Mission Innovation (Bodnar and Turk 2015). The
combination of ambitious commitments and broad support for innovation
and technology will help ratchet up energy investments over the coming

years, accelerate cost reductions for low-carbon solutions, and spur increasing greenhouse gas emissions reductions.

Plans for the Future
Building on the progress discussed in this chapter in decreasing emissions and shifting toward a clean energy economy will require concerted
effort over the coming years. Many of the policies and commitments begun
by the President will have growing impacts over time, including several
recently enacted policies mentioned above, as well as ongoing initiatives
discussed below that form some of the next steps to continuing progress on
climate issues. Also discussed below are some of the President’s proposals
for furthering clean energy goals that Congress has not yet acted upon, as
well as potentially promising directions for longer-term climate policy.
On June 29, 2016 at the North American Leaders Summit in
Ottawa, Canada, the President was joined by Canadian Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto in announcing the North American Climate, Energy, and Environment Partnership.
The Partnership outlines several goals the three countries aim to achieve.
Notably, a primary tenant of the Partnership is for North America to attain
50 percent clean power generation by 2025, including renewable, nuclear,
and carbon capture, utilization and storage technologies, as well as demand
reduction through energy efficiency. Each country will pursue these actions
individually by establishing specific legal frameworks and clean energy
national goals, tailored to each country’s unique conditions. Additionally,
the three countries aim to drive down short-lived climate pollutants, such as
reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent
by 2025. Other elements of the national methane emissions-reducing strategies could target key sectors such as waste management. To improve energy
efficiency, the Partnership intends to better align and further improve appliance and equipment efficiency standards: North American neighbors plan
to align six energy efficiency standards or test procedures for equipment by
the end of 2017, and to align 10 standards or test procedures by the end of
2019. In order to advance integration of all clean energy sources, including renewables, the Partnership also strives to support the development
of cross-border transmission projects that can play a key role in cleaning
and increasing the reliability and flexibility of North America’s electricity
grid. At least six transmission lines currently proposed, or in permitting
review, would add approximately 5,000 MW of new cross-border transmission capacity. The three economies will align approaches for evaluating the
impact of direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions of major projects,

Addressing Climate Change | 477

such as using similar methodologies to estimate the social cost of carbon and
other greenhouse gases. In summary, the North American Climate, Clean
Energy, and Environment Partnership Action Plan aims to advance clean
and secure energy, drive down short-lived climate pollutants, promote clean
and efficient transportation, protect nature and advance science, and show
global leadership in addressing climate change.
In 2015, about 41 percent of U.S. coal was produced on Federally
managed land, and this coal was responsible for about 10 percent of U.S.
greenhouse gas emissions (BLM 2016a). The President’s 2016 State of
the Union address called to “change the way we manage our oil and coal
resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and
our planet.” Three days later, Department of the Interior Secretary Sally
Jewell announced the first comprehensive review of the Federal coal leasing
program in over 30 years (DOI 2016). This announcement followed a series
of listening sessions across the country in 2015, initiated by Secretary Jewell,
to consider if taxpayers and local communities were getting fair returns on
public resources, how the coal leasing structure could improve in transparency and competitiveness, and how the federal coal program could be managed consistently with national climate change mitigation objectives (BLM
2016b). The Department of the Interior has yet to complete its analysis of
these issues. However, the current structure of the coal leasing program does
not price externalities from coal combustion, and independent analysis by
CEA concludes that it does not provide a fair return to taxpayers, making
this review a crucial policy step from an economic perspective (CEA 2016a).
Through a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS)
expected to be prepared over three years, the review will examine the
Interior Department’s current process to determine when, where, and
how to provide leases and respond to feedback and concerns raised during
the listening sessions as well as by the Government Accountability Office
(GAO 2013). The review will inform how the Federal coal program can be
reformed to ensure a fair return to American taxpayers for public resources
while considering the environmental and public health impact of Federal
coal production.
While the review is underway, mining will continue under existing
leases, but the Department of the Interior will pause new leases, with some
limited exceptions. This is consistent with practices under the previous
two programmatic reviews in the 1970s and 1980s. The Department of the
Interior also announced a series of reforms to improve the transparency of
the Federal coal program, including the establishment of a publicly available
database to monitor carbon emissions from fossil fuels on public lands and

478  |  Chapter 7

to increase transparency from Bureau of Land Management (BLM) offices
regarding requests to lease coal or reduce royalties (BLM 2016b).
A transition to a clean energy economy means removing subsidies
that encourage fossil fuel consumption and production, including the $4 billion in annual subsidies oil companies receive from taxpayers. The President
called on Congress to end these subsidies (Slack 2012), and proposed eliminating inefficient fossil fuel subsidies in every budget he has submitted, with
the Fiscal Year 2017 Federal Budget proposing to repeal $4 billion in subsidies to oil, gas, and other fossil fuel producers, as well as to expand the tax
that supports the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to apply to oil sand crude oil.
Following through on these proposals is a step toward avoiding a policy bias
toward fossil fuel energy consumption and giving clean energy production a
more level playing field. Given the climate externalities associated with fossil
fuel use, subsidizing fossil fuel consumption or production means that not
only are the externalities unpriced, but more fossil fuels are consumed than a
pure market outcome even without considering the externalities. Removing
the subsidies moves the incentives toward the efficient outcome.
Announced in 2016, the President’s 21st Century Clean Transportation
Plan seeks to improve America’s transportation accessibility and convenience, while reducing the emissions intensity of travel. The President’s plan
includes $20 billion in additional annual investments to reduce traffic and
improve accessibility for work and school trips by expanding transit systems,
adding high-speed rail in major corridors, modernizing freight systems,
and supporting the TIGER program, which provides grants for innovative
transportation projects. The Plan also directs an additional $10 billion a year
to support planning efforts by State and local governments to maximize the
benefits of public investments. The funds will encourage land use planning
and investments in infrastructure to support low-carbon transit options as
well as the development of livable cities with resilient transit options. In
addition, the Plan directs just over $2 billion a year toward the deployment
of smart and clean vehicles and aircraft, supporting pilot deployments of
autonomous vehicles, expanding the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act Grant
Program, and investing in the safe integration of new technologies.
To fund these investments, the President proposed a $10 a barrel fee
on oil, phased in gradually over five years. Revenues from the fee would provide long-term solvency for the Highway Trust Fund to maintain infrastructure, in addition to supporting new investments under the Plan. By placing
a fee on oil, this policy would take a step toward ameliorating the current
market failure that allows parties involved in emissions-generating activities
to bear less than the full costs of that activity. Further, by directing revenues
from the fee toward investments in a resilient and low-carbon transportation

Box 7-4: Supporting Increased Penetration of Variable
Energy with Smart Markets and Storage
The two most rapidly growing renewable energy technologies,
wind and solar, come with unique operating characteristics. The variable
nature of their production profile creates new challenges for management of the electric grid, as compared to traditional generating resources
with a more dispatchable output profile. For example, when considering
the timing of output from wind and solar, the net electricity load, which
is the demand for electricity less wind and solar generation, can exhibit
a “duck curve”—where the low net load in the middle of the day ramps
up quickly as the sun sets before trailing off as demand ebbs later at
night—looking much like the neck, head, and bill of a duck. The figure
below plots this curve for an illustrative spring day in California. We see
that current levels of variable energy resource (VER) penetration begin
to create this duck shape, increasingly so for future years, when VERs are
projected to increase.

In addition to the unique net load profile created by variable
renewable resources, wind and solar output exhibits more idiosyncratic
variation as compared to traditional resources, a feature that also creates
additional grid management needs.

480  |  Chapter 7

As penetration of variable energy resources has increased across the
country and the world, so too has the development of technologies and
operational changes to increase the flexibility of the electricity grid. In
addition to increasing transmission, larger balancing areas, and system
operational changes, smarter markets and energy storage and management systems can also support the flexibility requirements created by
increased use of VERs. Smart markets, which refers to communications
technologies and approaches that facilitate end-user responses in the
demand for electricity, can be leveraged to allow demand to adjust to the
true current cost of electricity. Dynamic electricity pricing structures, as
well as technology that facilitates end-user adjustment of demand such as
smart appliances, support integration of VERs by increasing the incentives and ability of consumers to modify their own electricity demand.
Further, the recent proliferation of smart markets infrastructure with
the deployment of 16 million smart meters since 2010 (DOE 2016e), lays
the necessary foundation for these resources to support grid integration.
Opportunities for energy storage to support integration are also
rapidly expanding as the storage industry has seen dramatic cost reductions in the last decade from over $1,000 per KWh in 2007 to under
$410 per kWh today (Nykvist and Nilsoon 2015). Storage technologies
support grid integration by temporarily storing electricity for later use
during times of grid stress, as well as storing variable energy produced
for use later that might otherwise be discarded due to low demand.
Although analysts had previously claimed that variable energy
penetration beyond 15 to 20 percent was not technically feasible
(Farmer, Newman, and Ashmole 1980; Cavallo, Hock, and Smith 1993),
instantaneous VER penetrations have already achieved high levels, with
Texas hitting a record 45 percent of total penetration in March 2016
and Portugal running for four days straight on 100 percent renewables
(wind, solar, and hydropower) (Electricity Reliability Council of Texas
2016, ZERO 2016). As more VERs increase the need and the value of grid
flexibility, supporting the ability of smart markets and energy storage to
provide grid integration services by ensuring that regulatory and electricity markets allow for the monetization of these resources will be critical
to transition to an increasingly low-carbon grid (CEA 2016b).

sector, the fee would incentivize private-sector innovation and investment
in clean transportation technologies. A portion of the fee would also be
directed to provide relief to vulnerable households.
In 2009, the President urged Congress to pass an energy bill that would
have used market-based mechanisms to incentivize a clean energy transformation (Obama 2009). A bill with a proposed national cap-and-trade system
passed in the House but was not voted on in the Senate (Walsh 2010). While
over the President’s terms the Administration has pursued a number of policies that indirectly price carbon-emitting activities, going forward, a widely
held view across a broad spectrum of economists is that policies that put a
direct, uniform price on carbon are the most efficient and comprehensive
way to both meet the goals set forth in the Paris Agreement and to efficiently
transition to a clean energy economy. Even with a comprehensive national
carbon price, some additional Federal climate policies (such as investments
in clean energy research and development) would likely still be efficient.

Conclusion
As discussed in this report, the costs of climate change are large, the
impacts are being felt now, and they will intensify in the future. Further,
delaying policy action designed to halt climate change will likely increase
its costs. There is strong economic rationale for policies to address climate
change based on both correcting a market failure from the negative externality produced by greenhouse gas emissions, and as a form of insurance
against catastrophes caused by global warming. Since the President took
office in 2009, the United States has taken numerous steps to both mitigate
climate change and respond to its effects. The Administration leveraged
a diverse set of policy mechanisms, from tax credits for renewable energy
technologies to the first-ever greenhouse gas emission standards for
vehicles and power plants, to pivot the nation toward a greener and stronger
economy while recovering from the Great Recession. With the implementation of these policies, renewable energy technology costs have declined,
and deployment of clean energy technologies has increased. With the
implementation of Administration policies, and with a concurrent increase
in supply and decrease in the cost of natural gas, the carbon intensity of our
electric portfolio has decreased, and the overall energy and carbon intensity
of the economy has declined. All of these changes in the U.S. energy system,
favorable to climate change mitigation, have occurred while the economy
has grown.
Although the progress made to date in transitioning toward a cleanenergy economy since 2009 presents only a portion of the Administration’s

482  |  Chapter 7

accomplishments in the clean energy and climate change space, the forwardlooking policies established by this Administration, as well as proposals for
further action, provide a pathway for the Nation to continue this transformation to a low-carbon economy that achieves future emissions reductions
goals. Some of the progress made during the Administration’s eight years
is due to policy and some from technological breakthroughs and changes
in natural gas production. To meet U.S. climate goals, it will be essential to
build on this progress by achieving the emissions reductions projected from
a number of policies that are just beginning to be implemented, and by taking further actions. The Administration’s significant investments in clean
energy research and development also help to ensure that the decreases in
carbon intensity and energy intensity analyzed here will continue over the
long run.
Finally, as climate change is global in nature, the 2015 Paris Agreement
provides a critical missing link between domestic and international climate
actions. Adopted by over 190 countries in December 2015, and officially
entering into force in November 2016, the Agreement is the most ambitious
climate change agreement in history, laying the foundation for a path to
keep the global temperature rise well below 2 degrees while pursuing efforts
to limit the increase even more. The United States set a goal of a 2025 emissions level in the range of 26 to 28 percent below 2005 emissions levels, and
the goals set forth in the President’s Climate Action Plan provide a path for
the United States to uphold this commitment. However, the work is not
finished. Continued efforts in upcoming years are critical to achieving these
goals and transitioning to an energy system that incorporates externalities
into energy production and consumption decisions, moving toward economically efficient outcomes that support the goal of global climate change
mitigation.

Appendix: Detail on Sectoral Emissions
Decomposition Analysis
In order to do the decomposition on a sector-by-sector basis, consider
that each of the four sectors contributes to a portion of GDP. To approximate a sector’s GDP contribution, each sector is matched to category in the
National Income Product Accounts (NIPA), with matchings below. Then,
the percent of GDP is calculated for each sector. To calculate 2008 baseline
projections, this observed contribution percent is multiplied by forecasts of
GDP made in 2008. This way, the difference between the actual versus the
baseline of sector GDP mirrors the difference between actual and projected
GDP. Performing this mapping for each sector allows for the same identity

sector decomposition.
The energy consumption and emissions included for each sector can
be found in EIA glossary and documentation materials for the Monthly
Energy Review (MER) Tables 2.1 and Tables 12.2 – 12.5.

Residential Sector
The account category used to approximate GDP contribution is
the category for “Housing and Utilities”, within Personal Consumption
Expenditure - Services - Household Consumption Expenditures.
Transportation Sector
The account category used to approximate GDP contribution is the
category “Transportation”, within Personal Consumption Expenditures Services - Household Consumption Expenditures.
Industrial Sector
The account category used to approximate GDP contribution is the
category “Goods”, within Personal Consumption Expenditures.
Commercial Sector

Activities of the Council of Economic Advisers During 2016  | 549

Report to the President
on the Activities of the
Council of Economic Advisers
During 2016
The Council of Economic Advisers was established by the Employment
Act of 1946 to provide the President with objective economic analysis and
advice on the development and implementation of a wide range of domestic
and international economic policy issues. The Council is governed by a
Chairman and two Members. The Chairman is appointed by the President
and confirmed by the United States Senate. The Members are appointed by
the President.

The Chairman of the Council
Jason Furman was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 1, 2013.
Prior to this role, Furman served as Assistant to the President for Economic
Policy and the Principal Deputy Director of the National Economic Council.
From 2007 to 2008, Furman was a Senior Fellow in Economic Studies
and Director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. Previously,
he served as a Staff Economist at the Council of Economic Advisers, a Special
Assistant to the President for Economic Policy at the National Economic
Council under President Clinton, and Senior Adviser to the Chief Economist
and Senior Vice President of the World Bank. Furman was the Economic
Policy Director for Obama for America. Furman has also served as Visiting
Scholar at New York University’s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service,
a visiting lecturer at Yale and Columbia Universities, and a Senior Fellow at
the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

The Members of the Council
Sandra E. Black was appointed by the President on August 10, 2015.
She is on leave from the University of Texas, Austin where she holds the
Audre and Bernard Rapoport Centennial Chair in Economics and Public
Affairs and is a Professor of Economics. Dr. Black received her B.A. from the

Activities of the Council of Economic Advisers During 2016  | 551

University of California, Berkeley and her Ph.D. in economics from Harvard
University.
Jay C. Shambaugh was appointed by the President on August 31, 2015.
He is on leave from George Washington University, where he is a Professor of
Economics and International Affairs. Dr. Shambaugh received a B.A. from
Yale, an M.A.L.D. from The Fletcher School at Tufts University, and a Ph.D.
in Economics from the University of California, Berkeley.

Areas of Activities
A central function of the Council is to advise the President on all
economic issues and developments. In the past year, as in previous years,
advising the President on policies to spur economic growth and job creation,
and evaluating the effects of these policies on the economy, have been
priorities.
The Council works closely with various government agencies,
including the National Economic Council, the Domestic Policy Council,
the Office of Management and Budget, White House senior staff, and other
officials to engage in discussions on numerous policy matters. In the area
of international economic policy, the Council coordinates with other units
of the White House, the Treasury Department, the State Department, the
Commerce Department, and the Federal Reserve.
Among the many economic policy areas that received attention in
2016, the Council focused in particular on: income inequality and inclusive
growth; the Affordable Care Act and health care costs; labor force participation; criminal justice policies and incarceration; innovation and competition,
including in the labor market; the minimum wage and unemployment
insurance; trade policies and the Trans Pacific Partnership; international
economics; financial system reform; energy and environment policies; and
higher education and college affordability.
The Council prepares for the President, the Vice President, and
the White House senior staff a daily economic briefing memo analyzing
current economic developments, almost-daily memos on key economic data
releases, and periodic memos on broader topics. The Council and its staff
also presents a monthly briefing on the state of the economy to senior White
House officials.
The Council, the Department of Treasury, and the Office of Management
and Budget—the Administration’s economic “troika”— are responsible for
producing the economic forecasts that underlie the Administration’s budget
proposals. The Council initiates the forecasting process twice each year,

552  |  Appendix A

consulting with a wide variety of outside sources, including leading privatesector forecasters and other government agencies.
The Council was an active participant in the trade policy process,
providing analysis and opinions on a range of trade-related issues involving
the enforcement of existing trade agreements, reviews of current U.S. trade
policies, and consideration of future policies. The Council also participated
on the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee, helping to examine the
ways in which exports may support economic growth in the years to come.
In the area of investment and security, the Council participated on the
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), reviewing
individual cases before the committee.
The Council is a leading participant in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD), an important forum for economic
cooperation among high-income industrial economies. The Council coordinated with other agencies to provide information for the OECD’s review of
the U.S. economy. Chairman Furman is chairman of the OECD’s Economic
Policy Committee, and Council Members and staff participate actively in
working-party meetings on macroeconomic policy and coordination and
contribute to the OECD’s research agenda.
The Council issued a wide range of reports and issue briefs in 2016.
In January, the Council commemorated the seven-year anniversary of the
Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act by releasing an issue brief on the gender pay
gap and progress made to ensure that women receive equal pay for equal
work. In February, the Council released a retrospective assessment of the
impact of the clean energy investments made in the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act.
In March, the Council released an issue brief on the digital divide
and the economic benefits of broadband access. The brief highlighted
the impacts that the Administration’s initiatives have had in dramatically
expanding access to the Internet for families and students, and reviewed
academic research that shows that Internet access leads to better labor
market outcomes. The Council also released a March issue brief on patent
litigation and its impact on innovation. The brief reviewed recent trends in
increasing levels of patent litigation, and the possible negative effect of these
suits on entrepreneurship and productivity growth. That same month, the
Council released new analysis on the impact of the Affordable Care Act six
years after passage. The analysis reviewed the substantial progress made on
health care coverage, costs, and quality.
In April, the Council released a report on the economic impacts of
incarceration and criminal justice policies. The report applied an economic
framework to policy questions related to criminal justice reform and found
Activities of the Council of Economic Advisers During 2016  | 553

that some criminal justice policies, such as increased incarceration, fail costbenefit tests. The report also highlighted that minority communities are
disproportionately impacted by interactions with the criminal justice system,
and these interactions can have long-run effects on individuals, families, and
communities. In addition, the Council released an issue brief on the benefits
of competition and indicators of market power. The issue brief highlighted
the economic benefits of competition for workers and firms and reviewed
several indicators that competition may be decreasing in the U.S. economy.
The Council released a June report on financial inclusion in the
United States, which highlighted the lack of access to safe and affordable
financial services for many low-income individuals. The report showed that
expanding access to traditional banking services for underbanked communities has positive economic impacts. That same month, the Council released
an extensive report on the long-term decline in the prime-age male labor
force participation rate. The report reviewed trends over the last 50 years of
declining labor force participation among working age men, and emphasized
the economic impact of this decline for both the macroeconomy as well
as individual families. The report reviewed various explanations for these
changes, as well as policy responses.
In June, the Council also focused on energy and environment policies,
issuing a report on prospects for integrating renewable energy sources into
the electric grid. The report emphasized the important transition toward
renewable generation in the United States, and the economics of integrating
these energy sources into electric grid operation. The Council also released a
report on the economics of coal leasing on Federal lands and reforms needed
to ensure that taxpayers receive a fair return.
In July, the Council released a report on investments in higher education and the state of student debt. This report highlighted the financial
benefits to individuals and the economy from higher education investments,
and evaluated recent trends in the level of education-related debt. The report
also highlighted the importance of the Administration’s policies to make
college affordable for American families and to protect students from lowquality academic institutions.
The Council published a report in August on the performance of
community banks over time, finding that, across many measures, community banks have remained strong since financial reform legislation was
passed in 2010. In October, the Council released an issue brief on the
economic progress of the Hispanic community over the past eight years,
focusing in particular on rising wages, declining poverty, and increased
health insurance coverage.

554  |  Appendix A

In October, the Council released a report on labor market monopsony,
or wage-setting power, including recent trends and policy responses. The
report highlighted the role that firm wage-setting power may have played
in the slow wage growth over recent decades and increasing inequality. In
November, the Council released an issue brief on trade policy and the industries and jobs at risk if the Trans Pacific Partnership does not pass.
Some of the analysis and findings of these reports can be found
throughout this Economic Report of the President. Additionally, over the
course of 2016, the Council published a series of reports examining the
Administration’s economic record and quantifying the impact of President
Obama’s economic policies. These reports included analysis of progress
reducing income inequality, economic benefits of health care reform, investments in higher education, the role of financial reform in strengthening the
financial system, and actions to address climate change. They are collected
and expanded upon in this Economic Report of the President.
All of the aforementioned reports can be found on the Council’s
website, archived at http://www.obamawhitehouse.gov/administration/eop/
cea/factsheets-reports.
The Council continued its efforts to improve the public’s understanding of economic developments and of the Administration’s economic
policies through briefings with the economic and financial press, speeches,
discussions with outside economists, and regular updates on major data
releases and postings of CEA’s reports on the White House and CEA blogs.
The Chairman and Members also regularly met to exchange views on the
economy with the Chairman and Members of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System.

Public Information
The Council’s annual Economic Report of the President is an important vehicle for presenting the Administration’s domestic and international
economic policies. It is available for purchase through the Government
Printing Office, and is viewable on the Internet at www.gpo.gov/erp.
The Council frequently prepared reports and blog posts in 2016,
and the Chairman and Members gave numerous public speeches. The
reports, posts and texts of speeches are available at the Council’s website,
archived at www.obamawhitehouse.gov/cea. Finally, the Council published
the monthly Economic Indicators, which is available online at www.gpo.gov/
economicindicators.

General Notes
Detail in these tables may not add to totals due to rounding.
Because of the formula used for calculating real gross domestic product
(GDP), the chained (2009) dollar estimates for the detailed components do
not add to the chained-dollar value of GDP or to any intermediate aggregate.
The Department of Commerce (Bureau of Economic Analysis) no longer
publishes chained-dollar estimates prior to 1999, except for selected series.
Because of the method used for seasonal adjustment, the sum or average of
seasonally adjusted monthly values generally will not equal annual totals
based on unadjusted values.
Unless otherwise noted, all dollar figures are in current dollars.
Symbols used:
p Preliminary.
	
	
... Not available (also, not applicable).
Data in these tables reflect revisions made by source agencies through
December 2, 2016, unless otherwise noted.
Excel versions of these tables are available at www.gpo.gov/erp.

1 Data on Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) basis include transportation and public utilities. Those on North American Industry Classification System
(NAICS) basis include transporation and warehousing. Utilities classified separately in NAICS (as shown beginning 1998).
2 SIC-based industry data use the 1987 SIC for data beginning in 1987 and the 1972 SIC for prior data. NAICS-based data use 2002 NAICS.
Note: Industry data on SIC basis and NAICS basis are not necessarily the same and are not strictly comparable.

1 Authorized by issuance of local building permits in permit-issuing places: 20,100 places beginning with 2014; 19,300 for 2004–2013; 19,000 for 1994–2003;
17,000 for 1984–93; 16,000 for 1978–83; and 14,000 for 1972–77.
2 Monthly data do not meet publication standards because tests for identifiable and stable seasonality do not meet reliability standards.
Note: One-unit estimates prior to 1999, for new housing units started and completed and for new houses sold, include an upward adjustment of 3.3 percent
to account for structures in permit-issuing areas that did not have permit authorization.

1 The term “family” refers to a group of two or more persons related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. Every family must include a
reference person.
2 Poverty thresholds are updated each year to reflect changes in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U).
3 Adjusted by consumer price index research series (CPI-U-RS).
4 Data for American Indians and Alaska natives, native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, and those reporting two or more races are included in the total
but not shown separately.
5 Reflects implementation of Census 2010-based population controls comparable to succeeding years.
6 The 2014 Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) included redesigned income questions, which were
implemented to a subsample of the 98,000 addresses using a probability split panel design. These 2013 data are based on the 2014 ASEC sample of 68,000
addresses that received income questions similar to those used in the 2013 ASEC and are consistent with data in earlier years.
7 These 2013 data are based on the 2014 ASEC sample of 30,000 addresses that received redesigned income questions and are consistent with data in later
years.
8 The CPS allows respondents to choose more than one race. Data shown are for “white alone, non-Hispanic,” “black alone,” and “Asian alone” race
categories. (“Black” is also “black or African American.”) Family race and Hispanic origin are based on the reference person.
Note: For details see Income and Poverty in the United States in publication Series P–60 on the CPS ASEC.

5 Beginning in 2000, data for agricultural employment are for agricultural and related industries; data for this series and for nonagricultural employment are
not strictly comparable with data for earlier years. Because of independent seasonal adjustment for these two series, monthly data will not add to total civilian
employment.
Note: Labor force data in Tables B–11 through B–13 are based on household interviews and usually relate to the calendar week that includes the 12th of
the month. Historical comparability is affected by revisions to population controls, changes in occupational and industry classification, and other changes to the
survey. In recent years, updated population controls have been introduced annually with the release of January data, so data are not strictly comparable with
earlier periods. Particularly notable changes were introduced for data in the years 1953, 1960, 1962, 1972, 1973, 1978, 1980, 1990, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000,
2003, 2008 and 2012. For definitions of terms, area samples used, historical comparability of the data, comparability with other series, etc., see Employment
and Earnings or concepts and methodology of the CPS at http://www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#concepts.

2 Yields on the more actively traded issues adjusted to constant maturities by the Department of the Treasury. The 30-year Treasury constant maturity series
was discontinued on February 18, 2002, and reintroduced on February 9, 2006.
3 Beginning with December 7, 2001, data for corporate Aaa series are industrial bonds only.
4 Effective rate (in the primary market) on conventional mortgages, reflecting fees and charges as well as contract rate and assuming, on the average,
repayment at end of 10 years. Rates beginning with January 1973 not strictly comparable with prior rates.
5 For monthly data, high and low for the period. Prime rate for 1947–1948 are ranges of the rate in effect during the period.
6 Primary credit replaced adjustment credit as the Federal Reserve’s principal discount window lending program effective January 9, 2003.
7 Beginning March 1, 2016, the daily effective federal funds rate is a volume-weighted median of transaction-level data collected from depository institutions
in the Report of Selected Money Market Rates (FR 2420). Between July 21, 1975 and February 29, 2016, the daily effective rate was a volume-weighted mean of
rates on brokered trades. Prior to that, the daily effective rate was the rate considered most representative of the day’s transactions, usually the one at which most
transactions occurred.
