ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT

To the Congress of the United States:
1970 was the year in which we paid for the excesses of 1966, 1967,
and 1968, when Federal spending went $40 billion beyond full employment revenues. But we are nearing the end of these payments, and 1971
will be a better year, leading to a good year in 1972—and to a new
steadiness of expansion in the years beyond.
We are facing the greatest economic test of the postwar era. It is a
test of our ability to root out inflation without consigning our free economy to the stagnation of unemployment. We will pass that test. But it is
a real test and we shall pass it only by doing all we are capable of
doing.
The key to economic policy in 1971 is orderly expansion. While continuing to reduce the rate of inflation, total spending and total output
should rise as rapidly as possible to lift the economy to full employment
and full production. Fiscal policy must play its full and responsible role,
and the economy's course in the year ahead will also reflect the extent
to which the monetary and credit needs of economic expansion are
met. With the stimulus and discipline from the budget that I have put
forward, and with the Federal Reserve System providing fully for the
monetary needs of the economy, we can look forward confidently to
vigorous and orderly expansion during 1971.
At the same time we must be relentless in our efforts toward the
greater stability of costs and prices that is the foundation for an enduring and full prosperity. Much has already been accomplished. Prices
in the market place have been rising less rapidly, and some that usually
change early have actually declined, responding to changing pressures
in the market.
In some cases the response of costs and prices has been slow, as the
result of insulation from market forces. Often these market problems
have been created by the Government itself. Accordingly, the Government has a responsibility to prevent misuses and imbalances of market
power which impede orderly operation of our free economic system.




This Administration intends to carry out that responsibility fully and
fairly.
To get the economy rising at the right rate, neither too rapidly nor too
slowly, is never an easy task. Economic policy does not operate with the
precision needed to keep the economy exactly on a narrow path. But
fortunately absolute precision is not required. What is required is that
we operate within a range where both unemployment and inflation are
moving unmistakably downward toward our goal. The full resources of
Government, with the understanding and cooperation of the citizens, can
accomplish that.
THE DUAL TRANSITION OF 1970
Faced with one of the largest inflations in American history we have
sought first to stop its rate from speeding up and then to get the rate
down. This has been done. The annual rate of increase of the consumer
price index, which was 6.0 percent from June 1969 to June 1970, dropped
to 4.6 percent in the last half of 1970. Wholesale prices, which usually
move before the prices consumers pay, have slowed down even more,
from a 5.3 percent rate in the first half of 1969 to a 2.1 percent rate in
the second half of 1970. Because productivity began to rise, after earlier
sluggishness, labor costs per unit of output rose much less in 1970 than
they did in 1969, and this contributed to slower price increases.
While the Nation was making the transition to a less inflationary
economy it was also making the transition to a lower level of defense
spending. Men released from the Armed Forces have been out of touch
with the civilian labor market and need time to readjust. Workers laid off
from defense production are likely to be concentrated in particular areas,
which are often not the areas where nondefense activity is expanding.
Their curtailed purchasing power further tends to lower employment of
others in their area. During 1970, the number of persons in military and
civilian employment for defense was reduced by about 1 million. Most of
these people have found work, and others will soon do so. But during the
transition many were unemployed, and their number added to the total
unemployment rate.
These two simultaneous transitions, from a wartime to a peacetime
economy and from a higher to a lower rate of inflation, would inevitably
be accompanied by some decline in output and rise in unemployment.
The aim of our policy was to keep the decline in output and the rise in
unemployment as small as possible.
Fiscal and monetary policy both became more expansive early in 1970,
in order to get output rising again while the cost of living slowed its
rise. This result was achieved. Total output declined only 1 percent from




its high reached in the third quarter of 1969 to the first quarter of 1970;
it leveled out in the second quarter and rose in the third. Fourth-quarter
output was held down by the auto strike; without it, another increase
would have been shown.
The timely shift of policy limited the decline of output; it also
helped counter the increase in unemployment caused by the dual transition. The average unemployment rate for the year was 4.9 percent. At
the end of the year, partly as a result of the auto strike, the unemployment rate was about 6 percent. About half of the unemployed had been
without work for less than 6 weeks. Most of the unemployed who had lost
their most recent job were receiving unemployment compensation.
THE ROAD TO ORDERLY EXPANSION
Our first task now must be to assure more rapid expansion and so to
reduce the unemployment rate. We are now in a position to do that, while
the progress against inflation continues. The restraint of 1969 and the
slowdown of 1970 have set in motion strenuous efforts at cost reduction.
These actions, as the pace of the economy quickens, will bear fruit in
better productivity and costs. Prices have begun to rise less rapidly. There
are the first faint signs of a retardation in wage increases in some sectors.
Much of the anti-inflationary effect of the 1970 slowdown still has to be
felt. And if the expansion is properly controlled in 1971 the conditions
for further slackening of the inflation rate will remain. The expectation
of continued rapid inflation has been weakened by the firm policies of the
past 2 years and we must strengthen this growing confidence in the future
value of money.
Forces now present in the economy, partly resulting from policies of
1970, make economic expansion in 1971 probable.
—The greater supply and lower cost of mortgage money has
stimulated a 40-percent increase in the rate at which construction of new houses is started.
—Improved financial conditions are leading to a strong increase
of State and local spending.
—Interest rates have dropped; the prime rate is down sharply
from its peak of 8 ^ percent.
—Consumers' after-tax incomes have increased and their saving has
been high.
—In the early part of 1971 the economy will get a boost as the
production lost during last year's auto strike is made up.
—Exports have been strong, and in 1970 were 14 percent above
those of a year earlier.




These are powerful upward pressures, but existing and foreseeable expansionary forces in the economy are not strong enough to assure that
output will rise as much as is desired and feasible. These forces must,
therefore, be supplemented by expansive fiscal and monetary policies.
The full employment budget that I have submitted will do its full
share in stimulating a solid expansion. Outlays will rise by $16/ 2 billion, or about ll/2 percent, between the current fiscal year and the next—
appropriate for orderly expansion, but far short of the inflationary 15
percent average annual increases from 1965 to 1968. In addition, receipts have been reduced $2.7 billion by the depreciation reform which
I have initiated to stimulate investment, jobs, and growth.
In fiscal 1971, the Federal Government will spend $212.8 billion,
which is equivalent to the revenues the economy would be generating at
full capacity. The actual deficit is expected to be $18/2 billion. In fiscal
1972, also, the planned expenditures are equivalent to the revenues we
would get at full employment. How big the actual deficit will be next year,
in fiscal 1972, will depend on economic conditions. If the economy follows
the expected path of a vigorous, noninflationary expansion, the deficit
will decline to $111/2 billion. This combination of deficits is appropriate
to the situation through which the economy has been passing. The budget
moved into deficit during calendar 1970 as the economy lagged below its
potential. Accepting this deficit helped to keep the decline in the economy moderate. It was a policy of not subjecting individuals and businesses to higher tax rates, and of not cutting back Federal spending,
when the economy is weak because such actions would have weakened
economic conditions further.
To say that deficits are appropriate in certain conditions is not to
say that deficits are always appropriate or that the size of the deficit is
ever a matter of indifference. Such a policy of free-for-all deficit financing
would be an invitation to inflation and to wasteful spending.
As I stated last June, we need to abide by a principle of budget policy
which permits flexibility in the budget and yet limits the inevitable
tendency to wasteful and inflationary action. The useful and realistic
principle of the full employment budget is that, except in emergencies,
expenditures should not exceed the revenues that the tax system would
yield when the economy is operating at full employment. The budget for
fiscal 1972 follows this principle.
Balancing the budget at full employment does not deny or conceal
the deficit that will exist this year and almost certainly next year. It does,
however, avoid large deficits when they would be inflationary, like
the swing to a big deficit in fiscal 1968. It means that even when the
economy is low we must not allow our expenditures to outrun the




revenue-producing capacity of the tax system, piling up the prospect of
dangerous deficits in the future when the economy is operating at a high
level. Moreover, to say that expenditures must not exceed the full employment revenues draws a clear line beyond which we must not raise the
budget unless we are willing to pay more taxes. This is an irreplaceable
test of the justification for spending. It keeps fiscal discipline at the center
of budget decisions.
Fiscal policy should do its share in promoting economic expansion, and
our proposed budget would do that. But fiscal policy cannot undertake
the responsibility of doing by itself everything needed for economic
expansion in the near future. To try to do that would drive taxes and
expenditures off the course that is needed for the longer run. The task
of economic stabilization must be accomplished by a concert of economic
policies. The combined use of these policies, starting near the beginning of 1969, finally checked the accelerating inflation that had kept the
economy overheated for years. A turn of fiscal and monetary policies in
a more expansive direction at the beginning of 1970 limited the economic
decline and initiated an upturn. Concerted policies of expansion are
needed now to lift the economy fast enough to make rapid progress
toward full employment, and these needs will be fully met.
PRICE STABILITY AND FULL PROSPERITY
In a fundamental sense, as I have always emphasized, the control of
inflation and the achievement of full employment are mutually supporting, not conflicting, goals. Nothing would contribute more to the new
expansion than confidence that the threat of inflation is fading. As part
of my program of expansion I propose to justify that confidence.
The basic conditions to bring about a simultaneous reduction of un' employment and inflation are coming into being. We are going to continue to slow down the rate of inflation in the middle of an orderly
expansion. And we are going to do it by relying upon free markets and
strengthening them, not by suppressing them. Free prices and wages are
the heart of our economic system; we should not stop them from working
even to cure an inflationary fever. I do not intend to impose wage and
price controls which would substitute new, growing and more vexatious
problems for the problems of inflation. Neither do I intend to rely upon
an elaborate facade that seems to be wage and price control but is not.
Instead, I intend to use all the effective and legitimate powers of
Government to unleash and strengthen those forces of the free market
that hold prices down. This is a policy of action, but not a policy of action
for action's sake.




The process of reducing inflation is a process of learning. Business and
labor must learn a pattern of behavior different from the one they have
learned and practiced during the inflationary boom. Labor contracts and
price lists cannot embody the expectation that prices will continue rising
at the peak rates of recent years. Businesses cannot expect to pass all cost
increases along in higher prices. The ritual of periodic increases in prices
has no place in an economy moving toward greater stability.
These lessons are being learned. Most of all they are being taught by
the facts of economic life today. Consumers are already imposing stern
discipline in markets where sellers have not begun to adapt their pricing
to the new, less-inflationary conditions of the economy.
But there are cases where these lessons are not being learned and
actions have been taken or are under review. In those cases the Government will act to correct the conditions which give rise to excessive price
and wage increases.
Actions were taken to augment the supply of lumber, and to deal with
domestic copper prices that were out of line with world markets. To
restrain increases in the price of crude oil, this Administration took steps
to permit greater production on Federal offshore leases and to increase
oil imports. Faced with inflationary price increases for some steel products, I have ordered a review of the conditions which permit or cause
such increases, and threaten jobs in steel-using industries.
We have been particularly concerned with increases in the costs of
construction. It is now more critical than ever to check inflationary
wage and price increases in an industry where unemployment is high.
The 1972 Budget provides for a large increase in construction expenditures. This should support increased employment in construction, but
will do so only if the larger appropriations are not eaten up by higher
wages and other costs. I have asked the leaders of labor unions and
contractors in the industry to propose a plan for bringing the behavior
of construction wages, costs, and prices into line with the requirements
of national economic policy. A workable voluntary plan will avert the
need for Government action.
Those of us who value the free market system most cannot disregard
the cases where it is being kept from working well. In some of these cases
it is Government which limits the free market's effectiveness and Government has the means to make it work better. We must constantly review
our economic institutions to see where the competitive market mechanism that has served us so well can replace restrictive arrangements
originally introduced in response to conditions that no longer exist.
We must also devise efficient solutions to problems that have become
more urgent recently, such as those of pollution and adequate health




8

care. Where inadequate market arrangements are delaying our advance
toward full employment with price stability, we have a responsibility
now to correct them.
In our market-oriented policy, our domestic goals and our international goals are interrelated. Success in our struggle against inflation will help to safeguard our international economic strength, and
allow our highly productive enterprises and workers to compete in world
j markets. The liberal policy with respect to international trade to which
this Administration is committed will help keep price increases in check
here while giving our farms, factories, and banks a profitable market
abroad. At the same time we have to make sure that the burden of adjustment to changing conditions in world markets does not fall entirely
on a few exposed industries.
With the cooperation of the private sector, an expansionary public
economic policy will achieve a goal we have not seen in the American
economy in many years: full prosperity without war, full prosperity
without inflation.
In the record of progress toward that new prosperity, I am convinced
that economic historians of the future will regard 1970 as a necessarily
difficult year of turnaround—but a year that set the stage for strong and
orderly expansion.

A Quarter Century of the Employment Act
of 1946
MEET TO CONSIDER what I profoundly believe to be as important a proposal as any before the Congress within my memory."
With these words Senator Wagner of New York, on July 30, 1945, convened
the subcommittee of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee to begin
hearings on S. 380, "The Full Employment Act of 1945." In February 1946,
a quarter of a century ago this month, President Truman signed into law
the "Employment Act of 1946." The 25th anniversary of that Act provides
a useful opportunity to look at the road that we have been traveling and
where we may be going.
The Employment Act of 1946 made two major contributions to the
management of economic policy. Section 2 explicitly declares the objectives
of national economic policy, the most familiar passage of that section
being the last eight words: "to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power." More than a hundred other words in this
one-sentence statement concern national economic objectives and they are
all important. Economic programs and policies, for example, are to be consistent with "other essential considerations of national policy" and all are to
be carried out by means "calculated to foster and promote free competitive
enterprise and the general welfare. . . ." While the closing words are the
most widely quoted of Section 2, the framers of the Act did not ignore the
complex nature of our economic objectives and the fact that we must strive
for an optimum balance among competing objectives, since the single-minded
pursuit of one would inevitably mean sacrifices elsewhere.
The Employment Act of 1946 also provided for some additions to the
structure and activities of Government. It created the Joint Economic
Committee of the Congress as well as the Council of Economic Advisers
in the Executive Office of the President. During the quarter of a century
that this structure has been in operation, 58 Members of the Senate and
House (including the present Committee members) have served on the
Joint Economic Committee. Mr. Patman of Texas, alternating Chairman of
the Committee, played a major role and was floor manager for the bill in
the House; and Senator Fulbright of Arkansas, a present member of the
Joint Economic Committee, was a member of Senator Wagner's subcommittee that conducted the initial hearings. Two of the present members
have served on the Joint Economic Committee since its inception. During




19

this period 25 of the Nation's economists have served as Members of the
Council of Economic Advisers under five Presidents. There have been eight
Chairmen of the Council, five of whom had previously served as Members.
Have this structure and the operations that have evolved within it made
any significant impact on policy? Considering their nature, this is a reasonable question. The Joint Economic Committee does not have legislative
functions: proposed legislation that deals with the building blocks of economic policy is handled by other committees of the Congress. The Council of Economic Advisers is one of the smallest agencies in the Federal
Government. It advises; it does not manage. On almost any issue of economic policy another senior official of the Administration will have immediate responsibilities—the Secretary of the Treasury for taxes, the Secretary of Agriculture for farm policy, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget for expenditure policy.
Even so the Joint Economic Committee and the Council of Economic
Advisers have clearly influenced Government policy. To some extent this
result was planned by those who framed the Act. They did not leave entirely to chance and the evolution of experience the responsibilities for
implementing Section 2. They also added Sections 3, 4, and 5, which set
up some quite explicit responsibilities. They call, for example, on the President to transmit each year an economic report that sets forth such matters as
current and foreseeable trends in employment, production, and purchasing power and outlines a program for carrying out the policy declared in
Section 2. They direct the Council, among other things, "to appraise the
various programs and activities of the Federal Government in the light of
the policy declared in Section 2 for the purpose of determining the extent
to which such programs and activities are contributing, and the extent
to which they are not contributing, to the achievement of such policy and
to make recommendations to the President with respect thereto. . . ." They
call on the Joint Economic Committee to make a continuing study of programs and their coordination and to report to the Congress. And the Act
calls for cooperation among all groups in our society in attaining these
objectives.
Within this general framework a substantial complex of activities has
emerged. For one thing the Joint Economic Committee has come to be one
of the major, ongoing, national seminars on economic policy. Witnesses at
its hearings include Government officials, a wide range of scholars from the
universities, leaders of unions and businesses, and students of economic policy
from abroad. The membership of this Committee includes chairmen and
senior members of major legislative committees; and the published Proceedings of Hearings and other Committee publications have had a marked
influence on national thinking about public policy and have increased the
understanding in government and public circles of the problems and issues
of economic policy and economic performance.




20

The Council of Economic Advisers has also had a pervasive influence
in shaping policy. Through it the discipline of economic thinking has been
introduced at a level where it directly affects decisions. While Government
agencies have long had economists, the Council of Economic Advisers is an
agency in which economists are the principals. Though small, it reports directly to the President. And having no particular constituency it can look
at the broader public interest. The Council assists in the preparation of the
President's Economic Report, which has become the major statement
of national economic developments, programs, and policies. The requirement to submit an annual economic report subjects the Administration to
the discipline of specifying its targets and appraising the adequacy of its
policies for reaching the targets.
Have the results of efforts by these two bodies shown up in the performance of the economy during this quarter of a century? In employment the
performance has been reasonably good. The unemployment rate during
the past 25 years has averaged 4.6 percent, and the highest yearly rate was
6.8 percent in 1958. In the 25 years before the war, ending with 1940, the
average unemployment rate was 10.9 percent, and its peak was 24.9 percent
in 1933. This 25-year period includes the Great Depression, however, which
dominates the record. If we look at the quarter of a century before the
Great Depression, ending with 1929, the average was 4.7 percent, the
highest unemployment rate was 11.7 percent in 1921, and in three other
years (1908, 1914, and 1915) the 1958 rate was exceeded. This suggests
that we have not appreciably reduced the incidence of small departures
from maximum employment but that we have reduced the incidence of
large departures, which is just what one would expect aggregate economic
policy to be able to do.
During the quarter of a century since World War II, the goods and
services made available to each consumer increased by 62 percent in real
terms, and our stock of productive capital has increased by close to $800
billion (in 1970 prices). In the quarter of a century ending with 1929 the
per capita output of goods and services produced grew about 50 percent,
somewhat below our postwar performance.
A recurring question throughout these years has been whether the Employment Act of 1946 has caused an imbalance in our management of
economic policy by lessening the attention paid to price stability. While
Section 2 recognizes that "other essential considerations of national policy"
must be weighed, there is no explicit recognition of a stable price level as
an objective of economic policy. It is clear both from policies and statements about policies that all Administrations have considered a reasonably
stable price level to be an important objective of policy, and such stability
is one of the concerns implicitly expressed in the Employment Act of 1946.
Indeed, it is clear from early comments that the Congress interpreted "maximum purchasing power" to involve concern about inflation.




21

During most of the first 20 years of the Act this question about the role
of the price level in the objectives of national economic policy had a certain leisurely and academic quality. The basic trend of the price level was
moderately upward. Between 1948, the time that prices established a new
plateau, and 1965 the consumer price index rose 31 percent. Over one-half
of this rise, however, is accounted for by two 2-year surges in the price
level—one from 1950 to 1952, and a second from 1956 to 1958. And one of
these surges could be attributed to the large rise in defense outlays incident
to the Korean conflict. Apart from these, the price level was performing in
a reasonably quiescent manner.
Concern about the price level as a consideration in the objectives and
management of economic policy has come into sharper focus and taken
on a new sense of urgency with the rise in prices since 1965. While the
inflation was clearly set off by excessively expansive fiscal and monetary
policies, its persistence as the overheating of the economy subsided has
raised urgent questions. Can a free economy have a reasonably stable price
level with its productive resources fully utilized? Has the concentration on
"maximum employment, production, and purchasing power," as specified
in the Employment Act, caused a bias in our policies that leaves us exposed to a sustained deterioration in the purchasing power of the dollar?
Have new institutional structures and forces come into play that keep driving the price-cost level upward regardless of the state of the economy?
This much seems clear: The Employment Act of 1946, and the concerns that gave rise to its passage, moved the quality of our economic
performance to a higher place on the Nation's agenda. The Act provided
a flexible and general statement of what our economic activity ought to do
for us. The structures that it called for have evolved and adjusted to changing circumstances and problems. Our most urgent task, as we move into
the second quarter century of the Employment Act of 1946, is twofold:
to find ways of keeping the Nation consistently concerned about the problems raised by experience with inflation since 1965, and, with full regard for
the requirements of a free economy and a free society, to develop new policies
and programs needed to meet this national concern. We can be confident
that this twofold task will be performed.




CHAPTER 1

The Record of 1970
1 Q 1 C\ W A S T H E Y E A R w h e n P o l i c i e s o f restraint initiated earlier
A +J I VJ to curb the long inflation had their first major effects on the
economy. It was also the year when a large part of the transition from
a wartime level of defense spending to a peacetime level was accomplished.
Alongside these major forces were others that visibly affected the shape of
the year. A long upsurge of business investment in plant and equipment came
to an end and a strong rise in residential construction began. The stock
market experienced one of its most severe declines in 40 years, one of the largest corporations in the country went into reorganization, and there was a 10week strike of an even larger industrial corporation, whose products account
directly and indirectly for about IV2 percent of the total national output.
The primary goal of anti-inflation policy in 1970 was to limit the decline
of output that had been initiated by earlier restrictive measures and then to
get output rising again in the second half. The increase of output that was
desired was an amount sufficient to keep the rise of unemployment moderate
but not so large as to prevent progress toward a lower inflation rate. The
primary instruments for achieving this goal were monetary and fiscal
policies aimed at influencing the rate of increase of the total demand for
goods and services. Three requirements of the policy were important. First,
policy should turn in an expansive direction early in the year. The turn
in policy from its earlier restrictiveness would not affect the behavior of the
economy immediately. To make sure the economy was rising again in the
second half of 1970, the policy change would have to come well before
that. Second, the combined fiscal and monetary stimulus should be sufficient to assure the desired rate of expansion in the economy. Third, both
policies—fiscal and monetary—should become moderately expansive. A combination of a highly expansive fiscal policy and a restrictive monetary policy
(or in principle a highly expansive monetary policy and a restrictive fiscal
policy, although this combination was not in prospect in early 1970) was not
wanted, partly because it was not certain that primary reliance on either
alone could be counted on to yield the desired overall results.
These requirements of policy were all met. The change in monetary policy
was reflected in two decisions of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, first on January 15, 1970, and then more decisively on February 10.




23

The stock of money (currency plus demand deposits), which had increased
at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the second half of 1969, rose at the rate of
about 5J/2 percent during 1970 (Chart 1). In the Federal Reserve policy
of 1970 more attention than formerly was paid to achieving a specified
rate of growth of money and credit and less was paid to achieving predetermined conditions in money markets. By and large the Federal Reserve
was able to achieve its overall targets despite the necessity to act quickly
from time to time to prevent disorderly conditions in credit markets.
The sequence from monetary tightness in 1969, which slowed down the
economy and reduced the demand for credit, to the easier monetary
policy of 1970, which increased the supply of credit, produced a dramatic
decline of interest rates. Short-term rates declined by about 3 percentage
points from their peaks reached at the end of 1969. Long-term rates surged
upward in May and June during the period when the demand for liquidity
was at a maximum because of uncertainties in both foreign and domestic
affairs, but thereafter they declined substantially, particularly in November
and December.
Fiscal policy also changed sharply in-1970. The net budget position in the
national income accounts shifted from a surplus of $9 billion in calendar
1969 to a deficit of $11 billion in 1970. Most of this $20 billion swing was the
result of the lower level of the economy in 1970 than in 1969, measured
against a full employment path. If the economy had been at full employment
in both years there would have been a surplus, but it would have declined
by $5 billion. (See the appendix to this chapter, "Measures of Changes in
Fiscal Policy.") Most of the shift in the budget position occurred after the
first quarter of the year (Table 1).
Expenditures increased about $15 billion, a decline of $2 billion in defense
purchases being much more than offset by an increase in other categories.

The increase in expenditures included $1 billion more for unemployment
compensation because of higher unemployment rates. Receipts declined by
about $5 billion. Expiration of the surcharge in two steps reduced revenues
by $8.3 biliion, and other tax changes during 1970 cut them by $0.6 billion.
Because of the slowdown of the economy only a small part of this reduction
was offset by expansion of the tax base.
A shift in the budget position in 1970 that would have eliminated the
large surplus of 1969 was implicit in the Administration's plans at the
beginning of the year.* This was due partly to the projected path of the
economy below full employment and partly to the combined effect of changes
in expenditures and taxes. The actual shift, which ended in a substantial
deficit, exceeded the plan, however, one reason being lower economic activity
than projected and the other being unplanned expenditure increases.
The Administration's position was to accept the deficit resulting from the
economic slowdown as an aid to limiting the slowdown. It also accepted
some moderate expenditure increases beyond its budget. However, it
strongly resisted program expansions which would substantially raise commitments for expenditures beyond 1970.
The policies of 1969 and 1970 were intended to achieve at first a slowdown in the rate of increase of money demand and then a moderate revival of that rate. This general pattern was accomplished. The increase of
rnoney GNP, which had been running at an annual rate of about 7^4 percent in the first three quarters of 1969, subsided to about half of that in the
fourth quarter of 1969 and in the first quarter of 1970. The rate then
increased to about 5 percent in the second quarter and to a little over
6 percent in the third. The fourth-quarter picture is obscured by the great
effect of the auto strike, but with a minimum allowance made for that
factor it would seem likely that underlying demand increased at an annual
rate of about 7 percent in the fourth quarter.
This early revival of the growth of demand limited the decline of real
output. From its peak in the third quarter of 1969 to the first quarter of 1970,
real GNP fell by 1 percent (at an annual rate of 2 percent). After stabilizing in the second quarter it rose in the third, almost regaining its previous
peak. The Council estimates that real output in the fourth quarter, instead
of decreasing, would have increased at least as rapidly as in the third if it
had not been for the strike. From 1969 to 1970, total output declined by
about one-half of 1 percent.
In the early part of the slowdown employment was well maintained, as
employers held on to labor against the possibility that a tight labor market
might soon return. By early 1970, however, with sales sluggish and profits
weak, businesses were making intensive efforts to reduce payrolls in order
to cut costs. Together with an extraordinary rise in the labor force, this
development boosted the unemployment rate from 3.5 percent in December
*The above statement refers to the national income accounts for calendar 1970.
On a unified budget basis small surpluses were planned for both fiscal 1970 and
fiscal 1971.




26

to 5.0 percent in May. Thereafter the rate leveled off for some months but
began to rise again in the latter part of the year, partly under the influence
of the auto strike, until it reached around 6.0 percent in December.
In some degree, though it cannot be measured precisely, the rise of unemployment was aggravated by the 1.1 million reduction in defense employment during the year, of which about 0.6 million occurred in the private
sector. Unemployment between jobs may be longer than average for persons
released from defense production, because of their geographic location, the
specialized nature of their skills, and their above-average incomes, when
employed. Moreover, given the slowdown in the rise of money demand, there
would probably have been more restraining effect on prices and less reduction
of output and employment, if the reduction of demand had been less heavily
concentrated in defense industries.
The purpose of the policy of restraint, which had as one consequence the
reduction of output and employment, was to stop the rate of inflation from
accelerating and to slow it down. Many signs now show that this is being
accomplished. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of increase of the consumer price index, which had been 5.9 percent in the second half of 1969 and
6.0 percent in the first half of 1970, was 4.6 percent from June to November.
Wholesale prices, after a 4.2 percent rise in the second half of 1969, rose at
the rate of 2.6 percent in the first half of 1970 and 2.1 percent in the second
half of 1970. Although 1970 brought only a faint sign of abatement in the
rate of increase of wages, the reduction in overtime reduced costs per hour of
work, and productivity rose more rapidly in 1970 than in 1969. Labor costs
per unit of output therefore rose more slowly.
The policies of .1969 and 1970 set a ceiling to the mounting inflation and
turned the inflation down; they set a floor to declining output and turned it
upward. The strongest American inflation in over a century, aside from
periods of major war, was countered by deliberate acts of policy; another
change of policy checked the accompanying decline in the real economy
before it had gone far.
Although total output declined slightly from 1969 to 1970, this decline
was less than the decrease in production for defense; the output devoted to
nondefense purposes increased. The real per capita disposable income of
persons (that is, after allowing for changes in both taxes and prices) reached
a record high in 1970. Real compensation per hour of work increased by 1.1
percent over 1969, a little more than the increase in real output per hour.
Real personal consumption expenditures for the year were 2 percent above
those for 1969. The increase in the real per capita disposable incomes of
persons was made possible in part by the cuts in defense. These cuts also
contributed to the rise in unemployment. But at its 1970 peak aiound
the end of the year, while the influence of the General Motors strike was still
being felt, the rise of the unemployment rate had not been as large as in
earlier transitions from inflation and war. At the end of the year, about
half the unemployed had been out of work for less than 6 weeks.

The performance of the economy disappointed many expectations
and intentions, including those of this Council. Aggregate demand in money
terms and real output were lower than expected, while the rate of inflation
and the unemployment rate were higher (Chart 2). The momentum
of rising costs and prices, a legacy of the long inflation, proved to be extremely
powerful. The continuing rise of prices and wages creates the main uncertainties for economic policy in 1971. It is the inflation that has prevented an
all-out attack on unemployment and that contains the possibility of frustrating the recovery policies which are being adopted.
Some people have been hurt in the transition to a lower level of defense
expenditure. Some have suffered the hardship of unemployment. Others
have experienced shorter hours, or loss of profits. The entire economy has
been hit by inflation. These hardships are the price that is now being paid for
the earlier inflationary boom. The memory of this price should stay with us
as economic policy is made in the future.
DEMAND PATTERNS
The part played by the principal components of demand in the slowdown
and initial phase of revival is best seen in the period from the third quarter
of 1969 to the third quarter of 1970. The results for the fourth quarter of
1970 are so influenced by the temporary supply constraint caused by the auto
strike that they yield little reliable evidence on the trend of demand either in

the aggregate or by sectors. We shall return later, however, to the interpretation of the fourth quarter, because it is important as the starting point for
1971. Here we shall concentrate on the less uncertain picture presented by
the period through the third quarter of 1970 (Table 2).
Total demand, as measured by total expenditures for gross national
product, increased much less in the year ending in the third quarter of 1970
than in the same period a year earlier—$42.9 billion as compared to $66.8
billion. The slower increase, or decline, of four categories of demand—Federal purchases, change in business inventories, residential structures, and
business fixed investment—amounted to more than the total slowdown. The
total of the other categories—personal consumption, net exports, and State
and local purchases—rose a little more in the later period than in the earlier
one.
Expenditures rose more from the first to the third quarter of 1970 than
they did over the preceding two quarters. Changing rates of inventory
accumulation were mainly responsible for this shift. In part, the changing
pattern of demand—from 1969 to 1970 and in 1970—reflected thefiscaland
monetary policies of the time. The decline of Federal defense purchases
continued, but tax reductions and increases in transfer payments helped
to sustain consumer spending when earned income was weak. Monetary
ease helped promote the flow of funds into savings institutions and thus
supported the turnaround in housing. An increase of Federal grants-in-aid
to the States helped to keep State and local purchases growing fairly steadily
despite the economic slowdown.
CONSUMER INCOME AND SPENDING
Consumer spending rose about as much from the third quarter of 1969
to the third quarter of 1970 as in the preceding four-quarter period despite




the sluggish economy (Table 2). It constituted an important force sustaining
aggregate demand early in the year when the economy was contracting, and
it contributed to the recovery. This pattern of consumption resulted from
fiscal measures that buttressed consumer disposable income in 1970 against
forces of contraction as well as from the automatic stabilizing influence
of the tax system.
With little change in real output and employment during 1970, private
wages and salaries, the largest component of income, rose much less rapidly
from the third quarter of 1969 to the third quarter of 1970 than in the year
before—4.6 percent as compared to 9.8 percent (Table 3). Government payrolls, however, continued to rise rapidly notwithstanding cutbacks in the size
of the Armed Forces. Part of the slowdown in private payrolls was offset by
the rise in State unemployment insurance benefits, but there was also a large
expansion in Social Security benefits in the spring. Corporations maintained
dividend payments in the face of a pronounced decline in profits, a practice
evident in earlier periods of slowdown. All told, the increase in personal
income came to 6.5 percent as compared to the 8.7 percent rise during the
preceding year.
The decline in personal taxes affected after-tax disposable income even
more than did the rise in transfers. After increasing over $15 billion from the
third quarter of 1968 to the third quarter of 1969, personal taxes declined
more than $3 billion in the same period a year later/Reductions in taxes,
amounting to $10 billion, more than offset the moderate rise that would have
occurred at 1969 rates. Disposable income during the later period rose substantially^ 8.2 percent compared to 7.6 percent over the preceding period.
Only part of the fiscal stimulus created in 1970 was translated into an

increase in consumer spending during the year, the shortfall from expectations
being most pronounced after the midyear. This is best seen in the saving rate,
which rose in the second quarter to a level that has occurred in the past but
that must be judged high by historical standards. The rate was maintained
in the third quarter. The rise in the second quarter came mainly from the
lagged response of consumers to the large increase in income caused by the
statutory rise in Social Security benefits and the Federal pay raise, both of
which included payments retroactive to the first of the year. The severe
decline in the stock market in May might have been a contributing factor,
although it is of interest that, despite the decline in consumer net worth that
this implied, purchases of automobiles were higher in the second quarter
than in the first. But by the third quarter consumers had clearly become
cautious, since with incomes no longer rising rapidly, some decline in the
saving rate might reasonably have been expected.
Sometimes shifts in the saving rate are a reflection of shifts in consumption
patterns. Table 4 provides alternative measures of the saving rate, obtained
by adding to the saving rate either all consumer purchases of durable goods
or consumer purchases of autos and parts (as a percentage of income).
Although sluggish demand for automobiles affected the saving rate in the
first quarter, it does not explain the continued high rate through the third.
The method of adding all consumer durables to the saving rate makes it clear
that saving was indeed high in the second and third, quarters. The data,
which are still preliminary, suggest that consumers may have shifted purchases to nondurables in the strike-affected fourth quarter.

BUSINESS FIXED INVESTMENT
The policies of restraint pursued in 1969 and their effects on the cost and
availability of financing played an important role in bringing the long boom
in capital investment almost to a halt during 1970. After rising 12 percent
from calendar 1968 to 1969, nonresidential fixed investment increased only
3 percent, less than the rise in the index of plant and equipment costs.
Businessmen scaled back by a few percentage points the plans that had been
reported early in the year in surveys of investment intentions; this was a
somewhat larger shortfall from plans than occurred in 1968 and 1969.
The effects of the general slowdown on investment were quite varied. In
some industries like electric utilities and communications, which increased
their outlays by substantial amounts, the response was slight, the need for
additional facilities having been accentuated by service breakdowns in some
areas. To a considerable extent these industries, which enjoy strong growth
trends, tend to budget their capital outlays over long periods. Since they are
regulated noncompetitive industries facing inelastic demands, they also have
the ability to pass on high interest costs in the form of higher rates, once
authority has been granted by regulatory commissions. The strength of
investment in these industries and increased spending by the airlines were
important in offsetting the more common response—either a decline in
investment outlays or a much smaller rise than that of the preceding year.
Sharp drops in profits, relatively low operating rates, high interest costs,
and other financing difficulties brought decreases in the amounts spent
by manufacturing companies and railroads, whose spending patterns tend
to be more sensitive to business conditions. The decline in corporate profits
after taxes was pronounced—8J/2 percent from 1969—and was especially severe in the first and fourth quarters, when automobile output was
depressed. In addition, the termination of the investment tax credit probably
had a general dampening effect on investment outlays.
Demand for new plant and equipment was not strong but appeared to
be holding up at a high level as the year progressed. Appropriations by
manufacturers, which had fallen in the fourth quarter of 1969 and the
first quarter of 1970, leveled out in the second quarter and rose in the third.
The results of the surveys of businessmen's spending intentions for 1971
pointed to small increases in current dollar outlays and small decreases in
real terms. In view of such adverse developments as the stock market decline
and the Penn Central problems in May and June and the automobile strike
after mid-September, these indicators of business investment decisions made
in the second half of 1970 suggest that business confidence held up reasonably well.




INVENTORY INVESTMENT
Businessmen pursued cautious inventory policies in 1970; for the year
as a whole they added $5 billion less to their stocks than they had in
1969. The most significant fact about inventory behavior was the quarterly
pattern and its effect on movements in GNP. The more rapid rise in GNP
from the first to the third quarter of 1970 as compared to the preceding
half-year reflected a shift in inventory investment. In the earlier period the
rate of inventory accumulation declined, subtracting from the change in
GNP, while in the latter period an increase in the rate of accumulation
added to the rise in GNP.
The year started with stocks somewhat high in relation to sales or output
mainly because of the slowdown in sales late in 1969. However, it was expected that businessmen would make a gradual reduction in their inventory investment, rather than an abrupt change, because for much of 1969
they had been expecting a slowdown in business to follow the Administration's announced intention of cooling off the economy.
Early in the year, however, investment in stocks was slashed, from an
annual rate of $11 billion in the third quarter of 1969 to $1/2 billion in the
first quarter of 1970. Indeed, this sharp decrease explains much of the
weakness in the economy early in the year. A good part of the decline came
from the automobile industry, where a softening in auto demand led to a
severe reduction in output. In addition, work-in-process inventories in the
aerospace industry were reduced as companies increased their deliveries
and were forced to cut back on new work. Automobiles and aircraft together
accounted for about $6 billion of the $10-billion decline in inventory accumulation. The recovery of the auto industry in the spring and summer was
one reason for the somewhat higher rates of accumulation in the second and
third quarters.
HOUSING
Nowhere have the effects of policies been more visible in the past 2 years
than in homebuilding, where 1970 brought substantial recovery after the
sharp decline of 1969. The year began with private housing starts at the low
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.25 million units in the first quarter,
down from a high of 1.64 million in the first quarter of 1969. By the fourth
quarter, however, starts had exceeded that earlier peak. The increased
availability of funds for mortgages, which will be described later in this
report, was the driving force for this turnaround.
The total of 1.43 million units started in calendar 1970 represented a 3percent decrease from the number of starts in 1969. Expenditures, however,
fell 8 percent in the face of a 5-percent increase in the index of housing costs.
The decrease reflected a decline in the average value of single-family starts,
the first in many years. New homes were apparently smaller in floor area
and had fewer of the amenities associated with housing quality.
This decline in the average quality of single-family houses, which started




33

before 1970, has been influenced heavily by changes in costs. From 1969
to 1970 wage rates in construction rose 9.2 percent. With productivity gains
small, most of these exceptionally large adjustments were reflected in higher
building costs. Land prices and property taxes have also been increasing
persistently. And yields on new FHA home mortgages reached 9.29 percent
in March 1970, 130 basis points higher than the yield a year earlier, although
by December the figure had fallen to 8.90 percent.
The rising costs of home ownership have been dramatic in recent years.
The average home built in 1965 with FHA financing obligated the buyer to
$118 per month in mortgage payments. In 1970, for a house of the same
size, the corresponding figure was $212, an increase of 80 percent at a time
when median family incomes rose about 45 percent. Because of higher costs,
however, the average size of the home sold in 1970 was smaller than its
counterpart in 1967, 1968, and 1969. An increase in the proportion of houses
financed with Federal subsidies also contributed to a reduction in the average value of houses built in 1970, because the subsidies go to smaller and
cheaper houses.

STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PURCHASES
State and local government purchases, which have been rising steadily for
many years, continued to increase at a rapid rate and were an important
sustaining force in 1970. The 9-percent rise in such purchases was a little less
than that of the year before despite a faster rise in prices. Most of the slowdown reflected the difficulties that States and localities experienced in
financing their construction projects, except for federally aided highways,
in 1969 and early 1970.
With expenditures continuing to rise very rapidly, employment by State
and local governments rose almost 5 percent over the average level in 1969, a
somewhat faster rate than the year before but about 1 percent less than
the average annual percentage increase in the period from 1964 to 1968. The
rise in wage and salary rates was especially large last year. At the same time
strikes by State and local government employees, as in the last few years,
were a much more common occurrence.
THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1970
According to preliminary estimates, GNP in the fourth quarter of 1970
rose at an annual rate of about 2 percent, compared to the 6 percent rate
of increase in the third quarter. During 2 months of the fourth quarter
the motor vehicle plants of General Motors Corporation were closed
down as the result of a work stoppage. The basic demand for output was
clearly rising but was kept from expressing itself in purchases by
the strike. Although the question cannot be answered precisely, it is useful
to estimate the rate at which the underlying demand was actually rising.
WTe could then judge better how well the expansive policies initiated earlier




34

were working and also have a better base for appraising the prospects for
the economy as 1971 begins.
Those components of demand where the strike impact was either nonexistent or not large on balance—private construction, purchases by Federal,
State, and local governments, and net exports—as a group rose about as
much in the fourth quarter as in the third. Consumer purchases of nondurable goods, which were indirectly affected by the loss of income resulting
from the strike, nonetheless rose more in the fourth quarter than in either
the second or third. Declines were pronounced, however, in those sectors
affected by the strike—consumer durable goods expenditures and producers' durable equipment. In aggregate, inventory investment declined
by about $ l / 2 billion, as a severe reduction in auto stocks offset increased
accumulation in other industries.
A partial notion of the strike's impact on GNP may be obtained from
gross auto product (the value of automobile production and distribution),
which declined $12 billion from the third to the fourth quarter. GNP,
excluding automobiles, rose $17J/s> billion over the same period (Table 5).
The decline in auto GNP in the fourth quarter does not tell everything
of the strike's impact. It ignores the effect on truck production. Furthermore with so large a loss in output there must have been substantial multiplier effects (which may well have started even before the strike) as workers
cut back on their consumption, particularly their purchases of durable
goods, in the face of drastic cuts in income. Then too, because of the uncertain length of the strike, some businessmen may have adopted conservative buying policies while the strike was still on. On the other hand, strike
benefits helped to hold up income, and dissaving helped to support the
consumption of workers affected. Two other developments may have mitigated the negative impact of the strike. One is the possibility that suppliers
accumulated more stocks of parts and supplies than would have occurred
in the absence of the strike. And it is possible that some consumers, unable
to buy their new cars, purchased other things.
A minimum estimate of the strike's impact may be put at approximately
$14 billion. This is based on an estimate that domestic automobile output
would have been at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8 million units (as

allowance for lost truck production minus some offset for suppliers' inventories. The total impact on GNP was greater than these effects but because
of difficulties in estimation a specific figure is not presented. On this basis
GNP in the fourth quarter would have been $1,005 billion. This would
represent a rise over the third quarter amounting to 7 percent at an annual
rate.

OUTPUT, EMPLOYMENT, AND UNEMPLOYMENT
Between 1969 and 1970, when the value of output rose by 4.9 percent,
prices rose 5.3 percent and real output fell by 0.4 percent. Without
the automobile strike, which began in mid-September, real output for the
full year would probably have been slightly higher in 1970 than in 1969. Real
output declined from the third quarter of 1969 to the first quarter of 1970
by about 2 percent (annual rate), leveled out in the second quarter, and then
rose slightly in the third and decreased in the fourth. If the strike had not
occurred, the annual rate of increase in output in the third quarter would
have been about 1 percent greater, while in the fourth quarter the rate of
rise would have been in the neighborhood of 2-3 percent.
From the third quarter of 1969 to the third quarter of 1970 real output
declined by one-half of 1 percent (without strike adjustment). Since Federal purchases, mainly for defense, declined significantly, total real output
available for non-Federal use rose by 0.8 percent. The latter reflected a
rise in real expenditures of consumers, net exports, and State and local government purchases that more than offset a decline in real private investment
(Table 6). Looked at another way, the decline in output was concentrated

in construction and in durable commodities, mainly motor vehicles. Output
of nondurable goods and services was up slightly.
EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT
The decline of output that began toward the end of 1969 did not immediately affect total employment. Indeed, the rise in employment (as estimated
from the household survey) from the fourth quarter of 1969 to the first
quarter of 1970 was at a rate only moderately less than it was during 1969,
a year of considerable employment expansion. Although manufacturers had
begun to cut their employment in the fourth quarter, nonmanufacturing
firms continued to increase theirs. Experience with labor shortages for several years, when the economy was operating above its potential, probably led
many employers to take on workers as they were available and to postpone
laying off workers until the slackening in demand was clearly not temporary.
Hours of work were reduced, however, a trend that had been in progress
during most of 1969.
The first-quarter rise in employment proved to be short lived. The output
decline, coming at a time when payrolls were increasing because of rapidly
rising wage rates, led to a pronounced increase in unit labor costs and a
sharp decrease in profits. Employers began examining their costs much
more carefully and took measures to reduce them or at least to hold down
their rise. After declining in the spring quarter, employment (household
basis) leveled out after midyear. Manufacturing employment declined
through the year, nonmanufacturing employment was about unchanged,
and government employment rose. The average level of employment in
1970 increased by only 0.7 million workers over 1969, the smallest rise since
1961 and roughly half of the normal growth in the labor force.
With real output declining or rising very little, unemployment rose in
each quarter of 1970. The unemployment rate increased sharply in the first
half of the year, rising from 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 1969 to 4.1
percent in the first quarter and 4.8 percent in the second. The rate of increase
diminished somewhat in the summer months but speeded up again in the
final quarter to a rate of 5.8 percent (Chart 3). The 4.9-percent rate for
the full year was the highest since 1964, and represented an average of 4.1
million persons out of work.
Last year's rise in unemployment was greater than had been anticipated
in most projections, including that of the Council. Explanations for the
large rise in unemployment are found in the behavior of the labor supply
and production costs. The civilian labor force increased by 1.9 million
workers from the final quarter of 1969 to the corresponding 1970 quarter.
This was less than the 2.4-million increase over the preceding 4 quarters,
but it was larger than the average of the 1960's.
One special circumstance that contributed to the large increase in the
civilian labor force was the reduction in the Armed Forces. During 1970,
400,000 persons left the armed services, and most of them entered the labor

force. The change in selection procedures for drafting young men may also
have contributed to the very large increase in the number of adult men
entering the labor force during the year. Although adult women and teenagers entered the labor force in smaller numbers during 1970 than during
1969, the increases were not markedly lower than in other recent years.
There is little evidence, therefore, that the increased difficulty which workers
experienced in finding jobs in 1970 led to a significant withdrawal from the
labor force; it has apparently shown up almost entirely in increased
unemployment.
The first-quarter rise in the labor force was especially large—3.7 million
persons at an annual rate. The reduction in the Armed Forces may have
contributed to the rise, as noted above, but in addition women and teenagers
continued to enter the labor force in large numbers at a time when labor
demand, although still strong, had begun to slacken. The slower rise in the
civilian labor force after the first quarter was more nearly in line with the
experience of the 1960's.
The other explanation for the large unemployment increase would appear
to be related to the rapid increase in wage rates and the very poor performance of productivity in 1969, and to attempts by businessmen to compensate
for this cost increase in 1970. From mid-1968 to mid-1969, for example,
output per man-hour in the private nonfarm sector showed no growth
whatever. This was a period when demand was still very high and the




38

economy was operating well above its potential. Demand for labor was
intense. The unemployment rate for all persons averaged less than 3.5 percent, and the rate for married men 1.5 percent, the lowest since the Korean
war. This was a period of rapid employment growth for women and teenagers who lacked experience and whose productivity tended to be below
average. Labor turnover was also very high and absenteeism common.
The situation started to change in the fall of 1969 when policies of restraint
began to make themselves felt. Crosscurrents began to appear. In manufacturing, hiring slowed down and layoffs started to increase. Output declined
in the fourth quarter of 1969 and fell more in the first quarter of 1970. The
sharp decrease in productivity in the first quarter of 1970 reflected the usual
practice among employers of retaining workers in the face of falling output;
the decline in output per hour was not markedly different from the decreases
that accompanied other downturns. Employment increased in nonmanufacturing industries.
The situation changed much more after the first quarter as businessmen
stepped up their efforts to cut their costs. It was natural that operations had
become inefficient after the long period of expansion, and a correction of the
excesses of the past was clearly going to take more than a month or two.
Moreover, the increase in wage rates showed little evidence of receding. The
attempt to cut labor costs by letting workers go was a reversal of the practice
followed for several years, when employers had difficulty in attracting and
keeping productive, experienced workers. In the second quarter, productivity
rose at an annual rate of 3.9 percent, and in the third quarter the gain was
4.5 percent. In the fourth quarter, however, productivity declined as a result
of the strike.
Characteristics of the Unemployed
The increased unemployment in 1970 was not accompanied by a marked
lengthening in the duration of unemployment, although there was a strong
trend in that direction during the year. The median duration of unemployment increased from 4.3 weeks in 1969 to 4.8 weeks in 1970; over half
those unemployed were unemployed for less than 5 weeks. In fact, fewrer
than half those unemployed in an average month in 1970 were unemployed
in the following month. The reason for this is that persons who have been
unemployed for a relatively long period have a higher probability of remaining unemployed in succeeding weeks than persons who have only recently
become unemployed. The median duration of completed spells of unemployment is much shorter than the median duration pertaining to persons unemployed at any given time. Although net additions to employment totalled only
0.7 million, there was a great deal of flux in the labor market; in an average
month at least 2 million workers were taken off the unemployment rolls,
and a slightly larger number of persons newly searching for jobs were added.
The relative increase in unemployment among adult men was more than
twice that for adult women and teenagers. As a result, the unemployment




39

rate for adult men, which had decreased year by year starting in 1962, increased substantially, from 2.1 to 3.5 percent. The rate for married men rose
from 1.5 to 2.6 percent. The rate for persons of Negro and other races increased from 6.4 to 8.2 percent but remained significantly below its historical
relationship of twice the rate for whites (Table 7). Long-term unemployment (15 weeks and over) increased from 0.5 percent to 0.8 percent of the
labor force.

The unemployment rate for young persons 16 to 21 years old increased
in 1970, for those both in school and out of school (Table 8). Unemployment
rates for young persons are typically high because many of them are new
entrants into the labor force and are looking for short-term and part-time
jobs. For example, about 85 percent of those unemployed and in school were
looking for only part-time work. Although the fraction of the young people
in the labor force who were unemployed was high (13.3 percent), particularly for those in school, the fraction of all young people who were unemployed and not in school during the year was relatively low.
Recent changes in unemployment are better seen in a comparison of the
third quarter of 1970 with the third quarter of 1969, since this approach
minimizes distortions associated with the auto strike in the fourth quarter.
Unemployment was 1.4 million higher in the third quarter of 1970 than
for the same quarter of 1969, and the rate increased from 3.6 to 5.2 percent.
Among the 4.3 million persons unemployed in the third quarter of 1970,
a total of 1.9 million had lost their previous jobs, whereas only 575,000 had
quit the job they had last held. State-insured unemployment totaled
2.0 million in the third quarter of 1970. Thus, most unemployed workers

who had lost their most recent job apparently were covered by unemployment insurance programs.
Both the average number unemployed and the rates of unemployment increased more for blue-collar than for white-collar workers (Table 9). Within
both these occupational categories there was a tendency for the relative
increases in unemployment and unemployment rates to be larger among the
more highly skilled. Among white-collar occupations, professional, technical,
and manage rial workers were more sharply affected than sales and clerical
workers; and among blue-collar wrorkers, relatively more craftsmen and
operatives became unemployed than laborers. In part, the explanation lies
in the declines in employment related to defense and aerospace, since a larger
proportion of highly skilled workers were employed in defense and aerospace
jobs than in the rest of the economy. Service occupations are less cyclically
sensitive and their unemployment consequently increased less than for other
occupations.
Among industries, experienced workers in manufacturing had the largest
increases in unemployment, although the relative increase in construction
was also substantial. About 40 percent of the increase in unemployment during the year was in manufacturing and two-thirds of this was in durable
goods. The concentration of increased unemployment in durable goods
manufacturing reflects the combined effect of reduced defense and space
procurement and the slowdown in demand generally.

DEFENSE SPENDING AND EMPLOYMENT
De-escalation of the Vietnam war and changes in our general purpose
force planning have led to a significant reduction in the resources used for
national defense. By the third quarter of 1970 defense purchases had declined by $11.4 billion (measured in 1958 prices using the Federal Government purchases deflator), or 18 percent, from its recent peak in the second
quarter of 1968. Over the same period total GNP in 1958 prices increased by
$22.0 billion. An additional $33.4 billion of real output, therefore, became
available for nondefense uses as the combined result of economic growth and
the redirection of resources away from defense.
Consumers, whose real expenditures rose by $31.2 billion, were the major
beneficiaries of this change. Also, State and local government purchases
increased by $5.0 billion, and net exports by $1.6 billion. The main off-




42

setting decline occurred in gross private investment ($3.0 billion), where
a $2.0 billion increase in fixed investment was accompanied by a drop of
$4.9 billion in investment in business inventories. A decline of $1.5 billion
also occurred in Federal nondefense purchases.
The reduction in defense spending was itself related to the general program
of restraint to reduce inflation. The overall program of restraint, however,
permitted continued growth in some sectors of the economy, primarily the
sectors producing goods and services for personal consumption, and at the
same time reduced resources used to produce defense goods and services.
National economic policies were aimed at two objectives simultaneously,
namely, a reduction in inflation and a redirection of resources from defense
to nondefense uses.
Each of these transitions could have been more easily accomplished if
it had not been necessary at the same time to effect the other. If the past
and current inflation had not been in the picture it would have been
possible safely to maintain more expansionist pressures in the economy and
the labor market; resources released from defense uses could have been
more quickly redeployed to new uses; and workers affected by defense cutbacks would have found it easier to obtain new jobs. On the other hand, the
program of fiscal restraint would have had more effect on prices and less
on unemployment if the restraint had been more generally spread over the
economy, because the required job shift would have been smaller and the
downward pressure on prices of nondefense output greater. A large fraction of the reduction in demand occurred in sectors of the economy producing defense products, with little direct effect on the prices of most interest
to consumers. A significant cutback in any large sector of the economy, particularly one that is geographically concentrated, is likely to result in a disproportionate amount of transitional unemployment relative to its effect on
the general price level.
Employment Attributable to Defense Expenditures
Employment attributable to Department of Defense expenditures will
have decreased nearly 1.8 million workers from its highest recent
level in fiscal year 1968 to fiscal 1971 (Table 10). Most of the drop is in
private employment attributable to defense expenditures, which is estimated
to decline by 1.3 million workers over the period. A reduction in the Armed
Forces accounts for much of the rest of the decrease.
The estimates of average employment for fiscal years indicate that the
largest reductions in defense employment took place during calendar years
1969 and 1970, and the decline was most pronounced during 1970. The
number of persons in the Armed Forces was reduced about 400,000 during 1970, and civilian employment for the Department of Defense declined
by nearly an additional 100,000 during the year. Private employment may
have been reduced by approximately 600,000 during the year. All told, there

was an estimated decline of 1.1 million jobs attributable to Department of
Defense expenditures during 1970.
Defense-Related Private Employment
Private employment generated by defense spending is diffused over a
broad range of industries and occupations. About two-thirds of the private
employment generated by defense spending, however, has been in the manufacturing sector, although this sector accounts for about one-third of the
private nonagricultural employment of wage and salary workers. Within
manufacturing, employment attributable to defense spending has been most
heavily concentrated in ordnance and aircraft. It was also concentrated
among relatively skilled workers. A remarkably high proportion of workers
in certain jobs calling for extremely specialized skills have been dependent on
defense spending.
Estimates of private employment attributable to defense spending have
been constructed for fiscal year 1965, just prior to the increase in Vietnam
spending, and for fiscal year 1968, when private employment generated by
defense spending reached its peak. Estimates of increases in private employment attributable to increased defense spending occurring during the
Vietnam buildup are shown for selected industries in Table 11 along with the
changes in employment in these industries that have occurred since 1968.
The two industries where defense generated the highest share of total
employment were ordnance and accessories and aircraft and parts. Both
industries, but particularly the aircraft and parts industry, employed large
numbers of workers in supplying defense products. Defense employment was
also relatively high in the manufacture of machine shop products, radios,
television and communication products, electronic components and accessories, and other transportation equipment. Although a large number of
workers were employed in transportation and warehousing services, the
industry was not heavily dependent on defense even in 1968.
Employment attributable to the increase in defense expenditures during
the Vietnam buildup was generally concentrated in those industries already

employing large numbers of defense workers. Aircraft, ordnance, and transportation together accounted for about 40 percent of the additional defenserelated employment generated by the Vietnam buildup. These industries
have consequently been most strongly affected by the cutbacks in defense
spending occasioned by the withdrawal.
As shown in Table 11, manufacturing employment declined by 2.5 percent from the third quarter of 1968 to the third quarter of 1970, while
total private wage and salary employment in nonagricultural industries increased by 3.0 percent. Most of the decline occurred in those manufacturing
industries where a significant part of the employment was attributable to increased defense spending during the Vietnam buildup. Over half the decline
in manufacturing employment occurred in the ordnance and aircraft industries, precisely those where employment attributable to Vietnam spending
was particularly high.
Workers producing goods and services for defense are generally more
skilled than the civilian labor force as a whole. Among white-collar workers
a higher percentage of professional and managerial workers were employed
in defense-generated jobs than in the entire economy. Among bluecollar workers, craftsmen and operatives were also more strongly represented
in defense-generated employment (Table 12). The larger relative increases
in unemployment from the third quarter of 1969 to the third quarter of
1970 for more highly skilled white-collar and blue-collar workers were in

part a consequence of the sharp reduction in defense employment, in which
these workers were more heavily concentrated.
Skilled workers in certain categories, such as engineers, were heavily
dependent on defense spending for their employment (Table 13). The estimated unemployment rate for engineers increased from 0.5 percent in the
third quarter of 1968 to 2.4 percent in the third quarter of 1970. Nearly 60
percent of all the jobs for aeronautical engineers were generated by defense
spending in 1968. Nearly 40 percent of all physicists were dependent
on defense spending. A large number of airplane mechanics were employed
in defense-related work, and over 50 percent of the skilled workers in this
category relied on defense spending.
The geographic concentration of defense-related employment (Table 14)
has also been an important factor in the uneven impact on the economy of

reduced defense spending. Major declines in demand for defense production
have, of course, directly reduced the jobs available in affected areas and
often prompted specialized workers to look for new employment in other
locations. The multiplier effects applicable to areas with significant reductions in defense employment have further reduced demand in those areas
for a wide range of economic activities.

Employment attributable to defense spending is most heavily concentrated in the Pacific Coast States and New England. Military procurement,
the major category of defense spending that grew most rapidly from fiscal
year 1965 to 1968 during the Vietnam buildup and also accounted for twothirds of the decline in budget outlays from fiscal 1969 to 1971, appears
to be even more highly concentrated geographically. In recent years prime
contracts for military procurement awarded to firms based in California accounted for nearly 20 percent of the total value of all contracts. In fiscal
year 1970, firms based in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New
York, and Texas received almost 50 percent of the total value of prime
contract awards for procurement. Actual production work may of course
take place in other States; these data indicate only where most of the final
processing and assembly occurs.
State-insured unemployment in California, Connecticut, and Massachusetts showed larger than average increases from the third quarter of 1969 to
the third quarter of 1970—about 2 percentage points compared to 1.4
for the Nation as a whole. In contrast, State-insured unemployment rose by
only 1.3 percentage points in New York, and 0.7 percentage points in Texas.
The increases in New York and Texas may have been smaller than average because the relative impact of defense cutbacks was small in both
States, but of course other factors are also at work. In the State of Washington, for example, insured unemployment increased by 5.7 percentage
points as a result of declines not only in military procurement but also in
the demand for civilian aircraft and lumber. Michigan also experienced a
relatively large increase of 2.6 percentage points in insured unemployment




47

during the year, because production of consumer durables and autos is
heavily concentrated there.
Nearly 35 percent of reported reductions in defense-related employment
occurred in California (Table 14), disproportionately affecting the jobs of
scientists and engineers in the aerospace industry in Southern California.
Several other States experienced significant shares of the reduction in defenserelated manufacturing employment, but the other reductions in employment
were in general smaller and less concentrated geographically than in California. Local labor market adjustment problems were experienced by many
communities throughout the Nation, of course, where firms producing defense
products were a major source of employment in the locality.
To assist in the adjustment of communities seriously affected by defense
cutbacks, the President on March 4, 1970, set up an Interagency Economic
Adjustment Committee under the chairmanship of the Secretary of Defense.
The Committee brings together two kinds of agencies. One group has economic adjustment itself as a primary function; this includes the Manpower
Administration of the Department of Labor, the Economic Development
Administration, the Small Business Administration, the Department of Agriculture, and the Council of Economic Advisers. The other group carries on
functions that significantly affect the location of economic activity although
this effect may not be the main purpose; this includes the Departments of
Interior, Health, Education, and Welfare, Housing and Urban Development,
and Transportation, as well as the General Services Administration. The
Department of Defense, drawing upon its long experience with base-closings
and similar problems, provides leadership as well as other resources.
The fundamental purpose in the Committee's approach is to assure that
all the services and facilities of the Federal Government are available to the
affected communities. Although the Committee provides general guidance
and support, its work is carried on by task forces organized for each community being served. The task force visits the community and assists the
local leaders, whose initiative is indispensable, to prepare a plan for action.
Heavy emphasis is placed on the involvement of the private sector in the
community leadership structure and the execution of the economic adjustment plan. The plan would be tailored to the local situation; there is no
common blueprint. Each plan would attempt to mobilize private, municipal,
State, and Federal resources to create an economic base which will utilize
the local labor and capital. The Federal contribution to the combined effort,
in addition to advice, may include economic and engineering surveys, public
facilities grants, small business loans, surplus real property, and funds for
manpower training programs, as well as Federal expenditures to carry out
a variety of programs. Not all of this help is available or would be useful in
each case. Moreover, some hardships and dislocations are unavoidable as
cutbacks are made in areas where defense employment has been a large part
of the total. However, the Committee's operations have served in a number
of cases to ease the transition from defense-related industry.




PRICES AND WAGES
The purpose of slowing down the rise in demand from 1969 to 1970
was to moderate the rise of prices. On this subject two things can be said.
First, the evidence for the year suggests that the purpose is being achieved:
the rate of inflation is subsiding and the impact upon different prices and
costs is approximately in line with what might have been expected. Prices,
first of raw materials and then of finished goods, began rising less rapidly;
and wages of unorganized workers also began to rise more slowly, although
the rate of increase for organized workers has not yet shown this change.
Second, the process of disinflation during the year, given the degree of economic slack that has existed, has been disappointingly slow.
PRICES, COSTS, WAGES, AND PRODUCTIVITY
The rate of inflation for the most comprehensive price measure, the GNP
deflator, reached a peak in the first quarter of 1970; in the next three
quarters it recorded smaller rates of increase than in the first (Table 15).
The difference is accentuated by the fact that the first-quarter index includes
a Federal Government pay raise, which had the effect of adding 1.2 percentage points to the annual rate of increase in that quarter. The movement
of the deflator within the year was slightly upward in the third quarter and
sharply upward in the fourth, but these changes are mainly a reflection of
the auto strike, given the nature of the deflator.
The deflator employs current period weights and is sensitive to shifts in
output toward or away from goods and services whose prices have risen
much more or much less than the average since the index base period
(1958). The price of new automobiles has risen much less than average
since 1958, and the overall deflator is greatly influenced by shifts in auto
production. This is brought out clearly in Table 15, which shows the deTABLE 15.—Changes in GNP deflators {total and excluding autos) and in real gross auto

flator, the deflator calculated by excluding auto GNP (column 2), and the
associated movement in real auto GNP (column 3).
A partial solution to this problem is provided by the use of base period
weighted indexes, which is the method used to construct conventional
indexes like the consumer price index and wholesale price index. It is not an
ideal solution mainly because weights may become outdated as relative prices
and buying habits change. For such a purpose the Commerce Department
has calculated three alternative measures of total price change that use base
period weights; for two of these alternatives the weights are fixed (columns
2 and 3 of Table 16). All three of the alternatives show a retardation of the
price rise as compared to the first quarter, but in varying degrees. Two of the
three show an acceleration from the third to the fourth quarter.
Although it is helpful to look at prices for the whole economy a better
picture is obtained by looking at the private nonfarm sector, where some of
the relationships among prices, costs, and wages may be seen. When this is
done for the past 2 years or so it is apparent that both the rate of price increases and the rate of wage increases have been fairly stable (Table 17).
However, the rate of increase of productivity improved markedly after the
first quarter of 1970 and correspondingly reduced the rate of increase of unit
labor costs. During the earlier quarters, the rapid rise of unit labor costs was
absorbed in a reduction of other components of price, essentially in profits
per unit. As unit labor costs slowed down, profits per unit recovered somewhat later but they remained exceptionally low.
More cost detail is available for the nonfinancial corporate sector. Here
too it may be seen that a slower rise in unit labor costs from the first to the
third quarter was not matched by a slower rise in prices. All nonlabor costs
taken together continued to rise very rapidly, even though the pace was
somewhat less than it had been over the preceding half year. Profits per unit

rose moderately as businessmen attempted to bolster margins that had been
squeezed badly in the preceding half year and had declined the year before.
Even with the rise in the second and third quarters of 1970, unit profits were
lower than at any time since 1961, except for early 1970.
CONSUMER PRICES
The consumer price index increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 5.6 percent from the end of 1969 to November 1970 after a 6.1-percent
rise during 1969; the latter was the largest increase since 1947. There was
little evidence of a slowdown in the first half of 1970, when the total index
rose at an annual rate of 6.0 percent; but from June to November the rate of
advance eased to 4.6 percent (Table 18 and Chart 4). Sharply reduced rates
of increase for food and more moderate reductions in the rise of service prices
accounted for the general deceleration from June to November. Because
services carry a larger weight than food in the CPI, the slowdown in the total
CPI from the first to the second half of 1970 was influenced more by services,
with its lesser slowdown, than by food, with its sharp deceleration. Prices of
nonfood commodities showed about the same rate of increase in both periods.
Prices of services continued to rise much more rapidly than average in
1970 but slowed down from a 9.2 percent annual rate of increase in the
first half to 7.1 percent in the second. Most of the broad categories of services showed a similar pattern. The most pronounced slowdown, although
rates were very high to begin with, occurred in household services excluding
rent, where as a result of easing in credit markets interest rates leveled out
after very sharp increases in the first half (mortgage interest rates are in-

eluded in the service section of the CPI). Cuts in conventional mortgage
rates in late 1970 are already being reflected in the CPI, but the reduction,
announced in early December, in the maximum permissible rates on VA
and FHA mortgages will not be apparent until January and February,
respectively.
Perhaps the greatest disappointment on the price front has been the behavior of nonfood commodities, which in the past have typically responded
with a lag to a weakening in demand. In the second half of 1969, for example, there was some suggestion that this pattern would be repeated, since
prices rose at a distinctly slower pace than was evident in the first half of that
year. However, the rate of inflation in this category accelerated in the first
half of 1970 to 4.6 percent and failed to slow down in the second, at least
through November.
The most pronounced acceleration was evident for new cars. Car prices
failed to show the usual discounts this past summer, apparently because
dealers expected a strike. In October and November, substantially higher
suggested retail prices on the 1971 models were announced by car manufacturers. The BLS index for new cars in November showed a 5-percent
rise over a year earlier, the largest such gain in over 10 years.

An acceleration of price increases was also evident in apparel, where demand has not been strong and where competitive markets are the rule. The
failure of these prices to slow down would support the cost-push explanation of price behavior unless what we now see is only the prelude to a very
slow response to the weakening in demand. Prices of fuel oil and coal and
gasoline also rose more rapidly in the second half.
Retail food prices continued to increase in the first quarter of 1970 after
having risen sharply in the final quarter of 1969. Although the rise from
March to November was only 1 percent at an annual rate some decline
might have been expected in view of falling farm prices. Two conditions
explain the fact that food prices did not fall. First, about 60 percent of the
final costs of food are accounted for by the spread between farm prices and
the retail prices of food purchased for home consumption. In 1969 this
spread rose 1.9 percent, somewhat more than in previous years. But in the
third quarter of 1970 the spread broadened substantially to 7.1 percent above
the spread in the same period a year earlier. The spread normally widens
when farm prices are falling and narrows, at least temporarily, when farm
prices are rising. In part, the sharp gains in 1970 reflect the acceleration of
the increases in wages and other processing and marketing costs that have
resulted from the inflation of the late 1960's. The second factor was the
continuing rapid rise in the prices of food eaten away from home, a reflection
of substantial increases in restaurant operating costs.
WHOLESALE PRICES—INDUSTRIAL
Wholesale prices rose 2.3 percent from December 1969 to December
1970 after a 4.7-percent rise during 1969. The pronounced slowdown was
mainly a reflection of the easing of upward pressures on prices of farm
products and foods, which had led the inflationary surge in 1969. The slowdown in the rise of industrial products was much smaller—from 3.9
to 3.6 percent. The deceleration of the WPI within 1970 was mainly a reflection of industrial prices, which advanced at a 3.8 percent annual rate
from December to June and at a 3.4 percent rate from June to December
(Table 19 and Chart 5).
Prices of several industrial categories either declined or rose more slowly
in the second half than in the first—textiles, paper, metals, furniture, and
nonmetallic mineral products—and for some of those that accelerated, such
as hides and rubber, the rate of inflation from June to December was not
high. Prices of metals and metal products declined in the second half after
rising at a 10-percent rate from the beginning of 1969 to mid-19 70. The
falling world market for copper and other nonferrous metals was a major
factor in this development. Prices of ferrous and nonferrous scrap dropped
late in the year. Prices of iron and steel mill products rose little after midyear
following exceptionally large increases in the first half.
Prices of three important groups showed accelerated increases during
1970—fuel, transportation equipment, and machinery and equipment. A

variety of supply problems, discussed in Chapter 4, was mainly responsible
for substantial rises of spot prices of coal, coke, petroleum, and gas. Electric
power rates quickly responded to these increased costs of primary energy
with the largest increases in many years. Rising costs, chiefly of labor, in the
face of sluggish demand were the key factors in the accelerated rise in
equipment prices.
FARM PRICES
Prices received by farmers reached high levels in early 1970, after a rise
that began late in 1968. Reduced supplies of livestock commodities, particularly of eggs and hogs, accounted for much of the increase. Fruit and vegetable prices also rose substantially, but field crop prices were relatively stable
in the early part of 1970. As a whole, farm prices were 8J4 percent higher
in the first quarter of 1970 than in the first quarter of 1969.
Beginning in April, farm prices started a downward path, and by October
they were lower than a year earlier. Prices of livestock led the declines. A
sharp increase in supplies of hogs in the third and fourth quarters continued
the downward pressure on livestock prices.
Crop prices followed a pattern just the reverse of livestock. After sta-

bilizing in the first quarter, crop prices were stronger through the remainder
of the year. To some extent the rise in these prices was a consequence of
Federal cropland adjustment programs, which had diverted substantial
acreage from production in the past 2 years, and the large stocks of commodities built up earlier were thus somewhat diminished. In addition, export
demand, particularly for wheat and soybeans, was strong during the year.
But the most important influence was an unexpected loss of 15 percent of
the anticipated corn crop because of poor weather in the western corn belt
and a new strain of corn leaf blight, which spread from the South into several
major States in the corn belt.
Higher crop prices in the second half of 1970 were more than offset by
declining livestock prices, so that farm prices as a group declined through
the year. Because prices were relatively high early in 1970, however, the
1970 average exceeded that of 1969 and indeed was the highest since the
peaks of 1951-52.
WAGES AND COMPENSATION
The large wage increases that have become common in recent years continued with few exceptions in 1970. Compensation per hour in the
private economy increased by 7.1 percent in 1970, showing little change from
the 7.2-percent rate of increase in 1969. Although increases in average gross
hourly earnings (Table 20) were smaller in 1970 than in 1969 in all industries except contract construction and wholesale trade, most of this
slowdown appears to have been due to reductions in overtime and to relative
and absolute declines in employment in high-wage industries. Large numTABLE 20.—Increases in average gross hourly earnings of private nonagricultural production

bers of relatively high-wage automobile workers were, of course, off the
payroll during the General Motors strike and their omission accentuated the
apparent slowdown in average earnings. Moreover, quarterly data show that
in most industries hourly earnings were rising more rapidly in the second
half of the year than in the first.
Wage increases negotiated under major collective bargaining agreements
continued to accelerate in 1970. Median first-year increases in wages and
benefits were 12.4 percent compared to 10.9 percent in 1969 and 8.1 percent
in 1968 (Table 21). Median increases averaged over the life of the contract
were 8.8 percent in 1970, indicating the continuation of "front-end loading"
of collective bargaining agreements.
Reports of large wage increases in individual collective bargaining agreements can give a misleading view of wage and compensation changes in the
entire economy. Although the collective bargaining calendar was heavy in
1970, only about 6 percent of the civilian labor force was involved in major
collective bargaining settlements during 1970, that is, settlements involving
1,000 or more employees. Furthermore, the size of settlements and the pattern
of increases during the past few years have varied widely among industries.

1970, averaged 8.5 percent (mean). Quarterly increases in negotiated firstyear wage adjustments in manufacturing have shown no acceleration since
the second quarter of 1969. During the same period, mean first-year wage
adjustments in nonmanufacturing rose substantially, from 10.7 to 15.1
percent.
Wage rate increases in nonmanufacturing industries accelerated much
more rapidly than those in manufacturing (Table 21), mainly because of
the large settlements in contract construction and trucking. First-year wage
increases in construction were 15.7 percent in the first 9 months of 1970; increases over the life of the contract were 13.4 percent. As shown in Table
22, over 50 percent of the construction workers affected by these settlements received first-year wage increases of 15 percent or more, compared to
only 5 percent of similarly affected manufacturing workers.
The contrast between the rate of increase in wages in manufacturing and
the rate in nonmanufacturing is also evident in the deferred wage adjustments that go into effect in 1971. Deferred increases averaged 4.9 percent in
manufacturing, as compared to 10.8 percent in nonmanufacturing and 13.3
percent in construction.
Changes in overall wage rates reflect both the proportion of workers receiving increases and the size of the increases they receive. Although new
wage increases for nonunion workers in manufacturing have been lower
than those for unionized workers since 1963, median increases in
overall (effective) wages for nonunion workers have exceeded those for
unionized workers in 4 out of 5 years ending with 1969. The prevalence of
long-term collective bargaining agreements in recent years has resulted in a

more sluggish response of overall wage changes of unionized workers to economic conditions, but the new increases they received were correspondingly
larger.
Agreements negotiated in the first 9 months of 1970 called for wage
increases for unionized workers in manufacturing that were higher than those
specified in agreements in the same period of 1969, and almost all workers
received some increase. For the nonunion sector, however, both the relative
number of workers receiving increases and the size of the increases they
received in 1970 were lower than in the first three quarters of 1969. Hence,
overall wage increases in the nonunion sector of manufacturing can be expected to show a significant slowdown for the year as a whole.
WHY IS THE INFLATION SO STUBBORN?
Even though there are now signs that the rate of inflation is subsiding,
it is certainly also true that the inflation has been and remains exceptionally persistent. Observation of previous inflationary experience, such as that
of 1955-57, suggests that, while the absolute level of prices is unlikely to fall,
the rate of increase of prices is likely to decline after a moderate lag as slack
in the economy emerges. More sophisticated econometric analysis of the relation between the behavior of prices and a large number of variables that
might help to explain it—such as the level and rates of change of unemployment, the gap between actual and potential output, past prices, and the
like—did not generally predict the rate of inflation experienced in 1970,
given the actual conditions in 1970.
Though the reasons for the stubbornness of the inflation in 1970 are not
fully clear, two main explanations are usually offered. One relates the persistence of the inflation, after corrective measures have been taken, to the
duration and magnitude of the preceding inflationary boom and to the historical context in which it occurred. The other would trace the cause to
structural changes in the economic system, especially but not exclusively connected with the concentration of economic power.
The first explanation relies heavily on the momentum built up by the
inflationary pressure which began in mid-1965 and continued well into
1969, although by then steps had been taken to curb it. This was already
a long inflation that had reached a rate not equaled since the first quarter
of 1951, and it generated a momentum exponentially greater than, although not qualitatively different from, that experienced earlier. The meaning of "momentum" can be illustrated by the behavior of wages. There
were in 1970 a large number of built-in wage increases—the second- and
third-year increases provided for by contracts negotiated in 1968 and
1969. Since these contracts had been negotiated in highly inflationary circumstances, the second- and third-year increases they provided were large,
larger than the corresponding increases of earlier years. Many new contracts negotiated in 1970 were successors to those that had been arranged in
1967, a year when demand was weak and some thought that the inflation




6o

might be ending. There was naturally great pressure in the new 1970 contract negotiations to catch up not only with the wage increases others had
already gained but with the increases that had already occurred in the cost
of living. After so many years of rising prices there was also a strong desire to
incorporate in wage increases some protection against cost-of-living increases
expected for the future.
These demands and expectations were not confined to union members.
They were also present in the relations between unorganized workers and
their employers. Such demands might not always have been fully met, but if
they were to be resisted a marked or long period of economic slack and consequently poor profits would be required. This was especially true because the
expectation of continued inflation had pervaded the whole system. Such an
expectation, whose origins and strength may not be found entirely in price
statistics, may have a powerful effect. For example, the outbreak of the
Korean war revived the memories of World War II shortages and inflation
and probably caused more inflation in 1950 than the objective situation
justified. Similarly, in the late 1960's the fact that prices kept rising, despite
the jawboning of 1966, despite the slowdown of 1967, and despite the tax
increase of 1968 fortified the expectation of more inflation.
The momentum of inflation was not confined to wages. It can also be seen
in the lagged rise of interest costs, taxes, regulated rates, and other costs or
prices that joined the inflationary stream late and have kept it running.
The other explanation of the persistent inflation is that the structure of
economic power and the motivation behind its use have changed in ways
that push prices and wages up more violently. Various observers with different viewpoints are impressed with the apparently irresistible agglomerations of power represented by large corporations or unions. It is difficult to
find objective evidence that this powrer on either side has increased in recent
times, but it may have. There may also be in the economic sphere, as apparently in other aspects of our social life, a new impatience and restiveness about
the use of power. The militancy of many union members may be a manifestation of the more general disinclination to have regard for authority.
These hypotheses are intended to explain the same phenomenon, and
for the time being they may lead to the same results. But in a longer view
they have different implications. The implication of the first is that persistence in general restraint of demand will finally check the momentum of the
cost-price spiral and lead to a reasonably stable price-cost level. It is not
a theory of a permanent dilemma between rapid inflation and high unemployment; it is only a theory of slow response. The second does imply
that a permanent change in the response system has occurred, which could
not be controlled by ordinary anti-inflationary policy but might require
revision of economic and even social structures.
The two theories are not necessarily exclusive. It may be that the
economic power structure, though it is not radically different from that
of two decades ago and would not on its own cause persistent inflation,
6i
411-364 O—71

does tend to prolong a high rate of inflation, once such a movement is
generated by excessive demand. Reduction in the rate of inflation would
still be achievable in the face of that type of structure, but it would come
faster if the economic system were more competitive.
All of the foregoing discussion is based on the assumption that what we
observe about the behavior of prices and wages in the published statistics is
an accurate representation of events in the real world. We do not wish to
suggest that in broad terms what is actually occurring is different from what
the statistics indicate. But the statistics are far from perfect; and improved
statistics, particularly at a time of transition like the present, would be of
genuine help both to the policymaker and to the public at large. For the past
several months, for example, there have been scattered reports of discounting
from list prices in a number of industries. List prices tend to be reported in
the industrial component of the wholesale price index. It may well be that
discounting is not uncommon at present, just as premiums above list price
may have been common when excess demand was the rule. Similarly, our
data on wage rate changes in the non-unionized sector of construction and
other industries leave much to be desired.
The problem goes beyond prices and wages and indeed can be extended to
virtually all aspects of our economic statistics. Although this country has
better statistics than any other country, the appropriate criterion is not
whether we rank first but whether our data are doing the job that has to be
done. There is some evidence of a lag. For example, if we take account of
the Federal resources that have been devoted to the development of economic statistics since 1963 we find that the level of support has remained the
same while the real economy has increased by almost one-third. Furthermore,
we find we are asking much more of our data than formerly. If policy is
aimed at achieving specific responses in economic activity, we must have
more accurate statistical tools for measuring such changes. Better statistics
are the surest way we now have of improving our economic knowledge.
WAGE-PRICE POLICY
The persistence of inflation during 1970 in the face of mounting unemployment heightened interest in the possibility of doing something more
direct about rising prices and wages, in addition to restraining demand.
This subject had been under almost continuous consideration in the Administration since February 1969. During 1969 certain steps had been taken,
mainly with respect to the construction industry. In 1970, as the period
of general excess demand was left behind, opportunities for direct action
increased. In the absence of excess demand it was less likely that restraint
exerted upon particular prices and wages would only cause some others
to rise more, and it was more likely that the restraint would exert a cumulative anti-inflationary effect. Moreover, it was more probable that large price
increases would result rather from inertia and erroneous expectations than
from equilibrium adjustments to market conditions.




62

The Administration took action designed to supplement the effects of fiscal
and monetary policy on inflation in two ways. First, it sought to improve the
functioning of markets so that they would be less likely to generate unnecessary price and wage increases. Second, it sought to help business, labor, and
the public at large to recognize the kinds of behavior that would favor
progress towards a lower rate of inflation.
Actions to make the market a less likely source of inflationary pressure
continued to focus heavily on the construction industry, where costs had
kept on rising sharply. Steps were taken to increase the supply of skilled
labor, encourage technological advances, reduce the cost of seasonal variation in construction activity, and improve the structure of collective bargaining in the industry.
The Administration also conducted a study of pricing procedures in the
copper industry which may have contributed to subsequent price reductions.
Restrictions on importation and production of crude oil were relaxed in
order to restrain price increases for that commodity. Two, more general,
measures were the establishment of an interagency Regulations and Purchasing Review Board, to determine where Federal actions were driving up
prices and costs, and a National Commission on Productivity, to recommend public and private measures that would increase productivity and
thus, among other things, hold down the rise of costs and prices. (The activities of both of these bodies are described in later chapters of this report.)
The Administration's attempts to inform the public about the nature and
consequences of inflationary wage and price behavior were embodied in two
major addresses by the President, in June and in December. In his June
address the President announced that he was asking the Council of Economic
Advisers to prepare a periodic Inflation Alert to "spotlight the significant
areas of wage and price increases and objectively analyze their impact on the
price level." The Council has published two issues of the Inflation Alert and
intends to continue its publication at approximately quarterly intervals. The
more general findings in the 1970 issues of the Inflation Alert are described
in Chapter 2.
FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS IN 1970
The effects of the easier monetary policy of 1970 were evident throughout the money and capital markets, though other forces had a counter effect.
Long-term interest rates had reached historical highs at the end of 1969
as a result of heavy demands for credit and the tight monetary policy then
being pursued. After some decline early in 1970, these rates were surpassed
in June 1970, when greater .uncertainties in foreign and domestic affairs,
due particularly to increased tensions over developments in Southeast Asia
and the reorganization of the Penn Central Railroad, produced an increased
demand for liquidity. But since the middle of 1970 long-term bond rates
have declined, as signs of a weakening in inflationary pressures became
plainer and as other tensions subsided.




Rates on high-grade (Aaa) corporate bonds and municipals showed the
most decline (Chart 6). The rate on Baa corporate bonds has remained
almost unchanged. The spread between the Aaa and Baa bonds reflects the
premium that investors demand for holding riskier securities. This spread
typically increases during slack periods, when the economic outlook is uncertain. The demand for liquidity precipitated by the Penn Central reorganization, however, placed an added premium on quality investments. Short-term
rates reached their peaks at the end of 1969. Rates turned upward in May
and June of 1970 but did not surpass their previous highs. Since mid-1970,
short-term rates have declined substantially, showing more improvement
than long-term rates.
From the last, part of November 1970 through the middle of December
there was a sharp decline in both short- and long-term interest rates. The
Aaa corporate bond rate dropped 46 basis points to 7.59 percent, and the
Treasury bill rate fell 50 basis points to 4.78 percent between November 20
and December 18. Explanations for this abrupt decline in rates commonly
point to four causes: the reduction in the demand for short-term credit because of the General Motors strike, expectations of an easier money policy,
the present and expected sluggishness of business, and a reduction of inflationary expectations. It is still not certain, however, how important each of
these causes has been and why, aside from the strike, they became so
powerful in November and December.
Greater fluctuations in short-term rates compared with long-term rates
are consistent with the past cyclical behavior of interest rates. The traditional
behavior of these rates was accentuated during 1970 by the character of
the demand for funds during the year. Table 23 lists the funds raised in
the credit markets during 1969 and 1970 by type of credit market instrument. During 1970, corporations made special efforts to improve their
liquidity positions by turning much of the short-term debt accumulated in
1969 into long-term obligations. This is why the supply of new corporate
bonds in the second and third quarters of 1970 was substantially above the
flow during 1969, and why the equity market was tapped despite depressed
stock prices. The pronounced slowdown in bank loans not elsewhere classified (which include commercial and industrial loans) during the second
and third quarters of 1970 compared with the same period in 1969 confirms
this pattern of financing. The large volume of corporate bond flotations last
spring and summer explains why long-term bond rates did not decline more
during that period, just as the weak demand for bank loans was a major
factor causing a series of cuts in the prime rate charged by commercial
banks, from 8.50 percent to 6.75 percent by the end of the year and to 6.00
percent early in 1971.
Many State and local governments were forced to postpone security issues during the last half of 1969 because of rising interest rates and statutory
limitations on the interest rates that could be paid. A liberalization of these
statutory ceilings, combined with lower interest rates later in the year, ac-

FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION AND THE MORTGAGE MARKET
Mortgage rates tend to be sticky and have declined relatively little in
response to monetary ease. For example, the rate on FHA-insured mortgages
declined from a high of 9.29 percent in March to 8.90 percent at the beginning of December. However, according to preliminary estimates, mortgage rates declined sharply during December. As can be seen in Table 24,
savings flows to the mortgage institutions, such as savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks, which were severely depressed in the second
half of 1969, rose substantially in the second and third quarters of 1970.

uted to the movement of large certificates of deposit (CD's) at commercial
banks. For example, the suspension of deposit ceilings on large CD's in
June 1970 stimulated a huge inflow of these deposits between the second
and third quarters. In addition to generally easier monetary conditions
(and lower rates on competing open market securities), the inflow of funds
to savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks during the second and third quarters of 1970 was encouraged by the increase in January
1970 in the legal deposit rates that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation permitted such institutions
to pay. At the same time, similar action by the Federal Reserve Board in
increasing the maximum rate that commercial banks may pay on most
categories of time and savings deposits also contributed to large inflows of
time deposits into commercial banks (Table 24).
To some extent savings and loan associations and savings banks used
these inflows of deposits during the second and third quarters of 1970 to
restore their liquidity positions rather than to make mortgage loans.
Each of these institutions, for example, increased its holdings of Government securities significantly during the second and third quarters. For this
reason the mortgage-supporting activities of the Federal Home Loan Banks
and the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) during 1970
were quite essential and entailed amounts that almost matched the substantial operations in the last half of 1969. For example, FNMA made net
purchases of home mortgages at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.0
billion during the first three quarters of 1970, as compared to a rate of $5.6
billion in the last half of 1969.
The enactment in July of the Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970
created the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to supplement the
mortgage-market activity of FNMA. During the year, this new corporation
purchased $326 million of loans that had been made with the guarantee of
the Federal Housing Administration and the Veterans Administration. In
December, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation began to purchase participations in conventional mortgage loans, introducing a national
market for these mortgages for the first time. The Federal National Mortgage Association is also preparing to create a secondary market for conventional mortgages.
In December 1970, the Federal Housing Administration and Veterans
Administration lowered the maximum rates permitted on FHA- and VAinsured mortgages from 8.5 percent to 8.0 percent. (In January 1971 rates
were further reduced to 7.5 percent.) Such action does not by itself reduce
mortgage rates, but lowers the maximum rate that can be paid on mortgages
that are insured by the FHA and VA. Lowering these ceiling rates when
market conditions require a higher rate would reduce the availability of
funds for such mortgages. However, since conditions in the money and
capital markets seemed to warrant a lower mortgage rate, the only problem
being the sluggish behavior of this rate, it was hoped that the lowering of




the FHA and VA ceilings would stimulate a downward movement in actual
rates. Present indications are that market rates have begun to decline.
THE STOCK MARKET
Stocks traded on the securities exchange suffered substantial declines in
the first half of 1970. For example, the New York Stock Exchange index of
all stocks (December 31, 1965 = 50) declined 19 percent from a level of
50.86 in December 1969 to 41.15 in July 1970. By the end of December 1970
the index had recouped nearly all of its loss and stood at 50.23. The sharp
decline in stock prices in May 1970 and their depressed state through July
were due in part to the increased tensions over developments in Southeast
Asia and the Penn Central reorganization. Throughout the first half of 1970
investors were concerned with inflation, the stabilization policies needed to
control it, and the extent of the business downturn that would result from
control measures.
Although it is often assumed that stock prices move with prices of real
goods, and hence mirror any inflation, this is not always the case, as events in
1970 again demonstrated. Profit expectations were uncertain, and the threat
of a return to relatively tight monetary policy to ensure success on the inflation front created further uncertainty among investors. These factors combined to produce a large erosion in the value of equities. Progress on the
inflation front, evidence before the auto strike that the upturn in business
activity was getting underway, an end to the decline in corporate profits by
midyear, and the maintenance of a moderately expansionary monetary policy
all helped to stimulate the stock market recovery.
An important side effect of the excessive exuberance in the stock market
that accompanied the inflation, and the subsequent steep decline in stock
prices as anti-inflationary policies were instituted, has been unusual strains
on the institutions of the market. At least 30 broker-dealer firms have ceased
to operate since mid-1968. Although most of these companies were relatively
small, a few larger firms had to merge with stronger ones.
The stock exchanges have voluntarily maintained a fund to reimburse
customers of firms that have failed. The experience after 1968, however,
indicated that a more formal arrangement for greater consumer protection
was needed. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which was
established by Congress in December 1970 with support from the Administration, insures investors against financial loss (within specified limits) caused
by the bankruptcy of their brokerage firm.
LIQUIDITY SQUEEZE
The concern over a possible "liquidity crisis" mounted in mid-1970 when
the Penn Central Railroad filed for reorganization. The immediate stress on
the financial markets in June was lessened by the Federal Reserve Board's
suspension of interest rate ceilings on 30- to 89-day certificates of deposit
issued by large commercial banks. The Federal Reserve Banks also made it




68

clear that the borrowing facilities at the discount window would be fully
available to banks needing to accommodate their customers. Commercial
banks were thus able to bid more freely for funds in the open market,
to borrow from the Federal Reserve, and to channel the funds thus obtained
into business loans. As summarized in Table 24, there were huge inflows of
time deposits to commercial banks in the third quarter. Borrowings at the
Federal Reserve did, in fact, increase to $1.36 billion in July after having
averaged $940 million during the first half of 1970.
Corporate liquidity is a general term that refers to the ability of a firm to
make payments as obligations fall due. A firm faces a liquidity crisis if its
near-term obligations threaten to exceed its ability to raise the cash needed
to cover payments. Bankruptcies can result, of course, simply from an uneconomic operation, when costs, for example, persistently exceed revenues. In
a liquidity crisis funds to cover immediate obligations may be temporarily
lacking even though a firm's prospects for long-term profits are satisfactory.
The question whether a genuine liquidity crisis existed in mid-1970,
in the sense that firms otherwise sound were going bankrupt because of
a liquidity squeeze, can be answered in the negative. It is quite true that
certain statistical measures of business liquidity showed substantial declines from 1968 through mid-1970. But these declines can be explained in
part by the longer trend toward more efficiency in managing corporate
reserves of cash and marketable securities.
Much of the reduction in overall liquidity can be attributed to the reaction of the more liquid corporations to tighter monetary conditions and
high interest rates, although some firms had overextended themselves financially. A comprehensive analysis of this point and of overall corporate
liquidity in 1970 is presented in Appendix A. Confronted by high interest rates during 1969, business firms in general relied on short-term
credit, with the intention of converting this short-term debt into long-term
liabilities during 1970 at lower interest rates. Since many firms experienced
low earnings in the first half of 1970, this need to refinance short-term debt
made the demand for long-term funds in the capital market particularly
heavy in 1970 (Table 23). A sharp increase in interest rates thus occurred
and some borrowers were inevitably squeezed out of the capital markets.
Nonetheless, there was no liquidity crisis if this term is taken to connote skyrocketing interest rates, a complete absence of bids for established securities,
and numerous bankruptcies of sound corporations. The actions of the Federal Reserve and the resiliency of the money and capital markets led to significantly improved financial conditions during the second half of 1970.




APPENDIX

Measures of Changes in Fiscal Policy
When the effects of budget policy on the overall economy first came to
general attention 35 years ago, the expansiveness of the budget was commonly measured by changes in the actual deficit or surplus. This measure
can be grossly misleading, however. Even if existing tax and spending legislation remains unchanged, the actual budget balance will rise and fall, as
changes in incomes influence tax receipts and call for different unemployment and welfare payments. In fact, the actual deficit can rise in the face of
restrictive policy actions of Government. For example, a fall in tax revenues
can coincide with an increase in tax rates if incomes decline sufficiently.
A given change in the actual deficit (or surplus) between two years has a
very different significance if economic activity is rising between those two
years than if it is falling.
Clearly, a need has existed for a better measure of Government budget
policy and its effects—one that would show what effects were the result of
tax and expenditure decisions and what effects the economy itself had exerted
on the budget. There are a number of possible solutions to the problem.
Econometric models, for example, can be used to estimate the impact of
various combinations of tax rate and expenditure changes on the level of
economic activity. Different models utilize different assumptions regarding
the nature and relative importance of various determinants of economic
behavior, and therefore they provide different estimates of the economic
impact of various fiscal policy changes. Consequently, fiscal policy
analysts cannot place too much reliance on the results of a particular model,
although the distribution of estimates provided by a variety of available
models is a useful guide.
For the purposes of public discussion, it is convenient to use simple
measures of the stance of fiscal policy which summarize the more complicated
policy changes used in the complex models. As noted below, however,
considerable care must be exercised in using simple measures of changes in
fiscal policy to estimate the effects of these policies on economic activity.
One simple measure of changes in policy can be obtained by calculating
the effect of changes in revenue and expenditure legislation at a particular
level of economic activity. This technique abstracts from the effect of changes
in economic activity on the budget and provides a clearer view of purely
discretionary policy changes. For example, at the level of economic activity
prevailing in 1970, changes in tax rates occurring during 1970 reduced
revenues by roughly $9 billion while expenditures increased by about $15
billion. In other words, exogenous policy actions during 1970 provided a
fiscal stimulus of $24 billion.
While changes in the surplus or deficit at a given level of money GNP
provide a convenient measure of discretionary policy changes, fiscal policy




70

planning requires a measure containing somewhat more information. Because
the labor force and productivity normally rise and prices rarely fall, money
GNP normally grows. Consequently revenues also rise and over time the
budget surplus would tend to grow rapidly if spending and tax rates remained
unchanged. Spending and tax programs that would yield an unchanged
surplus in an economy with a constant GNP would thus tend to hold down
growth at the normal rate by generating larger and larger surpluses.
It has been found of interest to ask how the surplus or deficit would change
if the economy moved along a specific path. Conceptually, any number of
growth paths could be selected for this purpose; it is the change in the budget
position along the assumed path that will indicate whether the budget policy
has been or will be restrictive relative to that path—that is, whether the
budget is tending to push the economy above or below the assumed path.
In order to give the measure more relevance it is common to select a
growth path that has some normative significance. The full employment
growth path has been used most frequently since the concept of a full employment budget was developed and publicized by the Committee for Economic Development in 1947. Changes in the full employment surplus measure changes in spending and tax legislation as well as the effect of full
employment growth on revenues. The difference between the full employment budget balance and the actual balance reveals the effects of short-run
variations in economic activity around the full employment growth path.
A particular target growth path could serve as an alternative to the full
employment path. Sometimes this path is identical to the full employment
path, but in 1970 it was necessary to be below full employment temporarily in
order to moderate the inflationary pressures which had become excessive in
1969 and early 1970. In other circumstances the desired path may be steeper
than the full employment growth path, if it is necessary to regain full employment from a less than full employment position. The target path budget
would reveal the effect of discretionary tax and spending changes and the
effect of target growth on tax revenues, but would abstract from the effect
on the budget of deviations of economic activity away from the target.
Method of Computation
The figures for the full employment budget provided in Tables 1 and 25
are computed in the following manner: First, the full employment growth
path is estimated in terms of the real value of production. Second, the real
growth path is converted into current dollar terms using the actual rate of
price inflation. This step suffers from the difficulty that a revenue change
resulting from price changes would alter the estimate of the full employment surplus even though there were no changes in discretionary tax and
expenditure policies. One way out of this difficulty might be to convert
real output to money income using the inflation rate that would have
occurred if the economy had actually been at full employment. But this
figure is so difficult to estimate, if indeed there is any unique rate, that the




actual inflation rate despite its shortcomings is used as a convenient
approximation.
Next, full employment income must be distributed into various tax bases,
such as corporate profits, personal income, and other categories. The calculations used in this chapter are based on an estimate of the distribution which would emerge if the economy were actually operating continuously
at full employment. For the purposes of comparing full employment budgets
at different points of time it is important that a constant distribution pattern
be used. Otherwise the estimates would shift with distributional changes that
are unrelated to fiscal policies.
Average tax rates are then estimated for different types of income under
current legislation. On the basis of these estimates full employment revenues
can then be calculated. Full employment expenditures are estimated by
adjusting actual expenditures to allow for the difference between actual
outlays on unemployment compensation and those that would occur at full
employment.
It is clear that the full employment estimate depends on numerous assumptions and that these create the possibility of error. This problem should
not, however, be exaggerated. For most purposes interest focuses on changes
between years, and if the assumptions are consistent between years the errors
in the estimated changes in the budget position are likely to be small. Moreover, estimates of the full employment budget for the future are probably
subject to less error than estimates of the actual budget, because the actual
future path of the economy is more variable and uncertain than the full
employment path.
The Full Employment Budget as a Measure of Fiscal Impact
The absolute level of the full employment surplus or deficit is of limited
significance for indicating how much restraint or stimulus the budget would
exert on the economy if it followed the full employment path, or indeed for
indicating which of these directions its influence would take. Changes in
the full employment surplus from period to period are much more important
indicators of how much fiscal policy is moving toward contraction or expansion. The fact that the full employment budget has a surplus does not imply
that the budget is not having an expansionary impact on the economy; the
effects may be expansionary if the surplus is declining. Similarly a budget
with a deficit may be restrictive if the deficit is declining.
Although changes in the full employment budget balance provide a
convenient summary measure of changes in fiscal policy, they do not tell
the whole story. A given change in the balance may exert a different force,
depending on whether the change stems from a change in transfer payments,
purchases of goods and services, corporate taxes, personal taxes, or other
instruments of fiscal policy. Results vary because different policy changes
affect economic behavior differently, even though the same amounts of
money are involved. Some of the most important differences can be con-




72

sidered in complex models of the economy, but no model can capture all
of the subtle effects of fiscal policy. For example, virtually identical policy
changes may have different results depending on circumstances. A longanticipated increase in Social Security benefits may have a different
consequence from that of an unexpected increase. Similarly, a permanent
cut in income taxes probably has a more powerful impact than an equivalent
reduction that is known to be temporary. Conceptually models could be
constructed to take account of such differences, but they would be extremely
difficult to manage.
Recent Changes in the Full Employment Budget
The table below illustrates changes in the full employment budget during
the last decade. If fiscal policy changes are measured by the annual change
in the surplus relative to full employment GNP, the largest stimulus of the
decade came with the tax cut of 1964. The largest shift toward restraint
came in 1969, or, on a 2-year basis, in 1968 and 1969.
The full employment budget can be computed by using either national
income accounting concepts or the concepts applied in deriving the unified
budget, which appears in the President's annual budget statement. Economists generally favor the national income accounting approach in the belief
that on balance it provides a more accurate measure of fiscal effects; but
both concepts have advantages and disadvantages.
On both the expenditure and revenue sides these concepts embody important differences of timing. In the national accounts budget, purchases
of goods and services are recorded when delivery is made. The unified
budget records them when checks are issued for payment; this might occur
before or after delivery. It is sometimes argued that neither method of timing truly captures the fiscal impact and that for such a purpose the timing
of orders should be used.

On the revenue side the unified budget again uses cash receipts. In the
national income accounts budget most receipts, such as corporate income
and excise taxes, are recorded on an accrual basis, but personal income taxes
are recorded when paid by individuals. Steps are now being taken to put
the unified budget more on an accrual basis.
The national accounts budget omits the direct lending activities of Government except for Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) "nonrecourse"
commodity loans, which are treated as expenditures rather than loans. The
unified budget also treats as expenditures CCC loans as well as foreign loans
made on noncommercial terms and domestic loans where repayment may
be waived. A unified budget deficit can be computed for the expenditure
account alone, or it can be defined to include the net lending not already
considered in the expenditure account. In fiscal 1970 such lending amounted
to $2.1 billion.
Neither budget considers the loan guarantee and insurance programs of
Government, and besides these there are a number of Government-sponsored
lending institutions which operate outside of the budget. During fiscal 1971
it is expected that Government net guaranteed and insured loans will increase by about $13 billion, while the increase in the net lending of Government-sponsored institutions will be about $8 billion.

CHAPTER 2

Outlook and Policy

T

HE GOALS FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ECONOMY
IN 1971 ARE CLEAR. Our objectives should be to move along a
path through 1971 that will bring the unemployment rate in 1972 down to
the zone of reasonably full employment, and at the same time to get the
rate of inflation dowrn to the 3-percent range. The general nature of the
policies that would help to achieve each of these goals is also clear. We can
reduce unemployment, at least in the short run, by expansive economic
policies which would make the demand for output rise rapidly and so raise
employment. We can reduce the rate of inflation by restrictive economic
policies which would repress the demand for output, increase unemployment and unutilized capacity, and thereby encourage business and labor
to settle for smaller advances in prices and wages. While these "solutions"
are clear, the problem is also clear. We cannot do as much as would be
possible in one direction without injurious results in the other. This is not
to say that it is impossible to make progress in both directions at the same
time. It is possible, but only if we do not move too fast in either direction.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT-INFLATION DILEMMA

The dilemma of having to balance our efforts between reducing unemployment faster and reducing inflation faster is not new. This itself is worth
recognizing, because if the problem were truly new, the thinking and experience of the past would be of little value. In fact the dilemma has been
one of the central concerns of economics and of economic policy throughout
this generation. The problem came to the fore as early as 1936 and 1937
when the economy, although still at a very low level, was recovering from the
Depression and prices began to rise. President Roosevelt called public attention to what he believed to be the dangers of the price increases. There
wrere many who thought that the ending of the recovery in the sharp
recession of 1937-38 wras due to the earlier price rise, which they attributed
to concentrations of economic power. This belief was one of the motives for
the establishment of the Temporary National Economic Committee
(TNEC) to investigate the concentration of economic power.
The work of the TNEC led to no conclusions on this point, because its
report did not come until the war had superseded earlier concerns. Never-




75

theless, the problem of reconciling full employment and price stability was
prominent in wartime thinking about the postwar economy. This was one
of the reasons why some were reluctant to accept what they interpreted
as the overly ambitious commitment to full employment implicit in the original "Full Employment Bill," an attitude that led to a less ambitious
commitment in the Employment Act as enacted in 1946.
Discussion of the possibility of full employment without inflation continued in the first 10 years after the war. This was a period in which contemporary experience was dominated by the effects of wars, controls, and
their aftermath, and it was not generally considered that it could provide
much light on the characteristics of a normal peacetime economy. The
events of 1955-57 intensified the concern with the problem. We then had
the first full employment achieved in normal conditions since 1929, and it
was accompanied by a disturbing increase in the inflation rate. From the
third quarter of 1954 to the third quarter of 1957, prices (as measured by
the GNP deflator) rose at an annual rate of 3.1 percent, reaching a peak
annual rate of 5.4 percent in one quarter. Six quarters after the recession
began the inflation rate was still 2 percent, and this contributed to the idea
of inflation as a permanent problem. This experience lay behind the statements contained in the Economic Report of the President during that period
about the need for responsible restraint in raising prices and wages.
In the upswing that followed, however, most measures of the general
price level stabilized, and this stability continued through 1965. From mid1958 to the end of 1965 the rate of inflation averaged 1.5 percent per year, as
measured by the GNP price deflator, and 1.3 percent by the consumer price
index. At the time this moderate rate of inflation was considered as being, for
all practical purposes, "reasonable price stability." The experience, however,
did not resolve questions about the compatibility of full employment and
price stability. Unemployment was high during all of this period, although
declining from 7.1 percent in early 1961 to 5.0 percent by the end of 1964
and to 4.5 percent in mid-1965. Some thought that the prolonged period
of little inflation would create an environment stable enough so that a
gradual reduction of the unemployment rate to 4 percent could be achieved
without speeding up the inflation. Evidence that the inflation rate was
holding steady at a low level as unemployment fell towards 4.5 percent encouraged this hope. But in fact the GNP price deflator began to rise soon
after unemployment fell below 4 percent at the end of 1965, and there had
been evidence of the beginnings of a rise in wholesale prices before that.
This rise in the inflation rate and its sequel left several important questions
unanswered. Would the inflation rate have increased if the drop in the unemployment rate from 5 percent to 4 percent had occurred more gradually?
Would the inflation rate have stabilized at the still moderate figures registered late in 1965 if demand had remained just sufficient to keep unemployment at 4 percent? Or was some higher rate of inflation the inevitable
accompaniment of the 4-percent unemployment rate?




Demand kept rising rapidly, although not without some interruptions,
after the end of 1965, reducing the unemployment rate below 4 percent and
pushing the inflation rate still higher. While this was happening, that is, until
about the middle of 1969, the dilemma of policy disappeared. Unemployment had been driven down to a level where symptoms of labor shortages and
tight labor markets were widespread. In those circumstances the proper
course of policy was clear. Restrictive policy which would restrain inflation
would carry with it little, if any, cost in the form of undesirable effects
on employment. For the time the appropriate direction of policy was
unambiguous.
The dilemma reasserted itself in early 1970 when we again experienced
high and, for a time, rising inflation rates along with rising unemployment
rates. This was a natural transitional combination, in view of the rapid
inflation we had been experiencing. Once the rise of total demand was restrained, the effects were first felt on the real side of the economy—on output, employment, and unemployment—with prices continuing to rise as a
result of forces set in motion earlier.
THE GOALS OF POLICY
There are several reasons for believing that from this point forward a
further reduction of the inflation rate will be consistent with reduction of
the unemployment rate:
1. A reduction of the inflation rate has already begun. This is reflected
in most broad measures of the price level.
2. There is a lag between the emergence of slack in the economy and its
effect on the inflation rate so that the full effects on prices of the sluggish
economy in 1970 have yet to be felt.
3. If, as expected, employment rises at a moderate rate during 1971,
sufficient slack will still remain in the economy to exert downward pressure
on the rate of inflation.
4. With output rising fast enough to cut into the unemployment rate, a
high rate of productivity growth should continue through 1971. Stern costcutting measures in 1970 have put businesses in a position to achieve more
favorable trends in costs per unit of output as operating rates improve. This
will help to limit the pressures of these costs on prices.
To go beyond these general statements of direction and try to estimate
how much unemployment and inflation could be reduced, we must move
cautiously. However, some approximate judgments seem consistent with
recent as well as earlier experience. Confining the economic expansion to a
pace which would keep unemployment about where it now is, in the neighborhood of 5.5 to 6.0 percent, would permit a significant decline in the
rate of inflation during 1971 and 1972. To allow so high an unemployment rate to persist for so long a time, however, would be inconsistent with
the Employment Act—and undesirable even if there were no Act. On the
other hand, trying to restore what has been commonly regarded as "full
411-364 0—71



6

employment"—a 4-percent unemployment rate—within the present planning period that extends to the end of fiscal year 1972 would entail risks on
the inflation side. Although this latter path might be consistent with some
further reduction of the inflation rate, there is a serious risk that the inflation rate would start rising again if the 4-percent unemployment rate were
approached as rapidly as such timing would imply.
There is a feasible path between these extremes that would better meet
the Nation's present requirements by allowing significant progress to be
made against both inflation and unemployment. This is a path that would
see the unemployment rate reduced to the 4 ^-percent zone by the second
quarter of 1972 and the inflation rate, as measured by the GNP deflator,
declining to approach the 3-percent range at the same time. Total output
would have to rise significantly faster than the growth of potential output,
or employment would rise only in proportion to the growth of the labor
force and would not cut into unemployment. The necessary rate of increase
of total output, however, would not have to exceed the rates that have
been achieved during past periods of economic recovery.
The general goal, which is more important than the precise numbers, is
that the rate of unemployment should decline as fast as is consistent with
a reasonably steady and durable decline in the rate of inflation. We believe
that the numbers we have proposed—an unemployment rate in the 4 *4-percent zone and an inflation rate declining to approach the 3-percent range by
mid-1972—are feasible representations of that goal. But the numbers are
themselves not the fundamental goal.
It has to be recognized that achievement of this goal would still leave
the economy short of the ideal with respect to both unemployment and
inflation. As things turn out, the economy may yield better results on both
sides than are projected here. But it would be unrealistic to count on such
an outcome, and irresponsible to hold out to the American people the
idea that there are readily available policies which would achieve it. The
long and accelerating inflationary boom that was set off beginning in late
1965 left the country with this unemployment-inflation dilemma, whose
severity was only subsequently appreciated. But to move firmly along the
path laid out would relieve the anxiety about the economy from which the
country has been suffering for many years and generate confidence in further progress.
IMPROVING THE UNEMPLOYMENT-INFLATION CHOICE
Howr rapidly we can move in expansion of the demand for output, with
associated increases in production and employment, will depend heavily on
the capability of the economy to resist the inflation of prices and costs. In
many directions we see accumulating evidence of public weariness with a
continuing' deterioration in the purchasing power of its money. Surveys of
public sentiment reveal it sharply. Widespread public support for direct
price and wage controls clearly reveals public frustration with inflation




even if the full consequences that these controls would have in distortions
and black markets are not perceived. Developments which persistently
force costs and prices upward will simply prolong unemployment and the
sluggish spending inclination of consumers. And growing confidence in
prospects for a reasonably stable price level would make a major contribution to invigorated consumer spending and improved economic conditions generally.
Broad fiscal and monetary policies must continue to play the basic role.
How expansive these policies can be, however, will depend on what more
can be done to enable the economy to translate rising demand into rising
output, employment, and real incomes rather than into a more rapidly rising
cost-price level. This list of other possible actions, beyond the prudent management of fiscal and monetary policies, is long and varied. The problem is to
select those which would be, on balance, helpful. It is not solved by saying
that reliance on fiscal and monetary restraint alone will make the process of
disinflation slower and more painful than we would like. That is a restatement of the problem, not a solution to it.
As a basis for thinking about the problem, several points must be borne
in mind:
1. The free market system of determining prices and wages, even with
its imperfections, serves exceedingly well in shaping what gets produced
and by whom, and how the resulting income gets distributed. These are key
questions in any economy, and no effective substitute for this market economy
has been found that answers them better. We take the free market system
for granted, like the air we breathe, and become conscious of the benefits
of either only after they have been lost.
2. There is now a great deal of experience to indicate that the superficially attractive route of voluntary controls is unlikely to lead to a solution.
By "voluntary controls" is meant a system in which the Government, or a
quasi-independent board selected by the Government, specifies comprehensive standards of wage-price policy to be observed voluntarily by labor
and business, without any similarly comprehensive means of enforcement
by Government. The basic deficiency in this approach is that it counts on
a large number of people to acquiesce in conduct that they find contrary
not only to their own interests but also to theiiwiew of fairness, propriety,
and efficiency. The great initial attraction of the idea, that it makes the
public think something effective is being done, is also one of its adverse
consequences because it distracts attention from the real nature of the
problem.
3. At the same time, it is evident that some price and wage increases
that are going on are not adaptations to current basic market conditions
and are not consistent with efficient operation of the economy. To some extent this simply reflects a lag in adjustment to the change in market conditions that has taken place in the past year. But in some cases the behavior




79

of prices or wages can be explained only by a combination of this factor
with an unusual degree of insulation from competitive market forces.
4. In some cases the insulation from market forces is due to acts of commission or omission by the Federal Government. This may be true, for
instance, in industries that are protected from foreign competition by import
quotas or voluntary arrangements with similar effect. In these cases the
Government has the instruments at hand for correcting the problem. This
does not, in itself, make the correction easy. Those who have been the beneficiaries of a shelter from competitive forces would certainly feel aggrieved
by changes in conditions on which they have come to rely.
Government policy must find its way among all these considerations.
Short of an emergency of a kind which does not exist, mandatory comprehensive price and wage controls are undesirable, unnecessary, and probably unworkable. The Government should not rely upon pseudo-solutions for
real problems and should not delude the public about doing so. But there
are cases where price or wage increases not justified by competitive market
forces are contributing to the prolongation of the inflation and to unemployment as well. In some of these cases the Government has means of
correction available that do not interfere with market performance but
tend rather to improve it.
What is called for is a policy of doing what can effectively be done,
wherever it can be done, and not pretending to do more. The Administration
set out on this course with the President's speech of June 17, 1970, and
has since then been following it with increasing force.
In June the President directed the Council of Economic Advisers to issue
a periodic Inflation Alert to call attention to specific cases or general features
of exceptionally inflationary wage or price behavior. The purpose of these
reports was to bring to bear on important wage and price decisions a more
informed and sharply focused public attention. The Council will continue
to issue the Inflation Alert approximately every 3 months. Certain points
made in the December 1970 issue, prompted by developments in the immediately preceding period, are worth reiterating.
1. Apart from temporary aberrations the general price level tends to rise
by the excess of wage increases over productivity increases. Productivity cannot be counted on for long to rise more than about 3 percent per year, although this rate will probably be exceeded during the next year. This means
that a continuing 7-percent annual rate of increase of employee compensation per hour would commit the economy to a continuing inflation rate of
about 4 percent.
2. We shall not make progress in reducing the inflation rates if the gains
we hope to make on the labor cost front are offset by too rapid increases of
profit margins.
3. If the inflation is to be slowed down, all wages that have not kept up
with the inflation of prices cannot catch up in any short period. On the average, labor compensation has kept pace with the inflation and productivity




8o

increases, but some wages have led and some have lagged. If those that have
lagged were to catch up quickly, while the leaders did not fall back—as they
surely would not in a short period—then the cost-price spiral is given another
turn, prices rise further, and new laggards are created who feel they have to
catch up.
4. To embody in wage agreements covering two or three future years
provisions for wage increases based on the assumption that prices will continue to rise at recent peak rates is not a reasonable response to our present
situation. If this were done generally it would be a recipe not only for permanent rapid inflation but also for persistent unemployment, because the Government would be bound to try to check the inflation by generally restrictive
policies. On the other hand, in some cases escalator clauses, which relate
future wage changes to actual variations in the cost of living rather than to
the expectation of continued inflation at its peak rate, may have a role to play
during the adjustment to a more stable price level.
The President's June 1970 speech also announced the establishment of the
Regulations and Purchasing Review Board to correct Government policies
which unnecessarily contribute to inflation. It has under consideration a
number of problem areas on which recommendations will be forthcoming.
Examples of these are the management of import restrictions, regulations
which unduly increase the cost of bidding on small Government projects,
design and procurement methods for Government buildings, and the administration of the Davis-Bacon Act, which requires that contractors on Federal
construction projects pay "prevailing" wages (a provision which in practice
may have exerted an inflationary effect on construction wage rates and
costs).
It is the general policy of this Administration that where it has a legitimate
role the Government should act to correct market conditions that prolong inflation, or whose correction can have a favorable effect on the price level.
In line with this policy the Administration last fall took two steps to restrain
increases of crude oil prices. It relaxed limitations on the importation of oil
from Canada and permitted production of oil on Federal offshore leases
without restriction by State regulatory commissions.
Following the announcement of a large increase in prices of some steel
products in January 1971 the President directed the Cabinet Committee
on Economic Policy to investigate economic conditions in the steel industry
which were giving rise to such increases. To be taken into account in this
review is the voluntary agreement by producers of steel in Japan and the
European Economic Community to limit their sales of steel in the United
States, an agreement negotiated by the U.S. Government. One subject to
be investigated is how the interests of U.S. users of steel, including many
industries which themselves face foreign competition, can best be correlated
with the interests of U.S. producers in these international steel arrangements.
Rapidly rising construction costs have been a serious concern for the past
2 years. In 1969 the Administration took steps to reverse price increases




8i

in lumber; the impact on construction is one reason for concern about steel
price increases. The Administration has also moved to check the extraordinary wage and price increases in the construction industry. The wage increases have been occurring despite high unemployment in the industry. On
January 18, 1971, the President met with leaders representing construction
workers and employers and asked them to submit a plan for stopping the
exceptionally large wage and price increases that are raising the cost of
new homes and other buildings and causing unemployment in the industry itself. An effective resolution of these problems by parties in the industry would avert the need for changes in the legal provisions affecting
the construction labor market. The public interest cannot condone continuing massive increases in these costs at a time when American families
need more homes and many in the industry are unemployed and need jobs.
The rising demand for houses, highways, and buildings must produce more
construction and not be dissipated in higher costs and prices.
To regularize the increasingly active Federal role in particular labor or
product markets, the Council's function of alerting against inflation has
been broadened. By a decision taken in January the Council of Economic
Advisers will report immediately to the Cabinet Committee on Economic
Policy on any exceptionally inflationary wage or price developments so that
the Cabinet Committee can consider appropriate Federal action.
The measures the Administration is taking will contribute to the capability
of the economy to resist inflation as it moves along a rising path in 1971-72.
They will not relieve the country of the consequences of past errors which
have caused us to live for a longer time with both more unemployment and
more inflation than anyone would like. They will still leave us dependent
upon a course of steady but not excessive economic expansion as the way
out of this dilemma. But they give the Nation additional assurances that
1971 can be a year not only of diminishing rates of inflation but also of rising
employment and output.
THE PATH OF THE ECONOMY IN 1971
Some of the factors that will determine the course of the economy in
1971 are present and visible, others may be present but not now clearly
seen, and still others are, from the standpoint of the Federal Government,
matters of policy still to be decided or at least subject to revision.
The most obvious of the present conditions is that the year 1970 ended
with unemployment in the neighborhood of 6 percent and output in the
fourth quarter about 6^4 percent below its potential. As explained in
Chapter I, the fourth quarter was significantly depressed by the automobile
strike. This carries with it the probability of a large rise in output in early
1971 to rebuild inventories and meet customers' demands for motor vehicles.
Also, apprehension that there may be a steel strike after midyear is likely
to cause some larger than usual additions to steel inventories in advance.
These two factors will provide a special boost to total output in the first




82

half of the year but they also involve the danger of a subsequent letdown.
The assurance of a reasonably smooth and even expansion throughout the
year must be a special concern of economic policy in 1971.
Aside from these transitory influences, there are several conditions that
promise a strong rise of output during the year. The sharp rise in housing
starts which occurred in the second half of 1970, the large inflows of savings
into thrift institutions in the same period, and the beginning of a decline in
mortgage interest rates all point to a much increased rate of residential
construction in 1971 as compared with 1970. How fully these promising
developments translate into more housing and more jobs will depend heavily
on progress in stabilizing labor and other costs in the industry.
The increased availability of funds and lower interest rates, especially
during the second half of 1970, permitted State and local governments to
increase their borrowing substantially, and this will support an acceleration
of State and local expenditure.
On the other hand, the most recent survey of anticipated plant and equipment expenditure of business, made by the Department of Commerce and
the Securities and Exchange Commission in late November and December,
suggests a year-to-year rise of \l/z percent. This does not allow for 1971 business purchases of automobiles and trucks not bought in 1970 because of the
strike. It also does not allow for the effects of the liberalization of depreciation allowances for tax purposes that was announced in early January 1971
and went into effect retroactively to January 1. This liberalization will initially add about $2.6 billion in calendar 1971 to the after-tax cash flow of
business. It will stimulate investment by increasing the after-tax rate of
return on machinery and equipment.
The catch-up after the auto strike and the stocking up in anticipation of a
steel strike are likely to lead to a high temporary rate of inventory accumulation in the first half of 1971. Apart from this, however, there is nothing in
the relationship between inventories and sales as the year opens to suggest
that a change in the rate of inventory accumulation will be an active element
in the economy for the year as a whole.
The Federal Budget proposed by the President implies an increase of
$17.0 billion in expenditures on the national income accounts basis between
calendar 1970 and calendar 1971. Federal purchases of goods and services
would decline $1.9 billion, the reduction in defense spending more than
offsetting a rise in nondefense purchases.
The first instalment of revenue sharing together with other programs
would result in $6.6 billion of increased grants to the States, and these will
support increased State and local expenditures. Also, there would be an increase of $12.0 billion in transfer payments to individuals, resulting in part
from a proposed 6-percent increase in Social Security benefits effective January 1, 1971. On the other side of the Budget there will be the reduction of
revenues resulting from the depreciation revision.




83

There is, of course, no counterpart of the Federal Budget to represent the
probable course of monetary policy during 1971. In practice one of the important features of monetary policy as an instrument of economic stabilization is its capability for being adapted quickly and flexibly to emerging
developments. As a basis for considering what the outcome for the year
would be with a specified combination of policies, it is convenient to assume
that the money stock will continue to grow at about the rate that has prevailed since the turn early last year.
There is little doubt that this combination of conditions and policies
will bring forth a substantial rise of total output during the year. But the
rate of expansion is critical for attainment of the Nation's economic goals,
and this rate is uncertain. The outcome will depend upon the level of personal savings, the response of business investment to an actual upturn of
sales and profits, the effects of rising construction costs on the housing market,
the influence of the depreciation reform on business planning, the degree
to which individuals and businesses want to rebuild their liquidity, and many
other factors. The combination of such variables will determine whether,
under present policies, there is a vigorous cumulative cyclical recovery such
as has occurred after some economic declines or only a gradual rise.
There is a considerable body of opinion that expects the gross national
product for 1971 to be in the range between $1,045 billion and $1,050
billion, which would be an increase of 7 to 7 ^ percent above that for 1970.
This is a possible outcome. However, it seems more likely that with present
policies the outcome would be higher than that and could be as high as
$1,065 billion.
A $1,065 billion GNP for 1971 would be consistent with satisfactory progress towards the feasible targets suggested above—that is, towards an unemployment rate in the 4 J/2-percent zone and an inflation rate approaching
the 3-percent range by mid-1972. This calculation involves estimates of
the rates of increase of productivity and the labor force, which may in fact
turn out differently, so that the connection between the unemploymentinflation targets and the 1971 GNP is not a rigid one. Nevertheless, although
emerging information may later suggest a different view, the figure of $1,065
billion for the GNP in 1971 is an appropriate intermediate target of a
policy whose ultimate goal is not a dollar total but a desired behavior of
prices, unemployment, and real output. It is reasonable to expect that with
an increase of the GNP to $1,065 billion in 1971, the rate of price increase
would be declining through the year, the unemployment rate would also
end the year significantly lower than at the end of 1970, and real output
would show a strong gain.
For the GNP to reach $1,065 billion in 1971 would require an increase
comparable to the increases after the low points of the economy in 1954,
1958, and 1961. If the rise in the money stock were to continue at the 1970
rate, the ratio of money to the GNP would then decline at about the average
rate of the period 1952-70. Although this is a possible development, it is not
a certainty. In the earlier recoveries cited, a major stimulus to the sharp rise




of demand and output was a change from running down inventories to building them up. This is less likely in 1971 than after the earlier adjustments,
which were much more severe.
A GNP in the neighborhood of $1,065 billion in 1971 is a good present
estimate of the figure consistent with the targets for unemployment and inflation. It is feasible, and its realization with the proposed budget and complementary monetary policy is a reasonable expectation.
It will be necessary to maintain an appropriate balance between our international responsibilities and domestic objectives of economic policy in decisions about how to combine or "mix" the different instruments of policy.
And the economy remains a highly complex system which, even with its patterns of regularity, does not respond to policy changes in simplistic and invariant ways. For these reasons we must be prepared, as new evidence
appears, to make promptly the necessary policy adjustments.
The President's Budget for 1972 is based on the principle that expenditures should not exceed the revenues that the tax system would yield under
conditions of full employment. This is an important principle. It permits
the Federal budget to support the economy when the economy is weak, by
allowing the Federal budget to move into a deficit under those conditions.
But it retains the fiscal discipline of budget balancing by drawing a line
beyond which expenditures may not go without tax increases. Moreover,
keeping the full employment budget balanced, even when the economy is
below full employment, prevents the Government from incurring commitments to higher expenditures and lower taxes that would unduly encumber
the future. The Budget for fiscal 1972 provides for the most urgent needs
that should be met through Federal expenditures. Moreover, the yield of the
present tax system will be required later to meet foreseeable expenditures
to which the Government is already largely committed. Therefore, still
further increases of expenditures beyond this Budget or cuts in taxes would
not have been consistent \vTith fiscal discipline.
In the past year monetary policy has moved towards a greater degree
of stability in the rate of increase of the moneary aggregates, notably the
stock of currency plus demand deposits. This is, as wras stated in last year's
Economic Report of the President, a desirable direction. The financial and
economic system is thus given a more stable monetary framework within
which to operate.
The reasons for a new stability in fiscal and monetary policy are weighty.
But the need to press forward to reduce unemployment and inflation is also
great. After the economic instability we have experienced in the past 5 years
the parameters of the system cannot be located with precision and may well
be in flux. It would be unwise to try to freeze a course of policy which is expected to carry us through the difficult months ahead without change. A
course of flexibility and determination, with cooperation and division of
labor among the several instruments of economic policy, will be needed, and
if followed will lead to the goals we all seek.




CHAPTER 3

National Priorities and the National Output
INTRODUCTION

T

HE COUNTRY'S ATTENTION THIS YEAR is focused on the
problem of raising total production and employment to the point
where we are fully using the Nation's capacity to produce. But we cannot
afford to neglect measures that will promote continued rapid growth of that
capacity and bring about its utilization for the most important purposes. Our
success in achieving these goals will significantly affect the quality of
American life for years to come.
In recent years the desirability of increasing production has been more
strongly challenged than previously, and at the extreme there are some who
look upon economic growth as the mere enlargement of a quantity without
human meaning or value. But economic growth means increasing capacity
to produce what is wanted—as is indicated by the term "goods and services,"
meaning a good for or service to someone. The product is not measured in
tons or miles or calories. It is measured by the value that someone puts on it.
The key question is whose value counts.
In the measures of total output commonly used in the United States, the
value of products is what purchasers pay for them. That is determined not
only by the purchasers' preferences but also by conditions of supply. The
conditions of supply in turn reflect the natural and technological circumstances at a given time as well as the preferences of suppliers of labor and
capital. Thus the value by which a product is measured synthesizes the
preferences of consumers and suppliers of resources as expressed in markets
and in the political process. For example, a pound of butter counts for more
economic output than a pound of coal because it combines a higher consumer valuation and a higher cost to produce. The most comprehensive
measure of economic output, gross national product, is in fact defined as
the market value of the Nation's output of goods and services. The same
decentralized process that determines the values used in measuring the output also determines what gets produced.
For anyone whose values differ greatly from those of the general synthesis,
the measurement of economic growth will be different from that commonly
made. For anyone to whom clean water is the only valuable product there
has been no economic growth since the time of Hiawatha. The argument is




86

ultimately a matter of taste, and the only comment one can make on it is
that most people do not feel that way. The capacity of the economic system
to produce what is valued by today's population—as represented in the market and in the political process—has increased rapidly and continues to do so.
One can say no more about economic growth than that those whose decisions
are reflected in the composition of output are better able to satisfy their
desires in a growing economy. But if the markets are competitive and the
decisionmaking process is democratic, that is saying a good deal.
The case for production is not necessarily the case for a particular statistic
of production such as the gross national product, and the case for economic
growth is not necessarily a case for increasing the gross national product. The
GNP is not a perfect measure of all the activities comprehended in the idea of
economic output. This has long been recognized, and it has most recently
taken on new meanings and a new sense of urgency through growing concern
for the environment. Many deteriorations or improvements of the environment are not accounted for in the gross national product, even when they are
incidents of the production process. This is only a newly conspicuous example
of those limitations of the GNP statistic which have been well known for a
long time.
On the other hand, the gross national product measured in real terms
does not count as "product" many benefits which are provided as a part of
the production process, such as training, education, health care, and even cars
and subsidized meals for employees. Only the cost of developing a public
park goes into GNP, though the new park may add economic value to other
properties in the neighborhood. Nor does the GNP include the value of the
large amount of productive but unpaid work done in and out of the home,
such as the housewife's services. It can take no account of changes in the
burdensomeness of work, or the length of the workweek, or the wider choice
of products available; and it only inadequately accounts for the consequences
of the introduction of new products.
Despite these limitations the GNP statistic has made a great contribution
to understanding how the economy is working. And, although GNP is not
a complete measure of economic production, still less of "welfare," its level
and rate of increase are positively associated with what most people and
most societies consider an improvement in the quality of life. All over the
world, in countries whose cultures and values differ widely, we see a drive
for increasing the measured gross national product. Moreover, insofar as
we are able to measure conditions of life not incorporated in the GNP, such
as mortality and morbidity rates, educational attainment, and cultural
facilities, these tend to improve in countries with higher per capita GNP.
Evidence of a relation between GNP and the popular preference is seen in
migration within the United States. There is a large net movement to
those parts of the country, especially the metropolitan areas, where all the
attributes, desirable and undesirable, of a high-income industrial society are
most intensely present.




87

While the Nation has been engaged in a new and earnest soul searching
about the role of growing material affluence in the good life, it is probably
true that in general the American people prefer a rapid growth of GNP
and its consequences. There is, in fact, a good deal of evidence that in the
years ahead the demands on our capability to produce will be growing in
intensity rather than diminishing. One of the great merits of the American
system, however, is that those who do not share this common preference
have the opportunity to make alternative choices. An important virtue of
the market system for organizing economic activity is, therefore, precisely
that we can more closely tailor our productive activities to the wide-ranging
diversity of individual wants and preferences.
This is not to say that growth of measured GNP is an absolute to be
furthered at all costs. As individuals and as citizens we clearly do many
things that reduce the growth of GNP, and we fail to do manv things that
would accelerate it. This is perfectly reasonable; growth of GNP has its costs,
and beyond some point they are not worth paying. Man wants more than is
counted in GNP. People's values change. Conditions of life change. These
may lower the point beyond which more growth of GNP is not worth its
costs. Even so, growth of GNP would still be an objective about which we
are not indifferent.
In any case, whatever may be true or become true about the relative values
of the product' included in the GNP and the product excluded from it—
the automobile on the one hand and the clean air on the other—there is
little evidence that we are witnessing a decline in the value assigned to
economic output as a whole. This means that great importance must be
assigned to the basic factors which influence our total capacity to produce.
These are in the long run essentially the same for producing GNP as for
producing other benefits. They are the size and competence of the population, the state of knowledge, the stock of capital, and the effectiveness with
which these are combined. We can foresee no diminution in the need for
these factors if we as a people are to come closer to meeting our objectives.
In fact, as we shall show below, the existing propensities of the population
and the policies of the Government constitute claims upon the GNP itself
that can only be satisfied by rapid economic growth.
In the long view of history, the average rate of economic growth in the
United States has been exceptionally high. In the latter part of the 19th
century per capita real incomes in the United States and industrial Europe
were roughly equal. But by the middle of this century U.S. real per capita
income and output were roughly double those in advanced European economies. We expect that the rate of growth of real per capita income m the
1970's will be even higher in this country than our historical average. This
will happen solely because we will have unusually rapid growth of the labor
force relative to the growth of the population. Without special policies to
encourage productivity gains, a faster rate of growth of output per worker
or per worker-hour than the country has experienced since the end of World




War II does not seem to be a reasonable expectation. There is some evidence
that the higher rate of growth of the labor force might also affect productivity
favorably, but there are also reasons for fearing that productivity may rise
less than in the past. One reason commonly cited is the increased proportion
of the population that will be employed in industries whose gains in productivity are slow. Although there is no assurance that productivity in the
U.S. economy will rise as fast as in the recent past, extraordinary increases
in the rate of productivity have been achieved by some other countries,
notably Japan. This fact at least raises, though it does not answer, the
question whether there are applicable policies that would also accelerate
productivity here.
The rates of growth of total capacity to produce and of output per hour
of work will depend principally on the decisions of individuals and businesses—decisions about saving and investing, about the education of children
and the training of adults, about the pursuit of opportunities to earn higher
incomes. Still, the actions of Government also affect the rate of growth and
must be evaluated from that standpoint. The policy of this Administration
has been aimed at sustaining the rate of growth of productivity to which we
have been accustomed and if possible raising that rate moderately. A drop
in the rate of growth of productivity below the expected increases in real
wages and in real taxes would generate difficult tensions, especially when
the illusions of inflation were fully recognized. A higher rate of productivity
growth would be desirable to satisfy escalating demands, but in the American
free market economy the Government's ability to stimulate growth in
productivity is limited.
Some of the major policies of the Administration to promote growth may
be briefly noted:
The struggle against inflation is itself critical for economic growth. The
institutions for mobilizing savings in the United States and channeling them
into investment depend basically upon reasonable confidence in the value of
the dollar. Many kinds of investment which make a valuable contribution to
growth would suffer if the future stability of the general level of prices
became highly uncertain.
The Administration has kept Federal spending on a path that would not
exceed the revenues the tax system would yield under conditions of full
employment. With this policy the Federal Government does not absorb
private funds to finance a deficit when the amount of private investment is
crowding against the supply of savings.
Despite the stringency of the budget position, the Administration has
supported a continued strong Federal effort to promote research and development. Total obligations for the conduct of research and development in
fiscal 1972 will be $16.7 billion, according to the Budget just submitted, up
8 percent over 1971. For research alone the increase will be 9 percent, and
most of that is outside the defense program. Obligations of the National




89

Science Foundation for research will be 44 percent higher than in 1971 and
71 percent higher than in 1970.
The Administration has supported an increase in manpower training
programs as a means of speeding up the improvement of the capabilities of
the labor force. Training is also a way of helping workers to adapt to
changing requirements in labor markets and thus of reducing the amount
of unemployment. The Budget submitted by the President in January provided for an increase of 40 percent in outlays for manpower programs, between fiscal year 1970 and fiscal year 1972. In addition the Administration
has proposed a reorganization of the training programs to improve their
effectiveness and adaptation to local needs.
A new expanded program of student loans, grants, and work-study payments with subsidies based on need has been proposed to ensure that the
post-secondary education of those persons whose higher education would be
most valuable to themselves and to the Nation is not limited for financial reasons. It is estimated that 2.5 million students will receive benefits from
this program in fiscal 1972.
The Federal Government is the largest employer in the country, having
over 2.5 million civilians on its payroll at the end of 1970. An increase in
the productivity of these wrorkers would have a marked effect on average
productivity in the economy as a whole. The Administration is making
a determined effort to improve management and personnel utilization
throughout the Federal service. Probably the most fundamental step in this
direction w7as the reorganization of the postal service to permit the application of businesslike standards of investment and management.
TAXES AND GROWTH
In 1969 the Administration supported repeal of the investment tax credit.
At that time it was an excessive stimulus to business investment in view of
competing demands on the economy. In the Tax Reform Act of 1969 the
Congress went considerably beyond this. By changing a number of provisions of the tax law, it raised the tax burden on investment, through
higher levies on corporate profits, and thereby reduced both the supply of
internal funds available for business investment and the incentive to invest.
At the time the Administration suggested that if Congress considered the particular changes essential for reasons of equity or other considerations it should
offset their overall effect by reducing the corporate profits tax rate. Congress
did not, however, accept that suggestion.
The repeal of the investment tax credit, combined with the other features
of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, yielded a tax revision that was excessively
burdensome on business investment, and the Administration recognized that
this imbalance would need to be redressed at an early date. Surveys of business investment for the period immediately ahead now indicate a flattening
in money terms and probably some decline in real terms in this key ingredient
for future economic growth. This is an appropriate time to reduce the bur-




90

den on business investment. Accordingly, the President has announced a re^
vision of the depreciation rules that will provide greater incentive for business
to invest in capital equipment. This will be accomplished by permitting tax
lives which are shorter by 20 percent for most types of equipment. Although
the effects may build slowly, the stimulus to business investment will help
to support the recovery of the economy as well as to stimulate economic
growth and productivity.
THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON PRODUCTIVITY
Recognizing the importance of economic growth in the future of America
and the contribution that all sectors of the society could make to it, the
President in June 1970 established the National Commission on Productivity.
The Commission included representatives of business, labor, the general
public, and the Federal Government. Its basic function is to recommend
policies, not only for the Federal Government but for others as well, to
speed up the rise in productivity.
The Commission was established against the background of concern with
the inflation problem. The importance of productivity as an offset to increases in labor costs per hour is well recognized. However, the purposes
of productivity improvement and the interests of the Commission extend
beyond the control of inflation. Improvement in our levels of living, including improvement of our physical environment, depends on productivity
gains. The stakes here are high. If we could, for example, increase the rate of
productivity growth by only one-tenth of 1 percent a year, we could produce
$15 billion of additional output per year by the end of this decade.
In pursuit of its objectives the Commission has organized itself into four
working groups, designated by the general topic which each will examine.
They are:
1. Education and research.
2. Management organization and capital.
3. Labor and management policies and practices.
4. Government activities.
Each of the working groups has within its scope a large number of potential policy questions and programs for review. Each group will consider the
broad, aggregative issues coming under its jurisdiction—such as the impact
of education and of research and development on productivity; capital
investment needs and their implications for savings; practices in collective
bargaining that lead to higher productivity and higher rewards to workers;
and the influence of Government actions such as procurement, regulation,
and construction contracting. The Commission also plans to make studies or
recommendations about specific industries, especially where productivity is
relatively low; the utilization of scientific and technical manpower; and
methods of improving productivity in Federal, State, and local government.




ECONOMIC GROWTH AND NATIONAL PRIORITIES
If it is agreed that economic output is a good thing, it follows by definition
that there is not enough of it. This fact means in turn that choices must be
made among uses of it. Each of us is constantly encountering this necessity
in the management of his private affairs. By and large the way the national
output is used is decided by millions of decisions of private households. But
the question of how it ought to be used—commonly labeled the question of
national priorities—has been a matter of increasing national concern. There
are several reasons for this. First, the degree to which the Federal Government influences the uses of the national output has increased, and the degree and pattern of Federal influences that are desirable is itself an open question. Second, the validity of private decisions about the use of resources
is increasingly being challenged.
The effects that Federal policy may have on the uses of the national output are usually considered in the context of the annual budgetmaking and
appropriations process. The underlying notion is that a certain amount of
money, presumably representing claims on the national output, is to be allocated to Federal use and then divided up among alternative Federal uses,
such as defense, health, or highways. The annual budgetary process is essential because it forces periodic evaluation of many Federal programs, and it
will undoubtedly continue to be a basic framework for making decisions.
However, if we are to understand and control what we are doing, it is necessary to go beyond the annual allocation of the Federal budget total and
consider over a longer span of time and within a wider framework the Federal
influence on the allocation of the total national output.
There are several reasons for viewing national priorities in a larger context. One is that many Federal budget decisions strongly influence State
and local decisions as well as private decisions. It is often difficult to quantify exactly how and to what degree these other decisions will be affected,
but in some cases the influence is clearly substantial. There are many ways
in which Federal budget decisions influence private and State and local
decisions. The volume of Federal transfer payments affects the level and
composition of private consumption. The volume and character of Federal
grants-in-aid affect the level and character of expenditures by State and
local governments. The volume and character of Federal loans, interest
subsidies, and tax provisions affect the volume and character of private
investment. Federal provision of services and facilities, such as highways,
influences the level and character of private and State and local spending,
since these services and facilities in some cases compete with and discourage
non-Federal expenditures and in other cases complement and encourage
them.
Although it is often difficult to define precisely how these Federal decisions influence non-Federal decisions, the pervasiveness of the phenomenon means that the influence of Federal on non-Federal decisions cannot
be ignored. One major purpose behind the projections of GNP and its com-




92

ponents that were presented in the 1970 Economic Report of the President
and are continued this year is to account for some of the indirect effects of
Federal budget decisions.
A second major reason for analyzing Federal budget decisions in a broader
context is that the consequences of decisions almost always extend well beyond the annual reach of the budget. For example, the Housing and Urban
Development Act of 1968 stipulated a goal of 26 million housing units for
the 10-year period 1968-78. This Federal decision about national priorities
actually concerned the share of GNP devoted to housing, not the share of
the Federal budget related to housing. But it was also a declaration
which had an important bearing on the targets for national investment and
savings and on use of resources for the entire 1968—78 period. Such decisions
are, of course, not irrevocable and need to be reconsidered in the light of
changing conditions and goals. This is not, however, a substitute for initially
exercising as much foresight as possible. There are many other examples of
Federal laws or budget decisions that have important and long-lasting implications for the determination of national priorities. The recent act to increase
Federal pay commensurately with private wages and salaries links the Federal budget to wage increases in the private sector. The proposed automatic
increases in Social Security payments in response to increases in the consumer
price index is another example of budget decisions for the future that are
built into current law and are therefore beyond control except by further
legislation. Another extreme example that illustrates the degree to which
future decisions about priorities are made today is Federal loan subsidies.
Such subsidies may be very small for any one year, including the initial year,
but they do commit the budget to large and growing outlays in future years.
Sections 235 and 236 of the National Housing Act, for example, provide for
mortgage payments and interest subsidies entailing new commitments for
1971 amounting to an estimated $400 million. If the programs remain on the
books and new commitments continue at the 1971 rate, the annual outlay
would ultimately stabilize at $14 billion per year, since the subsidized mortgages have an average term of 35 years. While these programs are playing an
important role in the achievement of social objectives, they do limit flexibility
in changing the budget in the future and in changing the composition of
future national output.
A third reason for making projections for the entire economy rather than
for the budget only is that many Federal decisions which affect the allocation
of the national output do not pass through the Federal budget. This is true
of many regulatory decisions and decisions about monetary policy, for
example. A Federal decision to require antipollution devices will require
additional investment that can only be made at the expense of other uses of
our national output. This investment will then not be available for projects
that improve efficiency in the more orthodox sense, and therefore gains in
measured productivity may be smaller, product prices higher, and increases
in the array of goods and services available to consumers smaller. While this
93
411-364 0—71—7




decision to require antipollution devices does not enter the budget, it does
require or imply an important decision about national priorities and the uses
of national output.
The pervasive effects of Federal decisions throughout the rest of the
economy and through time require close scrutiny of Federal decisions to
ascertain their total impact. Unfortunately, many of the linkages are not well
known and can only be approximated at this time. Even such a rough outline,
however, may be more helpful than ignoring the problem entirely.

FUTURE NATIONAL OUTPUT AND CLAIMS UPON IT
This section presents estimates of the total output that would be available
in 1975-76 if the capacity of the economy were fully utilized. It also offers
some very tentative estimates of the uses that would be made of that output as a result of existing Federal programs and of the claims and propensities observed among private businesses, households and State and local
governments. The estimates are summarized in Table 26.
The procedures for deriving the potential supply of GNP and the visible
private and government demands when the economy is operating at potential are similar to those used in the 1970 Economic Report of the President.
The projections of Federal expenditures incorporated in the estimates are
shown in Table 27.
The gross national product available is estimated on the basis of assumed
characteristics of supply in the economy in the next 5 years. The principal
element in this computation is an assumed 3-percent trend rate of increase of
productivity (output per labor-hour) in the private economy. No method
exists for estimating precisely the productivity growth of the economy over
a long period, since it is subject to the rate of technical progress, the industrial
composition of output, the mobility of the labor force, and many other complex influences. Behind the assumption of 3-percent productivity growth is
an industrial composition of output that shifts fairly rapidly toward the service sector and the government sector. This shift toward sectors with historically low rates of productivity gain and low levels of productivity tends to
generate a lower rate of productivity increase for the entire economy. The
assumed rate of technical progress varies, of course, from industry to industry. The specific detail behind this productivity assumption is available in
Table A-15: The U.S. Economy in 1980, Bureau of Labor Statistics Bulletin
No. 1673. The total labor force and the civilian labor force are assumed to
rise about 1.8 percent per year in line with projections of the population
and of labor force participation rates. It is also assumed that average hours
worked will decline by 0.2 percent per year in the private sector.
These assumptions, and others about how output will rise as the total
labor force increases and about the private and government composition
of final output, yield a potential growth rate of GNP of about 4.3 percent.
The actual real GNP could in any year be above or below the potential,

though it is the object of policy to keep a reasonable balance between actual
and potential output. This chapter is concerned with the allocation of the
total output when it is equal to potential.
Briefly stated the other major components are determined as follows:
1. Claims on Available GNP. These are the sum of the demands for
output (items 2 through 7).
2. Federal Purchases. These involve a projection of the costs of existing
Federal programs and new initiatives proposed by the Administration.
The dollar costs of existing programs have been increased where this is
proper to allow for the growing population, the rising workload, Federal
pay increases, and relative price increases of the goods the Federal Government buys. These dollar costs are then deflated to 1969 prices.
3. State and Local Purchases. The growth of these purchases in real
terms is assumed to be a function of the rise in real GNP, Federal grantsin-aid, and the population.
4. Personal Consumption. Purchases by consumers are assumed to be a
function of real GNP, Federal personal taxes, State and local taxes, Federal
transfers, State and local transfers, and a level of personal saving that
averages 6.5 percent of personal disposable income.
5. Business Fixed Investment. In real terms this component is estimated
to be about 12 percent of real private GNP in 1976. This proportion has
been adjusted upwards from the assumption used in the 1970 Economic
Report of the President because of the shortfall of actual below expected
investment in 1970 and 1971 and because of the effects of the recently
adopted accelerated depreciation allowances.
6. Residential Construction. In real terms this component is estimated to
follow a path that achieves the 26 million housing units explicitly called for
in the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968.
7. Inventory Investment and Net Exports. Both are expected to rise slowly
at about the same rate as total real GNP.
According to these estimates, present programs and tendencies would
leave unallocated to any specified use 1 to 2 percent of the potential output
in 1975-76. This does not mean that this proportion will find no demand
and will therefore remain unproduced. Whether that happens or
not will depend on factors such as fiscal and monetary policy discussed elsewhere in this report. What it does mean is that the simple relationships
used here do not tell how that 1 to 2 percent of the potential output will
be used. There are various possibilities for its use. If the economy is kept at
its potential by monetary policy, for example, then an excess supply of
savings implicit in the projected excess supply of output would depress
interest rates; it would probably also reduce planned saving and raise investment, including residential construction. Another possibility is that taxes
would be reduced, presumably with the effect of increasing private consumption and perhaps investment. A third possibility would be an increase




96

of Federal expenditures; in that case the effects on the pattern of output
would depend on the nature of the expenditure.
The estimates also reveal a Federal budget surplus in the national income
accounts of about 2 to 3 percent of potential output in 1975-76. This surplus
does not by itself explain the existence of unallocated resources. In fact, as
Table 26 shows, there were substantial surpluses in 1955 and 1969, when
obviously there was no unallocated output, and actual output was approximately at the potential. So in 1975-76 the unallocated resources could be
used without reducing the surplus. Still, two of the three methods listed above
for allocating the unallocated resources—increasing expenditures and reducing taxes—would also reduce the budget surplus. In the simplest case, if all
the unallocated resources were devoted to Federal purchases, the annual
surpluses would be reduced to about 1 percent of potential output—which
would be about the same as in 1955 or 1969. These surpluses would be an
addition to private saving to finance private investment and State and local
deficits.
However, the lesson in the estimates is not that there are unallocated resources for the mid-1970's, but that they are already so small There is a
natural tendency in the political process to add commitments for continuing
expenditures while clipping away—slow7ly and gradually, or occasionally
with bigger strokes—at the revenues. The margin for these actions is already
small. Adding $3 billion each year to the cost of existing programs, in
1969 dollars, would exhaust the unallocated economic resources that now
appear for 1975-76. To insist on doing more, taking the expenditure and
revenue sides of the budget together, would draw resources from other uses.
If the lid were kept on the economy by tight money to prevent inflation,
high interest rates would tend to draw these resources out of housing, State
and local government outlays, and business fixed investment. If inflation were
permitted, the share of the national income going to taxes would rise and cut
real consumption. With higher prices there would be higher money incomes,
but taxes would rise still more rapidly, since the Federal tax system is progressive. This is the simplest way in which excessive Government spending or a
reduction of nominal tax rates restores the effective tax rate needed to equate
aggregate supply with aggregate demand.
The estimates presented here reveal an increase in real consumption between 1969 and 1976 that is much faster than occurred from 1955 to 1969. In
the earlier period real per capita consumption increased only 2.2 percent a
year, while in the period ahead it is estimated to rise by 3.6 percent a year.
Most of this difference is due to an expected faster rise in per capita output
in the later period—3.1 percent against 2.1 percent. This estimated rise
is in turn the result of the projected faster growth of the labor force relative to population in the years ahead. The remainder of the difference results
from a faster increase in the share of consumption in the GNP, due mainly to
reductions of tax rates and an increase of transfer payments. The reduction of
taxes, the increase in transfer payments, and the consequent increase in the




97

consumption share are made possible by a reduction in Federal purchases, a
reduction that shows up absolutely and even more as a share of the potential
output. It is mainly a consequence of the projected absolute and relative
decline of defense spending in real terms.
The sum of the growth in available resources and the decline in Federal
purchases between 1969 and 1976 may be viewed as a "peace and growth
dividend." It amounts to $338 billion in 1969 dollars. About 66 percent
of this would be absorbed by personal consumption according to the estimates presented here, almost 10 percent by State and local purchases, and
the remainder, including 6 percent which still is unallocated, by the other
categories.
The share of State and local purchases in the total remains almost unchanged despite the effect of revenue sharing, which is estimated to add
about $5 billion in 1969 dollars to State and local purchases by 1975. This
means that per capita State and local purchases would be rising at a slightly
lower rate than per capita output, about 2.6 percent a year in real terms
compared with 3.8 percent from 1955 to 1969. During the years ahead the
school-age population will be increasing much less rapidly than in the
earlier period; since education counts for a very large proportion of the
cost of State and local governments, we should therefore expect a slower
increase in per capita State and local services.
The present estimate of unallocated resources in 1975 is slightly smaller
than was estimated in last year's Economic Report of the President. Many
of the components have changed but tended to have offsetting effects on the
level of unallocated resources. On the one hand, the Federal budget, especially in transfers, grew much more rapidly than was projected a year ago,
a fact which has tended to increase private consumption and State and local
spending and to reduce the unallocated portion. On the other hand, the
higher inflation than was expected in the last year has increased "real"
Federal personal tax receipts at full employment (because of the progressiveness of the tax system) ; as a consequence projected private consumption
has been reduced because the relatively higher Federal personal taxes reduce
disposable income. More succinctly, higher inflation rates act like a tax on
real income, but the rapid growth of transfer payments has sustained real
disposable income.
ALLOCATION OF THE NATIONAL
AMONG FUNCTIONS

OUTPUT

For many purposes the discussion above covering the past and prospective uses of the national output classified by the purchaser (Federal, State
and local governments, consumers, businesses) is significant. We are interested in the buyers who will claim the output and the size of the different
markets that will absorb it. But "priorities" are also reflected in the distribution of the national output by functions or uses, such as health and educa-




tion, regardless of who is the purchaser. There is, for example, interest in
how much of the national output is devoted to education, and whether it is
paid for privately, by State and local governments, or by the Federal
Government.
This section presents estimates of the allocation of the national output by
certain broad functions and also the share that Government expenditures
represent in the total for each function. It should be noted that the estimates
are crude in many respects, the existing national accounts statistics not having been developed for the uses made of them here. The following discussion
is offered as much to illustrate a fruitful approach that deserves more work
as to suggest substantive conclusions.
The share of Government expenditures in a functional category is not an
adequate measure of the amount of the total that is'"due to" Government,
with the implication that the total would be correspondingly lower if the
Government's share were lower. Obviously, Government cannot be adding
to the share of all functions. The output would be divided among all the
functions somehow even if there were no Government. It cannot even be
assumed that Government always enlarges those functions when it spends
more than the average. Government expenditures on occasion may displace
private or State and local expenditures—or it may attract them. Nevertheless, the figures provide an initial basis for thinking about how the national
output is used and how the Federal Government may be influencing the
process.
The allocation of the national output over the past 15 years is shown in
Table 28. The appendix to this chapter gives a more exact definition of the
different functions. The years that were chosen for Table 28 are years when
the economy was at or near full employment; the comparisons between these
years are therefore not affected by substantial differences in the economy's
operating rate.

Changes over the past 15 years have been substantial but are not unexpected. With the advance in per capita incomes, it is not surprising that




99

spending for basic necessities, such as food, clothing, and rents (actual and
imputed), has declined in relation to GNP. There has also been a general
trend away from defense and housing investment.
The sectors where strong growth in demand has occurred are education,
health, and general government. The general government category includes
expenditures for fire and police departments and natural resource programs,
including pollution abatement. Those sectors where expenditures are increasing are also the sectors where prices have risen very rapidly. If the
GNP and its functional components were adjusted for these relative price
increases, the distribution of the functional components would be different,
and shifts in the distribution probably would not be as marked.
The role of the Federal Government in this shift in the character of output
has been important. It is simple to measure the direct Federal and State and
local purchases in each of the functional categories. But the direct share of
national output that the Federal Government purchases does not fully
represent its influence in determining the composition of national output.
For example, the Federal Government influences the functional composition
of GNP through its grants programs. Large grants have been made to State
and local governments, and these grants, which are tied to particular uses,
have accounted for an increasing portion of the Federal budget. Also, transfer programs, such as Medicare, have been increasing rapidly in recent years.
These transfers are often tied to particular end uses of GNP, and so they are
also important determinants of the final composition of GNP. Table 29
lists the functional composition of the Federal budget.

The direct and indirect share of the national output for each function that
can be traced back to total Federal expenditures is shown in Table 30. The
general trends toward education and health care are evident in this table
because the Federal contribution in these areas is made primarily through
grants and transfers. It is assumed here that a transfer or a grant for a specific
function is equivalent to a direct purchase by the Federal Government. This




ioo

is a reasonable assumption because many of the grants and transfers for these
purposes are directly tied to purchases by the private sector or by State and
local government sectors.

Transfers and grants that are not tied to specific purchases in a sector are
assigned to "basic necessities." For example, Federal welfare payments and
Social Security payments are rarely tied to specific purchases, but it may be
assumed that they are used by and large for food, clothing, and rents. On
this assumption, it is evident that the Federal share in this sector has grown
very rapidly in the past 15 years.
Finally, the total public share of these functions—both direct and indirect—is shown in Table 31. This table is similar to Table 30 except that
it emphasizes the important traditional role of State and local governments in
such functions as general government and education.

IOI

What do these data suggest about the uses of the Nation's output? While
the estimates are tentative and involve more than the usual quota of statistical uncertainties, several conclusions are at least suggested.
First, it is clear that since the mid-1950's the Nation has been increasing
steadily the share of its economic resources devoted to education and manpower training, health, general government, and business investment.
In effect we made room for their rising shares by reducing the proportion of
our economic resources devoted to national defense, residential construction,
and basic necessities. Since prices rose most rapidly in those markets where
productivity growth wras low and demand was strong, changes in the pattern
of output would be more moderate if output were expressed in constant
prices throughout, but the same pattern would be evident. This is a judgment
that cannot be verified for the economy as a whole with existing price deflators; it can be verified, however, and is true for the private sector of the
economy. Since the decline in resources absorbed by the provision of basic
necessities was small, and would be expected in an economy with rising
incomes, the significant shift was from national defense and residential
construction to education, health, business capital formation, and general
government.
Second, the data provide some indication of the extent to which public
budgets have led the way in changing national priorities. The question itself
is, however, a difficult one. Growing government outlays for a function
which is itself growing in importance would suggest that this government
activity was resulting in the allocation of more total economic resources to
that function. Indeed, an increment of public outlays may attract private
resources to the same use. Government's influence on the allocation of
resources might, however, work the other way. If the Government assumes
more direct responsibility for certain functions, private claims on resources
may be increasingly devoted to other functions. Therefore we cannot be
certain that more resources are being used in those areas where Government
contributions have increased. Government inevitably provides all services for
some functions such as general government or national defense through
public budgets, and it therefore has direct control over the share of the
national output devoted to these functions.
Nevertheless, in spite of the ambiguities in the interaction of public and
private decisions, some things can be said about the impact of government
fiscal activities on changes in the use of our economic resources. For one
thing, public outlays, as indicated in Table 31, have been growing in importance relative to the size of the economy. They have risen from an amount
equal to 23.2 percent of GNP in 1955 to 29.6 percent in 1969, the growth
being about evenly divided between Federal outlays and outlays of State and
local government units. The most dramatic and clear-cut effect of public
budgets on uses of output seems to have occurred in health-related outlays.
The share of our total economic output used for health care rose from 4.1
percent of GNP in 1955 to 6.4 percent in 1969. And the share of these out-




102

lays that was financed by public expenditures rose dramatically from 23.4
percent in 1955 to 39.9 percent 14 years later. Public outlays also increased
as a share of the total economic resources devoted to basic necessities, housing, and transportation.
Within the public sector the Federal Government increased its share
in financing most of the categories of uses of output, health expenditures
being the most striking example, with housing expenditures next. State and
local governments, however, are providing a larger share of total general
government services than in 1955.
These data suggest that there are many different forces influencing the
final composition of the national output. Most of these express themselves
in the private sector of the economy, primarily because it is still the largest
sector. There has been a marked shift in the composition of the Federal
budget, but that shift is only weakly translated into a similar shift in the
composition of national output. However, it is important to recognize that
some Government programs are designed to change not the composition
of final output but the distribution of income. For example, the growth in
Federal expenditures associated with basic necessities is related to the large
increases in income maintenance payments between 1955 and 1969. This
type of program is designed primarily to redistribute income and not to
change the functional allocation of the GNP. Consequently, expansion of
programs to redistribute income could very well have substantial, little,
or no effect on the functional allocation of GNP. This means that neither
the breakdown of GNP by purchasers given in Table 26 nor the functional
breakdown of GNP given in Table 28 is a completely appropriate framework for the analysis of government policies designed to change income
distribution.
CONCLUSION
The illustrative projections of GNP and the claims on GNP establish a
broad framework for the analysis of priority decisions.
Federal budget decisions influence many of the demand components of
GNP, and this influence will be quite pervasive in the next 5 years. The
magnitude of demands on resources according to this long-range outlook is
very great when consideration is given to projections of existing tax and
expenditure programs. The potential output left over after visible claims
are met is small. If new claims are to be satisfied beyond that, some existing
claims will have to be cut. This can be done by tax or expenditure changes.
Such changes require explicit decisions which are difficult to make, but they
are necessary if a significant shift in the composition of output is desired.
One alternative to making hard choices is inflation, since inflation is a
process by which competitive claims on output are finally arbitrated. But
this is a capricious way to resolve these conflicting demands.
When the allocation of GNP among certain functional components is examined, it is clear that there have been substantial changes in the past 15
years. Most of these changes are attributable directly to private decisions,




103

since many of the Federal budget changes were not closely related to changes
in the allocation of GNP. This reflects the fact that the private sector is by
far the largest sector in the economy, and there are probably some important
substitutions between private decisions and Federal budget decisions.

APPENDIX

Definitions of Functional Components
The composition of each of the eight functional components of GNP
(basic necessities, education and manpower, health, transportation, general
government, defense, new housing, and all other) is described below. Each
function is defined as the sum of private purchases and government purchases. The sum of the eight functions, together with business fixed investment, the change in inventories, and net exports, comprises GNP. Private
expenditures were obtained from the Survey of Current Business, Table 2.5:
Personal Consumption Expenditures by Type of Product. The source of
the government expenditures was Table 3.10: Government Expenditures by
Type of Function. Federal purchases and State and local purchases were
added to obtain total government purchases.
The government sector contributes directly to the functions through purchases and indirectly through transfer payments. Within the government
sector, the Federal Government contributes to the State and local expenditures through grants-in-aid. A more detailed description of the functional
categories and the data used are available from the Council of Economic
Advisers.
The descriptions below broadly identify the functional components that
are used in the national income accounts and were arranged to form eight
principal functional categories. The descriptions do not attempt to justify
the inclusion or exclusion of different kinds of spending in different functional categories. It is often difficult to determine in any precise way how the
categories should be defined, and in the classification process there are many
serious problems that cannot be resolved without some judgment. But it is
hoped that the composition of the final output and the trends in the relative
shares of the categories are not seriously affected by the ambiguities of
classification.
It is worth noting again that these GNP components do not measure intermediate products that often serve a useful purpose aside from their contribution to the real value of the final product. On-the-job training is a good
example of an educational function that is not counted as real output.
Furthermore, the functional categories are not wholly consistent since the
functional categories for government spending are only partly consistent
with those for private spending. There are other shortcomings of these data,




104

but they are probably sufficiently accurate to present a broad view of the
composition of output.
Education
Under education are included private expenditures on education and
research, together with government expenditures on education, on the education and training of veterans, and on labor.
Health
In the private sector the health expenditures consist of medical care expenses, and in the government sector expenditures cover health and hospitals, veterans' hospitals and medical care, Medicare, and Medicaid.
Transportation
In the private sector the transportation category consists of expenditures on
transportation, excluding the purchases of mobile homes, which come under
basic necessities. The public sector includes outlays on highways, water and
air transportation, and transit.
Basic Necessities
The function labeled basic necessities contains several different parts. The
private sector includes expenditures on food and tobacco, clothing, accessories
and jewelry, personal care, housing (rents and the purchase of mobile
homes), household operation, and religious and welfare activities. The government sector purchases include purchases for public utilities (electricity,
water and gas), for agriculture and agricultural resources, and for social security and special welfare. Most transfer payments not given for specific purposes are included as indirect government contributions to basic necessities,
since they are assumed to support private purchases of food, clothing, and
rents. These transfers are principally in the form of veterans' pensions, welfare payments, unemployment compensation, and Social Security payments.
New Housing
Expenditures on new housing included in this function are private investment in residential structures (National Income Accounts, Table 1.1) and
government expenditures on public housing, urban renewal, and community development. The government sector has a negative value for housing in 1955 because some housing built in World War II was sold by the
Federal Government to the private sector.
Defense
The defense function is defined as government defense purchases, excluding atomic energy expenditures. There are no private sector purchases associated with defense. The State and local functions in this sector pertain to
the National Guard.




105

General Government
The general government function consists of government purchases in
general government administration, sanitation, civilian safety (fire, police,
correction), and natural resources (conservation and recreation). There
are, of course, no private expenditures for general government.
All Other
The function labeled all other contains expenditures on those activities not
included in the other seven categories. In the private sector are thus included
personal business, recreation, and foreign travel. In the public sector are
included atomic energy development, space research and technology, international affairs and finance, regulation of commerce and finance, and postal
services.

CHAPTER 4

Economic Growth and the Efficient Use of
Resources

W

E ARE, AS THE ANALYSIS IN CHAPTER 3 MAKES CLEAR,
at the beginning of a decade during which claims on our productive
resources will be unusually intense. In addition to continuously rising demands for goods and services for private and public use, urgent new claims
on our economic resources have also emerged, such as the call for an improved environment. While the growth in our productive capability will
also be rapid, 50 percent during this decade being a reasonable expectation,
we must think in new terms about the deployment and organization of our
economic resources if this growth is to be reasonably balanced. The purpose
of this chapter is to explore selected program and policy issues that will
require some new thinking if our economic system is to make its maximum
contribution to national well-being.
The success of our economic system in achieving this goal requires that
the full social cost be paid for the use of resources. Most of our productive resources are, of course, privately owned and can only be used if they are
compensated according to their cost. The worker must be paid for his labor;
the property owner expects a return for the use of his investment in land
or productive facilities. Competition in the free market will normally
lead to the optimal use of these resources. Under certain circumstances,
however, the cost to society as a whole will not be the same as the
private cost of the resources. For example, when a person drives his car
during the rush hour he pays the cost of the gasoline he uses; but he pays
none of the cost of the additional congestion he helps create, except to the
relatively small extent that he himself is adversely affected. This means that
resources may not always be allocated in a way which best serves the national welfare.
Social costs may exceed or fall short of private costs for many different
reasons. For example, when there is no clear private ownership of a resource, the market cannot operate in such a way that the consumer pays
the full social cost. When a monopoly controls a good or service, the price
will tend to be above both the private and the social cost of production.
Government regulation of prices or output can also force prices above or




107

below true social costs; examples in the fields of transportation and energy
will be discussed in this chapter.
In cases where goods are overpriced or underpriced compared with
their true social cost, their consumption patterns tend to be distorted and
the value of national output is diminished. A striking example of this problem, recently and forcibly brought to public attention, is the underpricing
of clean air and water in many communities. Because there are no property
rights for the air and for most bodies of water, air and water have traditionally been treated as free goods to be used at no cost for disposal of wastes.
This arrangement does not necessarily cause problems. As long as the wastes
do not exceed its assimilative capacity, the environment itself performs valuable services free. But when the assimilative capability of the environment is
exceeded, pollution imposes real physical and psychic costs on the community. Clean air and water are then no longer free for society as a whole.
The growing number of such cases has led to numerous demands for
Government action.
In other areas where Government has intervened to set prices for certain
goods and services and otherwise to control their availability, the results
have often prevented the efficient use of resources. Many Government regulatory policies, for example, were formulated under conditions which no
longer exist, and these policies may have to be reconsidered if we are to
have the growth and efficiency in our economic system to meet rapidly
mounting claims on output.

POPULATION GROWTH AND ECONOMIC GROWTH
The growth of population and its concentration in metropolitan areas
have raised increasingly urgent questions bearing on public policy and the
efficiency and growth patterns of our economy. Historically, a growing and
mobile population has been a major source of economic development in
the United States. The waves of migration and the push, westward encouraged by our early land settlement policies accelerated the process of converting an undeveloped land into the world's most productive economy. As
the population grew and spread over the country, agriculture, transportation,
manufacturing, and commerce expanded dramatically. Large markets stimulated production and permitted economies of scale to be realized. Although
the population is now growing at a lower rate than in the past, the absolute
increase continues to be high. The population has also remained unusually
mobile, and this mobility has helped people find the jobs for which they are
best suited. Along with industrialization, there has been steady migration
to urban centers, where economic, social, and cultural opportunities are
more abundant, but where new problems are being created. Conversely,
the problems in many rural areas are those associated with a declining
population.




108

GROWTH AND SIZE: IMPLICATIONS

The magnitude of these changes is striking. Since the first census in 1790,
the U.S. population has increased from 3.9 million to 205 million. Economic
growth, as measured by real GNP, has proceeded even more rapidly than
population growth. In the past 60 years, population has increased by 122
percent while real GNP increased sixfold, so that per capita real GNP
increased by 171 percent (Chart 7). Historically, then, population growth
has clearly not prevented a rapid rise in levels of living as reflected in GNP
(see Chapter 3 for conceptual limitations).

The role of population growth in the country's future economic development is less clear cut. While population growth can be expected to lead to
growth in total output, the key question is whether it will continue to bring
about or be associated with growth in output per capita. With as large a
population as ours and with our opportunities for trading with other coun109
411-364 0—71


tries, we may have exhausted many economies of scale. The past conjunction
of rapid population growth and rapid economic growth does not imply that
population growth is necessary for economic growth in the future.
Indeed many people are asking whether population growth may even be
detrimental to further growth of output per capita or of some more comprehensive measure of individual well-being. While there appears to be
no immediate threat, it is less clear that we can be equally sanguine about
the next century. Population projections point toward a substantial further
growth in the number of people. According to the "high" census projection, 321 million persons will be living in the United States in the year 2000,
and the numbers will rise to 440 million in 2020. The "low" census projection estimates 266 million persons in 2000, and 299 million in 2020. Even if
the fertility rate were to drop now to the level required for an eventually
stable population, and no further immigration occurred, the population
would not actually stabilize until the year 2037 because of the high proportion of young people in the present population. At that time, there would be
about 276 million people in the United States.
Why are questions now being raised about the impact of population
growth when such a rise in the numbers of people did not prevent, and
indeed may have encouraged, the Nation's economic growth during most
of its history? The present concern centers on the limited supply of certain
types of resources. While it is impossible to specify the future adaptations in
technology and consumption patterns that will conserve resources, past experience indicates that many unforeseen ways of meeting demands will
be found. But some natural resources could become much more costly than
they are now. Costs have risen, for example, as poorer deposits of minerals
have been extracted and as water and other resources are recycled. The costs
in terms of environmental damage, or in terms of the resources used to prevent such damage, will also increase. Certain natural scenic areas are almost
fixed in supply; and, as they become more crowded, they may provide less
enjoyment for those who use them.
Some of these problems will arise because of our increasing affluence, not
because there are more people. Even by the year 2020 the high census
projection would give us a population density of only 124 persons per
square mile, about one-fourth that in Western Europe today. Each person
will, however, demand more manufactured products, more housing, more
transportation, more recreation, and more services, and this will affect
environmental conditions. Rising affluence is at least as important as a
growing population in creating additional demands on the supply of natural
resources. At the same time, increased affluence makes it easier to bear
the costs that thereby arise. The same factory that could well be denied a
place in a rich country because it creates pollution would be welcomed in
a low income country because it creates jobs. And more costly production
processes which cause less pollution can be used in factories that do locate
in a rich country.

POPULATION DISTRIBUTION
Many of the problems that are commonly attributed to excessive population in the United States are actually caused by uneven distribution
(Chart 8). We now have only 58 persons per square mile, about oneeighth of the density in Western Europe and less than one-tenth of Japan's.
The density of the population, however, varies greatly within the United
States. It ranges from 5,327 persons per square mile in the New York City
area to 3.4 for Wyoming, and Alaska has only one person for each 2 square
miles. Although areas with the lowest density at present have always been
sparsely populated, the population of many rural areas has declined. The
proportion of the population living in urban areas has been increasing
steadily and now comprises more than 70 percent of the total.
An important factor in the changing distribution of population is the
shifting composition of national output. When the country was largely
agricultural, settlement was heavily influenced by the distribution of arable
land. A substantial share of the population not employed directly in agriculture was employed in serving the agricultural population. Because of
high transportation costs these persons located close to the farming areas.
A multitude of small centers served the everyday needs of farmers, while
larger, more widely spaced centers undertook activities which were needed
less frequently or in which there were substantial economies of scale. As with
agriculture, clusters of people also developed around such natural resource
industries as forestry, mining, and fishing.
These primary industries no longer have a major influence on the distribution of population. The farm population, for instance, is now less
than 5 percent of the U.S. total, compared to 15 percent in 1950 and 35
percent in 1910. The relatively slow growth of industries dependent on
natural resources, the efficiency with which people and goods can be moved,
and the more rapid expansion of manufacturing and service industries
have encouraged further expansion of the already large population centers.
These centers provide opportunities for specialization and economies of
scale that would otherwise be impossible.
The distribution of populations within cities is also affected by changing
cost factors. The lower the cost of transportation and the higher the value
of spacious living, the more people will spread out around centers. As
people spread out to the suburbs, industries follow. The factors that affect
the distribution of people and jobs tend to reinforce each other. Jobs move
in search of people and people move searching for jobs. As a result an
initially small change in activity at a center can eventually have a large
impact on its size.
The consequences of the tendencies discussed above can be seen in the
population statistics. The population of the 24 metropolitan areas of more
than a million people in 1960 grew 14 percent between 1960 and 1970,
as compared to 10 percent for the remainder of the country. Metropolitan
areas with more than a million persons now contain 39 percent of the total

population. At the same time, the population within metropolitan areas is
shifting from the central city to the suburban fringe. Fifty-seven percent
of the people in metropolitan areas of more than a million lived outside
the central city in 1970, compared to 51 percent in 1960. In 1969, families
living in metropolitan areas of a million or more had average incomes 13
percent higher than those of families in smaller metropolitan areas and 37
percent higher than those of families outside metropolitan areas. (These
figures do not take account of differentials in living costs.)
Concentration of people and economic activity, however, involves costs
as wrell as benefits. Unless actions are taken to offset the effects of concentration, traffic congestion and air pollution increase with city size. Commuting
time rises and recreation areas become less accessible. Expenditures for
police protection, welfare, and waste disposal are higher per person in very
large cities than in smaller ones.
These costs of larger cities do not necessarily mean that cities should
be smaller. The fact that people continue to move to large cities implies that
they believe they can gain more there than the costs they incur, though costs
imposed on others, such as higher welfare payments or increased congestion
and pollution, may make large concentrations inefficient. If cities are too
large to be efficient or are poorly organized, the problem can be traced in
large part to a failure to charge people for all the costs they impose or to
reward them fully for the benefits of their action.
Traffic congestion provides a clear example of problems that arise when
costs to users fall short of total social costs. When congestion occurs, every
additional car on the streets increases travel costs for all other vehicles. Yet
no driver is required to pay for these costs that he imposes on others. Nor
is there any compensation for a person w7ho leaves the streets, permitting
others to travel faster. A more efficient use of streets would occur if people
were to pay in some way for the consequences of their actions. It has been
suggested, for example, that people should have to buy special permits to
operate cars in congested areas during rush hours, or that a charge for
congestion might be collected through parking lots.
The movement of population to metropolitan areas also creates problems
for declining rural areas. As population density falls, the range of goods and
services offered in an area shrinks. The outmigration of working-age people
lowers per capita incomes and makes it more difficult to finance social
services. Because of declining travel costs, more and more people who work
in outlying areas live in nearby small cities, though the opposite also occurs.
As the labor markets in these cities attain a sufficient size, they may also
attract industrial employers. Some small cities are already experiencing rapid
growth as many business operations and government facilities have been
located in such areas.
Last year the President appointed the Commission on Population Growth
and the American Future. The Commission is now examining how population growth will affect the quality of life and how all levels of government




"3

can best respond to the demands posed by population growth and its distribution. Its work should help the Nation to make better choices among
alternative ways of using some scarce resources.
SAFEGUARDING THE ENVIRONMENT
As the economy grows, more waste of various types is produced. This does
not cause major problems as long as the population is widely dispersed and
the environment is not overloaded. As the population is increasingly concentrated in urban areas, however, the assimilative capacity of the environment in these areas tends to be exceeded. It then becomes more and more
important that these limited environmental resources be used to the best
advantage.
While it might be tempting to say that no one should be allowed to do
any polluting, such a ban would require the cessation of virtually all economic activity. Since society places a value both on material goods and on
clean air and water, arrangements must be devised that permit the value
we place on each to determine our choices. Additional industrial development, increased use of pesticides on farms, and a growing volume of municipal sewage mean dirtier water downstream and fewer opportunities for
recreation. On the other hand, stricter rules for pollution control generally
mean either higher taxes or higher prices for goods. What we seek, therefore, is a set of rules for use of the environment which balances the advantages of each activity against its costs in other activities forgone. We
w7ant to eliminate pollution only when the physical and aesthetic discomfort
it creates and its damage to people and things are more costly than the value
of the good things—the abundance of industrial or farm products and efficient transportation—whose production has caused the pollution.
One of the ways that the competing claims on environmental resources
could be balanced is through the development of "new towns" and resort
communities. In these cases, a developer essentially buys title to a whole
community's environment. He then has an economic incentive to avoid
excessive damage to that environment. If, for example, he lets a factory
buy the right to locate in the community even though it would substantially damage the community's environment, the value of potential residential property will thereby be lowered. Only when the advantages of
industrial activity, such as increased income, outweigh the environmental
disadvantages would the developer permit the factory to locate there. The
same incentives would operate to limit pollution from such activities as
municipal waste disposal.
The concept of unified development does not provide much guidance
for solving pollution problems in areas that are already developed. With
substantial capital invested in existing industrial facilities, a company that
must pay large additional costs for pollution control may find continuing
operations economically infeasible. A major change in liability for pollution costs may, in effect, expropriate the capital of some even while it




114

enhances that of others. Nearby homeowners, on the other hand, may feel
that pollution has always been harmful, and that its existence in the past
does not justify its continuation.
This kind of dispute is central to the pollution problem and has become
increasingly widespread as the various users of air and water seek to assert
their claims to the limited environmental resources. A solution requires
procedures and rules for the use of clean air and water that permit an
orderly settlement of the competing claims on these limited resources, and
that take account of the fact that these resources are not inexhaustible. The
homeowner, the factory owner, and the farmer cannot simultaneously enjoy unlimited use of air and water. Industry and agriculture must recognize
the new sense of urgency and concern about environmental problems. At
the same time we must not overlook the fact that people also want more
and more of the jobs and products of farms and factories.
SOCIAL ROLE OF PROPERTY RIGHTS
Problems similar to those arising from pollution have frequently been
handled by granting private title to limited resources. Agricultural and
forest land were once common property with poorly defined usage rights.
As demands on these resources grew, their use by one party inflicted damage on others. The adjudication of conflicting claims to these resources by
granting private title to them served the important social purpose of providing an incentive for these resources to be used more efficiently.
Air and water resources are harder to divide into meaningful private
parcels than land. If each landowner had title to clean air around his property, a factory in New York that would emit air pollutants might have to
deal with 8 million "property owners," making it difficult to operate any
factories at all.
Because private property arrangements cannot be applied generally to
our air and water resources, environmental problems connected with their
use have to be solved within a framework of common property. The procedures and rules that we develop for resources regarded as common property
must encourage their efficient use., just as would be true if they were private property.
A set of rules for the efficient use of air and water should not only permit
no more fouling of air and water than we wish to tolerate, but it should
also ensure that the tolerated degree of pollution occurs for the most productive reasons. The rules should also encourage the use of resources to
limit the damage done by the pollution that is allowed. Finally, the rules
and procedures should not themselves entail a higher cost of administration
and enforcement than the cost of having no rules.
Specific Rules
As our society has become increasingly aware of the conflicting claims
on air and water, specific rules have been developed for the use of these




"5

resources that recognize their limited nature. As early as 1899 a Federal law
was passed regulating the disposal of waste in rivers and harbors. However,
only with recent legal opinions and legislation has it become clear that the
law could be used to reduce pollution, and the President has recently issued
an Executive Order to use the law in this way.
Two problems must be faced in setting up rules for use of the environment. First, it must be decided how much pollution, if any, will be tolerated and under what circumstances changes in this amount will be permitted. Toward this end, the Federal Government has established the
Environmental Protection Agency. This Agency, together with State and
local authorities, develops standards for ambient air and water quality.
These standards are statements of environmental quality goals considered
desirable for particular areas or for the Nation as a whole. Since past arrangements, which imposed no cost on those who polluted the environment, led to excessive pollution, these air and water quality goals have uniformly sought reduction of pollution. Once such goals are developed,
the next problem is to devise a system of rules for attaining them. Particular polluters must be led to change their actions so that, in fact, less pollution
is produced. The Federal Government and other authorities have also been
active in devising rules to implement attainment of environmental goals.
Foremost among the new rules has been the setting of Government standards applicable to particular pollution sources. Under this system, the Government requires that each source reduce its emissions of pollutants by an
amount sufficient to keep the total of all emissions within the environmental
quality standard. All sources are ordinarily required to reduce emissions
by the same percentage. For example, under recently enacted amendments
to the Clean Air Act of 1967, cars of the 1975 model year will have to reduce
emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons by 90 percent from 1970
levels. While such Government standards have been applied most extensively to automobiles, similar standards are now being developed and
implemented for other pollution sources.
This system of Government standards provides one mechanism for
attaining environmental goals that recognizes the increasing scarcity of environmental resources. If this system is to generate efficient results, the goal
must, of course, be appropriate. That is, the control of emissions that is
required at each source must produce a high enough quality of air and
water so that further improvements is not worth the costs of further control.
If Government standards are to achieve the best use of environmental resources, there must also be substantial uniformity of the cost of control
among pollution sources. Where these costs differ, the same environmental
quality could be attained more cheaply by having the source with low
control costs undertake more control than the source with high costs; but
this would not occur if uniform standards were applied to all sources. The
standards might, of course, be made nonuniform to account for differences
in control cost, but only at considerable administrative cost because the




n6

Government agency setting the standards would need detailed knowledge
about many different pollution-causing activities. It is also difficult politically
to set variable standards. Many, including of course the owner, would think
it unfair to penalize a plant with low control costs for its efficiency in pollution control by imposing an especially tough standard on such a plant.
Differences in control cost were perhaps an unimportant problem when
attention focused on automobile exhausts. While there are some differences
among types of cars in the cost of controlling exhaust emissions, the common technology of the internal combustion engine limited these differences
and seemed to justify the application of common standards to all cars.
In other cases a pollutant may prove so damaging that a common standard,
namely, an outright ban on all discharges, would also be called for even
if there are differences in control costs. However, as attention focuses on
industrial and agricultural pollutants that are not to be eliminated completely, differences in control cost will prove to be more of a problem.
Particular pollutants are emitted from sources with diverse processes, sizes,
and ages; and large differences in the cost of control can be expected. For
example, sulphur oxides, which are one of the most damaging pollutants of
the air, are emitted by electric powerplants, steel mills, nonferrous metal
smelters, and home-heating systems. The differences in the size of these
sources and the diversity of their processes make it almost certain that a
given reduction of sulphur oxides cannot be accomplished at the same cost
at each source. It is already known that there are economies of scale in
sulphur oxide abatement, so that, for example, a given degree of control
could be attained less expensively at one large powerplant than in many
home-heating systems.
One way that differences in control costs could be taken into account would
be to set "prices" for the use of the air and water. If each potential polluter
were faced with a price for each unit of pollutant he discharged, he would
have to compare this with the costs of pollution control in his particular circumstance. If control costs were relatively low, he wrould engage in extensive
control to avoid paying the price being charged for polluting. If control
costs were high, less control would be undertaken. Since sources with low
control costs would carry out more than average control and those with high
control costs less than average, a given level of environmental quality could
be attained with expenditure of less productive resources than if all sources
had to meet a common standard. At the same time, discovery of new techniques to control pollution would be encouraged, because every reduction
in pollution would lower the payments for the right to emit pollutants. Of
course, a price system, like a system of standards must be employed in a way
that is consistent with environmental goals. The right to use air and water
must be priced high enough so that the abatement encouraged improves the
quality of the environment enough to justify the abatement expenses, while
further improvement would not be worth additional expenditures.




117

There are three methods by which prices may be established for use of
air and water: subsidies for control of pollution, charges for emissions of
pollution (also called effluent fees), and sales of transferable environmental
usage rights.
In the case of pollution abatement subsidies, the "price" paid by the
polluter is the subsidy he forgoes. The more he fouls the air and water,
the less he receives in subsidies. This approach can attain the efficiency
inherent in a price system, but it entails substantial administrative as well
as fiscal costs. In order to keep its subsidy payments down, the Government
agency will have to incur the expense of ascertaining the level of pollution
that would have occurred without any pollution control. As new products
and processes are developed, this administrative task would grow more
expensive, because in their case no record of past pollution would be
available.
Alternatively charges could be levied on pollution. A charge on emissions
of harmful substances would limit the amount of emissions indirectly. The
higher the charge, the more a polluter would be willing to spend to avoid
contaminating the environment (and thereby avoiding the charge). Another
alternative would be an environmental usage certificate system. It would
limit the amount of pollutants directly, but allow the price for pollution
to be set indirectly. Under this system, as under a system of pollution
standards, a Government agency would set a specific limit on the total
amount of pollutants that could be emitted. It would then issue certificates
which would each give the holder the right to emit some part of the total
amount. Such certificates could be sold by the Government agency at
auction and could be resold by owners. The Government auction and
private resale market would thus establish a price on use of the environment.
The more pollution a user engaged in, the more certificates he would have to
buy. Groups especially concerned about the environment, such as conservation groups, would have a direct method of affecting the environment. They
could themselves buy and hold some of the certificates, thus directly reducing the amount of emissions permitted and increasing the cost of
pollution.
In general, any choice between emission charges and usage certificates
should depend on which is easier to determine: the right price for pollution
or the right quantity. If the amount of damage done by a pollutant can be
measured easily and it appears that each unit of pollutant does roughly the
same damage, an emission charge would be called for. If the damage per
unit of pollutant may rise substantially with higher total emissions, a usage
certificate system would be in order. Both the charge and the certificate approach would, like a system of standards, reduce the total amount of air
and water pollution. However, by introducing a price mechanism, charges
or certificates would allow the limited amount of tolerable pollution to be
allocated efficiently when differences in the cost of control are present.
Such efficiency would reduce the resource cost of pollution control and would




118

therefore enable us to afford cleaner air and water than we could if common standards were imposed in the face of differences in control costs.
Pollution charges and certificates have not yet been widely used in this
country, though some municipalities have levied charges on industrial sewage
discharge. A system of water pollution charges has been used in the Ruhr
basin for some time, and new proposals for pollution charges have been advanced in this country. This Administration has already proposed a tax
on lead additives in gasoline which reduce the effectiveness of certain devices used to control auto exhaust emissions. This tax should encourage
drivers to switch to unleaded or low-lead gasoline, refiners to produce such
gasoline, and carmakers to equip their cars with the low-cost catalytic
filters which work only with unleaded gasoline.
There is currently under study a charge on atmospheric emissions of sulphur oxides from combustion of fossil fuels. This charge would be sufficiently high to encourage substantial control of sulphur oxide emissions,
and the consequent reduction of damage to health and property should
substantially exceed the control costs.
A charge on sulphur oxide emissions provides a good illustration of one
of the important benefits of a price system—namely, the information produced by prices about the most efficient way of handling pollution problems. Sulphur oxide emissions are now regulated by Government standards.
The State of Washington, for instance, has proposed a standard whereby
copper smelters there would be required to control 90 percent of the sulphur
content of copper ore entering smelters. This, according to a study done
for the State, could be accomplished at a cost equal to about 2 cents per
pound of copper (about 4 percent of the price). The copper smelters there,
however, claim that such a level of control is technologically impossible
to attain, and that imposition of the standard would force the smelters
to close. Such disputes over Government standards are not surprising where
there is uncertainty over control costs. Advocates of the standard will tend
to minimize its costs so that the chances of having the standard adopted
are increased, while those facing the burden of complying with the standard
have an incentive to overstate the costs so that chances are improved of
having the standard, and hence their costs, lowered. In the absence of
accurate independent information on the costs of control, such disputes are
difficult to resolve.
Much of the gap in information could be eliminated quickly if an emission charge were instituted. If, for example, a charge were applied to
smelters equivalent to 3 cents per pound of copper when emissions were
not controlled, then with 90-percent control the smelter would save
about 2.7 cents in charges per pound of copper produced. If this 90-percent
control could indeed be achieved at a cost of 2 cents per pound, the smelter
would not hesitate to incur such costs and thus avoid the larger charge.
If, on the other hand, 90-percent control were "technologically impossible"
or cost much more than 2.7 cents per pound, the smelter would engage in
less complete control. Perhaps 80-percent control could be achieved more




"9

cheaply than the 2.4 cents in payments which this control would save. However, the company would still have an incentive to find new control methods
that might be less costly than its remaining tax burden. Not only would
the factual dispute be settled by this charge but incentives would be created
for an efficient response to an environmental problem.
While transferable environmental usage certificates have the same kind
of efficiency advantages as emission charges, they have not yet been applied
to the solution of environmental problems. One area where their use may
merit attention is the control of offshore dumping of waste, which constitutes
a growing hazard to the environment. It is feared that damage, especially to
food sources, may escalate sharply unless steps are taken to limit the waste
dumped into the ocean. At the same time, the cost of alternative means of
waste disposal differs among the many current users of the ocean. Ocean
dumping could be limited and individual differences in the cost of control
of dumping taken into account under a certificate system. This would require that anyone who wished to dump wastes in the ocean have a Government license to do so. The license would specify the amount and type
of material that could be dumped at a particular ocean site, and the number
of such licenses would be limited to permit no more dumping activity
than is considered safe. These licenses could be auctioned off by the Government, and sold later by a purchaser who no longer required them.
The Administration has proposed legislation under which licenses will
be required for ocean dumping. A possibility worth considering is to make
such licenses transferable. If this were done, prospective ocean dumpers
would either have to pay the going price for licenses or find a cheaper way
of disposing of their waste products. Those who were able to find such
alternatives would not buy the licenses; those for whom alternatives were
very costly would purchase them. The Government's prime concern should,
of course, be limited to the total amount and kind of dumping, not who
is doing it.
As choices are made between applying Government standards and instituting prices, the grounds on which the choice is made must be kept clear.
Prices for pollution have, for example, been regarded by some as a form
of 'evasion of standards, as a "license to pollute." Actually every system of
rules for use of the environment, other than outright and total prohibition
of certain uses, involves granting someone the right or "license" for some
polluting. The amount of pollution that results does not depend on which
system of rules is adopted, but on how each is administered.
It is sometimes said that administration of emission charges is unduly
complicated, since they must be varied continually as pollution damages
change, and they require close measurement of the pollution against which
the charge is to be made. When damage estimates can change frequently,
administration of a system of charges can become costly, and a certificate
or standard system would save this cost. However, the cost of measuring
pollution is not unique to a charge or certificate system. It would be just as




120

great if standards are to be enforced. If measurement of pollution is too
expensive to permit an effective system of standards, charges, or licenses,
we face a choice between outright prohibition of the pollution, tolerating
the present level, or requiring adoption of some conventional control
procedure.
Problems in the Application of Rules
As rules for the use of common property are developed, whether these
are embodied in Government standards, emission charges, or usage certificates, several problems will have to be resolved. We shall, for example,
have to decide at what level of Government the rules will be made. Since
these rules require that the gains and losses entailed by different levels of
environmental quality be weighed, the Government agency making the
rules must be responsive to those who bear the gains and losses. This
is especially important because part of the damage from pollution cannot
be measured directly but depends on such things as the aesthetic preferences
of those affected. As a practical matter, much of the damage from pollution
will be "measured" by political pressures from those damaged. Many, though
not all, pollution problems are local in character, and therefore determination of the appropriate level of environmental quality in these cases is
likely to be more accurate if it is done locally rather than by the Federal
Government.
Where the environmental effects of a particular activity are in fact
nationwide, as is true when poisons enter the food chain in a river and
eventually damage fish caught in a distant waterway, the Federal Government must ensure that certain minimum standards are set. Some degree
of uniformity may also be desirable where the cost of altering a given
production process or product to meet differing local standards is great.
It is not clear, however, that the Federal role should extend beyond the
setting of such minimum standards where most benefits and costs of pollution are borne locally. In such cases, a pollution source generates income
as well as pollution damage in the community where it is located. The
seriousness of the damage will depend in part on such local factors as
topography, wind patterns, and population density; and the right amount
of control will depend on how much income would be lost to achieve abatement. It would not be sensible to impose the same abatement costs on a
factory or farm located in a lightly populated area or where the environment
has substantial assimilative capacity as on one in an area without these
favorable characteristics.
Where environmental damage crosses local political boundaries but is not
national in scope, the appropriate Federal role might be to foster the creation of interstate agencies, such as regional air quality boards and river
basin authorities, which would be responsible to residents of areas affected
by common environmental problems. The recent amendments to the Clean
Air Act of 1967 will permit interstate air quality agencies to set regional




121

air quality standards, which will have to meet minimum Federal standards.
It is important, however, that these minimum standards permit these agencies to adopt standards appropriate to local circumstances.
New rules for use of the environment are bound to affect competitive
relationships within and among industries, localities, and nations. As industries are forced to bear the costs of using the environment, those who have
high costs will lose part of their market to those with lower costs of using
the environment. Inevitably, there will be pressures for Government action
to prevent this reallocation of production. It should be realized, however, that
such reallocation is necessary if environmental resources are to be used efficiently. Government interference with this process should therefore be
limited to mitigating the transitional effects.
The same considerations apply internationally as well as domestically.
Our high level of material wealth has caused us to place a higher value
on clean air and water than they are assigned in countries which have lower
incomes or where clean air and water may still be abundant. As this value
becomes reflected in the costs imposed on our producers, those for whom
the costs of pollution control are high will find it harder to compete with
producers in countries where clean air and water are less valuable or
where pollution is lower. The resulting reallocation of production among
nations should benefit all nations. We will tend to concentrate on the production of goods which make small added demands on our valuable environmental resources, while other countries will produce goods which increase the
use of their relatively abundant environmental resources or whose lower incomes make growing industrialization more urgent than extensive control
of damage to their environment. International agreements to restrict this
reallocation would, however, be desirable when pollutants emitted in one
country damage residents of another.
TRANSPORTATION
Even as Government creates new rules and institutions to promote an
efficient use of resources, it must constantly examine the utility of its existing
institutions. The transportation industry is a case where special care must
be taken to assure that Government policies do not promote inefficiency
by permitting private costs to diverge unnecessarily from social costs.
The transportation industry is important both to the Nation's rate of
overall growth and to the way that this economic activity is distributed
geographically. Much of this industry is subject to Federal and State regulation instituted under conditions that no longer exist. Such regulation
today may be one factor that interferes with an efficient use of resources
in transportation, and it appears that regulatory patterns may have to be
reexamined if the industry is to contribute its full potential to the Nation's
welfare. While the focus here will be on regulation, this is not the only
Government policy that creates a divergence between private and social
costs. Inland waterways, for example, are developed and maintained out




122

of general tax funds. There is no direct charge levied on the barge operators
who use them. Many barge rates consequently fall short of the social cost of
such traffic and lead to uneconomic diversion of traffic to barges. In addition some States have laws that inhibit the efficient utilization of labor on
railroads.
SURFACE FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION
When the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) was established in
1887, the railroads had a near monopoly of freight transportation. Public
demand for control of this monopoly was one of the factors leading to the
creation of the Commission. Another source of pressure for railroad regulation, however, may also have played a role in the development of ICC regulation. While railroads as a group had a near monopoly of freight traffic, there
were often several railroads along the same traffic routes. The absence of
antitrust laws made it attractive for rival railroads to collude among themselves in setting rates. As is frequently the case, such private cartels tended to
break down when some members secretly reduced rates to lure business away
from others. The railroads themselves supported the establishment of a Government agency that would end the instability of these private rate cartels.
The powers given to the ICC in 1887 and subsequently may therefore not
have been designed primarily to promote competition among railroads.
The ICC now regulates all rail traffic, 39 percent of truck traffic, and
10 percent of inland water traffic. The regulation is comprehensive, covering
rates, types of service offered, and the ability of firms to enter and leave
the industry or particular markets. While groups outside the transportation
industry do influence the exercise of the Commission's powers, the main
thrust of regulation has been to ameliorate the effects of competition among
the carriers and to mediate competitive disputes among them.
Early attempts by railroads to eliminate rate competition under regulation were not completely successful. Early in the 20th century, therefore,
and with the support of the railroads, the ICC was given power to approve
minimum rates—rates below which a particular railroad could not go. The
railroads used this power to institutionalize the value-of-service rate structure whereby goods of higher value were charged the highest freight rates
even if it cost no more to carry them. Private costs to shippers were thus
allowed to diverge from the social costs of transportation. This rate structure was most profitable to the railroads at the time, but its institutionalization under minimum rate regulation eventually became a source of their
present problems.
The value-of-service rate structure helped expose the rails to competition
from trucks. Because rates did not correspond to costs there were substantial
differences in the profitability of carrying different goods. New trucking
companies saw the prospect of capturing some of the profitable high-rate
traffic from the railroads. With the spread of the highway network, the then




123

unregulated truckers undercut rates on the high-rate traffic and diverted
some of it from the rails.
This reduced the profitability of the railroads and they argued for suppression of the truck competition. In 1935, ICC regulation was extended to
cover much of intercity trucking (and barge traffic in 1940). In order to
resolve the competitive dispute between rails and trucks, the existing rate
competition was suppressed. The value-of-service rate structure was carried
over from rails to trucks. At the same time, minimum rate regulation was
applied to all common carrier motor carriers, so that existing rate competition between trucking firms was reduced. All carriers were left to compete
on nonprice grounds, such as speed and the quality and frequency of service.
As the highway network grew, however, trucks continued to attract highvalued freight from the rails. Much of this was manufactured goods, where
superior service offered by trucks frequently gave them an advantage. Thus
the railroads' share of the freight market continued to fall. From 1939 to
1969, their share of intercity freight traffic fell from 62 to 41 percent, while
the truckers' share rose from 10 to 21 percent. At the same time, the railroads
became more heavily dependent on low-valued, low-rate traffic.
Inefficiencies Due to Regulation
This shift of traffic from railroads to trucks did not always come about
because trucking costs were below those of the rails. Part of it occurred because the value-of-service rate structure was unrelated to the costs of transportation. Even on long-haul traffic, where rail costs are much below truck
costs, a shipper would frequently choose to ship by truck if trucks offered
better service. By preventing carriers from fully reflecting cost advantages
in their rates, regulation maintained high-cost transportation. In some rate
cases where a low-cost carrier sought to exercise its advantage by offering
a lower rate, the ICC prevented this so that the high-cost carrier would
not be damaged financially, even though the public interest would have
been better served by lower rates. More recently there has been some increase in competition between modes of transportation, but the ability of
carriers to set minimum rates in concert continues to suppress competition
among railroads and among motor carriers.
The application of the value-of-service rate structure to all modes also
contributed to the problems of rural depopulation and metropolitan congestion which were mentioned earlier. Under the value-of-service rate structure,
rates on finished goods tend to be higher than those on raw materials. These
higher rates on finished goods give manufacturers an incentive to locate
close to or in the metropolitan areas where their major consumer markets
are found, rather than in the areas where raw materials are produced.
The preservation of value-of-service rates also induces excessive reliance on
unregulated private or contract carriage. Wherever regulated rates are held
above costs, some shippers have an incentive to buy or rent their own vehicles, usually trucks. This may save money for the shipper even if the cost




124

of operating these vehicles is above the cost to the regulated carriers, as it
might be because under present regulations these trucks must often return
empty to the shipper's location. These added costs represent wasted economic resources.
Transport regulation extends beyond rates. Under existing legislation, a
firm that seeks to enter the industry or a particular market must first obtain
a certificate from the ICC. This has protected existing carriers from competition because new carriers have not been permitted to enter freely even if
they could meet safety and reliability standards. This restriction of entry has
inhibited the formation of new trucking firms, though trucking is the most
rapidly growing form of regulated surface freight transportation. Further, a
certificate to enter a market often contains numerous service restrictions designed to protect established carriers. There are, for example, restrictions on
the commodities which may be carried and the number of towns between
two points which may be served. In the absence of these restrictions, the same
service could be performed equally well by fewer trucks.
This restriction of competition has had in the long run an increasingly
adverse effect on many of the intended beneficiaries, especially the railroads. With rate competition among carriers minimized, carriers sometimes
strive to gain customers by having the most equipment available and offering the most frequent service. This is one reason why the transportation
industry as a whole has had more capacity than the total traffic requires;
another reason is to be found in the obstacles to abandonment of unprofitable
service. The costs of carrying this excess capacity have in turn tended to
dissipate some of the financial gains to carriers that resulted from suppression of rate competition.
An Alternative to Regulation
The development of the transportation industry under regulation suggests that the public as well as large sections of the industry would be well
served by relying more on the forces of competition. The rationale for
regulation found in the railroads' monopoly position in the 19th century
has become increasingly obsolete. Transportation could be a viably competitive industry today since most shippers already have a choice among
modes, and with fewer entry restrictions they would have more choice
among carriers. By frustrating this potential for competition, regulation
appears to have promoted high freight rates and numerous inefficiencies,
and in the long run to have weakened firms financially. This raises the question of whether the introduction of competition in transportation may require
fundamental institutional reform. Legislative attempts to promote competition under the present regulatory system have had only limited success. This
is illustrated by experience with the Transportation Act of 1958, which
sought to increase competition among trucks, rails, and barges within the
present regulatory framework. While such intermodal competition has inJ

411-364 0—71



9

25

creased somewhat, it has often not been permitted when the financial viability of some carrier was threatened.
If it appears that the full benefits of competition can not be attained within
the framework of the existing regulatory process, substantial deregulation
of surface freight transportation may have to be considered. This approach
would involve the removal of regulatory obstacles to competition so that
free market forces would ultimately be allowed to establish prices and allocate resources in the same way that they do in other industries. In view of
the magnitude of the changes that would be brought about by such deregulation, it would probably be advisable to introduce competition gradually.
Carriers, for example, might initially be given freedom to set rates within
a narrow band above and below the present regulated levels, and this band
could widen over time. Freedom to enter markets could be initiated by removal of the service restrictions on existing ICC truck certificates and of the
restrictions on intermodal ownership by existing carriers. At some future
point, restrictions on entry by new firms could be lifted. Restrictions against
carriers' leaving unprofitable markets could also be lessened gradually by,
for example, permitting them to abandon without ICC approval a fixed
percentage of service each year for several years. As regulatory restraints on
competition in transportation are removed, it would appear appropriate that
transportation firms become subject to the antitrust laws, from which they are
now substantially exempt. In particular, it would be necessary to guard
against predatory pricing, intended to establish a monopoly, and against
monopolistic pricing, of which there are instances even under present
arrangements.
Deregulation would, of course, produce profound changes extending
beyond the transportation industry itself. With restrictions on competition
removed, transport rates would be likely to fall; and since high-cost carriers
would no longer be protected from competition the rate structure woujd
change. Rates based on the costs of efficient carriers would tend to replace the
current value-of-service rate structure. Under a cost-based rate structure,
commodity distinctions would tend to disappear, and rates would be based
primarily on such factors as the size and weight of shipment.
Deregulation and a shift to cost-based rates would also lead to a better
use of transport resources. For many long-haul shipments, rail costs are
below truck costs, while the reverse is true for short-haul shipments. Once
carriers are permitted to compete and take advantage of these cost differences, some long-haul shipments would shift from trucks to the rails and
some short-haul shipments would shift the other way. More generally, since
traffic would flow to carriers with the lowest costs, the total resource cost
of transportation would be reduced.
Many shipments that now move by rail over branch lines to main lines
would instead originate by truck, transferring to the rails at the main line.
To reduce the costs of such transfer, many of these multimodal freight
shipments would be sealed in containers which could be interchanged among




126

modes. In this way, both those shippers located close to the main line and
those farther away could take advantage of the flexibility and short-haul
cost advantage of trucks as well as the long-haul cost advantage of rails.
At the same time, much of the cost to the rails of maintaining excess track
and underutilized equipment on these lines would be removed.
Many shippers in small towns oppose railroad abandonments of branch
lines today, because they fear that under present regulation lower-cost truck
service would not be substituted. However, if carriers were free to compete
on rates as well as to enter and leave markets as they saw fit, the abandonment
of high-cost rail branch lines would create a new market for trucks. Competition among trucks would frequently result in lower freight rates for
branch-line shippers than they now face. Such shippers would also greatly
benefit by the savings from the multimodal long-haul shipments that increased competition in transportation would stimulate. Regulation is sometimes justified as protecting shippers in nonmetropolitan areas from loss of
service. It is argued that without the service requirements imposed by regulation not only railroads but trucks as well would abandon nonmetropolitan
areas for the more populous markets. It appears, on the contrary, that
regulation prevents many nonmetropolitan shippers from realizing the benefits of competition.
Evidence that nonmetropolitan shippers can and do benefit from a competitively organized transportation industry is provided by experience in
agriculture. In response to farm pressures, truckers of agricultural products
were exempted from the 1935 extension of ICC regulation to trucking.
In the 1950's fresh-dressed and frozen poultry and frozen fruits and
vegetables were added to the list of exempt agricultural commodities. The
Department of Agriculture found that this resulted in rate decreases averaging about 30 percent for poultry and 20 percent for frozen fruits and
vegetables. At the same time shippers reported that the quality of service
offered by the nonregulated truckers was generally superior to that previously offered by the regulated truckers. This experience indicates that residents in nonmetropolitan areas may receive substantial benefits from a
fully competitive transportation industry. In addition, with cost-based competitive rates, some of the manufacturing activity now carried on in the
large population centers, because of the high finished-goods rates in the
current value-of-service rate structure, would then shift to smaller towns
and generate increased incomes there.
In evaluating the distribution of the gains from competition in transportation the broad national gains should not be overlooked. Residents
of all areas are affected by transport rates both as producers and consumers, so that the lower transportation rates brought about by increased competition would benefit residents in all parts of the Nation. This, in the final
analysis, is why a deregulated transportation industry would better serve
the public interest.
Indeed, recent developments in the railroad industry suggest that deregulation of transportation may have to be considered as a matter of urgent




127

national priority. Several railroads, including the Nation's largest, are in
reorganization; and the Congress has approved Federal Government guarantees for $125 million in loans to these railroads. These significant developments, however, are only symptoms of more far-reaching problems that appear to be incapable of permanent solution without regulatory reform. The
over-investment and misallocation of capital in railroad facilities, and the
regulatory restriction on the ability of railroads to set rates that would capture
profitable long-haul traffic where they are most efficient, have led to a steady
decline in the railroads' own rate of return on investment from an average
of 3.7 percent in 1950-59 to 2.8 percent in 1960-69. As the financial condition of the railroads has deteriorated, investment of funds in the railroad
business has also become more risky. Today the average rate of return on the
railroads' investment, with its increased risk, is less than half that on riskfree Government bonds.
In the absence of regulatory reform it may not be possible for the railroad
industry to attract sufficient private capital to prevent further deterioration
of service in the years ahead. The Federal Government would then become
increasingly involved in the preservation of freight service, as has already
happened in passenger service.
RAIL PASSENGER SERVICE
Rail passenger traffic has declined steadily in recent years, and now accounts for only 8 percent of intercity passenger movements by public carriers. Railroads have long been seeking to abandon unprofitable trains,
but this was difficult under existing rules. The Railroad Passenger Act of
1970 permits a railroad to discontinue all its intercity passenger service
on May 1, 1971, provided that it invests in the newly-created National Rail
Passenger Corporation. Most of the capital for the Corporation will come
initially from a Federal Government subsidy and guaranteed loans, and a
majority of its Board of Directors is to be appointed by the President. The
Corporation must raise any additional capital without Federal assistance.
It will at the outset eliminate many of the passenger trains which are now
unprofitable, and operate an integrated system of passenger trains serving
all regions of the country that, it is hoped, will ultimately be profitable.
AIR TRANSPORTATION
Like surface transportation, the air transportation industry is subject to
Government regulation which has restricted price competition and appears
to have created some inefficiency. This regulation was instituted at the
request of the carriers in 1938. Entry into the industry or into a particular
market almost always requires a certificate from the Civil Aeronautics
Board (CAB), and carriers may not charge rates below those approved by
that agency.
This regulation has probably resulted in rates that in many cases are
higher than they would otherwise be. In the segments of the industry where




128

entry has sometimes been permitted—namely, nonscheduled, commuter, and
air taxi service—new firms have entered quickly. Some indication of the
degree to which regulation has raised rates is provided by the air transportation experience in California. Airlines operating wholly within a State are
exempt from CAB regulation. Until recently, California permitted free
entry into intrastate markets and did not regulate rates. Competition from
intrastate airlines has resulted in fare levels per-mile within California that
are approximately 40 percent below those for comparable services in the
rest of the Nation. As a result, air traffic between Los Angeles and San
Francisco far exceeds that between any other two cities in the world.
Nonscheduled carriers provide further evidence of the benefits of competition. In the late 1940's, a few carriers were permitted to enter the market
in order to provide unscheduled service as a supplement to scheduled service.
The nonscheduled entrants took an increasing share of the market by
undercutting the rates of established carriers in longer-distance markets
where rates most exceeded costs. The scheduled carriers responded by promoting low-cost coach service. The regulatory authorities also took action
to curb nonscheduled lines. While the public is thus denied the benefits of
extensive domestic nonscheduled competition today, the rapid growth of
coach service is, in part, an important legacy of the earlier competition.
In 1970, many airlines experienced excess capacity and low profits. This
partly reflected the absence of normal traffic growth. From 1960 to 1969,
domestic air passenger miles increased at the rate of 12 percent per year. In
1970 there was virtually no growth, while many airlines were taking on another generation of aircraft. In that sense the problems of the airlines are
similar to those a decade earlier when they were shifting to jets, while traffic
growth decreased and for a time reported earnings were also down sharply.
There is also, however, a more fundamental problem. As is true in surface
transportation, the substitution of service competition for rate competition
tends tQ-result in excess capacity. Fares higher than a more openly competitive market would establish have not, therefore, led to correspondingly
high rates of return. Through the inducement to excess capacity, overinvestment in facilities and planes occurred. Costs were thereby increased,
and the financial performance of the companies, even with sheltered fares,
has recently been unsatisfactory. Faced with some excess capacity, airlines
have asked the CAB to approve intercarrier agreements to reduce flight
frequencies in selected markets. Such a remedy tends to treat the symptoms
of the problem without removing the cause. The original cause of the excess
capacity was regulatory restriction of price competition. If price competition
had not been inhibited, the incentive for airlines to provide excess capacity
would have been reduced.
The resumption of a more vigorously expanding economy will ameliorate
part of this problem by increasing air traffic. It must be remembered, however, that these problems will be recurrent if prices are held substantially
above what they would be in a more openly competitive market. Para-




129

doxically, the earnings performance of the airlines themselves is apt to be
adversely affected if this basic principle is persistently ignored.
NATURAL RESOURCES
The utilization of natural resources normally proceeds from lower-cost
to higher-cost sources. As the best sources are depleted, new supplies can be
obtained only by exploiting those that involve lower grades and higher costs.
Copper is an example. The average ton of copper ore mined in the United
States in 1911 contained 1.82 percent copper. By the late 1960's the copper
content of ore had dropped to six-tenths of 1 percent, and some new mines
now produce ore with less than five-tenths of 1 percent of copper. Technological improvements have counteracted this tendency toward higher costs
of production. The number of man-hours of direct labor required to produce
a ton of copper ore has declined from 4 hours in the 192(Ts to one-quarter
of an hour in the 1960's. The net effect of these tendencies is that the price
of copper in peacetime has moved from a range of 10 to 20 cents in the
earlier part of this century to between 30 and 60 cents per pound in recent
years, or roughly in line with the general price level.
Not all natural resources have increased in price over the years. Aluminum prices, after bottoming out in the 1940's, are now at about the
same level as in the 1920's. As a result of these relative price changes aluminum has replaced copper in many applications. In spite of technological
advance and substitution there nevertheless remains a concern about the
ability of this Nation to continue producing a high proportion of the industrial raw materials it consumes. Accordingly, Congress has established a
National Commission on Materials Policy to estimate the supply-demand
situation that will be confronting us toward the end of this century and to
recommend appropriate policies.
ENERGY
Sharp price increases in two major energy products, combined with concern about the extent of their supply, have focused particular attention on
the Nation's energy resources. In late 1970 the price of heavy fuel oil,
which is used by electric utilities, industrial plants, and other large institutions, was almost twice as high as a year before in some markets. Bituminous coal, used primarily by electric utilities, was also priced substantially
higher in the spot market than a year before. Natural gas supplies were
not available to meet desired consumption at prevailing prices, and
therefore the demand for substitute fuels increased. Nevertheless these
recent price increases and shortages are not symptoms of a growing scarcity
of energy resources. They are the result of unanticipated developments that
the energy industry has been unable to offset completely in a short timespan, in particular a stronger demand for energy than was expected from
past experience. Programs to reduce air pollution by prohibiting highsulphur fuels contributed to the problem.




130

Coinciding with the acceleration of demand, there have been several
disappointments on the supply side. The generation of electric power, particularly in atomic plants, has not met the expectations of electric utilities
because of construction delays, licensing problems, and environmental concerns. In part, these difficulties reflect the assumption a few years ago that
atomic power would become profitable, an assumption that slowed coal
mine development. Heavy fuel oil supplies have been limited by a world
tanker capacity that has not yet adjusted to the longer delivery runs required from the Mideast after the Trans-Arabia Pipeline was severed. This
limitation on supply has resulted in higher prices for heavy fuel oil. Since
heavy fuel oil can be imported to the east coast without quotas, that area has
come to rely on these normally lower-priced foreign sources for a large share
of its supply, and domestic refiners have had no incentive to construct refineries with much capacity for these heavy products.
These short-run problems are being resolved by Federal action and by
adjustments in the market. Higher domestic prices of heavy fuel oil have
attracted more supplies from abroad; these higher prices have also induced domestic refiners to increase their yields of heavy fuel oil. Actions
by the Interstate Commerce Commission to increase the efficiency of utilization of hopper cars, including a doubling of the demurrage charge, have
helped to correct another bottleneck by adding about 3 percent to the
hopper car fleet's delivery capability. As a result, the previously low level of
coal stocks at electric utilities has been raised to the normal range, and
spot coal prices have turned downward.
In anticipation of local supply problems in the winter of 1971 a Joint
Board on Fuel Supply and Fuel Transport, chaired by the Director of the
Office of Emergency Preparedness, was created last September. Actions by
this Board and its New England field board have resulted in increased supplies in that area. The field board, in cooperation with local and State
authorities and industry, has resolved more than 50 complaints in the area.
Barring extraordinary events—such as a rail strike, or extremely severe
weather in the remaining winter months, or disturbances of international
oil supplies—fuel consumption in the United States should not be significantly curtailed in the winter of 1971.
With tankers being built as rapidly as world shipyard capacity permits
and with improvement in the efficiency of our rail system, the transportation problem should begin to abate. Although transportation bottlenecks
can arise from time to time, the principal long-run energy problem in the
future is to increase the amount of energy produced while avoiding a substantial increase in its price.
Domestic energy consumption between now and the year 2000 is likely to
exceed all of the energy consumed by this Nation in its history. This enormous
future demand raises questions about the supply of energy fuels, their price,
and the role that different sources of energy will play.




Once current technical and environmental problems are resolved, nuclear
energy promises to contribute significantly to the electric power supply.
While oil and natural gas supplies from conventional sources in the United
States appear to be small relative to current consumption, this is not true
of coal. However, technology that will inexpensively reduce the air pollution now produced by coal burning may have to be developed if the cost
of using coal is not to increase. Coal can also be liquefied and refined to
substitute directly for gasoline or fuel oil. It can also be gasified to substitute
for natural gas. Liquefaction and gasification of coal are both approaching
the margin of economic feasibility. The production of oil from oil shale
is another marginal economic proposition, and it is expected that with
production experience costs will be reduced further. In the States of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming there are enormous reserves of oil shale. These
sources of energy are not now being exploited because there are less costly
ways to supply energy, another illustration of the principle that least-cost
resources will be used before those that are more costly.
Even the potential supply of some traditional sources of energy has increased since World War II. An enormous production potential in the
Middle East has been hanging over the world petroleum market, production
costs there being less than one-tenth the selling price for typical Middle
Eastern crudes. Close cooperation among foreign producing countries has
thus far enabled them to prevent world prices from falling sharply. Attempts
at price increases will, of course, be made, but discoveries of new sources
throughout the world will tend to exert countervailing pressure. The increasing number of supertankers should reduce transportation costs, and
thereby help to keep delivered prices down.
Within the United States there has been persistent overcapacity in crude
oil production. Excess capacity in Texas and Louisiana has typically been
over 30 percent in the last decade and has at times exceeded 40 percent of
total production capacity. The State prorationing agencies have held back
domestic production, and this, together with strict national security limitations on imports, has maintained relatively high U.S. oil prices.
It is important to distinguish between two main functions of State
agencies that regulate crude oil production. The first function arises because crude oil is mobile underground and will flow to where it is being
drained. If a pool of oil is not produced as one unit, owners of individual
portions of the pool have an incentive to lift oil to the surface in their segment rapidly; whatever oil they do not remove themselves will be left for
others or may become irrecoverable. Since excessively high rates of production tend to result in lower ultimate recovery, competitive production from a single pool will often be wasteful. By prorating production
to individual producers in a pool, State prorationing agencies can enforce
the same rate of production that would occur if the pool were being operated
economically by a single operator. This is the conservation function of State
prorationing agencies.




132

In some cases, however, these efforts go beyond conservation and limit
total production to the market demand for crude oil in the State at prevailing prices. Since the quantity of oil demanded is related to its price, limiting
production to the quantity demanded at a particular price tends to support
that price. This market demand prorationing, as opposed to conservation
prorationing, has often kept production in the United States below efficient
capacity. On the other hand, the idle capacity has given us a standby supply
of oil that has sometimes been useful in times of international stress.
In the second half of 1970 domestic production was close to capacity. One
reason is that imports changed little, and another is that production capacity itself has not grown as rapidly as domestic demand. In part, capacity
may have shown little growth because of the negative incentive effects of
market demand prorationing. The value of an oil discovery depends not
only on the price of oil but also on the rate at which production is permitted.
If production is restricted to low levels, the potential value of a new oilfield
is reduced. The effect of market demand prorationing on the development
of new capacity is therefore similar to that of a lower price.
The action announced by the President in December 1970 to remove
market demand restrictions on Federal offshore leases not only promises
increased production from existing offshore wells but will also encourage
exploration for and development of new productive capacity on Federal
offshore land. Supporting this view is the fact that bonus bids received by
the Federal Government on the December 15, 1970, Gulf of Mexico sale
of leases exceeded earlier expectations and resulted in more revenue than
any previous Federal sale.
There appears to be a shortage of one major energy fuel, natural gas;
that is, its production is clearly falling short of desired consumption at current prices. Current prices for interstate sales have been kept low7 by the
Federal Power Commission, which sets these prices under law. Not only have
prices been too low for desired consumption to be met, but they appear also
to have retarded development of new gas supplies. The only satisfactory
solution of this problem is to allow the price, at least of new gas not previously committed, to approach the market-clearing level.
It is important to recognize that increased gas supplies, even at higher
prices, would offer direct benefits to the consumer. Some users would
switch to natural gas if it were available because the price of gas in terms
of heating value, though higher than before, would still be lower than the
price of the fuel they had been using. Industrial users would switch because
gas contains little sulphur and would be the cheapest way for them to meet
air quality standards. The added competition of these new supplies would
also tend to reduce prices for consumers of other fuels. If the price of natural
gas on old commitments remained under control, consumers would be protected from unnecessary price increases on current supplies.




133

TIMBER RESOURCES
Timber is another natural resource whose supply is affected by Government policies. In fact, there are few areas where Government has as much
direct control over the supply of natural resources as it has in timber. About
65 percent of the more than 2 trillion board feet of our Nation's inventory
of softwood sawtimber is on public lands. More than half of the total is on
land owned by the Federal Government. These softwoods, principally evergreens, provide the major wood materials used by the building industry, and
as the economy has grown so also has the demand for softwood.
With only 16 percent of the inventory, the private forest industry has
accounted for almost a third of the softwood sawtimber harvests. Public
lands have provided some 40 percent, the remainder coming from the private holdings of farmers and other small private landowners. In times of
increased demand it is to these private holdings that the forest industry has
commonly turned to augment supply. As a result of past cuttings, however,
this source of supply has been reduced, and time will be required to regrow
much of the timber on private lands.
This decline in supply occurs at the same time that the Nation's demand
for softwood lumber products is expected to grow substantially. If the
Nation's housing demand for this decade is to be met, the annual consumption of softwood lumber and plywood by the housing industry may have
to increase by as much as 75 percent over current levels. And as the economy
resumes a course of vigorous expansion, nonhousing demand for softwood
will increase as well. It has been estimated that for the economy as a whole
the annual demand for softwood sawtimber, assuming that prices remain at
their 1962-67 levels, could reach 70 billion board feet by 1978, some 40
percent above the level of consumption in 1969. Accordingly, the President
has directed the Secretary of Agriculture to formulate plans for increasing
timber yields on Federal lands.
An increase in the timber harvest through intensified management promises broad public benefits. Not only will consumers of wood products, particularly purchasers of housing, benefit through lower prices, but this can
be achieved while keeping our timber resources intact. Unlike other natural
resources, forests are renewable, so increased cuttings need not imply a permanent reduction in the annual lumber supply. Indeed, it appears that, with
proper planning and management, the permanent yield of forest lands can
be increased.
Growing concern for our environment necessitates that increases in timber
supply be achieved in a manner which is consistent with the preservation
of natural surroundings. In the past, cutting has frequently been synonymous
with denuding the land, but this is by no means inevitable. By partial cutting
and careful selection the negative aesthetic and environmental impact of
harvesting can often be kept to a minimum. Indeed, increased harvests can
offer benefits beyond the increased supply of timber, for intensified forest
management can also result in a natural increase in wildlife and improved
opportunities for recreation.




134

HEALTH CARE
Expenditures for health care have grown rapidly as families' incomes have
increased and as Government has assumed greater responsibility for the
medical bills of the aged and many of the poor. Total private and public
health expenditures grew from $42.3 billion in fiscal year 1966, the year
before the introduction of Medicare and Medicaid, to $67.2 billion in 1970,
or at a rate of 12 percent per year. (Health expenditures are defined more
broadly here than in Chapter 3.) Hospital and nursing home expenditures
have grown most rapidly, with expenditures for physicians' services and other
types of expenditures rising somewhat more slowly.
Price increases account for a considerable portion of the change in expenditures. The medical care component of the consumer price index increased
at an annual rate of 6.4 percent between fiscal years 1966 and 1970. The
price of daily service charges in hospitals rose at the rate of 14.4 percent per
year, while physicians' fees rose at a 6.7-percent rate. Yet in 1966 prices, expenditures for health still grew by 24 percent during these years, rising to
6.4 percent of real GNP in 1970 from 5.9 percent in 1966.
THE SUPPLY OF MEDICAL SERVICES
Between 1966 and 1970 the number of active physicians grew at more
than twice the rate of the total population; from 151 active physicians per
100,000 people the figure rose to 159. This growth has been accompanied by
a decline in the proportion of physicians who provide primary patient care
(general practitioners, pediatricians, and internists) and an increase in the
proportion who enter the other specialties. Despite some debate over whether
the total increase in services has been sufficient to meet the recent increase
in demand, there is agreement that the uneven geographic distribution of
physicians presents problems for sparsely populated and inner city areas.
There is also growing interest in the possibility of improving the organization
and delivery of health services to provide more services for people throughout the country. If more doctors were to practice in groups, where they could
take advantages of timesaving equipment and allied health personnel, their
productivity could be increased. Group practice might be more suitable
than solo practice in some of those areas where health services are difficult
to obtain.
Between 1966 and 1969, beds in short-term non-Federal hospitals, where
most of the acute hospital care is provided, increased by 7.6 percent. Patients'
days in the hospital rose somewhat more, by 10.7 percent between 1966 and
1969, and annual patient-days per person in the country rose from 1.095 to
1.178. This rise in patient-days was due primarily to the increased rate of
hospital admission of the aged following Medicare and to their longer average stay after entering a hospital. Hospital use among people under age 65
increased only slightly.

INCREASES OF MEDICAL CARE PRICES
The rapid increase in medical care prices cannot be completely explained
by the lack of rapid growth in the supply of the services of physicians and
hospitals. The recent increase in fees may be partly a result of the fact that
many patients no longer have to pay their own medical bills. The itemized
billing required by public and private insurance has also encouraged charging for services which were previously including in a package.
The increased price of hospitalization reflects an increase in the cost of
their operation more than a shortage of hospitals. As the financial position of
the hospitals has improved following Medicare, they have been more willing
to consent to doctors' requests for better equipment and expanded facilities
and to pay their employees higher wages. Because Government and most private insurers pay the hospitals according to their costs, these increases are
rapidly passed on to the consumer directly or through Government.
WHO PAYS THE BILLS
While the organization and delivery of health care services has been changing relatively slowly, the method of paying for personal health care has
altered dramatically. Private health insurance has grown rapidly in the past
two decades and now pays 24 percent of all medical bills as compared to 8
percent in fiscal 1950. Government has expanded its financing of medical
care from a responsibility for the Armed Forces, veterans, municipal hospitals, and various public health services to the assumption of a large share of
medical bills of the aged and poor. The fraction of medical care expenditures
paid by Government has increased from 20 percent in 1950 to 35 percent in
fiscal 1970. The consumers of medical services are as a consequence directly
paying a decreasing portion of medical care costs. Of the $280 of personal
health care services provided per person in fiscal year 1970, individuals paid
out of pocket an average of $110, or less than 40 percent.
The out-of-pocket share of medical expenses which a family must pay
depends greatly on the age of the family members. In fiscal year 1969, Medicare, Medicaid, and other Government programs paid about 72 percent of
the medical care expenditures of the aged and, after some smaller contributions from private sources, left them with out-of-pocket expenses averaging
$163 per person. In contrast, the Government paid only about 23 percent
of the expenses of persons under age 65. Private insurance paid about 29
percent, and the individual paid 46 percent of the total or an average of $98.
These out-of-pocket expenses are less than those made by the aged, even
though the aged pay a lower fraction of their medical bills.
Among persons under age 65, out-of-pocket expenses vary considerably
depending upon the type and level of expenditures and upon the income of
the family. In 1969 about 81 percent of individuals under age 65 had some
form of hospitalization insurance and 79 percent had surgical insurance.
Physicians' office visits and many services which prevent serious illness were
much less likely to be covered, thereby encouraging resort to hospitalization




136

even though it tends to involve higher costs. Insurance paid about 70 percent
of consumer expenditures for hospital care, about 45 percent of consumer
expenditures for physicians' fees, and considerably less of other types of services. Private insurance covers an increasing fraction of a person's expenses
as these rise up to some level, but a declining fraction as expenses become
very large.
Middle and upper income families are much more likely to be covered by
private insurance than are low income families. In 1968, for example, over
90 percent of the persons under age 65 in families with incomes of $7,000 or
more had some type of hospital insurance, while only 36 percent of people
in families with incomes below $3,000 had coverage. Of these low income
people, those aged 56-64 were twice as likely to be covered as were children under age 17. The Medicaid program, which pays the medical bills of
welfare recipients and certain low7 income people with high medical expenses, is putting an increasing burden on many States but is often inadequate to meet the needs of the people it is designed to serve. The program
also reduces the incentive of poor persons to earn more income by making
them ineligible for benefits if their income rises above a certain level.
There have been three broad problems in the Nation's health programs.
The distribution of health services is uneven by income groups and geographic areas. There has been an imbalance between programs which increase the demand for these services and programs which augment the supply of trained personnel and improve the organization and delivery of health
care services. Finally, there has been the problem of assuring an efficient
utilization of the resources devoted to health care. While the increase in
real expenditures on health has benefited large groups of the population,
further efforts are needed to resolve these remaining problems.

CHAPTER 5

The United States in the International Economy
HHHE VAST EXPANSION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND
-*- CAPITAL MOVEMENTS has produced an increasingly complex network of relationships linking domestic economic conditions and domestic
economic policies across national boundaries. New and urgent questions
have therefore emerged concerning the management of domestic economic
policies and the international machinery developed to make it easier for
national economies, with their differing policies and objectives, to adjust,
to each other. The first part of this chapter is devoted to examining the
ways in which the various subdivisions of our balance of payments have
been affected by changes in economic policies and conditions during 1970.
The relative calm imparted to the international monetary system by the
recent correction of persistent disequilibria in several major currencies provides an opportunity to evaluate the system without the pressure of emergency conditions. Such an analysis, placing special emphasis on the unique
role of the U.S. dollar in the international monetary system, comprises the
second part of this chapter.
A third section reviews international trade policy, which became an
urgent issue again in 1970 because protectionist pressures were building
up in a number of industrialized countries and threatened to reverse the
broad trade-liberalization movement of the postwar years. Two policy
problems were particularly important. One was the future of U.S. trade
policy, and the other stemmed from the proposed enlargement of the
European Economic Community and its implications for the future of an
open world trading system.
The final section of this chapter focuses on the continuing search for
more effective ways to aid the economic development of the lower income
countries and the role played by transfers of both official and private capital in this process. The President's Foreign Aid Message of September
1970 suggested a number of wide-ranging measures to increase the effectiveness of the total U.S. aid effort.




138

DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
CURRENT ACCOUNT
There is an important relationship between the domestic economy and
the balance of trade. Policies that stimulate the domestic economy tend to
raise imports and restrain exports. With domestic economic expansion, increases in personal incomes and prices as well as greater pressures on productive capacity at home cause a growing proportion of rising domestic demand
to be taken care of through purchases from abroad. And such factors as
higher domestic prices, buoyant demand in the convenient and more familiar
domestic market, and lengthening delivery schedules limit the rise in exports.
Economic policies in other countries also have an important impact on the
U.S. balance of trade. For example, the deterioration in the trade balance
resulting from a rapid domestic expansion is greater when other countries
are not using their own productive resources fully or expanding as rapidly.
Moreover, such developments as the long-term decline in the relative importance of transportation costs, the reduction of barriers to international
trade, and the increasing similarity of cost structures among industrial nations have tended to increase the responsiveness of trade flows to price
and income fluctuations. The composition of U.S. exports and imports has
shifted toward finished manufactured goods, the demand for which is more
responsive to movements in incomes and relative prices prevailing among the
different economies. Finished manufactured goods accounted for only 41
percent of U.S. imports in 1965, a figure which rose to 56 percent in the
first 11 months of 1970 (Table 32). And the share of finished manufactured
goods in total U.S. exports increased from 58 percent to 62 percent in the
same period of time.

Inflation and relatively full employment in the U.S. economy from 1965
through 1969 and underutilization of resources in several other major industrial countries at various times during that period contributed to a striking
deterioration in the U.S. trade balance in the latter half of the 1960's.
Beginning with the second quarter of 1969, the U.S. merchandise trade
surplus rose sharply. The surplus was $2.7 billion (on the Census basis) in
1970 compared to $1.3 billion in 1969. Since mid-1970, however, the trade
surplus has declined irregularly. To a considerable degree, the levels of exports and imports in 1969 were affected by temporary distortions arising
from the dockworkers' strike. When adjusted to eliminate the effect of these
distortions, the figures indicate a somewhat smaller improvement in the
trade balance in 1970 over 1969.
Superficially, it would appear that the slowdown in the domestic economy
which began in the second half of 1969 failed to exercise a restraining influence on the growth of imports. The value of recorded merchandise imports
was 11 percent more in 1970 than in 1969, compared with annual increases
of 8.5 percent in 1969 and 23.6 percent in 1968. However, when adjustments
are made for strike-related distortions in the flow of imports during both
1968 and 1969, the growth of imports in 1970 shows a slowdown from that
of the previous year. Moreover, an unusually large part of the increase in the
recorded value of imports in 1970 compared to the previous year—about
two-thirds—was accounted for by price increases as measured by the unit
value index. The rise in the price index of imports was much sharper than
the increase in the U.S. wholesale price index in 1970, suggesting a possible
decline in the price competitiveness of foreign goods on the domestic market.
A marked acceleration in the growth of exports (excluding shipments
under military grants) occurred in 1970, from an average annual rate of
increase of 8.7 percent in the period 1965—69 to an increase of about 14 percent in 1970 over 1969. While continued high levels of economic activity
abroad and the slowdown in the U.S. economy undoubtedly helped sustain
the growth of exports, the acceleration in this growth in 1970 can be attributed largely to the gain in agricultural exports, initial deliveries of jumbo
jets, and recovery from the 1969 dockworkers' strike.
Recent price and cost developments here and abroad appear to favor
U.S. exports. From 1960 to 1965, labor costs per unit of output in manufacturing declined in the United States, while they rose in each of the ten
other major industrial countries except Canada. This trend was reversed
in the latter half of the 1960's. As capacity utilization rose to high levels in
the United States, unit labor costs increased at an average annual rate of
3.6 percent in the period 1965-69, substantially higher than in the economies
of other major industrial nations, with the exception once again of Canada.
Since 1969, labor costs per unit of output have risen faster in several major
U.S. trading partners—notably Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom—
than in the United States. There is also some evidence that since the end of




140

1969 U.S. manufacturing export prices have risen at a slower rate than the
comparable export prices and wholesale prices of competitor nations, in
marked contrast to the earlier performance. If these developments continue,
they should help improve the international competitiveness of U.S. export
industries.
The net effect that divergent cyclical movements at home and abroad
during 1970 have had on other items in the current account (as defined in
Table 33) is unclear. Improvement in the transportation account during
the first three quarters reflected in part a large rise in U.S. port expenditures
by foreign shippers and in freight receipts by U.S. shippers, both accompanying the surge in trade. The easing of monetary conditions in the
United States and the general tightening of credit conditions abroad tended
to decrease the rate of interest on foreign-held claims on the United States
and raise the rate of interest paid on U.S. claims on foreigners. However,
the balance on investment income showed only a slightly larger surplus in
the first three quarters of 1970 than during the corresponding period of
1969. Military spending abroad showed little increase as higher living costs
and wages in other countries were largely offset by troop reductions, the
shutdown of a number of military bases, and smaller outlays for military
construction projects. Overall, the current account in the first three quarters of 1970 showed a surplus of $0.7 billion (seasonally adjusted), an improvement of $1.6 billion over the corresponding period of 1969.
On the whole, the improved U.S. performance on the current account in
1970 can be attributed to progress in restabilizing the economy and the
price-cost level, and to the probability that we were more advanced in this
process than much of the rest of the industrial world. Undoubtedly the
excess of exports over imports in 1970 would have been smaller under conditions of full employment in the United States and less intense demand
pressures abroad. In fact, the irregular decline in exports from the peak
reached in mid-1970 may be attributable to a general flattening out of the
economic cycle in Canada, Europe, and Japan during the latter part of the
year.
CAPITAL FLOWS AND MONETARY CONDITIONS
The lessening of demand pressures in the market for goods and services in
the United States during 1970, together with an easing of monetary policy,
were gradually reflected in the financial markets. In a number of other important countries, however, demand pressures continued to increase, at least
in the first part of 1970, with the result that financial conditions abroad
continued to tighten after they had begun to ease in the United States. This
shift in relative monetary conditions contributed to substantial net outflows
of private liquid capital from the United States during 1970.
Tight monetary conditions in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and,
most particularly, Germany, encouraged large capital inflows into those
nations. Much of these came from the United States via the Eurodollar mar141
411-364 0—71



10

ket, despite German efforts to discourage such inflows by imposing additional
reserve requirements on increases in the foreign liabilities of German banks.
The largest such flow occurred in November, when the Bundesbank's
reserves rose by $1.6 billion. In an apparently successful effort to halt these
inflows, the German authorities reduced the discount rate by 1 percentage
point in two successive cuts within a 3-week period.
U.S. banks reduced their borrowing from their foreign branches substantially during 1970. The liabilities of U.S. banks to their foreign branches
were lowered by about $1 billion during the first quarter of the year, as the
easing of credit conditions in the United States made less expensive funds
available in this country while interest rates in the Eurodollar market remained higher than comparable U.S. rates throughout most of 1970. In late
June, the Federal Reserve suspended the interest-rate ceiling on 30- to 89day large-denomination certificates of deposit. American banks increasingly
tapped this source of funds, and their borrowings of Eurodollar deposits from
their foreign branches fell sharply, from $11/4 billion to $7 billion, during
the second half of 1970.
There were also substantial changes in long-term capital movements between 1969 and 1970. U.S. direct investment outflows increased from $2.8
billion during the first three quarters of 1969 to $3.6 billion during the
corresponding period of 1970, reflecting the projected 16-percent increase
in plant and equipment expenditures for 1970 by foreign affiliates of U.S.
corporations. At the same time foreign direct investment inflows to the
United States increased to $0.8 billion. Net foreign purchases of U.S. stocks
and bonds (exclusive of U.S. agency bonds) declined substantially, from $1.9
billion during the first three quarters of 1969 to $1.1 billion during the
comparable period in 1970. This decrease was largely a response not only
to a sharp decline in U.S. security prices during the spring but to the difficulties experienced by several of the large offshore investment funds and the
consequent regulations imposed by several European nations. Net U.S.
purchases of foreign securities also declined dramatically, from $1.4 billion
during the first three quarters of 1969 to $0.6 billion during the corresponding period in 1970.
OVERALL DEFICIT
The net effect of changes in the current and capital accounts during 1970
was a considerable reduction in the recorded U.S. liquidity deficit but a
marked deterioration in the official reserve transactions balance. In response
to the latter, the Federal Reserve Board took steps in December to discourage
further repayment of Eurodollar borrowings by U.S. banks. This action was
undertaken partly because of concern that the capital inflows which were
causing some countries to gain dollar reserves might undermine the efforts
of their monetary authorities to maintain restrictive monetary policies for
domestic purposes.




142

Preliminary estimates indicate that the U.S. liquidity deficit in 1970 was
somewhat less than $4 billion, or more than $4j/2 billion excluding the allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDR's), a sharp reduction from the 1969
liquidity deficit of $7.0 billion. Preliminary estimates of the 1970 balance on
the official reserve transactions basis indicate a deficit of about $9j/i billion,
including the allocation of SDR's, as compared with a surplus of $2.7 billion
in 1969. (These figures differ from those in Table 33, which are figures for
the first three quarters of 1970, seasonally adjusted, stated at annual rates.)
While the recorded liquidity deficit showed a sharp improvement in 1970,
this balance was distorted by special financial transactions and flows of U.S.
funds to the Eurodollar market which, particularly in 1969, enlarged the
"errors and omissions" item. In addition, the 1970 figure included the
initial allocation of SDR's to the United States. If adjustments are made for
these factors, the underlying deficit in the first three quarters of 1969 was
about $4J/2-$5 billion and about $3*/2-$4 billion in the corresponding period
of 1970. This moderate improvement largely reflected the increase in the
trade surplus, partly offset by larger net outflows of private capital.
The sharp deterioration in the official reserve transactions balance in 1970,
despite the improvement in the liquidity balance, reflected the very sharp
shift in the flow of foreign private liquid funds—from a net inflow of $8.7
billion in 1969 to an outflow of $3.3 billion in the first three quarters of 1970.
(This is shown in Table 33, but the 1970 figures there are reported at annual
rates.) These flows were largely associated with the shift, referred to earlier,
in U.S. banks' Eurodollar borrowings through their foreign branches.
The U.S. official reserve transactions deficit in 1970 was financed partly by
decreases in our total stock of reserve assets. Such assets registered a decline of
$2.5 billion during 1970, even with a nearly $1 billion increase in holdings of SDR's that largely reflected the $867 million initial allocation in
January. The remainder of the deficit was financed by increases in liquid
liabilities to foreign official agencies.
Despite the substantial buildup of dollar balances in the hands of foreign
official holders, 1970 was a year of general calm in the foreign exchange
markets. It was free of any crises like those that had occurred intermittently in preceding years.
MANAGING CAPITAL MOVEMENTS
The large capital movements occurring, as described above, in response
to changes in relative interest rates and monetary conditions are the outgrowth of the increasing internationalization of capital markets, especially
the development of the Eurodollar market. The increasing mobility of capital
is a reflection of the growing flexibility and responsiveness of capital markets,
which contribute to the efficient international allocation of investment and
production. This mobility nevertheless involves some problems. The responsiveness of short-term capital flows to variations in timing and degree in the




use of monetary policy can both undermine the effectiveness of monetary
policy as a domestic stabilization tool and produce significant balance-ofpayments disturbances. It is possible to argue that such short-term capital
flows are largely temporary and usually self-reversing, and therefore that one
need not be concerned about their balance-of-payments consequences. Traditionally, however, several courses of action have been suggested to alleviate
problems arising from international movements of interest-sensitive funds.
One is to offset these capital flows through flexible official financing; another
is to reduce reliance on monetary policy as an internal stabilization tool; and
a third is to insulate domestic money markets by direct control of capital
movements.
Important steps to facilitate the offsetting of large international flows of
liquid capital through international cooperation have been taken by developing flexible arrangements for short- and medium-term official financing, and
by other forms of cooperation among national monetary authorities and
such international institutions as the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the Bank for International Settlements, and the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. But the experience so far with such arrangements indicates that, while they are helpful in preventing balance-of-payments difficulties arising from such flows, in general they cannot completely
offset the problems that such flows pose for domestic monetary management.
The second alternative would imply achieving a domestic fiscal-monetary
mix that would place heavier reliance on fiscal measures for the achievement
of domestic goals; monetary measures would then be directed more toward
international goals. Whether such a shift in the policy mix is desirable is a
question which must be decided with reference to its domestic effects rather
than on the grounds of balance of payments alone. There are, moreover,
rather obvious practical limitations to this option. Changes in tax rates and
in the level of Government expenditures are difficult and time-consuming.
Even more important, any major effort to rely more heavily on changing the
"mix" of domestic monetary and fiscal policies presupposes a more precise
knowledge than now exists of the different effects of monetary and fiscal
policies on internal stability and external balance.
The third alternative is to take policy actions which directly affect capital
movements. The United States, for balance-of-payments purposes, instituted
three programs to control capital outflows during the 1960's. One was the
Interest Equalization Tax in 1963, which applies to securities sold in U.S.
capital markets by developed countries (except new Canadian issues) and
long-term bank loans (with similar exemptions). The second was the Federal
Reserve's Voluntary Credit Restraint Program, initiated in 1965, which provides guidelines for capital flows from banks and other financial institutions.
Also in 1965, voluntary restraints on direct investment were established
under the direction of the Department of Commerce; this program was converted into the mandatory Foreign Direct Investment Program at the beginning of 1968.




144

Controls on capital movements are widely used; they are permitted by
the International Monetary Fund Articles of Agreement and are generally
regarded as less undesirable than controls on current account transactions.
But they involve some economic costs of their own, and their duration poses
problems. With respect to the Foreign Direct Investment Program, for
example, the passage of time is likely to bring more and more ways of
bypassing the controls. Insofar as the controls are effective, the longer they
remain the greater will be the potential capital outflow when they are lifted
and corporations attempt to repay foreign lenders. Finally, there is some concern about what effect the heavy foreign borrowing, induced by the direct
investment controls, might have on the debt structure of foreign affiliates
of U.S. corporations.
This Administration has affirmed its view that such controls are temporary measures and must not become part of the permanent tool kit of policy
instruments because they distort the efficient allocation of capital. The
relaxation of the Foreign Direct Investment Program which began in 1969
has been continued with due regard to the balance-of-payments situation. In
1970, the "minimum allowable investment" (i.e., the amount not subject
to restraint) was increased from $1 million to $5 milion per year, provided that the additional $4 million was used in the designated group
of lower income countries. Changes in the regulations concerning foreign
borrowings which may be offset against direct investment expenditures
permitted greater flexibility in financing foreign investment projects, as
did new provisions regarding the amount of earnings which may be reinvested and the conditions under which earnings may be transferred among
designated groups of countries. In January 1971 the annual investment
amount not subject to the controls was raised from $1 million to $2 million
without geographical restriction and the proportion of the previous year's
earnings which may be reinvested was increased.
Offsetting official financing, changes in the mix of monetary and fiscal
policies, and the use of direct controls on capital movements do not, however, provide a fully satisfactory answer to the policy problems posed by the
increasing integration of capital markets, and this fact has led to a growing
interest in finding alternative solutions. One answer might lie in no longer
trying to insulate national capital markets but substituting instead a greater
conscious international coordination of monetary policies. A solution relying
on international coordination is often limited, however, by the fact that it
implies restrictions on the freedom to direct monetary policy toward domestic economic problems. Where full coordination is not practicable, one
mechanism for providing greater insulation of domestic capital markets,
and therefore a somewhat more independent monetary policy, would be
greater flexibility of exchange rates within the framework of the present
system established at Bretton Woods. If there were more scope for changing
exchange rates in response to market forces, the sensitivity of short-term




145

capital movements to differences in national monetary conditions might be
somewhat reduced.
While the concern about how the balance of payments is affected by
interest-sensitive flows of short-term capital may be exaggerated, it must be
recognized that major countries will continue to rely heavily on monetary
policy to influence the domestic economy. The management of the resulting
flows of short-term capital will therefore continue to occupy monetary and
financial authorities.
THE UNITED STATES IN THE INTERNATIONAL
MONETARY SYSTEM
The U.S. dollar plays a number of key roles in the international monetary
system. It is widely used to finance private international transactions, even
if no American is involved. It is also the currency used by national authorities in their operations in foreign exchange markets, and dollar holdings are
an important component of world reserves. Because of its international roles,
the dollar further serves as the yardstick by which the values of many free
world currencies are measured. As a result, developments in the United
States economy and balance of payments, and the attitudes other countries
take toward these developments, are of key importance in the smooth
functioning of the international monetary system.
MEASURES OF THE U.S. BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS POSITION
The measures of our payments balance officially published by the U.S.
Government tend to be widely interpreted as indicators of how close to—
or far from—the most desirable situation we stand at a given time, even
though there is no clear consensus on how the optimum situation is to
be defined. A great deal of attention has been devoted to assessing the
adequacy of the two overall measures of the payments balance now used.
One is the liquidity balance, which is equal to the change in our holdings
of international reserve assets less the change in our liquid liabilities to all
foreigners, official and private. The second is the official reserve transactions
balance, which is equal to the change in our stock of international reserve
assets less the change in liquid and certain nonliquid claims on the United
States by foreign official monetary institutions. From the search for improved
measures has emerged increasing agreement that no one measure can adequately summarize the changes in this country's international financial
position.
The most commonly used measure of the U.S. payments position, the
liquidity balance, was originally intended as a measure of changes in this
country's ability to maintain conversions of dollars into gold at a fixed price
ratio. There has been considerable discussion as to whether the statistical
presentation of the liquidity balance is the best possible reflection of its
underlying concept. This problem was discussed in detail in the 1970 Economic Report of the President.




146

More fundamentally, however, some liquidity deficit will normally arise
when a reserve country acts as an international banking center. Foreigners
tend to accumulate short-term claims on such a country, and in turn the
country may build up a growing net investment in foreign countries at
longer term. At the same time, a continuing liquidity deficit means that the
ratio of reserves to liquid foreign claims is being lowered. The present situation results partly from the growth of world liquidity which was necessary
to accommodate the expansion of world trade and investment over the past
two decades—that is, in part it reflects the successes of the international
economy. Variations in the volume of our liquid liabilities relative to their
reserve backing are therefore not the primary determinant of how desirable
the dollar is as a reserve asset.
The U.S. responsibility for converting foreign liquid claims into other
reserve assets is limited to the holdings of foreign official institutions. Since
the adoption in March 1968 of the two-tier gold system, the possibility of
flows of gold from the U.S. reserve stock through foreign official institutions
into private hands has been eliminated. As a result, the liquidity balance
has lost much of its significance.
In recent years, increasing attention has been focused on the official
reserve transactions balance. This balance, with appropriate adjustments,
measures the quantity of claims on the United States which foreign authorities have acquired or given up in the process of maintaining the exchange
value of their currencies within the prescribed margins. There are considerable difficulties in reading the signals given by the official reserve transactions balance, however. For one thing, it is volatile, exhibiting wide
year-to-year swings as shown in Table 33. Moreover, a movement of dollars
from foreign private accounts to foreign official accounts will increase the
official reserve transactions deficit; movement in the other direction will
decrease it. Such movements may in some cases signal shifts in the degree
of foreign confidence in the dollar relative to other currencies. In other
cases they may simply be due to changes in monetary conditions and interest
rates which alter the attractiveness of dollar assets to foreign private holders,
quite apart from speculative considerations. Because of the obligation to
keep their countries' exchange rates within 1 percent or less of the par value,
central banks are essentially passive in such transactions. In still other cases,
shifts of dollar holdings between the central bank and commercial banks may
represent the deliberate exercise of selective measures designed to reduce
or to enlarge published reserves.
For all these reasons, no single concept of the balance will suffice for all
purposes. Beyond the liquidity and official reserve transactions balances, at
least two other "balance" concepts can be useful. One is the balance on
current account or balance on goods, services, and unilateral transfers (both
government and private). Such a balance indicates the extent to which our
country is currently earning the foreign exchange it needs to carry out its
international lending and investment expenditures. Properly adjusted for

earnings reinvested abroad, for errors and omissions, and for changes in the
valuation of domestic and foreign assets, the current account also indicates




148

changes in our net international investment position or "net worth," which
may well be considered more meaningful than any other measure of changes
in the basic strength or weakness of our international financial position. At
the end of 1969, for example, our net foreign assets amounted to $67 billion,
an increase of $1.5 billion over the total a year earlier.
Another concept, currently being considered for inclusion in the Government's table of balances, is the basic balance. Such a balance would measure
our net position on current account plus "nonliquid" or "nonvolatile"
capital transactions, treating changes in private liquid assets and liabilities
as financing items. The aim underlying the basic balance is to group together
those balance-of-payments items which best reflect broad, persistent forces
or underlying trends, treating more volatile classes of transactions among
the financing items. Because of the difficulties of approximating such a
distinction with available statistical data, several variants of the basic balance
have been suggested as best reflecting the fundamental concept.
The four balances just discussed—the liquidity balance, the official reserve
transactions balance, the current account balance, and the balance on current
and long-term capital accounts, which is one of several versions of the basic
balance currently under consideration—are shown for the past decade in
Table 33. Despite their conceptual and statistical differences, all these measures of our payments balance suffer from a common difficulty, namely, that
none of them can give more than one side of the picture. The other side,
which because of measurement problems does not appear in any presentation
of the U.S. balance of payments, is the demand side: the number of dollars
foreigners want to add to their reserve stocks in any given year. Rather than
the quantity of dollars flowing into foreign hands, it is the difference between
this amount and the amount they want to hold, given existing conditions,
that would be a true indicator of disequilibrium in the international economic
and financial position of the United States.
The Composition of Reserves
It is generally thought that, aside from political considerations and
questions of confidence, the quantity of dollars foreign authorities want to
add to their reserves depends partly on the desired rate of growth of aggregate international reserves and partly on the availability and desirability of
alternative sources for increasing reserves. The expansion in the supply of
monetary gold has for some time been erratic and insufficient to meet the
increasing reserve needs which have accompanied the rapid growth of world
trade and capital transactions. Under these circumstances, a steady accretion
of foreign exchange, primarily dollars, to world reserves has filled this gap
and prevented a general inadequacy of international reserves.
With the IMF's decision to allocate $9.5 billion of Special Drawing
Rights to member countries over the 3-year period 1970-72, an important
alternative source of new reserves was created. A first allocation of $3.4
billion was made on January 1, 1970, a second allocation of $2.9 billion




149

was distributed at the beginning of 1971, and a third allocation of $3.0
billion is planned for the beginning of 1972. It is envisaged that SDR's will
eventually supplant dollars as the major source of reserve growth, although
the SDR allocations for the 1970-72 period were determined with the expectation that dollars and other traditional sources of increases in official
reserves would supplement this new reserve "money."
The question of the size of foreign official demand for dollars, however,
involves another complication. In addition to wanting growth of reserves,
foreign official institutions generally have preferences concerning the composition of their reserve stocks: what proportion will be represented by
gold, SDR's, and dollars (as well as, in some cases, smaller amounts of
other convertible currencies). In part these preferences may arise from the
differing characteristics of the three major reserve assets. The yield, for
example, is zero on gold holdings, 1.5 percent on SDR's, and substantially
higher on dollar holdings. Also, unlike dollars, SDR's and monetary gold
(since the institution of the two-tier gold system) can be transferred only
among central banks or other official institutions; they cannot be used for
commercial transactions. Much more important, however, is that most
industrial countries wrould apparently like to run some sort of basic balance
surplus or a current account surplus with the rest of the world. The demand
for reserve dollars, therefore, seems to be affected not only by countries'
reserve goals but also by their balance-of-payments goals, measured "net"
of newr SDR allocations. SDR's help to satisfy the first of these goals but
not tlje^second, unless the goals themselves are modified.
The combined growth of official and private foreign demand for dollars
determines the equilibrium size of the liquidity deficit of the United States.
How much the private component of this demand grows will also depend
both on the rate at which nonofficial holders want to increase their aggregate
working balances of international currencies and on the desired composition
of these balances.
A number of characteristics have made the U.S. dollar particularly suited
to its role as the most widely used currency for international transactions.
Among them are the scale and efficiency of the American banking system,
the size and depth of our capital markets, and the freedom of the dollar
both from changes in its foreign-exchange value and from exchange controls
affecting foreigners. So far, the development of European capital markets seems to have enhanced rather than reduced the role of the dollar as
a vehicle currency, although it is too early to tell what ultimate effect
the European Economic Community's proposed movement toward a currency union will have through the decade of the 1970's.
The economic well-being of the United States does not require that
foreign demand for dollar balances continue growing at any particular
rate. What is important is to distinguish clearly between measured U.S.
deficits and the strength or weakness of our international financial position.
Throughout most of the 1950's, while the United States had a measured




150

deficit in its balance of payments nearly every year, there was widespread
concern about a worldwide "dollar shortage." This concern suggested that
the measured U.S. deficit during those years was below its equilibrium size
as determined by the growth of world demand for dollar reserves. The
point is that it is essential that consideration of the foreign demand for
dollars should temper any use of measured balance-of-payments deficits as
the basis for policy decisions affecting our domestic economy or our international economic relationships.
Balance-of-Payments Goals
In the present international monetary system, in which the dollar serves
as a yardstick, other countries, by selection of their exchange rates, in
effect determine the exchange value of the dollar. The balance-of-payments
position of the United States, however it is measured, depends therefore
not only on the state of our domestic economy and on the economic behavior of our citizens and Government but on the economic performance
and policies of other countries, including their decisions about exchange
rates. Individual countries take actions that they consider appropriate to
their particular circumstances. Collectively, those actions are not always
easily reconciled with other countries' statements about the most desirable
payments position for the United States. During the 1960's, for example,
there were frequent expressions of foreign concern about the size and persistence of the U.S. deficit. Yet the net result of exchange-rate changes by
leading industrial countries was a very slight actual appreciation of the
dollar—a development which would inevitably have some tendency to
weaken our current account balance.
The United States has full responsibility for maintaining a noninflationary
expansion of its domestic economy. This responsibility was not met in the
latter half of the 1960's, and U.S. performance during this period clearly
contributed to the deterioration of our balance of payments. Nevertheless,
regardless of our domestic performance, there are no measures which the
United States can take to satisfy balance-of-payments demands of various
countries if these demands are fundamentally inconsistent. No matter what
constraints the Government imposes on the domestic economy, and no matter
how many measures it adopts to alter or control individual categories of
international transactions, the United States will not be able to abolish
its balance-of-payments deficits if most of its major trading partners establish exchange rates and follow other balance-of-payments policies that
enable them to run surpluses over and above their SDR allocations.
This problem of the possible inconsistency of balance-of-payments goals
cannot, in short, be solved through unilateral policy action by the United
States. Instead it requires multilateral action by the members of the International Monetary Fund—the present framework for international monetary relationships among the countries of the free world. One step toward
the solution of this problem has already been taken with the establishment




of Special Drawing Rights, international reserves which do not depend on
a persistent deficit in the balance of payments of the United States or any
other country. The purpose in instituting SDR's and related arrangements
with respect to reserve creation is, of course, to provide a situation in which
all countries can satisfy their demands for reserve increases simultaneously,
so that the reserve center need not be forced into persistent deficit through
policies adopted by other countries to run net surpluses in their balance-ofpayments transactions.
Ideally, the rate of reserve creation should be neither too small nor too
great. If it is too small, at least some countries will find their reserve goals
frustrated, and their efforts to prevent the inadequacy of their reserves from
imparting deflationary pressures to their domestic economies are likely to
lead to increasing restrictions on international transactions and a competitive
upward pressure on interest rates. If the rate of reserve creation is too
great, the excess liquidity will be a vehicle for transmitting inflationary
pressures internationally and will make it more difficult for national authorities to control domestic inflation.
In practice, however, it is not possible to find a rate of creating world
reserves that is just right for every country. The objective must be a rate
which best reflects an international consensus as to the most desirable trend
of reserve growth. Moreover, even with such a consensus, problems would
still arise if, as suggested earlier, other countries were to formulate balanceof-payments goals that were inconsistent with their aims regarding the
composition of international reserves.
Exchange Rates
Because of the possibility that reserve creation and reserve management
alone cannot solve the dilemmas just described, interest has recently focused
on increased, though limited, flexibility of exchange rates. Changes in official
parities have occurred in the past, of course, and have played a role in
stabilizing the international monetary system. But the political consequences
inherent in exchange-rate decisions have made countries hesitant to undertake such adjustments. As noted earlier, exchange-rate changes by industrial
countries in the 1960's resulted in a small net depreciation of these currencies
against the dollar, in part perhaps because political inhibitions against exchange-rate changes tend to be stronger in the case of appreciation than in
the case of depreciation. To the extent that such an asymmetry exists,
its effect is to favor a devaluation against the international standard—
the dollar. Opinions about the quantitative significance of this tendency
differ, but there is a widespread feeling that modifications which would make
exchange-rate changes less politically charged and less likely to lead to speculative disturbances would contribute to the smoother and more effective
operation of the existing system.
More frequent and smaller changes in the dollar parities of currencies
would reduce the tendency for sizable payments imbalances to build up. This




152

in itself would be an advantage, but an added advantage would arise insofar
as the calculation of the appropriate new par became less critical. With
smaller and more frequent changes in par value it would be easier to modify
those which turned out to be either inadequate or excessive.
Smaller and more frequent changes in parity would not necessarily involve
a change in the present IMF rules, but only a change in the practices which
member nations have generally followed. A recent report by the Executive
Directors of the IMF notes that the Fund is empowered "to concur in members' proposals for prompter and smaller changes in parities, whenever these
are necessary to correct a fundamental disequilibrium."
On two recent occasions the difficulty of identifying an appropriate new
par value has led countries to move away from the existing exchange-rate
parity without immediately choosing a new one. At the end of September
1969 the German Government closed its foreign exchange markets under
the pressure of a large capital inflow. When the markets were reopened
several days later, no attempt was made to defend the old parity, thus introducing a period of "transitional float." The mark moved upward on the
exchanges, and when a new par value was declared toward the end of
October it exceeded the previous one by more than 9 percent. A somewhat
different case arose at the end of May 1970 when, in the face of a very
strong payments position and domestic inflation, the Canadian Government
withdrew its defense of the existing par value; it has not yet declared a
new one.
There is also the possibility of introducing greater flexibility by some widening of the margin permitted under the present IMF rules for exchange-rate
variation around each country's par value. This margin or "band" is now 1
percent each way. Such an increase in the scope for market-induced movements of exchange rates might have several advantages. By increasing the
risk of exchange-rate loss and thereby reducing the sensitivity of some types
of short-term capital movements to differing degrees of tightness or ease in
national money markets, it would make possible greater independence in
national monetary policies. It could also be expected to reduce pressure on
official reserves by encouraging stabilizing movements of private funds in
cases where payments disturbances are regarded as temporary and selfreversing, and by decreasing the potential profitability of speculative flows
based on anticipations of a change in parity. Such potential profitability
would be reduced not only because the speculators would lose more if
they guessed wrong but because the broader scope for exchange movements
within the margins might in some cases reduce the need for actual parity
changes.
All of the possible modifications just described are at present under study
by the IMF in its consideration of whether amendments to its Articles of
Agreement are necessary or desirable to encourage the most effective utilization of exchange-rate policies as a tool of international adjustment. The need
is to find modifications of law or practice that will alleviate in the best pos-




153

sible way the recurring financial strains in the existing system while still
maintaining the essential characteristics of a monetary system under which
steady and dramatic advances in world trade and prosperity have been
achieved.
ADJUSTMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE
Improvement in the monetary system has been one of the two major
developments in the international economy since World War II. The other
is the cooperative effort to dismantle the network of barriers that had
obstructed the international exchange of goods and services prior to and
during the war. Although many obstacles to trade still exist, gradual tariff
reductions have been an important stimulus to the rapid postwar expansion
of world trade. A number of international institutions, in particular the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), have been instrumental in reducing the hindrances to freer trade on a multilateral basis. Some
problems of adjustment have emerged, however, as international trade has
become more important in each country's affairs.
During the 1960's the volume of world trade (excluding that of Communist countries) grew considerably faster than real income in this group
of countries, and the relative importance of trade to the American economy
has increased as well. For example, the trend rate of growth of real imports of goods and services in the United States during the period 1955-68
was 1.6 times as great as that of real domestic production. In the same
period the trend rate of growth of exports in real terms was 1.4 times
that of output. Among broad categories of manufacturing industries, sharp
increases in penetration by imports were registered in the latter half of
the 1960's in apparel, leather goods, electrical machinery, transportation
equipment, and other durable goods. The ratio of exports to total output
rose significantly in the lumber, electrical machinery, transportation equipment, and primary and fabricated metals industries. Clearly, the growth of
U.S. trade has signified not only greater availability of foreign manufactures,
but also wider markets for many domestic products.
U.S. TRADE POLICY
The liberal trade policies followed since World War II have not only expanded our exports and imports but have also contributed to a higher standard of living with a richer choice of products both here and abroad. At the
same time, these gains require domestic adjustments in certain industries
that grow more slowly, or even contract, as a result of trade liberalization.
Despite the overall gains, the problems of adjustment and the natural
tendency for an industry to resist foreign competition have brought renewed
pressures in recent years to reverse trade liberalization. Pressures have also
grown because of protectionist actions by some of our trading partners and
because the reduction in our merchandise trade surplus has led to a
belief that the United States is now benefiting less from trade.




All these pressures converged during 1970 when Congress considered
new trade legislation. The trade bill recommended by the President in
1969, and described more fully in the 1970 Economic Report of the President, included several measures that represented continued progress in
our trade policy. In addition to authority for limited tariff reductions and
elimination of the controversial use of the American selling price as a basis
for setting certain import duties, the bill proposed new authority to act
against countries that employ export subsidies in competition with U.S.
exports in third markets. Most important, perhaps, was the bill's proposal
to liberalize criteria for providing adjustment assistance to workers and businesses adversely affected by imports.
Certain additional features were subsequently added to the President's
proposal. Some of these, including an amendment to allow Domestic International Sales Corporations that would provide tax deferrals to U.S.
exporting firms, and the addition of textile quota provisions designed to
assist in the conclusion of international agreements on textiles, were supported by the Administration. Other amendments, many of them unacceptable to the Administration, were eventually included in a bill
passed by the House of Representatives. The most questionable was
a provision to impose increased restrictions on imports of products which
met certain quantitative criteria in cases where the Tariff Commission
found injury. This and several other amendments threatened to reverse
the steady progress that had been achieved in liberalizing our trade policy.
The bill opened the prospect of retaliation by other countries against U.S.
exports, and it would have weakened the fight against domestic inflation.
U.S. trade policy clearly reached a critical juncture in 1970. Although
Congress did not adopt protectionist trade legislation, the pressures for
greater import restrictions remain strong at the beginning of 1971. If the
broad gains to the economy that have resulted from increasingly open access
to markets here and abroad are to be sustained, it is important that the
wider public interest be voiced as strongly as the complaints of adversely
affected parties. At the same time, better means must be found to meet
legitimate problems of adjustment in some industries affected by rapidly
increasing imports.
Domestic Adjustments to Changes in Trade Patterns
The burdens of adjustment to foreign competition are too often ignored
by those who advocate free trade. Much fixed capital, such as specialized
machinery, is not transferable to other industries. Workers will have the
difficulty of changing jobs, of moving and starting a new home; some who
have acquired skills not needed in other industries may face unemployment
or lower incomes.
Import restrictions, however, are neither the only solution to these problems nor in principle the best one. A better approach, taking into consideration the interests of both consumers and producers, is to do more to facilitate




the adjustments that injured firms and workers must make. As the President
recognized in his original trade bill proposal, adjustment assistance should
become available at an earlier point in an industry's struggle to compete with
imports. Moreover, it should become available more quickly after the application for aid.
Use of the adjustment assistance provisions of the Trade Expansion Act
of 1962, although still limited, expanded notably during 1970. For the first
time since the program's inception, the President authorized firms and
workers in three industries to apply directly to the Secretaries of Commerce
and Labor for assistance. The number of workers and firms actually certified
for assistance, including some in other industries that had requested assistance
individually from the Tariff Commission, increased greatly during 1970.
There are, of course, costs in administering and financing adjustment assistance programs. These costs, which would be substantial in the case of a
large industry such as textiles, are ultimately paid by taxpayers. The aim
of such programs, however, is not to provide compensation payments indefinitely to injured firms and employees, but to ease the transfer of labor and
other resources to more productive sectors of the economy. For workers, this
means retraining and assistance in job hunting. The costs to taxpayers should
thus decrease eventually as workers in the injured firms obtain new jobs or
reach retirement age. On the other hand, the costs that import quotas create
for consumers in the form of higher prices and a narrower choice of goods
continue as long as the quota remains in effect.
There may occasionally be sound reasons for reducing the burden of adjustment on import-competing industries by obtaining agreement from foreign exporters to restrict their shipments. This has been done for a number of
commodities, including cotton textiles, meat, and steel. The Administration
has attempted to negotiate similar restraints for manmade textiles and woolen
goods. Such voluntary agreements affect prices in the importing country in
the same way that quotas permitting a like volume of imports would do, but
their provisions tend to be more flexible than those of legislated quotas.
The main drawback of a quota as compared to a tariff is that unless a
tariff is prohibitive it does not inhibit competition as much as a quota, unless
the quota is ineffective. This is so because a tariff allows imported goods to
enter if, even with the tariff, they are competitively priced. A tariff therefore
puts a limit on the amount by which the domestic price can exceed the world
price. An effective quota, on the other hand, does not put any limit on the
rise in domestic prices. Those who are permitted to import under a quota
system are under no obligation to pass on the lower world price to their customers ; their right to import gives them a windfall profit. Under a tariff the
difference between the world price and the domestic price accrues to the
Treasury. In those schemes for quotas or voluntary restraints which do not
call for import licenses, the quotas are in effect controlled by the foreign
exporter, who is therefore in a position to capture the windfall. In the case
of imported beef, for instance, export prices to the United States from the




156

principal supplier are between 10 and 20 percent higher than the export
prices to other countries. It is clear therefore that quotas should only be used
where no satisfactory alternatives are available.
All these reasons make it important for countries participating in the
world trading system not only to reduce tariff barriers but also to work
toward eliminating various nontariff barriers to trade. Preliminary efforts
to develop a common framework for negotiating reductions in such barriers
have begun within GATT, and it is hoped that they will be intensified
during 1971.
While much attention has been focused on adjustment problems where
labor and capital have been hurt by foreign competition, it is often overlooked that erecting barriers to trade would cause similar problems for
firms and workers in exporting industries if other countries reduced their
imports from the United States either in retaliation or as a result of the
normal response mechanisms in international transactions. It has been
estimated that in 1969, 3.8 percent of the private labor force was directly
or indirectly dependent upon exports for employment, the same percentage as in 1965 (Table 34). This figure includes not only labor employed
directly in producing exports but also labor involved in producing items
used in the final export goods. The proportion of agricultural workers whose
output found a market abroad has been relatively high for many years.
Between 1965 and 1969, however, the proportion of employment accounted
for by exports in manufacturing rose and that in agriculture, forestry, and
fisheries declined.
Wages in export industries are usually higher than in import-competing
industries. For example, a weighted index of wage rates for production
workers in manufacturing whose jobs depended on exports in 1966, the
latest year for which information is available, was 8 percent higher than
the average earnings in jobs which might have been created by import
replacement.

Import Restrictions and the Domestic Price Level
For a country to benefit from trade liberalization, it is not necessary
that its trading partners also have liberal policies, although worldwide trade
liberalization would, of course, yield still greater benefits both here and
abroad. But the opportunity to obtain some goods at lower cost through
exchange for exports rather than through domestic production provides
net gains to our consumers and to U.S. industries which use imports as raw
materials, whether that opportunity arises from lower-cost production or
from subsidized production in other countries.
Import restrictions tend to aggravate inflation by limiting the total supply
of goods to the domestic market. When imports are free to expand, some
of the excess demand can be diverted from the domestic economy and
thus moderate the pressures on the domestic price level. In addition, competitive pressure from imports gives U.S. industries a strong incentive to
increase their productivity and cut costs. Such pressure also encourages
more competitive pricing, particularly in industries which are highly
concentrated.
Nevertheless, experience suggests that progress toward freer trade is
more likely to be achieved through reciprocal action than through unilateral moves. The domestic advantages of freer access to imports have
usually had to be reinforced by the attraction of better markets for a country's exports. Moreover, a country that imposes fewer restrictions on imports than do its major trading partners makes its industries bear a disproportionate share of the burden of adjustment to changes in the pattern
of international trade. The United States has maintained an open market
in manmade textiles, for example, while many European countries subject
them to quantitative import restrictions.
The benefits of freer trade can therefore be defended most effectively if
we not only avoid actions that would unnecessarily deny our consumers
access to the lower-cost products of other countries but also keep a careful
watch over developments abroad that threaten the achievement of liberal
trade policies. The President made this clear in a message to the Congress
in December 1970, in which he said:
The Administration remains committed to the objective of expanding mutually advantageous world trade. The record of the
United States demonstrates clearly its willingness to assume its
obligations in this field. We must continue to do our part, while
at the same time defending vigorously the rights of our traders
under international agreements.
REGIONAL TRADING ARRANGEMENTS
One argument cited by proponents of protection against imports has
been the rapid expansion of special trading arrangements among groups of
countries. Numerous groups of countries in all parts of the world have




initiated special trading arrangements. Although its objectives are much
broader, the European Economic Community is the largest and most important such trading unit. The principal grounds for concern about such
arrangements are that they may unduly discriminate in favor of trade among
member countries, and therefore against trade with the United States and
other nonmember countries. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
has rules governing these matters, but constant review is needed to ensure
that the rules are observed and to prevent adverse consequences for third
countries.
ENLARGEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY (EEC)
The prospective enlargement of the EEC will affect world trading relations substantially. The EEC entered into enlargement negotiations with
four other countries in June 1970. If negotiations culminate in the admission of the four applicant countries (Denmark, Ireland, Norway, and the
United Kingdom), the combined GNP of the enlarged EEC would be about
60 percent as large as that of the United States, and the total imports of
these countries from nonmember countries would be nearly 50 percent larger
than U.S. imports. It is anticipated that several other Western European
countries would also become associated with the EEC in subsequent negotiations.
The United States has long supported the integration of Western Europe
because the broad political gains expected from a strong, united, and outward-looking Europe should exceed whatever economic costs might be incurred. In supporting the enlargement of the EEC for the same reasons,
however, the United States has the right to expect that the interests of
nonmember countries will be taken fully into account in the process of enlargement and that the policies of the enlarged Community will be responsive to the needs of the world community. With this goal in view, the United
States has intensified its consultative arrangements with the EEC.
Enlargement could create significant changes for all U.S. economic relations with Western Europe. Although on balance the effects of the formation
of the EEC on industrial trade have so far been favorable, several studies
have shown that the EEC's agricultural policies have damaged some major
U.S. agricultural exports. The United States is concerned that British entry
into the Community at its current high levels of agricultural price supports
might lead to further deterioration of U.S. agricultural exports. The solution
lies in making the Common Agricultural Policy of an enlarged Community
respond better to the needs of both consumers and farmers. Such a change
would be to the benefit not only of the member countries but also of efficient
outside suppliers. The United States has found over the years that it is better
to maintain farm income through direct payments rather than through high
price supports.

GENERALIZED TARIFF PREFERENCES FOR LOWER INCOME
COUNTRIES

Another set of basically discriminatory trading arrangements are "special
preferences" which the EEC countries grant to imports from selected lower
income countries and which the United Kingdom and other members of
the Commonwealth grant to each other. Frequently, these arrangements
also entail "reverse preferences," whereby the less developed nation opens
its market to exports from those developed countries which grant it special
preferences. Reverse preferences are maintained in most of the EEC's special
preference arrangements and in some of the special arrangements between
developed and less developed members of the British Commonwealth. There
has been a tendency in recent years for such arrangements to spread, thus
undermining still further the principle of nondiscrimination on which the
international trading system is based and damaging the commercial interests
of countries that are not parties to the arrangement.
Recognizing the need to assist the lower income countries in accelerating
their economic growth and to avoid the adverse consequences of selective
trading arrangements, the President announced in his speech on Latin
American policy in October 1969 that he had decided to press for the adoption by all developed countries of a liberal system of generalized tariff preferences for the exports of all lower income countries.
The decision to pursue this course was based on the belief that the best
way to assist the lower income countries is for the developed countries to
join in a common effort without seeking special trading benefits for themselves. Establishing a nonreciprocal preference system open equally to all
lower income countries will have several advantages. It will enable them
to increase their exports and their foreign exchange earnings and thus
hasten their economic development; it will reduce the present discrimination
among lower income countries that arises from special preferences favoring some countries at the expense of others—notably the Latin American
countries—with no preferential access to any developed country's market;
and, by eliminating reverse preferences, it will allow the lower income
countries to buy from the cheapest source of supply.
In the months following the President's announcement the United States
engaged in a series of intensive consultations—both bilateral and multilateral—with the prospective preference-granting countries and with the
lower income countries in an effort to work out the details of a preference system.
Eighteen developed countries (including the six members of the European
Economic Community acting as a unit) have agreed, subject to necessary
legislative authorization, to grant generalized tariff preferences for a temporary period, now set at 10 years, and have made specific proposals. Under
the U.S. proposal, most manufactures and semimanufactures (excepting
only textiles, shoes, and petroleum products) imported from lower income
countries, and a selected list of processed and primary agricultural products




160

and raw materials, would be admitted duty free. In order to qualify for
generalized preferences, lower income countries must provide adequate
assurance that reverse preference arrangements will be eliminated within a
reasonable period of time. Proposals by the other major developed countries
also call for the elimination of duties on a broad range of products. While
the proposals of individual countries differ somewhat in their form, they are
designed to achieve similar results. In October 1970 these proposals were
accepted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development as
providing a "mutually acceptable" basis for the establishment of a generalized preference system.
AIDING DEVELOPMENT IN LOWER INCOME COUNTRIES
Stimulation of exports from the lower income countries by means of
generalized preferences promises to aid these countries materially; but capital
flows, both official and private, must play a major role in the economic
development of these nations. While increased trade allows lower income
countries to use their existing supply of resources more efficiently, capital
flows provide them with additional working resources.
FOREIGN ASSISTANCE
Although the United States still provides more aid than any other
developed nation, net official assistance for development has fallen from
$3.6 billion, or 0.6 percent of GNP in 1963, to less than $3:2 billion, or 0.3
percent of GNP in 1969. In 1970, there probably was a further slight
reduction in the net official flow. However, there are indications that, in
line with the President's declared policy^ the downward trend in the absolute
level of U.S. aid will be reversed. After falling for 3 years, budget authorizations for the portion of gross official flows covered by the Foreign Assistance
Act and for other multilateral flows increased slightly in fiscal 1970, and a
significant increase has been voted for fiscal 1971.
The fall in the share of our national product devoted to aid has reflected
a disillusionment both with the effect of such aid on the growth rates of less
developed countries and with the efficiency of our aid institutions. The complexities of the development process were underestimated when the United
States first began to assist the less developed world. Aid institutions which
were highly successful in implementing the Marshall Plan have lagged in
meeting the quite different challenges which lower income countries have
recently confronted. On the other hand, there have been some outstanding
successes. The economic progress of Israel, South Korea, Taiwan, and several
other nations demonstrates that aid can be used efficiently.
The Administration believes that the number of successes can be greatly
increased and has assigned high priority to the task of improving the probability of scoring positive gains. In 1969 the President appointed a Task
Force on International Development, whose report played an important
role in the formulation of his 1970 message on "Foreign Assistance for




161

the Seventies" with its proposal for a fundamental reform of the U.S.
effort. According to this proposal, aid would be divided into three components : development assistance, humanitarian assistance, and security
assistance. Because each would be administered through a different organizational structure, responsibilities could be more clearly fixed and the success of
each program in meeting its specific objectives could be more easily assessed.
The President's message recommends that a much higher portion of American aid be channeled through multilateral institutions than at present.
This change would allow greater coordination of international assistance
and reduce some of the political frictions associated with bilateral aid.
The President also proposed a major reform in our bilateral aid program.
He recommended the creation of two new organizations: a U.S. International Development Corporation to manage bilateral lending activities on a
businesslike basis, and a U.S. International Development Institute to manage a portion of our technical assistance and to mobilize private scientific
expertise and technology to help solve specific problems of lower income
countries. The present Agency for International Development would be
phased out; the number of U.S. employees working overseas on development projects would be reduced; and greater reliance would be placed on
the information gathered by multilateral agencies.
It is important to ensure that each dollar flowing to recipients is used
with maximum efficiency. Currently, the usefulness of international aid is
limited by the requirement that a large portion of the funds be used to purchase goods from the donor country, even though the necessary items might
be cheaper elsewhere. It is estimated that in many countries these "tying"
provisions directly reduce the value of aid by at least 20 percent. In addition,
tying may force recipients to engage in projects calling for a high import
content, although they would otherwise have low priority and although they
draw scarce local resources, both administrative and physical, away from
more essential activities. In order to eliminate these serious problems, the
President's message recommends that donor countries move together to
abolish tying restrictions. A joint effort will mitigate any negative effects on
the balance of payments of individual donor countries. Most donor countries
have agreed to this principle. The United States has already decided to
allow the use of development lending for procurement in any of the lower
income countries themselves.
Improvements in the form of our aid and in our institutions represent
only one approach to the problem. The impact of aid also depends crucially
on the policies of the recipient countries. Thus far, some countries' efforts
to use aid effectively have been hampered by a lack of administrative talent
and technical skills. To meet this problem it is essential to supplement aid
for capital formation with technical assistance. The United States has recognized this need, and in recent years technical assistance has been growing
more rapidly than capital assistance, even though it still constitutes a smaller
portion of our total aid compared to most other donors. One of the most




162

important tasks for the U.S. International Development Institute proposed
by the President in his Foreign Aid Message will be to emphasize technical
assistance and to provide the research necessary for its most effective use.
Even efficient technical assistance will do little to help development, however, if the recipient does not have the will to use it effectively. The
effectiveness of the recipient's development efforts must therefore be an
important determinant of how aid is distributed.
PRIVATE CAPITAL FLOWS
In the period from 1962 through 1969, net flows of private American
capital to the lower income countries were about 40 percent as large as the
official flows. Direct investment constituted more than two-thirds of the total
private flow, while the rest consisted of private export credits and portfolio
investment.
By the end of 1969 the book value of U.S. direct investment in less developed countries totaled $20 billion, of which $7.8 billion was in petroleum and
$5.2 billion in manufacturing. Almost $12 billion of the total was invested in
Latin America, the rest being almost evenly spread among less developed
economies in other parts of the Western Hemisphere, as well as in Africa,
the Middle East, and Asia.
Because private capital can confer important benefits, the U.S. Government has adopted a number of policies to encourage direct foreign investment in lower income countries in which it is welcomed! The Overseas
Private Investment Corporation was created late in 1969. It will take over
and expand the Agency for International Development programs to encourage private investment and will provide financial assistance to private enterprises operating in lower income countries. Its lending policies will follow
regular business practices, and in 5 years its formal constitution will be
reviewed with the possibility of transferring this agency to the private sector.
To the extent that the programs of the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation can reduce the risks associated with investing in the underdeveloped world, those with capital will be more ready to consider a wide
range of investment opportunities in the lower income countries. These lower
income countries, however, will reap the benefits of this and other policies to
stimulate private capital flows only if they create an environment that will
attract private foreign investment.
In its program to control capital outflows for direct investment, the U.S.
Government has discriminated in favor of investment in the lower income
countries. Under the 1968 regulations, the formula setting an upper limit to
the flow of direct foreign investment to the lower income countries was
much more generous than the formula applying to direct investment in developed countries. In addition, not only can the limits be exceeded in special
cases, but a company with unused allocations for direct investment in developed countries or Middle East oil-producing countries could reallocate the
funds for use in developing nations. As a result of these policies, restraints on
direct foreign investment have had little if any adverse effect on flows to the
lower income countries.
163



While most private capital is moved to lower income countries in search of
profits, there has also been a significant flow of aid financed by private foundations and other charitable groups. In 1969, this flow amounted to over
$400 million. Private foundations also played a significant role in one of
the most dramatic successes among aid programs by contributing to the
technological developments culminating in the new varieties of wheat, rice,
and other grains which have created the "green revolution." The resulting
increase in agricultural productivity greatly heightens the chances of a
continual rise in the level of living despite rapidly growing populations. The
technological improvement has been so overwhelming, however, that serious
adjustment problems are emerging. The benefits do not accrue evenly to
the agricultural population, and new job opportunities will have to be
created to absorb the labor force released from agriculture. In short, even
success can create problems, and this example well illustrates the complexity
of the growth process.
RELATIONSHIPS AMONG INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC
POLICIES
The various issues reviewed in this chapter are best considered, not independently, but in terms of the important interrelationships which tie them
all together. U.S. trade policy, for example, must be considered in the light
of domestic economic conditions as well as of the responsibilities implied
by the key role of the dollar in the international monetary system. The relationship between the United States and the European Economic Community
is a major consideration in the formulation of both our trade and our balance-of-payments policies. And generalized preferences for the exports of
lower income countries, official aid flows, and private investment in these
countries all play an important part in the effort to find the most effective
contribution which this country, along with other industrialized countries,
can make to the economic development of lower income nations.
In the light of these interrelationships, the President has recently moved
to assure coordination at the highest level of all aspects of our foreign
economic policy and to provide consistency with domestic economic policy
and basic foreign policy objectives. Such coordination and overall direction
is to be provided by the new Council on International Economic Policy, of
which the President will be Chairman, and whose membership will include
the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor, the
Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers, the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations, the Executive Director of the Domestic Affairs Council, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Ambassadorat-Large. The newly-appointed Assistant to the President for International
Economic Affairs will serve as Executive Director. In announcing the formation of this Council, the President pointed out that its purpose is to deal
with the international economic policies of the United States as a coherent
whole.

Corporate Liquidity in 1969 and 1970
Measures of liquidity refer to the capability of a corporation to make payments as obligations fall due. In reality, liquidity is a dynamic concept involving the total inflows and outflows of cash, and it extends beyond the
static financial values expressed in a company's balance sheet. Gash inflows result not only from the current selling of inventory and subsequent
collection of accounts, but also from the conversion of existing financial
assets and real properties into cash, as well as from short- and longterm borrowings, and the raising of additional ownership funds. Gash
outflows result from current payments for goods and services, but they are
also influenced by the pace of capital investments, payment of dividends
to owners, and the repayment of borrowed funds. Liquidity, therefore, is
determined not only by the interrelationship between current assets and
liabilities, but also by the general economic status and prospects of the firm,
its access to alternative sources of funds from the money and capital markets,
and of course the impact of national monetary and fiscal policies. Unfortunately, a general analysis of liquidity is difficult because there are extreme
variations in the liquidity requirements of different industries. Even within
the same industry, individual firms have divergent policies reflecting unique
management goals and techniques. Nevertheless, it is important to analyze*
the general status of corporate liquidity in appraising the entire economy.
During 1969 and the first half of 1970 there was particular concern about
the liquidity of corporate businesses. With the sustained period of credit restraint in 1969 and early 1970, some financial imbalances that had accumulated during the long inflation became more apparent. Capital expenditures
of businesses were high and large increases were projected for 1970, but it was
also clear that the financing of these expansion plans had relied heavily
on short-term borrowing. Some companies were therefore in an exposed position if a deterioration of earnings or some development in credit markets
should incline holders of these short-term liabilities to demand payment. As
the economy responded to measures of restraint, corporate profits did decline,
and confidence was even more generally disturbed by the financial problems
of the Penn Central Railroad.
DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY
This appendix summarizes liquidity developments in a sample of large
U.S. manufacturing corporations during 1969 and the first three quarters of




169

1970. Nonmanufacturing corporations are not included because liquidity information is not available for this category prior to the third quarter of 1969.
Particular attention is given to the question of whether the financial difficulties of 1969 and the first three quarters of 1970 produced a situation in
which a large number of sound and profitable corporations were threatened
with bankruptcy as a result of their inability to meet short-term obligations.
The financial information summarized in this appendix was collected by
the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of its regular quarterly survey of manufacturing corporations. To preserve the absolute confidentiality
of the information submitted to the SEC, the material is presented only on
an aggregate basis. Only large manufacturing corporations (those with total
assets of $100 million or more in 1970 I) were included in the aggregate
analysis. Nevertheless, the sample group has control of about 75 percent
of the assets of all manufacturers. A total of 553 large manufacturing corporations submitting quarterly income statements and balance sheets met
the size criterion used; of these, 18 were omitted because they did not report
in each quarter throughout the 1969 I to 1970 III period.
The liquidity ratios reported in this appendix differ from the statistics published by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its Quarterly Financial
Report. The Commission's figures refer to ratios of aggregates; for example,
the current ratio for a specific industry is determined by totaling the current
assets of all corporations in that industry and dividing this sum by the total
of current liabilities of the same corporations. Figures reported in this
appendix are the arithmetic means of all the individual corporation ratios;
that is, the individual corporate ratios are totaled and then divided by the
number of corporations. By averaging the ratios, an equal weight is given
to each individual ratio regardless of the size of the corporation. This
approach avoids the distortion that occurs if an aggregate statistic is dominated by a few large corporations whose characteristics may not be typical
of the majority.
MEASURES OF CORPORATE LIQUIDITY
A corporation's difficulty in meeting its short-term obligations could arise
from a number of causes: (1) a deficiency of cash and other assets which
can be quickly converted into cash; (2) excessive reliance on short-term
sources of funds to finance long-term asset requirements; (3) the absence of
an active market for financial securities often held by corporations as liquid
assets, with the result that these assets lose their marketability or can only
be sold at a large loss; and (4) an inability to arrange for additional financing
to meet maturing liabilities.
This analysis concentrates on whether the first two conditions associated
with a liquidity crisis existed in the first three quarters of 1970. The financial
markets never became so disorganized that active trading of liquid short-term
securities disappeared. While interest rates remained at high levels, measured
in historical terms, and the spread of interest rates on securities with differing




170

default risks widened to reflect a greater sensitivity of lenders to the varying
quality of corporate borrowers, a record volume of corporate financing was
accomplished; and the financial markets remained orderly throughout the
year. The issue of whether or not there was a shortage of the additional
financing needed by corporations, particularly a shortage of short-term
credit, cannot be examined because the aggregate data collected by the Securities and Exchange Commission from corporate balance sheets and income statements do not record items such as "lines of credit" at financial
institutions. Furthermore, the ability of a corporation to arrange for additional credit to meet short-term obligations depends on such nonquantifiable
factors as credit ratings and subjective evaluation of the corporation's future
prospects.
A simple assessment of the adequacy of a corporation's liquidity position
can be made from a detailed examination of its balance sheet and income
statement. The degree of liquidity varies, however, between different types
of assets. Similarly, the need to pay maturing obligations, whenever they
cannot be replaced with new credits, varies between categories of liabilities.
A number of financial ratios must therefore be used to measure the adequacy
of corporate liquidity, particularly when many different corporations are
being compared on an aggregate basis. Although each individual ratio may
present an incomplete picture, a comprehensive set of ratios does summarize most of the information about corporate liquidity that can be obtained from balance sheets and income statements.
The liquidity ratios used in the analysis are as follows (the term "current"
conventionally refers to an asset or liability maturing within 1 year) :
Total Current Assets
(1) The Current Ratio= — - 7 7 ;
^ T . u.r .

Total Current Liabilities
This ratio gives a general description of the liquidity position of a
corporation, showing the extent to which current liabilities are covered by
current assets. Its major weakness is its use of such broad financial categories.
Current asset accounts differ considerably in their convertibility into cash.
Similarly, there is great variation in the characteristics of current liabilities.

its business.

(3) The Quick R a t i o - —

'
^
Total Current Liabilities
This ratio relates only the most liquid assets to current liabilities. While the
quick ratio is very selective about liquid assets, it does not distinguish between




171

liability accounts. Nor does it take into account other prime sources of
liquidity, such as holdings of commercial paper, prepayments, State and
local government bonds, and short-term holdings of other corporate securities.
(4) The Solvency Ratio=
Cash + Government Securities + Other Current Assets
Total Current Liabilities — Accounts Payable
The solvency ratio compares highly liquid assets to near-term obligations
that do not arise from normal day-to-day business—hence the removal of
accounts payable from the denominator. The category "other current assets" is composed of commercial paper holdings, State and local government
securities, and prepayments, which are all quite liquid. The denominator
focuses on short-term loans, the current portion of long-term debt (payments due within 1 year), and commercial paper obligations.
(5) The Short-Term Debt Ratio=
Short-Term Bank Loans + Other Current Liabilities
Total Current Assets
This debt ratio indicates the extent to which a firm finances its assets with
short-term credit. "Other current liabilities" include commercial paper
borrowing. One source of. difficulty which may have been encountered in
the first half of 1970 is that expectations of a drop in long-term interest rates
led to the use of short-term credit when longer-term instruments should have
been used. A rise in the short-term debt ratio would reflect this development.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Chart A-l summarizes the current and quick ratios for large manufacturing corporations over the period of 1948-69. The liquidity position of these
corporations has shown a downward trend during the last two decades. The
other liquidity ratios analyzed in this appendix have followed the same
pattern. The downward trend reflects three significant developments:
1. Liquidity was high following World War II for a variety of reasons,
and much of the early decline was an adjustment of the enlarged volume of
liquid assets created during the war to the new levels of business activity.
2. The absence of severe depressions since World War II has caused
corporations to reduce cash and liquid assets to a lower proportion of
total assets. With greater confidence in the stability of the economy, corporate
financial managers have been attracted by the profit opportunities of investing such funds in inventories and other forms of working assets. Modern
techniques of short-term portfolio management have also encouraged the
shift from cash balances into short-term marketable securities in response to
rising interest rates.

3. The rising rate of inflation after 1965 probably influenced corporations
to shift from cash and other financial assets into inventories and physical
capital assets. This was a preventive measure, aimed at protecting profits
and the real value of assets because during periods of inflation the purchasing power of most financial assets is eroded, but the value of inventories and
physical assets tends to appreciate.
In addition to the basic trend, individual corporations may experience
deterioration in their liquidity positions for reasons beyond their control,
particularly during periods of economic change. The remainder of this
appendix reviews liquidity developments during the 1969-70 period, as
measured by the five liquidity ratios.
BEHAVIOR OF CORPORATE LIQUIDITY: 1969 I THROUGH 1970 III
Measures of corporate liquidity declined steadily from the beginning of
1969 through the first quarter of 1970 and then leveled off (Table A - l ) .
Part of the reduction in the current and acid-test ratios is a continuation of
173
411-364 0—71




12

the postwar trend. However, the restrictive monetary policy in the second
half of 1969, the reduced level of corporate profits in the first half of 1970,
the rapid pace of business investment in plant and equipment throughout
1969 and early 1970, and efforts by corporate management to minimize the
effects of inflation all contributed to the decline. For example, the 6.5-percent
decrease in the current ratio was caused by the more rapid 19.5-percent
growth of current liabilities, compared with only an 11.3-percent expansion
of current assets between the first quarter of 1969 and the third quarter of
1970. An absolute decline in holdings of cash and U.S. Government securities
accounts for much of the change. Corporations were evidently willing to hold
inventories in expectation of future sales at higher prices, or they were
trapped into carrying large stocks when sales volume became sluggish. Inventories of large manufacturing corporations increased 16.6 percent during
the period, while all other current assets increased by only 6.7 percent.

The behavior of the quick ratio and the solvency ratio was very different, and it is the sharp drop in these two ratios that has caused most of the
concern. Both ratios fell because of long-term management policies designed
to minimize holdings of cash and marketable securities, combined with the
decline in cash flows as corporate profits dipped in 1970. Corporate policies
to replenish cash and marketable securities through short- and long-term
financing efforts during the second half of 1970 should stabilize both ratios,
and a stronger corporate profit performance would result in improvement
of both measures. Continuation of an easy monetary policy in 1971 should
enable the banks to meet the credit needs of financially sound borrowers.
The leveling off of business spending for plant and equipment in 1971 and
the traditional lagged response of dividend increases as corporate profits rise
should help curtail cash outflows.
In general, the various liquidity measures for large manufacturing corporations declined during the period, some in line with historical trends,
and others more sharply. However, a more detailed analysis indicates that a
significant part of the decline can be attributed to the reaction of the most




^74

liquid firms to monetary restraint. For each liquidity ratio the entire sample
of firms was divided into two groups, those whose average ratio during the
entire period was below the mean and those whose average ratio was above
the mean (Table A-2). Four of the five ratios show that the firms with
above-average liquidity experienced larger declines in liquidity during the
period than the firms in the below-average category. Because the current
ratio is the least discriminating of these measures of liquidity, its failure to
corroborate the trend does not invalidate the general conclusion. Increases
in the short-term-debt ratio imply a deteriorating liquidity position; hence
firms in the "below-average liquidity" category had short-term debt ratios
above the mean, but they showed a smaller rise in that ratio. While part of
this pattern might be attributed to purely statistical phenomena, the fact
that the below-average liquidity group experienced a less pronounced deterioration in liquidity reduces the severity of the problem.

Manufacturing Corporations With Low Liquidity Ratios in 1970 I
Although the aggregate data for large manufacturing corporations do not
reveal a major crisis in the liquidity position of the entire sample analyzed,
many individual corporations with relatively low liquid assets and large
current obligations undoubtedly experienced serious problems. A closer
examination of these corporations was undertaken.
Corporations with a quick ratio of 0.06 or less and corporations with a
solvency ratio of 0.15 or less in the first quarter of 1970 were analyzed.
As a result of these cutoff points approximately 10 percent of the sample
group of large manufacturing corporations was included in the followup
study. The quick ratio was chosen as a standard because of its wide use
as an indicator of liquidity and because it focuses only on holdings of quite
liquid assets. Fifty-nine out of the 535 corporations in the sample were found
to have a quick ratio of 0.06 or less. The solvency ratio was useful in identifying corporations with liquidity problems, because it measures the availability of highly liquid assets to cover current liabilities other than accounts




175

payable. Since 28 of the 50 corporations with this characteristic were also
included in the group with a low quick ratio, the net total was 81
corporations.
Table A-3 summarizes the average liquidity and operating ratios for
the special sample of low-liquidity manufacturing corporations. Their
average liquidity position, of course, is lower than the average for the entire
sample of 535 large manufacturing corporations. However, even these
specially selected corporations do not appear to have liquidity problems
serious enough to threaten a crisis. In fact, among the original 535 corporations analyzed in the study, not one bankruptcy was reported. This record is
not too surprising in view of the very large size of these corporations.

Source: Securities and Exchange Commission.

Detailed analysis of the balance sheets and income statements of the corporations with either a low quick or a low solvency ratio, or both of these,
identified three general types of financial experience. The first group of corporations (approximately one-quarter of the total) had relatively high
liquidity as measured by the current and acid-test ratios. Many of these
corporations had very low cash balances, however, and virtually no holdings
of U.S. Government securities, a fact which accounts for their very low
quick and solvency ratios. Nevertheless, corporations in this first group had
strong general liquidity positions and high cash flows relative to assets.
Furthermore, the operating ratios of these corporations were generally better
than the average figures for the sample group of 535 manufacturing corporations. The data suggest that this group of corporations reacted to monetary restraint and rising interest rates by reducing their holdings of very
liquid assets and increasing their use of short-term debt financing, without
impairing either their earnings potential or their access to money and capital
markets.




A second group, approximately one-half of the sample of 81 corporations,
can be described as having generally low liquidity positions, but high operating ratios, indicating efficient operations and good profit returns. The average collection period for receivables is generally lower for these corporations than the average for the entire sample of 535 large manufacturing
firms, and their inventory turnover is generally higher. These corporations, as a whole, had no difficulty in arranging necessary financing during
the period examined. Financing difficulties could arise, however, as a result
of severe strains in the money and capital markets. The continued financial
health of these corporations depends in large measure upon stable conditions in the financial markets and a moderate increase in their overall
liquidity.
A third group, which includes approximately one-fourth of the special
sample of low liquidity firms, apparently did experience serious liquidity
problems. Their operating ratios remain low, an indication that the problems facing those corporations are quite distinct from those brought about
by a shortage of liquid assets. Most of the corporations in this group have
low profit margins and low returns, or none at all, on their equity investment. Their average collection period for receivables is generally higher
than the average in their industry, in some cases even three or four times
higher. They also appear to turn over their inventories less frequently
than the average turnover for their industry. These corporations would
undoubtedly have difficulty in arranging new financing in the money and
capital markets. The source of their problems, and their low liquidity position, can more accurately be attributed to their general economic weakness
and their competitive position in their markets than to the impact of monetary restraint on the money and capital markets.
Manufacturing Corporations With Negative Profits in 1970 I
Thirty-nine out of the total of 535 large manufacturing corporations
reported losses in the first quarter of 1970. Table A—4 summarizes the
liquidity ratios and operating ratios of this group. Surprisingly, the average
liquidity position of these corporations appears to be adequate. The current
and acid-test ratios are only slightly lower than those for the entire sample
of large manufacturing corporations, and the amount of decline in these
ratios has been moderate. The fact that the short-term debt ratio is higher
than that for the entire sample of 535 corporations indicates that these
corporations, along with the group of low-liquidity corporations referred to
in Table A-3, rely heavily on short-term financing. The maintenance of
stability in the money markets, particularly in the commercial paper market,
is important for the continued viability of these corporations.

CONCLUSION

This study suggests that the deterioration of corporate liquidity during
1969 and 1970 has been generally moderate for the group of large manufacturing corporations analyzed. There was some decline in the aggregate
liquidity ratios but not enough to approach the crisis zone. To the extent
that the sample of large manufacturing firms is not completely representative of all business firms this general conclusion might have to be qualified.
Small businesses as well as firms in certain nonmanufacturing industries
may have had more liquidity problems than is indicated in this analysis.
Furthermore, the severe difficulties experienced by some of the large manufacturing corporations in the analysis are concealed within the general averages. Nevertheless, during the period under review, when there was growing public concern about business liquidity, the responsibility for evaluating
the situation and taking necessary policy actions needed to avert a genuine
liquidity crisis was assumed by the appropriate agencies of the Government.
Continued study of the money and financial markets, and the role of Government agencies in improving the operation of these markets will be a vital
part of the future development of the economy.

ECONOMIC POLICY MAKING AND THE COUNCIL OF
ECONOMIC ADVISERS
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COUNCIL
The Employment Act of 1946 describes the objectives of national economic policy as "creating and maintaining, in a manner calculated to foster
and promote free competitive enterprise and the general welfare, conditions under which there will be afforded useful employment opportunities."
The basic responsibility of the Council is to advise the President concerning Federal activities to achieve that goal. Statistical analyses of economic
conditions and of the results of stabilization policies are an important part
of the assignment, along with the preparation of economic forecasts, using
a variety of analytical tools. Final output of all Council activities is presented
in personal consultations with the President, in communications from the
Chairman to the President, in presentations to the Cabinet and Domestic Affairs Council, and in reports to other Executive Offices and the Congress.
While the Employment Act specifically directs the Council "to appraise
the various programs and activities of the Federal Government," this function is largely an internal operation. The Council staff constantly works
with other agencies to assist the Administration in developing new legislative programs and in appraising existing activities. It also makes recommendations to the Administration concerning pending legislation. In 1970,
the Council prepared responses to legislative referrals involving 180 bills. In
preparing these recommendations the Council considers the broader viewpoint of the general public and the effects on the entire economy. Specifically, the Council helped formulate new Administration programs relating
to manpower training and development, unemployment compensation, national emergency strikes, housing and community development, regional economic development, welfare and social security, health, education, consumer
interests, agriculture, trade policies, transportation systems, protection of
the physical environment, Federal credit programs, financial institutions,
and assistance to small business. In addition, the Council and its staff contributed to numerous interagency efforts to improve Federal Government
programs, policies, and procedures in such diverse areas as the regulation
of financial institutions; meat and dairy import restrictions; international
finance; expansion of exports; foreign investment; development of natural
resources; transportation systems and their regulation; Federal procurement policies; use of national land; Federal sponsorship of research; programs in health and education; national problems concerning energy; antitrust; telecommunications; resource stockpiling; studies of basic industries,
such as copper; environmental programs; and many others.




184

POLICY COORDINATION
The broad range of economic policy issues confronting the Council requires it to work very closely with other Government officials. There is
especially close coordination between the Treasury Department, the Office
of Management and Budget, and the Council of Economic Advisers. Approximately once each week the Secretary of the Treasury, Director of the
Office of Management and Budget, and Chairman of the Council meet
to discuss the economic situation, Federal budget matters, and broad economic policy issues. This is the group known as the "Troika." A second
tier consists of one of the other Council Members, the Economist for the
Office of Management and Budget, and the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy. A third tier, consisting of senior staff economists
from the three agencies, meets frequently to appraise the economic situation and its policy implications. The outlook is summarized in memoranda
which they prepare and clear through the second tier of the "Troika" for
use by the principals. The "Troika" meets with the President frequently.
From time to time the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System participates in these meetings, forming the "Quadriad."
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Policy, established by Executive
Order of the President on January 24, 1969, provides for coordination of
economic policies within the Executive Office. Members include the
President; the Vice President; the Secretaries of the Treasury, Agriculture,
Commerce, Labor, and Housing and Urban Development; Mr. Moynihan,
Counselor to the President in 1970; the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; the Deputy Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs;
and the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers (who coordinates
the work of the Committee).
This Committee considers a broad spectrum of economic issues, such as
interest rate ceilings for financial institutions, national housing requirements,
establishment of a commission to review Federal statistics, lumber and plywood resources, post-Vietnam economic planning, the copper industry, agricultural trade, antitrust, operation of capital markets, transportation, and
Federal budgeting procedures.
Council Members participate in a number of other Cabinet and interagency committees. In 1970, the Chairman served as Chairman of the
Cabinet Committee on Construction and of the Domestic Affairs Council
Subcommittee on the National Energy Situation. The Chairman is a member of the Domestic Affairs Council and several of its various subcommittees,
the Property Review Board, the National Commission on Productivity, the
Regulations and Purchasing Review Board, and the Defense Programs
Review Committee. He also attends meetings of the National Security
Council when agenda items require his attention.




The other two Council Members and the Senior Staff Economists also
participate in the task forces and study groups designated by these committees. The Chairman of the Council regularly attends Cabinet meetings.
The Council has a particularly close association with the Joint Economic
Committee of the Congress, which was created by the Employment Act of
1946 "to make a continuing study of matters relating to the Economic Report" and to contribute to the achievement of the economic objectives of
that Act. During 1970, the Council testified three times before the Joint
Economic Committee. On February 16, the Council presented testimony
following submission of the Economic Report to Congress. The Joint Economic Committee is required by the Act to file a report to Congress by
March 1, evaluating the recommendations and content of the Economic
Report. On June 15, Mr. Stein testified before the Joint Economic Committee Subcommittee on Economy in Government Hearings on Changing
National Priorities. On July 20, the Chairman reviewed economic conditions
and the outlook before the Joint Economic Committee. Council Members
also presented testimony to Congress four other times during 1970. On
February 9, the Council presented testimony to the House Committee on
Banking and Currency concerning national housing objectives. The same
day the Chairman appeared before the House Committee on Appropriations. On March 3, Mr. Houthakker presented testimony to the National
Commission on Product Safety. And on October 6, Mr. Stein appeared
before the House Select Committee on Small Business, Subcommittee on
Special Small Business Problems, to discuss the national energy situation.
At the international level, Council Members and staff are active in meetings of the Economic Policy Committee of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. The Chairman leads the U.S. delegation
to the Economic Policy Committee and serves as its Vice Chairman. This
Committee attempts to improve the mutual understanding and coordination
of domestic economic policies among member nations. Council Members
and Senior Staff Economists also participated in several Economic Policy
Committee subcommittees, including Working Party III on the balance of
payments and international financial problems, the Working Group .on
Short-Term Economic Prospects, Working Party II on policies for the
promotion of long-term economic growth, the Manpower and Social Affairs
Committee considering manpower policies in member countries, and a
new committee created by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development to study environmental problems. In 1970, Council personnel
attended 14 international meetings.
PUBLICATIONS
The annual Economic Report is the major publication through which the
Council explains economic policies to the general public. About 52,000
copies of the February 1970 Economic Report have been distributed. The




186

Statistical Office of the Council also prepares Economic Indicators, a monthly
publication issued by the Joint Economic Committee. The current circulation of Economic Indicators is approximately 10,000 copies. On August 7,
the Council published its first Inflation Alert, which summarized the historical relationship of wages, prices, and productivity, reviewed changes
in the major wage and price indexes during the first half of 1970, and
evaluated several major wage and price decisions made during that time
period. The second Inflation Alert was released on December 1.
PUBLIC CONTACTS
During 1970, the Council continued to hold periodic meetings with
groups of academic, business, and labor union economists to exchange views
on economic policies. Many individual businessmen and labor leaders, students, educators, foreign visitors, news media representatives, and interested
citizens have also visited with Council Members to discuss a wide range of
economic issues. Finally, to communicate Council viewpoints concerning
current economic conditions and necessary policy decisions, Council Members
and the Special Assistant to the Chairman made a substantial number of
speeches throughout the year and participated in frequent interviews with
representatives of all types of news media.

ORGANIZATION AND STAFF OF THE COUNCIL
OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN
As stipulated in the Employment Act, as amended by Reorganization
Plan No. 9 in 1953, the Chairman is responsible for reporting the Council's
views to the President. The Chairman fulfills this charge through direct
conferences with the President and reports describing current developments
and economic policy requirements. The Chairman also represents the Council at Cabinet meetings; at congressional briefings; in U.S. delegations to
international activities; in meetings with the Chairman of the Federal
Reserve System and Chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board;
in sessions of the "Troika" and "Quadriad" and as the chairman of numerous
Cabinet and interagency committees; in the coordination of professional
staff activities; and in contacts with other Government offices.
COUNCIL MEMBERS
Specific professional activities are directed by the other two Council Members. While the Council is not departmentalized, and all three Members
frequently work together on major projects, there is an informal division




of responsibilities by subject area. Mr. Houthakker's responsibilities include
direction of staff assignments covering such matters as international finance
and trade policy, foreign aid and economic development, agriculture, transportation, telecommunications, industrial organization and antitrust, labor
relations, long-term economic growth, consumer affairs, natural resources,
technology, and environmental problems. He also supervises the preparation
of Inflation Alert.
Mr. Stein's responsibilities include forecasting and analyses of economic
conditions, medium-term economic projections, fiscal policy and taxation,
Federal budget concepts and reform, Federal credit programs, monetary
policy, financial institutions, housing and urban affairs, welfare and social
security problems, problems relating to education, health, manpower, and
human resources, as well as national defense programs and the problems of
transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy.
In addition, Mr. Houthakker and Mr. Stein represent the Council at a
wide variety of official gatherings, including meetings of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Policy, the Cabinet Committee on Construction, and
the Economic Policy Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The entire Council meets frequently with the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. One of the Members is always
designated as Acting Chairman when the Chairman is absent.
PROFESSIONAL STAFF
At the end of 1970, the professional staff included 14 Senior Staff Economists, two Statisticians, six Junior Economists, and one Research Assistant.
Each member of the professional staff is responsible for economic analysis
and policy recommendations in a major subject area involving Council
interests. In addition, the staff economists carry out many different Council
and interagency assignments requiring a broad application of their general
knowledge and analytical skills. The professional staff and their special
fields are:

for the Economic Report, and the fact checking of memoranda, speeches,
and testimony. Assisting Miss James are Teresa D. Bradburn, Catherine H.
Furlong, V. Madge McMahon, and Natalie V. Rentfro.
The Council also conducts a student intern program, employing a limited
number of outstanding students of economics, both graduate and undergraduate for various periods, particularly during the summer months. The
1970 interns were Victoria A. Dailey (University of Virginia), Michael C.
Deppler (Georgetown University), Ronald G. Ehrenberg (Northwestern
University), Richard J. Herring (Princeton University), and Charles F.
Revier (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Professor Raymond G.
Lloyd (Tennessee A. and I. State University) also joined the staff during
the summer.

1 Gross national product less compensation of general government employees.
2 Includes compensation of employees in government enterprises. Government enterprises are those agencies of government whose operating costs are to a substantial extent covered by the sale of goods and services, in contrast to the
general activities of government, which are financed mainly by tax revenues and debt creation. The Post Office and public
power systems are examples of government enterprises; on the other hand, State universities and public parks are part of
general government activities.
* Compensation of general government employees.

1 Gross national product less compensation of general government employees.
2
Includes compensation of employees in government enterprises. Government enterprises are those agencies of government whose operating costs are to a substantial extent covered by the sale of goods and services, in contrast to the general
activities of government, which are financed mainly by tax revenues and debt creation. The Post Office and public power
systems are examples of government enterprises; on the other hand, State universities and public parks are part of general government activities.

Note.—Data in Tables C-27 through C-33 are based on reports from employing establishments and relate to full- and
part-time wage and salary workers in nonagricultural establishments who worked during, or received pay for, any part of
the pay period which includes the, 12th of the month.
Not comparable with labor force data (Tables C-22 through C-25), which include proprietors, self-employed persons,
domestic servants, and unpaid family workers, and which count persons as employed when they are not at work because
of industrial disputes, bad weather, etc.
For description and details of the various establishment data, see "Employment and Earnings."

1
Excludes agricultural business; real estate operators; medical, legal, educational, and cultural service; and nonprofit
organizations. These figures do not agree precisely with the fixed investment data in the gross national product estimates,
mainly because those data include investment by farmers, professionals, institutions, and real estate firms, and certain
outlays charged to current account.
2 Commercial and other includes trade, service, construction, finance, and insurance.
3
Estimates based on expected capital expenditures reported by business in October-December 1970. Includes adjustments for systematic biases in expectations data.

Note.—Annual total is the sum of unadjusted expenditures; it does not necessarily coincide with the average of seasonally adjusted figures.

1 Monthly average for year and total for month.
2 Seasonally adjusted, end of period.
3 Inventory/sales ratio. For annual periods, ratio of weighted average inventories to average monthly sales; for monthly
data, ratio of inventories at end of month to sales for month.
4
Manufacturing data prior to 1961 not completely comparable with later data. See Department of Commerce, Bureau
of the Census, "Series M3-1.1," September 1968.
5
Based on seasonally adjusted data through November.
6
Unofficial estimate.
Note—The inventory figures in this table do not agree with the estimates of change in business inventories included
in the gross national product since these figures cover only manufacturing and trade rather than all business, and show
inventories in terms of current book value without adjustment for revaluation.

i Percentage changes for services are based on unadjusted indexes since these prices have little seasonal movement.
Note.—The percentage changes are calculated from indexes on a 1957-59 base; therefore, the unadjusted changes may
differ slightly from those calculated from indexes on a 1967 base as shown in Table C-46. The seasonally adjusted changes
for the all items index are based on seasonal adjustment factors and seasonally adjusted indexes carried to two decimal
places.

1 Data are for last Wednesday of month (except June 30 and December 31 call dates used for all commercial banks).
* Adjusted to exclude interbank loans beginning 1948.
Weekly reporting large commercial banks beginning 1965 and weekly reporting member banks prior to 1965.
* Commercial and industrial loans and prior to 1956, agricultural loans. Beginning July 1959, loans to financial institutions excluded. Prior to 1943, published data adjusted to include open-market paper.
5 Effective June 1966, balances accumulated for payment of personal loans (about $1.1 billion) are excluded from loans
at all commercial banks, and certain certificates of CCC and Export-Import Bank totaling about $1 billion are included in
other securities rather than in loans.
e New series beginning June 1969; for details see "Federal Reserve Bulletin," August 1969.

Net public and private debt is a comprehensive aggregate of the indebtedness of borrowers after eliminating certain
types of duplicating governmental and corporate debt.
i Net Federal Government and agency debt is the outstanding debt held by the public, as defined in the "Budget of the
United States Government, for the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 1972."
3 This comprises the debt of federally sponsored agencies, in which there is no longer any Federal proprietary interest.
The obligations of the Federal Land Banks are included beginning with 1947, the debt of the Federal Home Loan Banks
is included beginning with 1951, and the debts of the Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Intermediate Credit
Banks, and Banks for Cooperatives are included beginning with 1968.
* Farm mortgages and farm production loans. Farmers' financial and consumer debt is included in the nonfarm categories.
* Financial debt is debt owed to banks for purchasing or carrying securities, customers' debt to brokers, and debt owed
to life insurance companies by policyholders.

'The figures shown here for "internal sources," "undistributed profits," and "capital consumption allowances"
differ from those shown for "cash flow, net of dividends," "undistributed profits." and "capital consumption allowances"
in the gross corporate product table in the national income and product accounts of the Department of Commerce for
the following reasons: (1) these figures include, and the statistics in the gross corporate product table exclude branch
profits remitted from foreigners net of corresponding U.S. remittances to foreigners; and (2) these figures exclude and
the gross corporate product figures include, the internal funds of corporations whose major activity is farming.

Receivables from and payables to U.S. Government do not include amounts offset against each other on corporations'
books or amounts arising from subcontracting which are not directly due from or to the U.S. Government. Wherever possible,
adjustments have been made to include U.S. Government advances offset against inventories on corporations' books.

current assets.
* Generally reflects definitions and classifications used in "Statistics of Income" for 1961.
Note.—Data relate to all U.S. corporations, excluding banks, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, and beginning with the new series for 1961, investment companies. Year-end data through 1967 are based on
"Statistics of Income" (Treasury Department), covering virtually all corporations in the United States. "Statistics of
Income" data may not be strictly comparable from year to year because of changes in the tax laws, basis for filing returns,
and processing of data for compilation purposes. All other figures shown are estimates based on data compiled from many
different sources, including data on corporations registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

* Farm population as defined by Department of Agriculture and Department of Commerce, i.e., civilian population
living on farms, regardless of occupation.
* Total population of United States as of July 1 including Armed Forces overseas.
* includes persons doing farmwork on all farms. These data, published by the Department of Agriculture, Statistical
Reporting Service, differ from those on agricultural employment by the Department of Labor (see Table C-22) because of
differences in the method of approach, in concepts of employment, and in time of month for which the data are collected.
See monthly report on "Farm Labor."
« Computed from variable weights for individual crops produced each year.
