ECONOMIC REPORT
OF THE PRESIDENT




ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT
To the Congress of the United States:

I have long believed that the vitality of the American economy and
the prosperity of the American people have been diminished by inappropriate policies of the Federal Government: unnecessary government regulations that discouraged initiative and wasted scarce capital
and labor; an inefficient and unfair tax system that penalized effort,
saving, and investment; excessive government spending that wasted
taxpayers' money, misused our Nation's resources, and created
budget deficits that reduced capital formation and added to the
burden of the national debt; and monetary policies that produced
frequent business cycles and a path of increasing inflation.
I came to Washington to change these policies. The needed reforms are far from complete, but substantial progress can already be
seen: the burden of regulation has been reduced, tax rates have been
lowered and the tax structure improved, government spending on a
wide range of domestic programs has been curtailed, and a sound
monetary policy has been established.
Although the full favorable effect of those reforms on our Nation's
rate of economic growth will take time to develop, some of the benefit of our economic policies is already visible in the current recovery.
The economy's performance in 1983 was very gratifying to me. The
3.2 percent rise in consumer prices between 1982 and 1983 was the
lowest rate of inflation since 1967. The recovery produced a sharp
drop in unemployment and a substantial increase in the income of
American families. The number of people at work increased by more
than 4 million and the unemployment rate fell from a high of 10.7
percent in December 1982 to 8.2 percent in December 1983. The 6.1
percent rise in real gross national product (GNP) last year means that
real annual income per person in the United States rose $700.
Reducing Unemployment

Despite the substantial reduction in unemployment, the number of
unemployed workers remains unacceptably high. Continued economic recovery will mean millions of additional jobs in the years ahead
and further declines in the rate of unemployment. In 1984 alone, the
American economy is expected to add more than 3 million additional
jobs. By the end of the decade, we will need 16 million new jobs to
absorb a growing labor force. Only a strong and expanding economy




can provide those jobs while achieving a progressively lower level of
unemployment over the next 6 years.
Although economic growth is by far the most important way to
reduce unemployment, special policies to help the structurally unemployed and particularly disadvantaged groups can also be helpful. To
assist these individuals in developing job-related skills that will lead
to productive careers in the private sector, I proposed the Job Training Partnership Act that I signed into law in 1982. Last year I proposed additional measures to increase opportunities for training and
retraining. Although the Congress has enacted some of my employment proposals, I am still waiting for congressional action on others.
Of particular concern to me is the unemployment among teenagers. Such unemployment is not only a problem in itself, but is also
indicative of lost opportunities to acquire on-the-job training and
job-related skills. It is widely recognized that the minimum wage law
is a substantial barrier to the employment of teenagers, especially minority teenagers. I have proposed that during the summer months
the minimum wage for teenagers be reduced to 75 percent of the
regular minimum wage. This reform would give many teenagers the
opportunity to get a first job and acquire the skills needed to help
them with subsequent employment and would not hurt adult employment. With an unemployment rate of nearly 50 percent among black
teenagers and with only about 20 percent of black teenagers employed, we must act. The Federal Government must not be the
source of barriers to employment.
Inflation and Monetary Policy

Reducing the rate of inflation was my most immediate economic
goal when I arrived in Washington. In the preceding 24 months, the
consumer price level had increased more than 27 percent. Many
people feared the U.S. Government had lost its ability to control inflation. Until inflation was brought under control, a healthy recovery
could not get under way.
The inflation rate has declined dramatically over the past 3 years.
Between 1982 and 1983, the consumer price index rose only 3.2 percent. Americans can again have confidence in the value of the dollar,
and they can save for the future without fearing that the purchasing
power of these savings will be destroyed by inflation. I am firmly
committed to keeping inflation on a downward path. We must never
relax in our pursuit of price stability.
The basic requirement for a continued moderation of inflation is a
sound monetary policy. I continue to support the Federal Reserve in
its pursuit of price stability through sound monetary policy. Last year
was a particularly difficult time for monetary policy because of the




substantial changes in financial regulations. I am pleased that, in
spite of these difficulties, the monetary aggregates at the end of the
year were within their target ranges. I expect that in 1984 the Federal Reserve will expand the money stock at a moderate rate that is
consistent with both a sustained recovery and continuing progress
against inflation.
There are those who advocate a fast rate of money growth in an
attempt to depress interest rates. Experience shows, however, that
rapid money growth inevitably leads to an increased rate of inflation
and higher interest rates. The only monetary policy that can bring
interest rates down, and keep them down, is one that promotes confidence that inflation will continue to decline in the years ahead.
The Dollar and the Trade Deficit

The high interest rates in the United States and our low rate of
inflation continue to make dollar securities an appealing investment
for individuals and businesses around the world. In addition, the
United States has been an attractive place for stock market investment and for direct business investment. The result has been a continued rise in the dollar's exchange value relative to other currencies
of the world.
The sharp rise in the value of the dollar since 1980 has made it
cheaper for Americans to purchase products from overseas, thereby
helping us fight inflation. But the dollar's sharp rise has made it difficult for American businesses and farmers to compete in world markets. The decline in U.S. exports and the substantial rise in our imports has resulted in record trade deficits in 1982 and 1983. The
trade deficit has been temporarily exacerbated by the international
debt problems and by the more advanced stage of recovery in the
United States than in the world at large.
Despite these problems, I remain committed to the principle of
free trade as the best way to bring the benefits of competition to
American consumers and businesses. It would be totally inappropriate to respond by erecting trade barriers or by using taxpayers' dollars to subsidize exports. Instead, we must work with the other nations of the world to reduce the export subsidies and import barriers
that currently hurt U.S. farmers, businesses, and workers.
I am also firmly opposed to any attempt to depress the dollar's exchange value by intervention in international currency markets. Pure
exchange market intervention cannot offset the fundamental factors
that determine the dollar's value. Intervention in the foreign exchange market would be an exercise in futility that would probably
enrich currency speculators at the expense of American taxpayers, A
combination of exchange market intervention and expansionary mon-




etary policy could reduce the dollar's exchange value, but only by
causing an unacceptable increase in the rate of inflation. The dollar
must therefore be allowed to seek its natural value without exchange
market intervention.
Regulation

One of the four key elements of my program for economic recovery is a far-reaching program of regulatory relief. Substantial progress has been made during the last 3 years. The growth of new regulations has been reduced by more than a third. The demands on the
private sector of government paperwork have been reduced by several hundred million hours a year. The Congress approved legislation
that has led to substantial deregulation of financial markets and intercity bus transportation. The Federal Communications Commission,
with our support, has reduced the regulation of broadcasting and of
new communications technology, and the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Civil Aeronautics Board have gone far down the
path of deregulation of competitive transportation markets. The
benefits of these and other deregulation measures are now increasingly apparent to American consumers and businesses.
It is also apparent that substantial further deregulation and regulatory reform will require changes in the basic regulatory legislation. I
urge the Congress to act on the several measures that I proposed last
year on natural gas decontrol, financial deregulation, and reform of
private pension regulation. I remain confident that there is a basis
for agreement on measures that would reduce the burden of Federal
regulations, while protecting our shared values and not jeopardizing
safety.
Tax Reforms

The final installment of the 3-year personal tax cut took effect in
July, giving a helpful boost to the economic recovery. The income
tax rate at each income level has been reduced by about 25 percent
since 1980. In 1984 a median income four-person family will pay
about $1,100 less than it would have without these tax reductions.
And, beginning in 1985, the tax brackets will be adjusted automatically so that inflation will no longer push taxpayers into higher brackets and increase the share of their income taken in taxes.
The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 went beyond reducing
tax rates to establish important reforms in the structure of the tax
system. For businesses, the Accelerated Cost Recovery System increased the after-tax profitability of investments in plant and equipment. The sharp fall in inflation has also increased after-tax profit-




ability. As a result, investment in business equipment has recently
been quite strong despite the high real interest rates.
For individuals, the Economic Recovery Tax Act reduced the marriage tax penalty, the estate tax burden, and tax discrimination
against saving. The response to the universal eligibility of Individual
Retirement Accounts (IRAs) has been far greater than was originally
expected. It is estimated that more than 15 million individuals now
use IRAs to save for their retirement. Last year, I proposed to
expand the opportunity for all married couples to use IRAs fully by
allowing them to contribute up to $2,000 each per year to an IRA even
if only one has wage income.
Further improvement and simplification of our tax system are
sorely needed. The burden of taxation depends not only on the
quantity of tax revenue that is collected but also on the quality of the
tax system. I have asked the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a
plan of action with specific recommendations to make our tax system
fairer, simpler, and less of a burden on our Nation's economy. By
broadening the tax base, personal tax rates could come down, not go
up. Our tax system would stimulate greater economic growth and
provide more revenue.
Government Spending

One of my principal goals when I came to Washington was to reverse the dramatic growth of Federal spending on domestic programs
and to shift more resources to our Nation's defense. Although many
doubted this could be done, both goals are being achieved. We must
do everything that we can to avoid waste in defense as in other areas
of government. But we must also be willing to pay the cost of providing the military capability to defend our country and to meet our responsibilities as the leading Nation of the free world. Outlays for defense had declined to only 5.2 percent of GNP in 1980, less than
one-fourth of total government outlays. By the current fiscal year, defense outlays have increased to 6.7 percent of GNP and 28 percent of
total outlays. Real defense outlays have grown 39 percent since 1980.
Our spending on defense, however, remains a far smaller percentage
of our national income than it was in 1960, when defense outlays
took 9.7 percent of GNP.
Real spending has been cut on a wide range of domestic programs
and activities. Many wasteful bureaucratic activities have been eliminated and the number of nondefense employees on the Federal payroll has been reduced by 71,000. We have examined every area of
Federal Government spending, and sought to eliminate unnecessary
and wasteful spending while protecting the benefits needed by the
poor and the aged. As a result, total nondefense spending now takes




a smaller share of our GNP than it did in 1980. Moreover, under
present law, nondefense spending will continue to take a declining
share of our GNP in the years ahead.
This reduction has been accomplished without any decrease in existing social security benefits or any change in the medicare benefits
for the elderly. Spending on all other nondefense activities and programs has actually declined over 12 percent in real terms since 1980.
Even with no further reductions in these activities and programs,
their share of GNP in 1986 will be nearly back to the level of 1965.
I am committed to continuing the search for ways to reduce government spending. The budget that I am submitting to the Congress
identifies significant savings in entitlement programs and reductions
in outlays for other programs that are excessive or that are not the
proper responsibility of the Federal Government. The Grace Commission has given us some 2500 ways to reduce wasteful spending
that could save billions of dollars in the years ahead.
Budget Deficits

I have long believed that our Nation's budget must be balanced. A
pattern of overspending by the Federal Government has produced a
deficit in 22 of the last 23 years. My most serious economic disappointment in 1983 was therefore the failure of the Congress to enact
the deficit reduction proposals that I submitted last January in my
budget for fiscal 1984. We would be much closer to a balanced
budget today if the Congress had enacted all of the spending cuts
that I have requested since assuming office, and if the long recession
and the sharp decline in inflation had not substantially reduced real
tax revenue. In last year's budget I proposed changes in outlays and
revenues that could put the deficit on a sharply declining path that,
by 1988, would have been less than 2 percent of GNP and on its way
to a balance of revenues and outlays.
The unwillingness of the Congress to accept the proposals that I
offered has made it clear to me that we must wait until after this
year's election to enact spending reductions coupled with tax simplification that will eventually eliminate our budget deficit. But we
cannot delay until 1985 to start reducing the deficits that are threatening to prevent a sustained and healthy recovery. I have therefore
called on the Democratic and Republican leaders in the Congress to
designate representatives to work with the Administration on the development of a "downpayment" deficit reduction program.
I believe that this bipartisan group could develop a package that
could be enacted this spring which would reduce the deficit by about
$100 billion over the next 3 fiscal years. The package could include a
number of the less contentious spending cuts that are pending before




the Congress plus additional outlay savings based on the proposals
of the Grace Commission. Additional revenue could be provided by
measures to close certain tax loopholes—measures that the Department of the Treasury has previously said are worthy of support.
These deficit reductions can increase the public's confidence in our
economic future and their faith in the ability of the political system to
deal satisfactorily with the deficit. The downpayment package can be
a first step toward full elimination of the remaining deficits. Even
with a 3-year $100 billion package, the deficits projected for fiscal
1986 and beyond are totally unacceptable to me. They would be a
serious threat to our Nation's economic health and a heavy burden to
future generations. I am committed to finding ways to reduce further
the growth of spending and to put the budget on a path that will
lead to a balance between outlays and receipts. In 1985 I will submit
a budget that can achieve this goal. But we must go further and make
basic structural reforms in the budgetary process—including the lineitem veto and the balanced budget amendment—that will keep
spending under control and prevent deficits in the future.
Looking Ahead

As I look ahead, I am very optimistic about the prospects for the
American enonomy. Substantial progress has been made in reforming the economic policies that will shape our economic future. If we
continue to develop and pursue sound policies, our Nation can
achieve a long period of strong economic growth with low inflation,
and the American people can enjoy unprecedented prosperity and
economic security.

CHAPTER 1

The Strategy of Economic Policy
THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN 1983 was a very favorable combination of rising output, falling unemployment, and declining inflation. These economic improvements and the long-term economic
strategy that the Reagan Administration has been pursuing since
1981 are a welcome change for the American economy.
The Administration's redirection of economic policy was a necessary antidote to the poor economic performance of the 1970s. The
real earnings per week of the average employee were actually lower
in 1980 than they had been a decade earlier. The unemployment rate
doubled between the end of the 1960s and the start of the 1980s.
The level of consumer prices more than doubled and the rate of inflation increased from 5.5 percent in 1970 to 12.4 percent in 1980.
Net private capital investment declined from 7.1 percent of gross national product (GNP) in the 1960s to 6.4 percent of GNP in the
1970s and only 4.1 percent of GNP in 1980.
During these same years, the government expanded and tax burdens rose. Federal Government outlays for all nondefense programs
rose from 10.3 percent of GNP in 1970 to 15.1 percent in 1980.
Total Federal outlays rose from 20.2 percent of GNP to 22.4 percent
of GNP despite the sharp fall in the GNP share devoted to defense.
Although Federal tax receipts took one-fifth of GNP in both 1970
and 1980, many taxpayers found themselves pushed by inflation into
higher marginal tax brackets despite the absence of any rise in real
income. A two-earner family earning twice the median income faced
a marginal tax rate that was 26 percent in 1970 but 43 percent in
1980. The number of taxpayers facing marginal tax rates of 50 percent or higher rose more than five-fold during the decade. Inflation
not only pushed people into higher tax brackets, but also distorted
the measurement of interest income and capital gains, causing dramatic increases in the effective tax rates on real income from savings.
Nevertheless, the Federal budget moved from a position of near
balance in 1970 (a deficit of only 0.3 percent of GNP) to a deficit of
2.3 percent of GNP in 1980.
By 1980 there was widespread agreement that the direction of economic policy had to be changed if economic performance was to im-




21

prove. The accelerating growth of the money stock would have to be
slowed in order to bring down inflation. The high marginal tax rates
would have to be reduced and the tax structure reformed in order to
lower the adverse effects on the incentives to work, save, invest, and
take risks. The share of government domestic spending in GNP
would have to be reduced in order to decrease the distorting effects
of government programs, raise defense outlays, and reduce the
budget deficit.
These aims guided the formation of the Administration's economic
policy in 1981 and in the years since then. Now, 3 years later, monetary policy has been successful in reducing the rate of inflation. Government spending on domestic programs has been reduced to a
smaller share of national income. Tax rates have been lowered and
the tax system has been improved.
This chapter begins with a brief review of the economic recovery
of 1983; a more complete analysis is presented in Chapter 6. Here
the primary focus is on the strategy of economic policy. Three elements of the Administration's long-term economic strategy will be
discussed: sound monetary policy, reduced government spending on
domestic programs, and a tax structure that is conducive to individual initiative and economic growth. The fourth facet of the Administration's economic strategy, the reduction in regulation, was discussed in detail in the 1983 Economic Report; the deregulation of financial markets is the subject of Chapter 5 of this year's Report The
final section of the present chapter describes the medium-term problem of reducing the projected budget deficits.
ECONOMIC RECOVERY
The inherent vitality of the American economy was amply demonstrated in 1983. In this first full year of economic recovery, real GNP
rose 6.1 percent and business output climbed 7.0 percent. Industrial
production rose 16.3 percent in the 13 months following its November 1982 low, and the capacity utilization rate in manufacturing
bounced back from 68.8 percent to 79.4 percent during this same
period.
Civilian employment rose by 4.0 million in 1983 and the civilian
unemployment rate declined from 10.7 percent in December 1982 to
8.2 percent a year later. Although unemployment remains unacceptably high, the progress in raising employment and reducing unemployment in virtually every demographic group has been gratifying.
Civilian employment rose 4.0 percent between December 1982 and
December 1983, while employment among blacks rose 5.0 percent
and among teenagers rose 1.7 percent. The unemployment rate de-




22

dined 2.5 percentage points, while the unemployment rate for blacks
declined 3.1 percentage points and for teenagers declined 4.2 percentage points. Despite this progress, it is clear that more than cyclical recovery will be needed to reduce the very high unemployment
rates among these problem groups. The Administration's employment and training policies and proposals (discussed in detail in
Chapter 2 of the 1983 Economic Report) offer several ways of helping
these individuals and others with temporary unemployment problems
to find work.
The sharp increases in output and employment were accompanied
by an inflation rate that was even lower than in the previous year.
The GNP implicit price deflator rose only 4.1 percent in 1983 after
rising 4.4 percent in 1982 and more than 8.7 percent in 1981. The
consumer price index at the end of 1983 stood only 3.8 percent
above the level of a year earlier, after rising 3.9 percent in 1982, 8.9
percent in 1981, and more than 12 percent in 1980. And the index of
producer prices for finished goods rose only 0.6 percent in 1983, the
smallest increase in nearly two decades and far below the 3.7 percent
in 1982, 7.1 percent in 1981, and 11.8 percent in 1980.
The decline in price inflation accompanied smaller nominal wage
increases and a slower rise in nominal compensation per hour. The
5.6 percent increase in compensation per hour was the slowest rise
since 1967. In combination with the substantial cyclical improvement
in productivity, the slow rise in compensation raised unit labor costs
only 2.4 percent in 1983, far below the 7.9 percent rise in 1982 and
the lowest since 1965.
Despite the slow rise in nominal compensation per hour, the low
rate of inflation meant that real earnings and incomes increased significantly. Real average weekly earnings rose 2.5 percent in the 12
months to December 1983, after rising 0.5 percent in 1982 and declining in each of the 4 preceding years. Real personal income per
capita rose 3.0 percent between the final quarter of 1982 and the
final quarter of 1983 after rising a total of only 1.4 percent in the
entire 3-year period between 1979 and 1982.
A significant problem in the otherwise outstanding recovery was
the sharp decline in net exports. American imports rose while our exports of goods to the rest of the world declined. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit—the excess of imports of goods over our exports of
goods—reached a record of about $65 billion in 1983, nearly twice
1982's record level of $36 billion. This trade deficit, and the even
larger trade deficit projected for 1984, reflects several causes, including the decline of imports among less developed countries and the
relatively advanced stage of the U.S. recovery, but of primary importance is the high real value of the dollar relative to other currencies.

2).
MONETARY POLICY
The fundamental guiding principle of the Administration's approach to monetary policy is that the rate of growth of the money
stock should be reduced gradually until the rate is consistent with
price stability. This principle is consistent with the general approach
enunciated in recent years by the independent Federal Reserve.
Controlling the growth of the money stock may be viewed as a
means of achieving a desirable path of nominal GNP. Because the
growth of nominal GNP tends to follow the growth of the money
stock, this strategy of monetary policy can be expected to be consistent with a gradual decline in the trend rate of growth of nominal
GNP, although the mix of real growth and inflation is subject to
other influences. In the remaining years of this decade, this decline
in the rate of growth of nominal GNP should be compatible with
both a continuing growth of real GNP and a continuing decline in
the rate of inflation.
Last year's Economic Report discussed the difficulty of applying the
principle of steady monetary deceleration in a time of rapid institutional change. An appropriate monetary policy must balance the principle of steady monetary deceleration with the need to take account
of changes in asset preferences or institutional arrangements that
cause sustained shifts in the velocity of money, i.e., sustained shifts in
the ratio of nominal GNP to the money stock. There are, however,
many uncertainties about the timing, magnitude, and direction of the
effects of such financial changes on velocity.
The year 1983 was a time of significant change in financial regulations that substantially altered the nature of the monetary aggregates
(Ml, M2, and M3) and the pattern of portfolio demand for monetary
assets. In December 1982 depository institutions were permitted to
offer money market deposit accounts, a form of small-denomination
time deposit with no limit on the permitted interest rate. These deposits are classified as a part of M2. Beginning in January 1983,
Super-NOW accounts—checkable deposits with no ceiling on the interest rate—were permitted. These accounts are classified as part of
Ml.
The desirability of stable money growth rests on the stability of the
demand for money relative to the stability of other relationships in
the economy, and on the role of stable money growth in reducing
inflationary expectations. A change in the available mix of financial
assets or in the characteristics of the monetary aggregates may




24

change the equilibrium ratios of nominal GNP to the monetary aggregates. The Federal Reserve can in principle adjust the supply of
money to compensate for the shift in demand without altering the
degree of liquidity in the economy or, equivalently, the likely growth
of nominal GNP; however, because of the uncertainties mentioned
above in practice it is often difficult to do so. As an example of these
uncertainties, it is not clear at this time the extent to which the
increases in the monetary aggregates in the early part of 1983 reflected
demand shifts that will produce a sustained shift in the velocity of
money.
In 1983 especially, there was no way to know by exactly how much
the financial deregulation changed the demand for each of the monetary aggregates. The Federal Reserve appears to have followed a relatively passive strategy during the early months of the year, not putting pressure on bank reserves. This policy had the effect of not putting much pressure on interest rates. Between December 1982 and
May 1983, the monthly average of the 91-day Treasury bill rate
varied between 7.9 percent and 8.4 percent. After May, however, the
Federal Reserve permitted short-term interest rates to increase.
The Federal Reserve's approach to the very difficult task of adjusting the monetary policy to the new regulatory environment permitted
major adjustments to occur in 1983 with minimal disruption in the
financial markets. Some observers, however, are concerned that the
rapid expansion of the monetary aggregates in early 1983 may lead
to much higher inflation by the end of 1984. Some also fear that the
slow growth of Ml in the second half of 1983 may cause output
growth to decline sharply, or even turn negative, by the middle of
1984. All that can be said with certainty at this time is that monetary
policy has come through a very difficult year of substantial deregulation without destabilizing either real growth or inflation in 1983. It
may be noted also that on the basis of data currently available, all
three monetary aggregates ended the year 1983 inside the target
ranges that the Federal Reserve had established in February for M2
and M3 and in July for Ml.
All too often at this stage of an economic recovery, as growth
slows from the unsustainable pace of the recovery's first year, political pressures have built to try to reduce interest rates through raising
money growth. The Administration rejects calls to abandon a sound
monetary policy. Interest rates cannot prudently be lowered by creating more money. The Administration recognizes that if the Federal
Reserve were to try to maintain a strong recovery through excessive
expansion of money and credit the rate of inflation would inevitably
rise and undercut the prospect for sustained growth of employment
and output.




25

The Administration desires a steady growth of real GNP and a
gradually declining inflation rate. The monetary policy consistent
with this outcome is expected to be one of gradually declining rates
of growth of the monetary aggregates. Although no regulatory
changes comparable to those of 1982 and 1983 are expected, future
shifts in institutional arrangements could cause changes in velocity
that would require a recalibration of the money growth targets. It is
important that any such recalibration be made only in response to a
significant and persistent shift in velocity.
GOVERNMENT SPENDING
The second major aspect of the Administration's economic strategy
is to reduce the burden of government domestic spending. For the
first time in a half century, total appropriations for domestic programs began a sustained decline in real terms and total Federal
spending on all nondefense programs began to take a declining share
of the Nation's potential output.
In 1929, Federal Government spending was only 3 percent of
GNP. But the Great Depression ushered in a new era for American
Government. In the half century after 1930, government spending
exploded. By 1960 nondefense spending (excluding interest payments) by the Federal Government was 7.5 percent of GNP. Even
after adjusting for inflation, the Federal Government spent nearly
four times as much on nondefense programs in 1980 as it had spent
in 1960. Between 1930 and 1980 there was a dramatic increase in the
role of the government and of government outlays in American economic life.
Of course, not all government outlays represent government purchases of goods or services. By 1980, 56 percent of Federal Government expenditures were transfers to individuals or to State and local
governments. But transfers as well as direct purchases shift the use of
the economy's resources and require a sacrifice by present or future
taxpayers.
The speed at which many of the outlays grew was itself unintended
and unanticipated, reflecting the so-called "entitlement" character of
many of the programs introduced or modified in the 1960s or early
1970s. In such programs, the basic legislation does not appropriate a
fixed amount of money for a particular purpose, but establishes rules
that define who is eligible for benefits and the nature and amount of
the benefits for which each person is eligible. Funds must then be
made available for these benefits.
The medicare program is a good example of the unintended and
unanticipated growth in outlays. Medicare was introduced in 1966




26

and immediately experienced costs that were far greater than had
been generally anticipated. A decade ago, medicare outlays were less
than $10 billion; in the current fiscal year, they will exceed $50 billion. Medicare actuaries now project that by 1989 the cost of the program will exceed $100 billion, or more than 2 percent of GNP. The
dramatic growth of this program reflects greater utilization of health
care services than had been anticipated and a very much faster rise in
the cost of hospital care than had been forecast. For example, the
cost of a day of hospital care, relative to all consumer prices, rose 67
percent in the decade before medicare was introduced, but jumped
more than 100 percent in the decade after medicare began. This very
rapid rise in the real cost of a day of hospital care reflected primarily
the use of more personnel, equipment, and supplies for every patient. The increase in utilization and the rapid rise in cc :s were not
accidents of history but were in large part a direct response to the
medicare program itself.
The medicare example is paralleled in a wide variety of other programs in such disparate areas as housing, nutrition, and disability insurance. Other new programs were enacted and old programs expanded without a proper understanding of the future burdens that
they would impose on the economy. The members of the Congress
who enacted these programs and the analysts who advised them frequently underestimated substantially the future costs of the programs
that they were creating. They failed to anticipate that introducing
new programs or liberalizing old program rules would markedly
change economic behavior—that a higher level of retirement benefits
would significantly reduce the average age of retirement, that the introduction of medicare and medicaid would contribute to an explosive growth of hospital costs, and that the more generous provision
of disability benefits would be followed by a four-fold increase in the
number of persons collecting disability checks.
In addition to underestimating future program costs, many analysts
in the 1960s and early 1970s also overestimated the future growth of
economic resources with which to pay for them. The first half of the
1960s was a period of unusually rapid economic growth, with real
GNP rising at a 4.7 percent annual rate. In the mid-1960s, when the
Great Society programs were launched, and even in the late sixties
and early seventies, there was a comforting but mistaken assumption
that continued rapid growth would make it easy to finance an everincreasing level of government spending. Unfortunately, the real rate
of growth fell from the 4.7 percent experienced in the first half of
the 1960s to 2.8 percent in the years since then. If that earlier rate of
growth had continued, real GNP would now be nearly 40 percent




27

higher and, with current tax and expenditure rules, the Federal
budget would now be in substantial surplus.
If the public had foreseen the future costs of the expanded social
programs or the modest rate of economic growth during the past two
decades, the Congress might not have enacted all of those programs
and government would be smaller today. But once those programs
were started, it became extremely difficult to stop them or even to
reduce the level of benefits,
THE DECLINE OF DOMESTIC SPENDING

Between 1960 and the end of the 1970s, government outlays on
nondefense programs nearly doubled as a share of GNP. The government took a larger and larger share of the typical family's income and
used it to finance programs that came to be widely regarded as neither
generally useful nor directed at the truly needy. Many observers
concluded that many well-intentioned programs were actually often
exacerbating the very problems that they set out to solve and usually
creating adverse side effects of their own.
Since 1980 there has been a remarkable revolution in government
spending. Social security benefits now take a decreasing share of
GNP and all nondefense spending other than social security and
medicare has already declined significantly as a share of GNP. Table
1-1 presents Federal Government outlays and receipts as percentages
of GNP in fiscal years 1960, 1970, and 1980 through 1989. The
values for 1984 through 1989 reflect current services levels for all domestic programs, the Administration's 1984 budget proposal for defense, and the economic assumptions with respect to real growth and
interest rates used in the Administration's current budget calculations. (These economic assumptions are discussed in detail in Chapter 6.)
Spending on social security benefits (including disability benefits as
well as benefits for retirees and dependents) rose dramatically from
2.3 percent of GNP in 1960 to 5.3 percent in 1983. Although social
security benefits will continue to grow in the future because of the
increased number of retirees and rising benefit levels, the social security share of GNP has begun to decline and will shrink to 4.7 percent
of GNP over the next 5 years.
The reduced share of GNP spent on all nondefense programs
except social security and medicare (line 5 of Table 1-1) has been
even more dramatic. In 1980 government spending on these activities took 9.3 percent of GNP. In the 1984 fiscal year, that share is
down to 7.5 percent of GNP, a decline of one-fifth.
Between fiscal years 1980 and 1984 real government spending on
all nondefense activities except social security and medicare will have

fallen by 12.5 percent. This real 4-year decline, which includes outlays for everything from entitlement programs to the administrative
costs of running government departments, is absolutely unprecedented. During each of the five 4-year periods between 1960 and 1980,
this spending rose between 11 percent and 38 percent even after adjusting for inflation
The changes that have been enacted since 1980 mean that the
share of GNP spent on all nondefense activities except social security
and medicare will continue to decline in the future even if the Congress adopts no further spending cuts. By fiscal 1986 this domestic
spending share will be down to 6.7 percent of GNP and therefore
back to the same GNP share that such nondefense spending took in
the late 1960s. This decline as a percent of GNP means that total
spending on these nondefense government activities will average $84
billion less a year in the 3 fiscal years from 1984 through 1986 than
it would have if the 9.3 percent GNP share of 1980 had continued.
Although future spending could of course be increased by legislative
action, it is significant that the Congressional Budget Resolution for
1984 through 1986 also called for essentially this same declining
share of GNP.
Moreover, under current law this spending share will continue to
decline to only 6.2 percent of GNP by 1988, back to the level of the
early 1960s. And this lower level of outlays means savings that aver-




29

age $157 billion a year from 1987 through 1989 relative to what would
have been spent if the 1980 share of GNP had been maintained.
Chart 1-1 shows the share of potential GNP that nondefense
spending excluding social security and medicare would represent at
full employment. The growth in the 1960s and 1970s of these outlays
will have been almost completely reversed by 1989.

These projected spending reductions relative to the 1980 GNP
share reflect the current rules of entitlement programs and the assumption that the Congress will continue to appropriate funds to
maintain the current level of service for all programs governed by
annual appropriations. The President's 1985 budget proposes additional reductions in nondefense spending in each year from 1985
through 1989. These spending reductions total an additional $74 billion.




30

Total nondefense government spending as a share of GNP, including social security and medicare as well as all other domestic programs, is now falling and will, on the basis of current law and the
current services levels of annually appropriated programs, decline
from 15.1 percent of GNP in 1980 to 12.6 percent of GNP in 1989.
This decline represents an annual saving of more than $138 billion a
year in 1989.
One implication of the very substantial reduction in nondefense
spending is that it permits an increase in defense spending without
an equal increase in tax revenue. The Administration's budget calls
for a rise in defense spending from 5.2 percent of GNP in 1980 to
7.6 percent of GNP in 1989. For comparison, defense spending was
8.4 percent of GNP in 1970 and 9.7 percent of GNP in 1960.
Unfortunately, the rapid rise in interest on the national debt will
absorb a substantial share of the budget savings achieved by reduced
domestic spending. The net interest paid by the government will increase from 2.0 percent of GNP in 1980 to 2.6 percent in 1989, even
if the rate of interest on Treasury bills declines from the current level
of nearly 9 percent to less than 6 percent by the end of 1989.
Putting these pieces together shows that nondefense spending excluding social security and medicare will decline by 3.5 percent of
GNP between 1980 and 1989 while defense spending will rise by 2.6
percent of GNP and the net interest paid by the government will rise
by 0.6 percent of GNP. The reduction in domestic outlays financed
by general revenues is thus slightly more than sufficient to balance
the increase in defense spending and interest costs, leaving total outlays excluding social security and medicare virtually unchanged as a
share of GNP.
Despite the dramatic progress in reducing spending on domestic
programs, government outlays are still projected to equal 23 percent
of GNP in 1989, about 3 percentage points higher than in 1970 and
5 percentage points higher than in 1960. This increase in outlays
does not reflect greater defense spending, because the GNP shares
devoted to defense would actually be lower in 1989 than in either
1970 or 1960. The rapid growth of social security and medicare outlays (from 2.3 percent of GNP in 1960 to 3.8 percent of GNP in 1970
and 6.7 percent of GNP in 1989) accounts for nearly all of the increases in outlays as a fraction of GNP since 1960 and 1970. The additional source of increased outlays, the rise in interest payments on
the national debt, will be more than offset by the fall in defense
spending as a share of GNP between 1960 and 1989.
These are the fundamental facts that define the budget dilemma.
Despite the remarkable reduction in domestic spending on a wide
range of activities, the growth of the social security and medicare




31

programs raises the share of Federal Government outlays in national
income. With the budget balanced in 1960 and with taxes taking the
same share of GNP in 1984 as in 1960, the growth of spending since
then implies large budget deficits. Before discussing the problem of
the budget deficit, this chapter considers the changes in the nature of
the tax system that have occurred in the past 3 years.
THE CHANGE IN TAX STRUCTURE
The third principal part of the Administration's economic strategy
is to reduce the tax burden and restructure the tax system. The Economic Recovery Tax Act passed in 1981 substantially changed the
quantity and quality of taxation. It reduced personal income tax rates
by a cumulative 23 percent over 3 years. Special provisions reduced
the tax on two-earner families, introduced the indexing of tax bracket
and personal exemptions, and lowered the effective tax rates on
income from saving and investment. The total Federal taxes paid by
a median-income family, including both the personal income tax and
the social security payroll taxes, will be $1,750 lower in 1984 than
they would have been without the tax cuts. These changes represent
a reduction of 36 percent in Federal income tax liabilities and of 26
percent in total tax liabilities.
The total share of GNP taken by taxes has come down significantly
(see Table 1-1, line 9). In fiscal 1980, all Federal taxes took 20.1
percent of GNP. In the current fiscal year, this tax share will be 18.7
percent of GNP. Continuing economic recovery and the rise in social
security payroll taxes will raise the tax share of GNP to 19.4 percent
by 1989, if there are no further legislative changes. Without the 1981
changes, the tax share would have risen substantially from the 20.1
percent share of 1980.
These tax reductions occurred despite the rise in the social security
payroll tax. If the social security payroll tax is excluded, the reduction in all other taxes has been even greater, falling from 14.8 percent of GNP to 12.9 percent of GNP. This fall is equivalent to a $68
billion tax cut in 1984 alone.
The tax changes in the past 3 years have, however, gone far
beyond reducing the amount of taxes and have achieved fundamental
improvements in the nature of the tax system. The tax burden on the
economy depends not only on the quantity of taxes but also on the
quality. Although most taxes have adverse economic effects, some
taxes are more harmful than others. Taxes are undesirable not only
because they take away the fruits of labor, of risk-taking, and of
saving, but also because they distort economic decisions and thereby
lead to a wasteful misallocation of resources. Although there is no




32

simple rule for improving the quality of taxes, there are a few useful
principles. The most basic principle is to minimize the tax-induced
distortions of economic choices—choices about which goods to buy,
how much to work, how hard to save, and how to invest the capital
that results from savings. A key implication of this principle is that
the marginal tax rates paid on additional income or profits are more
important than the average tax rates. A second implication is that
taxes do more harm when levied on individuals or activities that are
more responsive to tax rules. Taxes that reduce the incentive to save
or that cause a misallocation of capital among different uses are particularly undesirable, because they unnecessarily increase the total
economic burden of the tax system and reduce productivity and economic growth.
The 1981 tax changes improved the quality of the tax system in
several ways. The top marginal individual income tax rate was reduced from 70 percent to 50 percent and marginal tax rates at all
income levels were reduced nearly one-fourth. Moreover, the reduced tax rates for two-earner families focuses tax relief on married
women, a group whose labor supply is known to be particularly sensitive to tax rates.
In addition to reducing marginal tax rates, the Economic Recovery
Tax Act provided for the indexing of tax brackets, beginning January
1985, to prevent inflation from pushing individuals into brackets with
higher marginal tax rates. Without indexing, a decade of 5 percent
inflation would more than offset the 23 percent reduction in tax
rates.
Perhaps the most fundamental change has been in the taxation of
personal saving. The American tax system has long been biased
against saving and in favor of current consumption. The tax law
changes in the Economic Recovery Tax Act represent a major shift
away from this antisaving bias. The universal extension of eligibility
for Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), the expansion of IRA and
Keogh plan limits, the reduced tax rates on investment income,
and other specific changes should spur private saving in the years
ahead.
The favorable effect of these tax changes on saving can be expected to occur only gradually. At first, by transferring previously saved
funds from existing accounts, many individuals can deposit the maximum $2,000 a year to an IRA without doing any additional saving.
Some individuals may extend this period by borrowing. But, after a
few years, most taxpayers will have exhausted all previously accumulated funds; they can then make additional IRA contributions only if
they save more.




The new tax treatment of saving represents something far more
basic than just an increased stimulus to saving. The universal availability of IRAs and the increase in IRA and Keogh limits will allow
most American taxpayers to pay tax only on that part of their income
that they do not save—that is, only on the part of their income that
they consume. It is also true that two-thirds of taxpayers do not itemize deductions and therefore cannot deduct interest expenses. Thus,
for most Americans, the income tax system has now been virtually
transformed into a consumption tax. This is a very fundamental
change in the character of our tax system.
An indirect but important source of reduction in the effective tax
rate on the income from savings has been the fall in the rate of inflation. Because our tax law bases tax liability on nominal interest
income and nominal capital gains, a lower rate of inflation implies a
substantial reduction in the effective rate of tax. An individual in the
30 percent tax bracket who earns a 15 percent nominal interest rate
when the inflation rate was 10 percent had an after-tax nominal yield
of 10.5 percent and an after-tax real yield of only 0.5 percent. By contrast, if the individual earns a nominal 10 percent interest rate when
the inflation rate is 5 percent, the nominal after-tax yield is 7 percent
and the real after-tax yield is 2 percent. The effective tax rate on the
same real interest income falls from 90 percent when inflation is 10
percent to 60 percent when inflation is 5 percent. With no inflation
and an interest rate of 5 percent, the effective tax rate would fall to
30 percent and the real after-tax rate of return would be 3.5 percent,
or 7 times as great as it was with a 10 percent inflation rate.
The tax climate for business investment has also been substantially
improved in the past 3 years. During the 1970s the rising rate of inflation combined with the old depreciation rules to raise very substantially the effective rate of tax on the income from investment in
business plant and equipment. The 1981 changes in the tax rules
governing depreciation, as modified in the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, and the sharp decline in inflation reduced this effective tax rate substantially. The result is higher after-tax rates of
return on business investment, and therefore a renewed incentive to
invest in plant and equipment.
The present strength of business investment in the face of very
high real rates of interest can be attributed at least in part to the
lower effective tax rates on business income and the higher real
after-tax rates of return that result. What matters for investment is
not just the rate of interest or the profitability of investment, but the
difference between the net-of-tax real cost of funds and the after-tax
real profitability of investment.




34

Similarly, the strength of the stock market in the face of very high
real interest rates reflects in part the improved after-tax profitability
that investors now expect. Indeed, one way to explain the current
level of investment is to note that the change in business tax rules
has raised the value in equity markets of new physical capital (or,
equivalently, reduced the cost of equity capital to finance new investment). This has stimulated business to increase its investment.
The recent reductions in high marginal tax rates and the improved
tax treatment of saving and investment represent major improvements over earlier tax rules. Much more can and should be done,
however, to reduce the adverse effects of the tax system on individual
and business incentives and therefore on the potential income and
growth of the economy. The President has emphasized his interest in
further improvements of the tax law. The Administration will continue to examine possible directions for tax reform and will propose reforms aimed at making the tax system simpler, fairer, and more efficient.
REDUCING THE BUDGET DEFICIT
Despite the dramatic reduction in the share of national income
taken by government domestic spending and the fundamental improvement in the character of our tax system, the Nation still faces
the serious potential problem of a long string of huge budget deficits. Vigorous economic growth can eliminate the cyclical component
of the deficit. But without legislative action, the structural component
is likely to grow just as fast as the cyclical one shrinks. The Administration's economic projections imply that the budget deficit will
remain roughly $200 billion a year—or about 5 percent of GNP—for
the rest of the decade unless there is legislative action to reduce
spending or raise revenue. Deficits of that size would represent a serious potential threat to the health of the American economy in the
second half of this decade and in the more distant future.
DEFICIT PROJECTION

The cyclical component of the budget deficit is the part of the deficit that occurs because the unemployment rate exceeds the inflation
threshold level of unemployment, i.e., the minimum level of unemployment that can be sustained without raising the rate of inflation.
This excess unemployment raises the deficit by depressing tax revenues and by increasing outlays on unemployment benefits and other
cyclically sensitive programs.
The remaining part of the budget deficit, known as the structural
component, is the amount of the deficit that would remain even if




35

the unemployment rate were at the inflation threshold level. The Administration estimates that the inflation threshold level of unemployment is now 6.5 percent and will decline in the coming years as the
relative number of inexperienced workers declines and as the Administration's employment policies are enacted and take effect.
Table 1-2 presents the cyclical and structural components of the
budget deficit for 1980 through 1989. The 1983 deficit of $195 billion was divided about evenly between the cyclical and structural
components. Because of the lower level of unemployment projected
for 1984, a much larger share of the current year's deficit is structural. The projected deficit of $187 billion includes a cyclical component of $49 billion and a structural component of $138 billion. By
1989, the entire projected budget deficit is structural.

A rate of economic growth for the next 5 years that is sufficiently
greater than the growth forecast by the Administration and by virtually all private forecasters could in principle eliminate the deficit
without legislative action. However, a 1 percent increase in the current level of real GNP would reduce the budget deficit by only about
$12 billion. It would require an increase of 40 percent in the projected growth rates over the next 6 years to eliminate the budget deficit
by the end of the decade without a change in spending or tax rules.
It would clearly be unwise to rely on such an unprecedented and improbably fast rate of growth. A prudent policy at this point must
assume that economic growth alone will not eliminate these deficits.
The economic assumptions that are used to project the budget
outlays and receipts are based on the premise that there will be a




36

sound monetary policy and that future legislative changes will reduce
budget deficits sharply in the years ahead. In the absence of legislative changes to reduce deficits substantially in future years, interest
rates will be higher than projected and the real growth rate will probably be lower than projected. The budget calculations assume that
real GNP grows at an average annual rate of 4.3 percent from 1983
to 1989. The calculations also assume that the Treasury bill rate will
fall from the current 8.9 percent to 5.0 percent by 1989. These assumptions are reasonable if the budget deficit in that year is about
1.5 percent of GNP and is moving toward complete balance. But if
legislative changes to reduce outlays and increase receipts are not enacted and the Treasury bill rate remains at its current level, the
higher interest payments on the national debt will raise the 1989
deficit by about $60 billion, bringing the total deficit in that year to
approximately $250 billion. Growth rates of real income slower than
those assumed in the budget calculations would raise the deficit even
more.
LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES

The projected budget deficits would directly and substantially increase the future size of the national debt. If legislative action is not
taken, the cumulative budget deficit would be more than $1,100 billion over the next 6 years. The annual interest on this extra debt
alone would represent a permanent cost of about $60 billion in 1989,
if interest rates fall as assumed, or at least $100 billion a year if the
interest rates remain at their present level. These amounts are equivalent to between 10 percent and 17 percent of the personal and corporate income tax revenue now projected for 1989.
This growth of the national debt and the interest on the national
debt shows that budget deficits do not eliminate the need for spending cuts or tax increases, but just postpone the time when extra
spending cuts or larger tax increases must take effect to pay for current deficits.
The most important long-term economic effect of the prospective
budget deficits would be to absorb a large fraction of domestic
saving, and thereby reduce the rate of capital formation and slow the
potential long-term growth of the economy. Federal borrowing to finance a budget deficit of 5 percent of GNP would absorb about twothirds of all the net domestic saving that would otherwise be available to finance investment in plant and equipment and in housing.
The reduced availability of investable funds means that the real
rate of interest must rise until the demand for funds for private investment is reduced to the available supply. Stated more generally,
the real net-of-tax cost of capital must increase relative to the real




37

net-of-tax return on capital until the demand for funds is reduced to
the available supply.
Although the 1981 tax changes and the reduced rate of inflation
will direct a higher share of the remaining capital formation to business investment and away from owner-occupied housing, the effect of
the budget deficits nevertheless would be a lower rate of investment
in business plant and equipment as well as in housing.
Each dollar of additional budget deficit does not necessarily reduce
capital accumulation by a dollar. The actual impact varies over time,
with less crowding out of capital formation likely in the first year or
two after an increase in the budget deficit than in subsequent years.
This is particularly so when, as in recent years, the increase in the
budget deficit occurs when there is substantial excess capacity in the
economy.
The current situation also shows how the extent of the crowding
out of capital formation in the United States can be temporarily reduced by an inflow of foreign funds that are attracted to the United
States by the rise in our real interest rate and increased real after-tax
return on equity investments. This capital inflow usually begins after
a lag, rises to a peak, and eventually shrinks. Even if the budget deficit remains at a high level, the inflow of capital from abroad eventually contracts as foreigners become increasingly unwilling to hold
even more U.S. assets in their portfolios.
If the current services budget deficits that are currently projected
were actually to occur, the likely result would be to reduce net investment in plant and equipment to a substantially lower share of GNP
than prevailed in the 1960s and 1970s. Net private investment has
fallen from 6.7 percent of GNP in the three-decade period through
1979 to only 3.2 percent of GNP in the past 3 years. Much of this
decline is attributable to the stage of the business cycle. The 1983
deficit strengthened the recovery and thereby boosted business fixed
investment, although the government's competition for funds to finance the structural deficit also depressed the level of investment
below what it would otherwise have been.
DEFICITS AND THE RECOVERY

The deficits will have effects on the economic recovery as well as
on the capital stock and on long-term economic growth. To understand the effect of budget deficits on the economic recovery, it is important to distinguish the deficits in the early years of the recovery
from the deficits that are projected for subsequent years. Although
the projected future deficit would be likely to have serious adverse
consequences on the character and possibly the duration of the recovery, the near-term deficits probably have a positive impact on the




38

pace of recovery in 1983 and 1984. The tax cuts in 1982 and 1983
raised after-tax incomes and therefore contributed to the rise in consumer spending that has been responsible for so much of the recovery. Similarly, the direct fiscal stimulus of the large 1984 deficit will
do more to raise demand in 1984 than the increased real interest
rates that result from the 1984 deficit will do to depress demand.
It is the continuing string of large deficits projected out through
the end of the decade and beyond that is the serious threat to the
health of the near-term recovery. The prospect of such prolonged
deficits inevitably raises the real long-term interest rate above what it
otherwise would have been, reducing current activity in key interestsensitive sectors and causing the recovery to be lopsided. The most
conspicuous example of such current crowding out is the sharp decline in net exports. High interest rates in the United States attract
funds from the rest of the world, causing the exchange value of the
dollar to rise. The strong dollar makes it difficult for U.S. products
to compete in world markets and makes foreign products more attractive to American buyers. In addition, the high real interest rate is
no doubt also causing the demand for housing, for some consumer
durables, and for some plant and equipment investment to be lower
now than it would otherwise have been. In these ways, the anticipation of future deficits may weaken the pace of recovery now even
though the current deficit strengthens the pace of the current recovery.
If the deficits persist, the crowding out would also persist but the
pattern of crowding out would change over time. As the value of the
dollar declines, the merchandise trade deficit is likely to shrink, focusing more of the crowding out on the domestic capital market. The
current rise in profits and retained earnings that result from the cyclical upturn and from the 1981 tax changes temporarily protects
business investment and concentrates more of the domestic crowding
out on residential construction. This too will change with time, placing more of the burden of future crowding out on business investment in plant and equipment.
No one can be sure of exactly how the pattern of crowding out
would evolve through time. It is clear however that the persistence of
large structural budget deficits would contribute to producing a lopsided recovery. The recovery would not be shared fully by the export
industries and by those firms that compete with imports from abroad.
Nor would the construction industry and those industries that are directly involved in the production of capital goods and consumer durables be likely to keep pace with overall economic activity.
As a result, employment and economic activity would shift from
these contracting interest-sensitive sectors to the areas of expanding




39

demand in the services and nondurable goods industries and in the
defense-related industries. If this shift of demand proceeds smoothly
enough, the overall recovery would continue at a satisfactory pace
with declining total unemployment. It is quite possible, however, that
the additional demand would concentrate in sectors that are operating close to capacity while the crowding out withdraws demand from
industries where a great deal of excess capacity exists. If so, much of
the additional demand might be absorbed in price increases while the
crowding out adds to unemployment. If this occurs, the resulting recovery would be slower paced, more fragile, and more inflationary
than a more balanced recovery.
No one can predict in detail the effects of a continuing series of
such large deficits. The economy could continue to experience a satisfactory overall pace of recovery for several years with declining
rates of unemployment and inflation. But deficits of this magnitude
could lead instead to imbalances within the economy that cause the
recovery to lose momentum. There is also the risk that the persistent
deficits could lead to inappropriate economic policies in the future.
An overly expansionary monetary policy would cause increased inflation while a sudden large fiscal contraction could depress economic
activity. Although no one can be sure just how the economy would
behave in the face of such unprecedented deficits, the longer the
deficits are allowed to persist, the greater are the risks to our economic future.
BUDGET STRATEGY

A major reduction in the structural budget deficit must therefore
be achieved over the next several years. This must be done without
causing a contraction of economic activity. Because the direct effect
of reducing the budget deficit is to reduce government spending and
private consumption, there must be an increase in investment and
net exports if real incomes and economic activity are to remain at
high levels.
A reduction in the level of the current or future budget deficits
automatically stimulates investment and net exports by lowering the
real rate of interest and the exchange value of the dollar. However,
experience shows that the rise in investment and in exports follows
the fall in interest rates and the exchange rate only with a substantial
lag.
It would be unwise, therefore, to reduce the 1984 deficit by a very
substantial amount. To reduce the deficit by a significant amount
without jeopardizing the recovery, the financial markets should be
given adequate advance notice of the intended deficit reduction. The




40

result would be a stronger economy that could absorb the deficit reduction without a contraction of overall economic activity.
In the fiscal year 1984 budget that was presented to the Congress
in January 1983, the Administration proposed a deficit reduction program that would begin with small reductions in the deficits of 1984
and 1985 but then would reduce the 1986 deficit by 41 percent and
cut the 1988 deficit by 61 percent to only 1.6 percent of GNP. Unfortunately, the Congress failed to adopt those proposals.
The Administration is now taking a two-stage approach to dealing
with the prospective budget deficits. The President has called upon
the leaders of the Congress to establish a bipartisan group to work
with the Administration to develop a "down payment" package that
will reduce the deficit by about $100 billion over the next 3 fiscal
years. The aim of these negotiations is to achieve a deficit reduction
package in the next few months. This package would be comprised of
some of the less contentious spending cuts still pending before the
Congress, certain measures to close tax loopholes, and additional
outlay savings achieved through improvements in management procedures and elimination of unnecessary or inefficient activities.
Such legislation to reduce the deficit by about $100 billion during
the next 3 fiscal years would make a significant contribution to reducing deficits and the future national debt. It could also give increased confidence to the financial markets, business investors, and
consumers that the projected deficits can be controlled and eventually eliminated. The result should be a stronger economy in 1984 and
1985.
Enacting a "down payment'* package is just a first step in reducing
budget deficits. The President has indicated that he will propose legislation in early 1985 that will further reduce deficits and point the
way toward budget balance. If these proposals are enacted, the economy can enjoy continuing expansion and a reduced burden of national debt.

CHAPTER 2

The United States in the World
Economy: Challenges of Recovery
THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY is in a much stronger position today than it was one year ago. In late 1982 the world was still
in a severe recession, and prospects for recovery were uncertain; the
third world debt crisis was a source of deep concern; and economic
stagnation had given rise to strong protectionist pressures. In 1983 a
vigorous recovery, originating in the United States, began to lead the
world out of recession. Many of the high-debt countries made major
strides toward successful adjustment. Despite increasing protectionist
pressures, the open international trading system remained fundamentally intact.
But the outlook is not entirely sunny. The recovery is not a cure-all
for the serious strains that remain in the world economy." From the
U.S. point of view, the focus of these strains is the emergence of
record trade deficits. Closely related to the problem of the trade deficits is the problem of the continued high value of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. There are also other economic troubles
around the globe. Trade relations among the United States, Japan,
and the European Community remain a source of friction. Much of
Europe is lagging behind the recovery in North America. The highdebt countries are finding the road back to financial health to be
slow and painful.
This chapter takes the U.S. trade balance as a starting point for an
examination of the challenges that still face the world economy. It is
organized in three sections. The first section examines the rise in the
trade deficit and the related problem of the strong dollar. The
second section covers developments among industrialized trading
partners: Japan, Canada, and the European countries. The third section explores the third world debt problem.
THE U.S. TRADE DEFICIT AND THE DOLLAR
The most dramatic recent development in U.S. international economic relations is the rising trade deficit and associated capital
inflow. The 1983 deficit in merchandise trade was about $65 billion,




42

approaching twice the previous record, which was set in 1982. A deficit in the neighborhood of $110 billion is forecast for 1984, three
times the 1982 level. The deficits signify loss of income and employment in those U.S. industries that depend on exports or compete
with imports. A common reaction is one of concern. It is easy to
draw the impression that there is a serious adverse long-run trend in
the competitive standing of the United States in the world economy.
The greatest danger is that such ideas will come to be believed, and
that as a result, the Nation will opt for major departures from its traditional economic system.
Understanding the source of the rising trade deficit is an essential
precondition to making intelligent policy choices. If policy is charted
in an atmosphere of panic, then crucial mistakes will be made. Mistakes in trade policy, once committed, cannot be easily undone. Foreign trading partners often react to protectionist measures in kind,
while, domestically, powerful interest groups coalesce around the
new status quo.
SOURCES OF THE TRADE DEFICIT

Although the 1983 and likely 1984 trade deficits are without precedent, they are not difficult to explain. To begin with, the United
States has a normal or "structural" deficit in merchandise trade that
is offset by a surplus in exports of services and therefore need not be
a cause for special concern. But it is the recent increase in the trade
deficit that has attracted attention. The increase can be broken down
into three parts. First, the appreciation of the dollar has made it difficult for U.S. firms to compete in world markets. Second, there has
been a substantial loss in net exports to debt-troubled countries.
Third, the United States is experiencing more rapid growth in
income, and therefore, in imports, than are Europe and Japan. These
three factors concern economic perturbations that, though large, are
believed to be temporary. The structural deficit is normal in that it
would exist even in the absence of the temporary factors.
The Structural Trade Deficit

In the 1970s, the United States ran a merchandise trade deficit that
was on average equal to 0.5 percent of gross national product (GNP),
with a gradual increasing trend, as Chart 2-1 illustrates. This deficit
in merchandise does not imply a failure of the Nation to pay its way
in international trade. The United States normally runs a surplus in
services to offset the deficit in merchandise trade. The largest component of the surplus is the earnings on overseas investments that
American residents have made in the past; these earnings are counted as services because they are payments for the use of U.S. capital.
But such exports as the services of lawyers, engineers, and computer




43

programmers, and banks, insurance companies, hospitals, and universities are also an important and growing component of the U.S. balance of payments. The balance in services trade has a gradual
upward trend, as Chart 2-1 shows.

Indeed, it is possible that, because of measurement errors, the true
U.S. surplus in services is greater than that recorded. Statistics show
that the sum of the services balance of all countries is a large negative number, on the order of —$80 billion. Because one country's exports are another country's imports, this number should in theory be
zero. It must necessarily be that some countries are underreporting
their services balance. For example, fleets of open registry (i.e., flying
"flags of convenience") often do not report their earnings to any
country. Another example is investment income that is channeled
through tax havens and is thus unrecorded in the recipient country.
Given the importance of the United States in services trade, it is possible that part of the unreported service exports are American.




44

Adding together the balances in merchandise trade, services, and
transfers (such as immigrants' remittances to their countries of
origin) gives the balance on current account. A country's current account balance indicates its changing investment position vis-a-vis its
trading partners. A current account deficit means that foreigners are
on net accumulating claims on assets located in the domestic country.
Countries with profitable investment opportunities, such as South
Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and other rapidly industrializing countries, are normally in this situation, borrowing savings from abroad to
finance their development. A current account surplus means that the
domestic country is on net accumulating claims on assets located
abroad. Capital-rich countries with high saving rates, such as Japan
and West Germany, are normally in this situation, lending their savings to other countries where they can earn a higher rate of return.
There is no clear argument as to whether the United States should
normally be a net borrower or net lender at this stage in its history.
The United States has been a capital-rich country throughout the
20th century, and before the 1970s the current account was normally
in surplus. But the U.S. saving rate now appears to be the lowest
among major countries. As it happens, the U.S. current account balance, as shown in Chart 2-1, was on average virtually zero during the
1970s.
The point is that a certain amount of the U.S. merchandise trade
deficit is normal: it would be there, offsetting the surplus in services,
even if the U.S. current account balance were zero. Judging from the
long-run trends in the merchandise trade deficit and the services surplus, this structural trade deficit now appears to be in the range of
$20 to $25 billion. Most of the recent trade deficit is thus still to be
explained.
Effect of the Strong Dollar

The high value of the dollar in foreign exchange markets is the
most important cause of the recent increases in the trade deficit. As
Chart 2-2 shows, the dollar has appreciated sharply over the past 3
years. As of December 1983, the dollar had risen 52 percent against
an average of 10 trading partners' currencies weighted by their
shares in world trade, relative to the average for 1980. (Weighting
countries by trade with the United States alone, which gives relatively
less weight to Europe and relatively more to Canada and Japan,
yields a smaller number.) Exchange rate trends sometimes match international differences in inflation rates, but that has not been the
case in this episode. Very little of the appreciation of the dollar was
offset by a more rapid increase in the foreign price level than in the
U.S. price level. In other words the dollar appreciated not only in
nominal terms, but in real terms as well. The real appreciation of the




45

dollar between 1980 and December 1983 came to 45 percent. This
means that U.S. firms are now offering their products on world markets at prices that on average have risen significantly relative to those
of their competitors, when compared in a common currency.

The year 1980 does not constitute a proper standard of comparison because the dollar had depreciated in real terms in the late
1970s: in 1980 U.S. firms were offering their products on world markets at prices that on average had fallen relative to those of their
competitors, when compared in a common currency. If one takes the
average over the period 1973-79 as the standard of comparison, then
the real appreciation of the dollar as of December 1983 comes to 33
percent.
This real appreciation represents a large loss in competitiveness of
U.S. producers. In response, foreign residents are more likely to buy
their own country's products than to buy the more expensive U.S.
exports, and U.S. residents and companies are more likely to buy
cheaper imports than to spend their money on products made at
home.




46

The effect on the trade balance is complicated by questions of
timing. Although the dollar's rise began in 1980, it was not until
1981 that the negative effect on the trade balance began to show up.
It was not until late 1982 that the balance on goods and services
turned to deficit. This pattern is in line with historical experience.
The immediate effect of a dollar appreciation is actually to improve
the trade balance, because it takes fewer dollars to buy a given quantity of imports. As time passes, more and more customers, both domestic and foreign, switch to the less expensive foreign producers. The
real volume of imports rises and of exports falls, and the trade balance
worsens. The dollar had completed a real appreciation of 27 percent
by late 1982, relative to the 1973-79 standard of comparison. If the
usual pattern of recent years holds up, the full effect on the trade
deficit will be reached in late 1984. Estimates indicate that every 1
percent real appreciation adds about $2 billion to the deficit at the
peak. Thus the 27 percent real appreciation of the dollar translates
into about $54 billion of the projected deficit in 1984. The continued
appreciation of the dollar through 1983 portends further deterioration of the trade balance in 1985.
Effect of Debt Problems in Latin America

In the last couple of years, a number of highly indebted third
world countries have experienced great difficulty meeting their debt
obligations. They have had to take strong measures to reduce their
imports and to boost their exports, in order to generate the foreign
exchange to pay the interest on the debt. Many of these countries are
in Latin America and conduct an especially high proportion of trade
with the United States. Mexico alone accounted for 7.6 percent of
U.S. exports in 1981. Seven of the most indebted Latin American
countries together accounted for 13.9 percent of U.S. exports. The
reductions in net imports that these countries have been obliged to
undertake because of a shortage of foreign exchange are so great
that the U.S. share looms large in the U.S. trade balance. Exports of
U.S. industries such as farm and construction machinery have been
particularly hard-hit.
As Table 2-1 shows, the U.S. bilateral trade balance with Mexico
alone, which changed from surplus to deficit in 1982, registered a decline of $12 billion between 1981 and 1983. The U.S. loss in net exports to Latin America was about $21 billion. By comparison, the
projected U.S. loss in net exports to Japan from 1981 to 1983 was
only $4 billion, and to all of Western Europe about $12 billion, as
illustrated in Chart 2-3. (The only source of improvement, U.S.
trade with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), is registering smaller deficits than in the past as a consequence of a decline in the demand for OPEC oil and in the dollar




47

price of oil.) As many of the Latin American debtors still have further
economic adjustments to make, the loss in U.S. net exports to that
region is not expected to diminish much in 1984.

Effect of Relative Cyclical Position of the United States

A country's level of imports varies with its level of income during
the course of the business cycle. Thus world trade in general contracted in the 1980-82 period of recession.
As of late 1982, cyclical factors were a plus for the U.S. trade balance. In the first place, even when business cycles are synchronized
across countries, the U.S. trade balance historically tends to improve
in recessions and worsen in expansions. U.S. imports from other
countries are usually more responsive to U.S. income than other
countries* imports are to their incomes. In the second place, as of
1982, the recession had been more severe in the United States than
for most trading partners. Real GNP had been on average almost
constant in the United States from 1980 to 1982, but had grown at

an average annual rate of 1.4 percent in other industrialized countries. As of December 1982, U.S. industrial production was 12 percent below its previous peak, but industrial production in the other
six major industrialized countries had fallen only 4 percent over the
same period. Thus, the recent recession tended to reduce U.S. imports from the rest of the world more than it reduced the rest of the
world's imports from the United States.
The cyclical position of the United States relative to its trading
partners began to turn around rapidly in early 1983. In the third
quarter of 1983 the United States reattained its previous peak in the
level of economic activity as measured by industrial production; most
of the major industrial countries had not yet done so. For the year,
real GNP grew at an annualized rate 3.8 percent faster in the United
States than among a weighted average of trading partners. Thus
sometime in the middle of the year the two output paths crossed; the
relative cyclical position was a positive factor in the trade balance in
the first half of the year and a negative factor in the second half. The
overall effect in 1983 was probably close to neutral.
With U.S. growth from 1983 to 1984 expected to continue well
above that of its major trading partners, U.S. imports from other
countries will rise faster than other countries' imports from the
United States. The relative cyclical position becomes an increasingly
negative factor for future trade balances. Estimates suggest that the
relative cyclical position will account for $15 to $20 billion of the
projected worsening in the trade deficit between 1983 and 1984.

Each of the three sources of the increase in the trade deficit—the
exchange rate, the third world debt problem, and the relative cyclical
position of the industrialized countries—warrants further analysis. In
each case, the impact on U.S. trade may be the channel through
which the problem is most forcefully brought to the attention of the
American citizen; but each topic bears examination for its own sake.
The exchange rate and related topics are considered in the remainder of this section; the cyclical position of other industrialized countries and the third world debt problem are considered in the second
and third sections of the chapter.
SOURCES OF THE STRONG DOLLAR

In the 1950s and 1960s central banks were committed to maintaining their countries' exchange rates at fixed levels. This effort became
increasingly difficult over time, due particularly to divergent inflation
rates among countries. By 1971 the dollar had become unsustainably
overvalued in the sense that the supply of dollars greatly exceeded
the private demand for dollars. Central banks made up the difference, buying unwanted dollars in exchange for foreign currencies.
The effort was abandoned in 1973 and the major currencies moved
onto a system of floating, i.e., market-determined, exchange rates.
When exchange rates float, there is no such thing as undervaluation
or overvaluation, in the sense of excess market supply or demand for
currencies. The value of the currency is whatever the market dictates
that it should be.
The Floating Exchange Rate System

It is nearly impossible to imagine the world economy going
through the past 10 years in the straightjacket of fixed exchange
rates. Given the events of this period, notably the large changes in oil
prices and the divergent macroeconomic policies among the industrialized countries, floating exchange rates have performed well.
Nevertheless, some critics argue that the system is not working as
it should. They base their case on the large fluctuations that exchange rates have exhibited over the past 10 years—short-term variability as well as longer term swings such as the large rise of the
dollar from 1980 to 1983. The critics also point to the fact that many
exchange-rate fluctuations cannot readily be explained. Few believe
that an early return to fixed exchange rates is possible, but there is
sentiment in some quarters for government action to try to dampen
the fluctuations.
Transactions costs in financial markets and government-imposed
barriers to the flow of capital across national boundaries are today
very low among most of the larger industrialized countries. The high
international mobility of capital means that the foreign exchange




50

market is now dominated by capital transactions, not by trade transactions. The foreign exchange market is an asset market, like the
stock or bond market; the exchange rate is the price of one currency
in terms of another. It is not surprising that it is difficult to explain
all the month-to-month ups and downs of the exchange rate, just as
it is difficult to explain all the ups and downs in stock prices or bond
prices. But most observers agree that an increase in the demand for
dollar assets underlay the 1980-83 appreciation. An increase in the
demand for a currency results in an increase in its price, for the same
reason that an increase in the demand for any commodity results in
an increase in its price.
Three reasons are often given for the recent increase in demand
for dollar assets. They are (1) reduced expectations of U.S. inflation,
(2) increased U.S. real interest rates, and (3) "safe-haven" and other
possible portfolio shifts. We consider each in turn.
Effect of Reduced Expectations of Inflation

In the long run, the exchange rate tends to follow the differential
trend in the domestic and foreign price levels. If one country's price
level gets too far out of line with prices in other countries, there will
eventually be a fall in demand for its goods, which will lead to a real
depreciation of its currency.
Investors in international money markets are fully aware of the relationship between the price level and the exchange rate. If market
participants think that a currency will be losing value in the future
through inflation, then they will seek to avoid losses by immediately
shifting their holdings out of that currency and into other assets.
This attempt to sell the currency will cause its price to decline, even
before the anticipated inflation occurs. For example, in the late 1970s
the value of the dollar declined, in large part because of heightened
expectations of U.S. inflation.
There is no way to know exactly what the market expects the inflation rate to be in the future, as opposed to what the inflation rate
actually is. Table 2-2 shows three alternative measures of expected
inflation: the actual inflation rate over the preceding year; a weighted
average of actual inflation over the preceding 3 years (with more
weight on the most recent years); and forecasts of future inflation
made by Data Resources, Inc. Regardless which measure is used,
there was a large drop in the expected U.S. inflation rate between
1980 and 1983. The market reduced its expectations of U.S. inflation
in response to the firm anti-inflation policies of the Administration
and of the Federal Reserve, to the 1980 and 1981-82 recessions, and
to the actual decline in the observed inflation rate. As the table
shows, expected inflation also fell in other countries between 1980




51

and 1983, but not as much. The differential between U.S. and foreign expected inflation declined.
The fall in the expected inflation differential is the first of the
three reasons for the appreciation of the dollar. Investors who had
previously shifted out of dollar assets because of fears of inflation,
now shifted back. The increase in the demand for dollar assets
caused an increase in the price of dollar assets, i.e., the exchange
rate.

Effect of Increased Real Interest Rates

The effect of the decline in expected inflation is only part of the
story. If exchange rate movements were determined solely by inflation rates, the decline in expected inflation could explain the nominal
appreciation of the dollar, but not the real appreciation of the dollar.
The latter is the important concept for the question of the competitiveness of U.S. producers in world markets.
A second cause of the appreciation of the dollar between 1980 and
1983—and the major cause of its real appreciation—is the increase in
the U.S. real interest rate. The real interest rate is defined as the
nominal interest rate corrected for expected inflation. If nominal interest rates had come down as quickly as the expected inflation rate,
then there would have been no increase in the real interest rate. But
by the three measures in Table 2-2, the U.S. real interest rate rose
between 1980 and 1983. This is typical of historical experience with
monetary disinflation: it takes time for reduced expectations of infla-




52

tion to be reflected in reduced nominal interest rates. Real interest
rates rose somewhat in other countries too, but not by as much. The
real interest differential shifted in favor of dollar assets.
Because U.S. assets now pay a higher expected real rate of return
than foreign assets, they have become more attractive to hold. The
increase in demand for dollar assets arising from a higher real interest differential can explain an increase in the exchange value of the
dollar, above and beyond the increase that would be due to a lower expected

inflation differential in the absence of a change in the real interest differential. It explains why the dollar appreciated not only in nominal
terms but in real terms as well.
Large real appreciations of a currency tend to be temporary. In the
long run, the real value of the dollar is widely expected to fall back
to a level that allows U.S. firms to compete in world markets on an
equal basis. To believe otherwise would be to believe that U.S. producers can continue to be priced out of world markets, and the
United States can continue to run 12-digk trade deficits, indefinitely.
It is impossible to say when the dollar will come back down. The decline could start in 1984 or it could come later. To judge by past experience, even if there were no unforeseen developments, it could be
as long as 10 years before the dollar returns to its long-run value.
It is possible to get a rough idea of how much above its long-run
real value the dollar is currently, in the market's view, by looking at
the long-term real interest differential in favor of the dollar. The
long-term interest rate is the one reported in Table 2-2. The 10-year
real interest differential is the compensation that investors get for
holding assets in a currency that is expected to depreciate, in real
terms, over the next 10 years. Taking the present 10-year real interest differential to be 3.2 points, the implication is that the market expects the dollar to depreciate, in real terms, at an average rate of 3.2
percent a year over the next 10 years, or 32 percent altogether (ignoring compounding). This arithmetic example would suggest that
the market regards the dollar as currently being about 32 percent
above its long-run real value.
In 1980 the real interest differential was negative; the market regarded the dollar as being about 23 percent below its long-run real
value. Taking the increase in the real interest differential between
1980 and 1983 to be 5.4 points, the implication is that this factor by
itself is sufficient to explain an increase in the dollar's value over this
period of about 54 percent (without any change in its long-run real
value). One can get different answers by choosing different horizons
or different measures of the rise in the real interest rate. It is possible that none of the three alternative measures of expected inflation
in Table 2-2 adequately reflects true expectations over the 10-year




53

horizon that is relevant. Nevertheless, it is evident that the real interest differential is capable of explaining the sort of real appreciation
that the dollar has experienced.
Effect of "Safe-Haven"

and Other Possible Portfolio Shifts

The third reason that is commonly given for the current strength
of the dollar is the "safe-haven" effect: capital flees social and economic instability in other countries for the safety of the United
States. There is some danger here of using the term "safe-haven" as
a vague label for unexplained shifts in investors' portfolios. But one
concrete interpretation is that investors have shifted their portfolios
into dollar assets in response to the increased riskiness of investments in other parts of the world, Latin America in particular.
A decision by Latin Americans to move capital into the United
States generates partly offsetting capital outflows from the United
States to Europe and other countries. But in the eyes of some observers, investments in Europe have also become riskier, as a result
of economic and political developments. Thus, a worldwide portfolio
shift into U.S. assets in response to a change in relative risk may explain some part of the dollar appreciation. Other factors that are
sometimes mentioned are the more favorable tax treatment for capital investment in the United States and the strength of the U.S. recovery in 1983.
The Source of High Real Interest Rates

If high real interest rates are the most important explanation for
the high real value of the dollar, what is the explanation for the high
real interest rates? This question is a subject of some controversy.
The real interest rate equilibrates the supply of saving, both private and public, to the demand for saving, in the form of investment.
The real interest rate will rise either if the supply of saving shifts
down or if investment shifts up. The contribution of the corporate
income tax to the cost of capital facing firms has been reduced under
this Administration. It is hoped that the increased incentive to firms
will stimulate investment in the future. Unfortunately, as the second
column of Table 2-3 shows, investment as a percentage of GNP was
still lower in 1983 than in 1980, or than the average since 1970.
Thus an upward shift of investment cannot be the sole explanation
for the increase in real interest rates. A decrease in the supply of
saving also must have played a major role. Indeed, there has been a
decline in private saving, probably because of the recession, and a
large decline in government saving, i.e., a large increase in the Federal budget deficit.
Although the decline in private and public saving is the most
widely cited explanation for high real interest rates, other explana-

tions are sometimes given. One is that an increase in uncertainty,
usually ascribed to increased variability in the U.S. money supply,
makes nominal dollar assets less attractive, so that they must yield a
higher expected real return as a "risk premium" if they are to be
willingly held. This argument could account for why real interest
rates are high, but it cannot also be an explanation of the strength of
the dollar. Any increased uncertainty attaching to dollar assets would
cause a fall in demand for them and therefore in the price of the
dollar, not a rise. Only increased uncertainty in other countries could
induce the observed portfolio shift. Indeed that was one possible interpretation of the safe-haven argument discussed above.
THE CAPITAL ACCOUNT SURPLUS

The U.S. current account deficit in 1983 was nearly three times the
previous record, which was set in 1978. The immediate connotation
of the current account deficit, as of the trade deficit, is lost production in import-competing and export industries. But there is another
way to look at it. The current account deficit is financed by a capital
inflow from abroad. Foreigners have been investing in the United
States, for example participating in the rising stock market and
buying Treasury bills.
Relation to Crowding Out

This capital inflow has an important implication for the U.S. economy. Under the natural assumption that the capital inflow is not
somehow offset by an equal decrease in domestic saving, it keeps real
interest rates lower than they otherwise would be. As such, it allows
those components of GNP that are especially sensitive to the real interest rate—housing, consumer durables, and business investment in
plant and equipment—to be higher than they otherwise would be. Of
course, the capital inflow has not been large enough to prevent real




55

interest rates from rising since 1980, as reported in Table 2-2, or investment as a share of GNP from falling, as reported in Table 2-3.
Table 2-3 also shows how two other components of demand, consumption and government expenditure, have risen since 1980 as a
percentage of GNP. Indeed, it was the increases in these components
of spending that drove up real interest rates and crowded out investment, as explained in Chapter 1. The important point regarding
the inflow of capital into the United States from abroad is that it
dampened the rise in the real interest rate, and thus reduced the
degree of crowding out of investment. This bonus did not come free.
The counterpart to the capital inflow is the appreciation of the dollar
and the worsening of the trade deficit. In effect, much of the crowding out is now borne by the import-competing and export industries,
with the consequence that less of it is borne by the construction, consumer durable, and capital goods industries.
In 1984 the U.S. current account deficit is forecasted to be roughly
40 percent the size of the Federal Government budget deficit. This
means that a capital inflow from abroad is financing the equivalent of
40 percent of the budget deficit, and the crowding out of other sectors of domestic demand is reduced correspondingly. International
capital flows of this magnitude are consistent with the increasing integration of world capital markets.
Benefits of the Capital Inflow and Dollar Appreciation

Is the inflow of capital and the associated strength of the dollar desirable? In one sense it is not; the appreciation of the dollar imposes
great costs on import-competing and export industries in terms of
lost income and employment. But the strong dollar has substantial
benefits too. It keeps down the general price level, both directly
through lower dollar prices of imports, and indirectly through lower
prices for domestically produced goods that compete with goods produced abroad. The important question for policy is whether the costs
of artificially reducing the capital inflow are greater than the costs of
the existing trade deficit.
In the long run, expansion of potential GNP is limited by such factors as growth of the labor force and of the capital stock. Even in the
short run, monetary policy puts a limit on the expansion of actual
dollar GNP, because the Federal Reserve is currently committed to a
monetary policy that avoids a resurgence of inflation. It follows that
if the capital inflow were somehow shut off, the dollar allowed to depreciate, and export and import-competing industries stimulated to
increase production, the gains in those industries would probably be
offset by losses in other industries so as to leave total GNP unchanged. The mechanism whereby this would happen is an increase
in the real interest rate; the industries that would lose include con-




56

struction and other interest-sensitive industries, whose customers are
primarily firms undertaking investment.
There are two reasons why the investment sector should not have
its share of the national pie reduced in favor of the export and
import-competing sectors, as it would be if the capital inflow were
shut off. The first is that there is no reason to think that the profitability of investment has fallen. Investment determines how big the
national capital stock will be in the future, and thus how big output
can be. It is true that a capital inflow, which constitutes the sale of
assets to foreigners, represents a loss of future income in the form of
capital earnings paid overseas. This loss in income is as great as the
loss of returns to plant and equipment never built. Indeed if the
United States continues to run current account deficits at anything
like the rate forecasted for 1984, sometime in 1985 the Nation will
pass from being a net creditor to being a net debtor, for the first
time in 68 years. But from the viewpoint of maximizing domestic
output and employment, it is better to have machines working in the
United States, even if owned by foreigners, than not to have them at
all.
The second reason for sharing economic expansion proportionately among sectors, to whatever extent possible, has to do with inflation. Expansion is often associated with an increase in inflation.
Whether U.S. inflation is reignited depends, among many other
things, on the distribution of expansion across sectors. It seems possible that industries that sell their goods and services primarily to the
consumer and government sectors will begin to run into capacity
constraints before the rest of the economy. At that point, any further
increases in demand in those sectors are more likely to be reflected
in higher prices than in higher production. In the industries that sell
their products to firms undertaking investment, by contrast, there is
still tremendous room for expansion. Some industries, such as nonresidential construction, have only begun to share in the recovery.
The noninflationary payoff to expansion in these industries is large.
But if the country had never had the capital inflow, the interest rate
would be even higher, and production in the interest-sensitive industries would be lower without much gain in reduced inflation. The
export and import-competing industries would be benefiting from a
cheaper dollar. But they might now be starting to run into capacity
constraints more quickly, with an adverse effect on the overall inflation rate.
MEASURES TO REDUCE THE TRADE DEFICIT

Four kinds of policy measures have at times been proposed to improve the trade balance: protectionism to keep out imports, foreign




57

exchange intervention to reduce the value of the dollar, capital controls with the same aim, and a change in macroeconomic policy. Each
of these has costs. Of the four, protectionism is the most dangerous.
Protectionism

In a dynamic economy there are always some sectors expanding
and others contracting because of technical change, shifting consumer tastes, and so forth. This is particularly true of an economy exposed to the rigors of competition in world markets. Earlier in its
history, the U.S. economy, with its large domestic market, diversified
economic resources, and geographic remoteness from Europe, was
less dependent on international trade. But as domestic economies of
scale were exhausted, as tariffs were reduced worldwide, and as declining transportation costs made geography increasingly irrelevant,
international trade became increasingly important. The growth in exports allowed many U.S. sectors to expand rapidly that otherwise
might not have been able to do so. Major examples in recent decades
include agriculture, high-technology products, and services. But the
increase in U.S. imports, which sooner or later must accompany any
increase in exports, meant a loss in demand for other U.S. sectors.
Some sectors that had previously had the domestic market to themselves found that their foreign counterparts could produce quality
products at costs far below what they had become accustomed to receiving. Some major examples are the auto and steel industries.
The economic strains associated with long-term structural trends
have always generated political pressure on the government to protect the adversely affected industries. In recent years temporary
macroeconomic factors—the rise in unemployment during the last recession and the high value of the dollar—have exacerbated the economic difficulties of sectors vulnerable to import competition, and
have intensified accordingly the political pressure to protect them. In
addition, some exporters are finding that the strong dollar, and subsidies by some foreign governments, are making it more difficult to
compete in foreign markets. This group traditionally forms a constituency for free trade but is now in some cases generating political
pressures of its own for government action.
The Administration's stated policy is to resist these pressures. Protectionism usually succeeds in increasing the income of the sector
seeking protection. However, it imposes costs on other sectors that
more than outweigh the benefits for the protected sector. These
costs are of three kinds. First are the effects on the purchasing power
of consumers. A tariff or quota on imports cannot succeed in raising
the prices received by domestic producers without at the same time
raising the prices paid by domestic consumers. Second are the effects
on other industries that use the output of the sector in question as an




58

input into their own productive process. Protection for the steel industry raises costs for the auto industry, protection for sugar growers
raises costs for candy manufacturers, and so forth. Third are the effects on export industries. The dollars that foreign countries earn by
selling to the U.S. market are useless to them unless, sooner or later,
they spend them on U.S. exports. If the United States cuts off imports of foreign goods, foreigners will not have the dollars to buy
U.S. exports. Usually it is difficult to identify the specific U.S. export
industry that would benefit from increased trade. When the dollars
come back to the United States, it will not necessarily be in the form
of spending by the same foreigners that originally earned them, nor
in the same year. But in one recent example, the connection is clear:
China has indicated that if the United States cuts off imports of textiles from it, China will cease purchases of agricultural products from
the United States.
The American public retains a broadly based commitment to the
ideals of free trade. Nearly all political factions support free trade in
principle. But there is a common fallacy that the arguments for free
trade are theoretical arguments that lose applicability if other countries are not practicing free trade, that market distortions imposed by
trading partner governments automatically warrant retaliation by the
U.S. Government.
The desire to retaliate against a foreign government that is, for example, subsidizing exports, is understandable. Such retaliation has
two effects, one predictable and one unpredictable. The predictable
effect is to impose immediate costs, on domestic consumers and
other domestic producers, that exceed the immediate benefits for the
protected sector. It is irrelevant to this effect why foreign producers
were underselling domestic producers, whether it was because of
government subsidies, the level of the exchange rate, or lower labor
costs. Export subsidies by foreign governments are in essence
income transfers—i.e., foreign aid—to the importing country.
The unpredictable effect is the reaction of the foreign government.
If the foreign government were to respond by removing its subsidies
in exchange for the domestic country removing its measures, then
both sides would be better off. All too often, however, the foreign
government retaliates with more of the same. U.S. measures must be
well targeted and explicitly temporary if they are to have the desired
effect on foreign governments. There are no winners in a trade war.
The issue of the duration of protectionist measures is an important
one. Frequently, measures that are originally adopted as temporary,
such as quotas imposed to protect a domestic industry "just until it
can get back on its feet," turn out later to be very difficult to remove.




59

Often protection encourages the industry to delay making needed adjustments, rather than to speed them up.
Foreign Exchange

Intervention

A second measure that has been proposed to improve the trade
balance is intervention in the foreign exchange market by the monetary authorities to force down the value of the dollar and thus to restore price competitiveness to American industry. At the beginning
of August 1983, and later in the year, U.S. authorities did intervene
on a small scale, buying marks and yen in exchange for dollars, in
cooperation with monetary authorities in other countries. The intervention did not noticeably depress the value of the dollar, nor was it
intended to. It is U.S. policy to intervene only to calm disorderly
markets.
There are two kinds of foreign exchange intervention, known as
sterilized and unsterilized. Sterilized foreign exchange intervention
occurs when the central bank, at the same time that it is buying foreign currencies with domestic currency, sells Treasury securities in
the market in order to take the domestic currency back out of circulation. The point of sterilizing the foreign exchange intervention is to
keep the domestic money stock unchanged. This is the type of intervention the U.S. monetary authorities undertake when they do intervene.
Unsterilized intervention has the effect of increasing the domestic
money supply. This would have a strong downward effect on the
value of the domestic currency. But like any other increase in the
money supply, it can be inflationary.
The effect of sterilized intervention is much less clear than the
effect of unsterilized intervention. The 1983 summer intervention
amounted to $254 million on the part of U.S. authorities. This was
only 1 percent of the flow through the U.S. interbank foreign exchange market on a typical day in 1983. It was even less significant
relative to the trillions of dollars in funds that investors around the
world can commit to the foreign exchange market if they think that
the exchange value of the dollar has been temporarily pushed below
the true market level. Investors will move in quickly to exploit the
potential profit opportunity, buying dollars, and thereby returning
the price of the dollar to its previous level. This process ensures that,
unless monetary authorities are prepared to intervene on a massive
scale, any effects on the exchange rate will be transitory. After the
Versailles Summit of 1982, a working group with representatives of
the seven Summit countries was set up to study exchange market intervention. Its report, released in April 1983, concluded in part, that
there was "broad agreement that sterilized intervention did not generally have a lasting effect.'*




60

If monetary authorities were prepared to intervene on a sufficiently
massive scale, there could conceivably be some permanent effect on
the exchange rate, even if the intervention were sterilized so as to
leave the money supply unchanged. But to the extent that sterilized
purchases of foreign currency were successful in reducing the value
of the dollar, they would also be successful in raising the U.S. interest rate. The reason is that sterilized intervention does not leave
market participants holding any more dollar currency than before; it
leaves them holding more dollar Treasury securities than before. The
interest rate would have to rise to induce the market to hold a greater quantity of Treasury securities, just as it does whenever the government sells large enough quantities of Treasury securities. The exporting and import-competing industries would be happy with the
lower value of the dollar. But the capital goods, construction, and
other interest-sensitive industries would be unhappy with the higher
interest rate.
Capital Controls

The third kind of measure that has been suggested to reduce the
U.S. deficit is the adoption of an international "interest equalization
tax" or other restrictions on the international mobility of funds. The
aim would be to shut off or reduce the inflow of capital and thus
reduce the exchange value of the dollar.
The case against restrictions on the international flow of capital is
analogous to the case against restrictions on the international flow of
commodities, i.e., the case for free trade. Controls on international
borrowing and lending interfere with the efficient allocation of capital among countries. The Administration is opposed to capital controls as a matter of general principle.
What effect would controls on capital inflow in the United States
have in the present context? As with exchange market intervention,
there are two possibilities. One possibility is that the controls would
not even be effective. The experience of the United States in the
1960s, and of other countries today, is that there are many ways to
circumvent capital controls. The alternative possibility is that the
controls would be strong enough to reduce the capital inflow, and
thereby reduce the value of the dollar. But if so, the reduced supply
of saving from abroad would also raise the real interest rate and,
once again, concentrate all the crowding out in the interest-sensitive
sectors.
Macroeconomic Policy

The fourth kind of measure that has been suggested to reduce the
U.S. trade deficit is a change in macroeconomic policy.




61

One possibility is a more expansionary monetary policy. This
would clearly reduce the value of the dollar. In the short run, before
prices throughout the economy had time to adjust, it would reduce
the value of the dollar not only in nominal terms, but in real terms as
well. Thus it would succeed in stimulating the demand for U.S. products. Unfortunately, a more expansionary monetary policy would also
have adverse consequences for inflation. In the long run, when prices
have had time to adjust, there would probably be no effect on the
real exchange rate or real output, only an increase in the general
price level. Because of the inflationary consequences, the Administration does not advocate using expansionary monetary policy to depress the value of the dollar.
On the other hand, for those who are concerned that monetary
policy should be tightened, it is worth taking note of the undesirable
consequences for the exchange rate in the short run. The fact that
the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets remained high
throughout 1983 is a clear signal that the market had confidence in
the Federal Reserve and that the money growth rate was not excessive.
The last possibility is a policy of reducing the budget deficit. Measures to reduce the budget deficit would lower real interest rates and
thus allow the investment sector to share more fully in the recovery
that is now taking place primarily in the government and consumer
sectors. But, further, it would also lower the real value of the dollar
and thus allow the exporting and import-competing sectors to share
in the recovery as well. Of course, just as there are costs to the other
proposed measures to improve the trade balance, there are also costs
to reducing the budget deficit, whether by reducing government expenditure or by raising taxes.
DEVELOPMENTS IN OTHER INDUSTRIAL COUNTRIES
One of the challenges facing the world economy is the uneven geographical distribution of the recovery. Among the industrialized
countries, only in Canada is real growth in 1984 expected to be as
strong as in the United States. The implication for U.S. trade is negative: slower growth among trading partners than in North America
means slower growth in U.S. exports than in U.S. imports. As Chart
2-3 shows, U.S. trade with both Europe and Japan is deteriorating.
EUROPE

The 1983 recovery in the United States and Canada is in the process of spreading to Europe as well. The United Kingdom and West
Germany seem to have embarked on a path of renewed growth. Ex-




62

pansionary policies in France in 1981 postponed the recession there,
but deteriorating inflation and balance of payments situations led to
the adoption of austerity measures. Though the French trade balance
improved in 1983, worries about inflation remained serious enough
to keep a lid on expectations of future French expansion. In Italy and
most of the smaller European countries there was no significant recovery for 1983 as a whole, although there were some signs of a
pickup in economic activity toward the end of the year.
Effects on Europe of U. S, Economic Developments

Inflation has declined in all the larger European countries since
1980. This accomplishment has not been easy. The weakness of their
currencies against the dollar has meant higher prices for oil and
other imports in Europe. To limit the damage from both domestic
and imported inflation, most European countries have accepted
higher real interest rates than they would have accepted otherwise.
Indeed, this is the mechanism through which recession was transmitted to Europe in 1981. Just as capital flowing into the United States
has kept real U.S. interest rates lower and U.S. investment higher
than they would otherwise be, so has capital flowing out of some European countries probably kept real European interest rates higher
and European investment lower than they would otherwise be. In
effect, the low U.S. rate of private and public saving is crowding out
investment not just in the United States, but in the rest of the world
as well.
The counterpart to a capital outflow is a current account surplus.
This is the positive side of the ledger from the viewpoint of the European countries. Their depreciated currencies give their exporting
and import-competing industries a competitive advantage in world
markets. Until now, the Europeans have not on the whole considered
that they were benefiting from the strength of the dollar and the U.S.
trade deficit, despite their sizable share of it illustrated in Chart 2-1.
Some have found it politically convenient to focus exclusively on the
negative aspects of the exchange rate movement. The world current
account discrepancy may also be part of the explanation: it is as if
each country thinks it is running a deficit in goods and services, and
someone else must be running the surplus.
In any case, in 1984 U.S. growth will lead to greater demand for
European goods and thus is likely to help pull Europe out of its recession. The prospective reversal of the 1980-83 appreciation of the
dollar is another development to which the Europeans can look forward. If the dollar depreciates, as many expect, the reduction in
import prices will make the task of fighting inflation easier in Europe.
Of course, the reversal in the gain in European competitiveness
would also lead to an eventual reversal in the gain in net exports to




63

the United States. But it might allow European monetary authorities
to bring down interest rates and stimulate domestic demand, at least
in those countries such as West Germany and the United Kingdom
that have relatively strong current account and inflation positions.
The weaker-currency countries in Europe would find it difficult to
expand on their own. The French franc, for example, might come
under renewed pressure within the European Monetary System if a
prospective world portfolio shift out of dollars were accompanied by
a portfolio shift into marks.
Structural Problems in European Labor Markets
Regardless of what happens in the international financial markets,
the problem of 18 million unemployed workers still plagues Western
Europe. Indeed, in 1983 the unemployment rate continued to climb
throughout Europe. In sharp contrast to the United States, Western
Europe employs about the same number of workers, on an absolute
basis, as it did in 1968. The most commonly cited cause of the bleak
employment picture is excessive labor costs. Due to wage contracts
indexed to consumer prices, and other less institutionalized social
forces, real wages in Europe never adjusted in the 1970s to reflect
the negative effect of oil shocks on the productivity of labor. Some
observers argue that the greater rigidity of real wages in Europe than
in the United States explains European governments* lack of enthusiasm for expansionary demand policies, despite low growth. For example, some European governments have taken steps to reduce government expenditure. They have also expressed the wish that the
United States would reduce its budget deficit. Whether or not it is
correct that expansion requires real wages to fall, it seems likely that
any expansion of employment in Europe will greatly lag expansion of
output. The implications for investment and long-term growth are
also disturbing.
JAPAN
Economic performance in Japan has been impressive by the standards of most countries, even though the 1980-82 world recession was
reflected in Japan as a clear slowdown in real growth. The Japanese
trade account moved into substantial surplus again in 1983, as declining oil prices reduced the import bill and recovery in the United
States and some others of Japan's trading partners boosted exports.
Domestic demand remained somewhat sluggish.
Trade with the United States and Japanese Commercial Policy
As Table 2-1 shows, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan, known as a
bilateral trade deficit, is larger than with any other single country.




64

Trade relations between the two countries are a source of special
concern, and warrant a careful analysis.
To some extent the bilateral trade imbalance follows naturally
from three other facts:
1. Japan usually runs a merchandise trade surplus with the rest of
the world, as a consequence of its high rate of saving and its deficit
in services.
2. The United States usually runs a merchandise trade deficit, as a
consequence of its low rate of saving and its surplus in services.
3. Japan and the United States are the two largest market economies in the world and account for large shares of each other's trade.
There is an important reason why, even if Japan's overall trade balance were zero, it would still run a large bilateral trade surplus with
the United States, and a very large surplus in manufactured goods in
particular. Japan has few natural resources, and is dependent on imports for its supply of primary products, especially oil and other mineral fuels. It must earn the foreign exchange to pay for the oil by
exporting other goods. If the United States were willing to sell
enough Alaskan oil to Japan, for example, the bilateral trade imbalance would be reduced. As it is, Japan buys its oil elsewhere, running
a large bilateral deficit with OPEC countries. And Europe normally
runs a bilateral deficit with the United States. It is as though the
United States sells to Europe in order to be able to buy from Japan,
Japan sells to the United States in order to be able to buy from
OPEC, and so forth around the circle of trading partners.
The important point is that it is neither necessary nor desirable
that any two countries' bilateral trade be in balance, any more than it
is necessary or desirable for an auto manufacturer to be in bilateral
balance with its steel supplier, or a household with its plumber. One
looks at the overall balance of a household, company, or country, not
at bilateral balances, to see if it is earning more—from all its trading
partners together—than it is paying out.
One widely held belief is that Japanese trade policy is responsible for the fact that Japan does not buy as much from the United
States as the United States buys from it. Because the Japanese
have accelerated tariff reductions agreed to in the Tokyo Round of
multilateral trade negotiations, their tariffs are now lower than those
of the United States and the European Community. But the Japanese
maintain a number of nontariff barriers against imports that are a
source of friction with the United States. These include import
quotas for some agricultural products, and less tangible barriers to
imports of manufactured goods, such as inspection requirements and
government purchasing policies. Recent negotiations between the
two governments in such areas as beef and citrus products, metallur-




65

gical coal and natural gas, cigarettes, and telecommunications equipment, have made some progress in reducing these barriers. But frictions remain.
Import barriers in every country protect those sectors that would
not have the comparative advantage in a fair fight, at the expense of
those sectors that would. In the Japanese case, it is agriculture that is
easily the least competitive sector and therefore the most protected,
with beef and citrus products the most highly visible examples. Japan
already imports a lot of agricultural products; indeed, it is the largest
customer of U.S. agricultural exports. But, in general, a high observed degree of "import penetration*' does not preclude the existence of a high degree of protection. In fact, import penetration is
often the cause and protection the effect, rather than the other way
around. Many countries invoke national security arguments as a justification for protectionist measures; it should be noted that Japan
does so on behalf of its agricultural sector.
It would be in the Japanese interest to reduce or remove the agricultural barriers because they can import these products far more
cheaply than it costs to produce them domestically. Japanese liberalization would, of course, also be in the interest of U.S. farmers. It
probably would not be in the interest of the U.S. manufacturing
sector, however. In view of Japan's deficits in oil and services, it must
run surpluses in its trade in other goods. If Japan were to start importing more agricultural products, its trade balance would not
simply worsen by the same amount. Rather, the yen would eventually
depreciate in order to generate the required trade surpluses in other
sectors, i.e., manufactures. The point is that Japanese protectionism,
like all protectionism, distorts the pattern of trade in such a way as to
hurt both countries on net; but it is not a major source of the Japanese trade surplus.
The Yen Exchange Rate and Japanese Foreign Exchange Intervention

Another common claim is that an undervalued yen is the source of
the trade problem. One version of this view is that the Japanese are
deliberately keeping the yen undervalued, presumably either through
foreign exchange intervention or through capital controls. No aspect
of this view stands up well to the facts, however.
The value of the yen has indeed fallen in terms of dollars since
1980, though this movement was largely reversed in late 1982. As of
December 1983, the yen had depreciated 3 percent, relative to the
1980 average. This depreciation has not been an offsetting reaction
to different rates of inflation. Rather, the opposite is the case: because of superior inflation performance, the gain in Japanese competitiveness over this period has been 13 percent, as measured by
consumer prices.




66

However, the dollar has appreciated against all foreign currencies,
not just the yen. Chart 2-4 shows the value of the yen, mark, franc,
and pound, each in terms of dollars. The mark, franc, and pound are
all clearly down in value by more than the yen. In fact, relative to the
1973-79 average, the yen has actually risen.in nominal terms by more
than 10 percent against the dollar. It is difficult, given Chart 2-4, to
single out the yen as the troublemaker.

The bilateral exchange rate between the yen and the dollar remains a source of difficulty for U.S. businessmen who compete with
Japan in domestic or foreign markets. Have the Japanese intervened
to keep the yen at a lower level against the dollar than it otherwise
would be? Although the Japanese authorities practice occasional exchange market intervention, their intervention has, if anything, prevented a further decline of the yen relative to the dollar. The Japanese monetary authorities have long followed a policy of trying to
dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate, known as "leaning against
the wind." In 1977 and 1978 when the dollar was weak against the
yen, the Japanese authorities bought dollars to dampen the down-




67

ward movement of the dollar against their own currency. In the
period since April 1981, when the dollar has been strong against the
yen, the Japanese have sold dollars to dampen the upward movement
of the dollar against their own currency. The intervention does not
appear to have been effective at moderating the swings in the yen/
dollar rate. But it has worked in that direction.
Liberalization of Japanese Capital Markets

The cause of the decline in the exchange value of the yen against
the dollar since 1980 is the flow of capital out of Japan and into the
United States. A primary reason for this capital flow is the high real
U.S. interest rate. But it has been suggested that Japanese restrictions on the international flow of capital may also be a factor.
Japan, like the United States and European countries, maintained
into the 1970s controls on the international flow of capital that had
originated under the fixed exchange rate system. After the shift to
floating exchange rates in 1973, the United States, West Germany,
and the United Kingdom, one by one removed their capital controls.
As recently as 1978, Japan still retained formidable barriers to both
inflow and outflow. For example, foreigners were not allowed to hold
many Japanese securities, such as gensaki, a 3-month repurchase
agreement. Chart 2-5 shows the Tokyo gensaki interest rate and the
London 3-month Euro-yen interest rate. The fact that the Tokyo
gensaki rate exceeded the London Euro-yen rate in 1978 is clear evidence that capital controls were operating to reduce capital inflow
into Japan. Otherwise foreign residents would not have been willing
to hold Euro-yen in London when a higher interest rate was available
in Tokyo. The yen was then at an all-time high against the dollar and
the Japanese were trying to dampen its appreciation by keeping capital from flowing into the country.
When the yen depreciated rapidly in 1979, the Japanese moved
quickly to remove controls on capital inflow, making it possible for
foreigners to hold Japanese securities. Japan's Foreign Exchange and
Foreign Trade Control Law of December 1980 established a presumption that international capital flows are permitted. Chart 2-5
shows that the de jure liberalization took place de facto as well. The
differential between the gensaki and Euro-yen rates dropped sharply.
In fact, the differential, though small, became negative in 1979 and
1980. This is evidence that Japanese controls on the inflow of capital
were liberalized more quickly than controls on capital outflow. If
some barriers to capital outflow had not remained, Japanese investors would not have been willing to hold assets in Tokyo when a
higher interest rate on comparable yen securities was available in
London. Thus those capital controls that remained were more a force
keeping capital inside the country than outside, and thus more a

force keeping the yen value up than keeping it down. By 1983 the
gensaki-Euro-yen differential was so small as to suggest that Japanese
capital markets for short-term negotiable instruments were as open
as, for example, European capital markets.
The governments of both Japan and the United States recognize
that the yen/dollar exchange rate remains a source of concern, particularly insofar as it heightens protectionist pressures in the United
States. One proposal is that the Japanese government take positive
action to bring about some capital inflow. In 1984 some Japanese
government-affiliated agencies plan to issue foreign currency bonds
in New York. However, the governments of both countries feel that
more direct measures, such as reinstatement of some of the controls
on capital outflow, even if they were effective, would be counterproductive to the longer term goal of completing the integration of
Japan into world financial markets.
In the past the yen has not occupied a place in world financial arrangements that is commensurate with Japan's importance in world




69

trade. For example, the yen's share in world official holdings of foreign exchange, though it has risen rapidly, still falls short of, not only
the dollar's share, but the mark's share as well. Similarly, the percentage of Japan's exports that are denominated in its own currency,
though it has risen rapidly, is still below the corresponding percentage for other large industrialized countries. At the time of the President's trip to Japan in November 1983, the Japanese agreed to promote increased "internationalization" of the yen. This includes such
concrete measures as relaxing the rules that previously restricted use
of the yen forward exchange market to transactions arising from foreign trade. There is no reason to expect such measures to have a noticeable upward effect on the value of the yen in the short run. Nevertheless, in the long run an enhanced role for the yen in world
financial markets is considered by some to be desirable in that it reflects Japan's importance in the world economy, and is hoped to contribute to some increase in its exchange value against the dollar as
well
A related goal is continued deregulation of domestic Japanese capital
markets, which lags behind deregulation in the United States. Here
the major beneficiary of liberalization would be Japanese households,
who in the past have not been paid competitive interest rates on their
savings. But it is also sometimes argued that, if interest rates rose in
Japan, there might be a decline in capital outflow from Japan and an
appreciation of the yen.
Changes in the Japanese-U.S. Trade Balance

The Japanese government is not using either foreign exchange intervention or capital controls to keep the yen "undervalued." Indeed,
it would be more accurate to say that the dollar is "overvalued" than
to say that the yen is "undervalued." The other major currencies are
down against the dollar to a greater extent than is the yen. One
would expect that the U.S. bilateral trade balance with Japan would
not have worsened more than the bilateral trade balance with other
countries.
This is indeed the case. As Chart 2-3 and Table 2-1 show, the bilateral balance with Japan has worsened. But the deterioration in the
U.S. bilateral trade balance with Japan represents less than oneeighth of the total 1981-83 decline in the overall U.S. trade balance.
The deterioration in the bilateral balance is less severe, as a proportion of U.S. imports from Japan, than the 1981-83 deterioration in
the overall U.S. trade balance. The deterioration in the U.S. bilateral
trade balance with Japan is also far less severe, on either an absolute
or relative basis, than the deterioration in the U.S. bilateral trade balance with Mexico over the same period.




70

This is not to say that U.S. trade with Japan does not remain a
source of concern. The point is that the trade balance with Japan has
deteriorated for the same reasons as the balance with other countries.
THIRD WORLD DEBT PROBLEM
The decline in the U.S. trade balance is good news for many trading partners. In the cases of Canada, Japan, and Europe, it represents
a pickup in exports that has helped to pull their economies out of
recession. But in the cases of the third world countries, particularly
those in Latin America, the changing pattern of trade represents
something quite different. As seen in Chart 2-3, the decline in the
U.S. trade balance with Latin America is much greater in magnitude
than the decline in the U.S. trade balance with other parts of the
world. The increase in their trade balances is not good news for the
Latin Americans; it is the reverse. It is a symptom of the severe debt
problem that afflicts most of these countries, and many in Asia,
Africa, and Eastern Europe as well, and of the wrenching adjustments
that they are finding it necessary to undertake.
THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM
Recent Developments in the Debtor Countries

Although there had been previous isolated cracks in the international debt terrain, it was not until 1982 that the problem erupted in
dramatic proportions. In August of that year, Mexico announced that
it was unable to meet its debt obligations to foreign creditors, although it was taking steps to rectify the situation. In response, the
U.S. Government mounted a rescue operation, involving the creditor
banks, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and other creditor
governments. The package included a strict program of adjustment
for the Mexican economy and a rescheduling of much of the debt.
Nervous banks began to cut back lending to other countries that appeared to be heavily indebted, with Brazil the most obvious target.
As long as the banks had been willing to continue lending, the
debtor countries had had the foreign exchange necessary to continue
servicing their accumulated debt, i.e., making scheduled payments of
interest and amortization of principal. As the banks cut back, the
debtors found debt-service obligations increasingly difficult to meet.
One by one, Brazil, Argentina, and many other debtor countries
found it necessary to seek debt relief from their creditors, while implementing programs of economic adjustment monitored by the IMF.
The most important result of these programs of adjustment has
been a sharp improvement in trade balances, so that interest pay-




71

merits do not have to be met entirely out of new loans, but can be
largely met out of foreign exchange earnings from international
trade. In 1983 the adjustment efforts of several of the most troubled
debtors were successful to the point of achieving significant surpluses
in their balances of trade. By the end of the year the situation looked
considerably brighter, especially in Mexico. If all concerned parties
continue their efforts, and there are no unforeseen calamities, the
system can be expected gradually to work its way back to normalcy.
The increases in debtors' trade balances have been achieved largely by cutting imports. Cutting imports is the only practical way of
achieving a large increase in the trade balance in a short period of
time. But, past a certain point, it is difficult to sustain. It means that
the population's standard of living is falling, inventories of raw materials and spare parts have been exhausted, and investment is at a
standstill. In some cases, inadequate supplies of imported inputs
have forced firms to curtail production, even firms producing for
export markets. Beginning in 1984 further progress will depend most
critically on expansion of exports, rather than further contraction of
imports. Only then will adjustment be compatible with a world of
economic growth.
Liquidity Versus Solvency

Central to an analysis of the current debt problem is the distinction between liquidity and solvency. Because countries do not go out
of business* as do firms, the distinction is not absolute but is rather a
matter of degree. A country might be defined as insolvent if it is
likely to find servicing its debt increasingly difficult over time, and
eventually to have to default. A country is merely short of liquidity if
its economy is believed to be fundamentally sound and its debt-servicing difficulties are believed to be temporary. In that case, continued
lending to keep the country liquid is justified, so as not to cause unnecessary damage to the local economy, and so as not to risk more
drastic solutions, with their adverse economic and political repercussions. In the case of insolvency, however, there would be no point in
the country making it through another year, only to face the same
difficulties next year that much further into debt; more drastic solutions would be called for.
Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico are the three debtor countries that
have dominated the discussion, not only because of their size, but
also because of the acuteness of their financial distress. One indication of their difficulties is that in all three cases, debt-service obligations (interest and amortization, including short-term debt, as originally scheduled) exceed 100 percent of exports of goods and services. This means that even if the countries could somehow cut their
imports to zero, their export earnings would not be sufficient to serv-




72

ice the debt in the absence of continued new lending. But many
healthy, developing countries borrow abroad to finance their development, and would be hard put to meet their debt obligations if for
some reason they were suddenly cut off from new lending. Furthermore, debt-service numbers are particularly sensitive to yearly fluctuations in interest rates. A longer term measure of "how far in over
their heads" the debtor countries have gotten is the ratio of debt to
exports. This ratio is reported in the first row of Table 2-4 for Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico taken together. The ratio increased rapidly between 1981 and 1982, and now exceeds 300 percent. If the
debt/export ratio were expected to continue to increase in the
future, the countries could be considered insolvent.
ORIGINS OF THE PROBLEM

The solvency issue is analyzed below. But to evaluate the future, it
helps first to recount the past.
The 1970s: Incurring the Debt

The present pattern of lending to third world countries, with its
heavy concentration on bank lending, is only 10 years old. In the
aftermath of the 1973-74 oil price shock, banks "recycled" billions of
dollars of savings that the OPEC countries could not in the short run
absorb. World inflation rates were high and real interest rates very
low—even negative—through the remainder of the decade, signaling
a high level of savings in search of investment opportunities. The
funds went, not to all the third world countries that were having difficulty paying their higher oil bills, but mainly to those judged to
have good prospects for future growth, and thus good prospects for
full repayment of the debt.
This lending seemed sensible at the time. The high world inflation
rates and low real interest rates meant it was advantageous for the
countries in question to borrow, and that servicing the debt did not
look difficult. A high level of indebtedness is not necessarily a source
of concern, as long as the borrowing countries are expected to grow.
Corporations whose income is expected to grow in the future often
have a high ratio of debt to earnings. Countries do the same. The
United States in the 1880s had debt/export ratios as high as those in
Table 2-4. Nor were the banks* expectations of high growth rates in
the debtor countries in the 1970s disappointed. The rate of growth
of exports from 1975 to 1980 was as great as the rate of growth of
debt, in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico taken together. Thus the key
measure, the debt/export ratio, did not rise during this period.
Prior to 1970, private capital flows to third world countries had
predominantly taken the form of foreign direct investment, bonds
issued for specific projects, and short-term trade credit for specific




73

imports. The pairing of loans to projects has the virtue of ensuring
that the sum of the lending equals the sum of the investment. The
bank lending of the 1970s was more often for general balance of payments financing. There is nothing wrong with this in itself. But it allowed total lending to exceed total project investment. The fact that
a large number of banks were involved, and that good aggregate statistics on lending did not at first exist, added to the confusion. The
banks may not have realized the extent of their collective investment.
The debtor countries also made policy mistakes. The mistakes fall
into two broad categories: overexpansion of demand and overvaluation of currencies. Both kinds of mistakes led to excessive trade deficits and therefore excessive borrowing to finance those deficits. But
beyond this observation, generalization is difficult. In many countries
the government sector expanded too quickly, especially in the form
of credit to inefficient state enterprises. Often government deficits
were monetized, and the currency was not devalued fast enough to
keep up with inflation; then the loss in competitiveness of export industries led to trade deficits that were financed by borrowing from
abroad. The end result was the same as when the governments financed their deficits by borrowing from abroad directly. Though
much of the money was used for profitable investment, some went to
unwise projects, to consumption, and to capital flight out of the
countries involved.
In some countries, a capital inflow and consequent real appreciation of the currency were the unintended effects of favorable developments. For example, the discovery of oil in Mexico brought about
an increase in indebtedness—financing the investment necessary to
develop the oil. Furthermore, the monetary inflow added to inflationary pressures, and the loss in price competitiveness had an adverse
effect on the exports of other industries, especially the manufacturing
sector on which previous hopes for growth had been pinned.
In other countries the simultaneous adoption of an array of monetarist and free market policies did not prevent indebtedness. Monetary stabilization made the country's assets seem attractive to hold,
trade liberalization increased the trade deficit, and removal of capital
controls allowed foreign capital to flood in. In several countries, real
overvaluation of the currency was an intentional element of the plan
to reduce inflation quickly. The magnitude and duration of the loss
in export competitiveness that followed were not intentional.
1980-82: A Change in the International Environment

As of 1980, there was little reason to doubt the ability of most of
the debtor countries to sustain high rates of growth. If the international economic environment had remained favorable, it is possible
that the debtor countries could have gone for years without having to




74

adjust their policies. But beginning in 1980, they were buffeted by
several blows not of their own making. First, inflation rates fell and
real interest rates rose in the United States and in other countries.
Because the percentage of the debt that was short term had been increasing, and most of the rest carried floating interest rates, the rise
in the market rate of interest showed up quickly in debt-service requirements.
Second came the 1980-82 world recession. The export earnings of
the debtor countries fell sharply. The demand for the primary products that many of the countries produce has always been highly sensitive to income in the industrialized countries. The years 1981 and
1982 saw sharp drops in the prices of these products relative to
goods produced in the industrialized countries. In addition, the nontraditional exports that had grown rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s
were hurt by the increased application of protectionist measures in
the industrialized countries. Protectionist measures sometimes operated to limit exporters to their past levels of sales, in which case exports from the "new arrivals" in the market were hurt disproportionately. In Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, total export revenue fell
about 8 percent in 1982 in dollar terms.
A third factor that contributed to the debtors' loss in export revenue was the large appreciation of the dollar. The strength of the
dollar was in particular a source of the fall in primary product prices
when expressed in dollars, which is the appropriate measure because
most of the debt is denominated in dollars.
A fourth factor for some countries was the decline in dollar oil
prices after 1981 (which in turn derived partly from the other three
factors). The oil price decline of course helped the oil-importing
countries, which are the majority. But it added to the list of problem
debtors a number of oil-exporting countries, OPEC members such as
Venezuela and Nigeria, as well as nonmembers such as Mexico.
The loss in export earnings attributable to the world recession
shows up immediately in the denominator of the debt/export ratio.
The higher interest payments show up immediately in the current account deficit, which in turn shows up over time as a rise in the
numerator of the debt/export ratio. As seen in Table 2-4, the ratio
rose sharply in 1982.
It is worth noting that virtually all the major Latin American countries got into trouble, the oil exporters as well as the oil importers,
those that followed monetarist and free market policies as well as
those that increased the money growth rate and expanded the role of
the government in the economy. This suggests that in retrospect the
key factor, which they all shared, was getting deeply into debt in the
first place.

It is, however, true that South Korea and other Asian countries
that had become as indebted as many of the Latin American countries, as measured by debt/output ratios, encountered less severe
problems in the 1980s. What distinguishes South Korea and other
Asian debtors from most Latin American countries is not the degree
of government intervention in the domestic economy, but the degree
of export-orientation. Exports of goods, services, and private transfers are 44 percent of GNP in South Korea, as the result of 20 years
of vigorous export promotion. By contrast they are 17 percent of
GNP in Mexico, 16 percent in Argentina, and just 8 percent in Brazil.
Indeed, of the major Asian debtors, the one to run into the most serious problems, the Philippines, also has the lowest ratio of exports
to output. While many other factors are relevant, a debtor country
with a high ratio of exports to GNP is less likely to get into debtservicing difficulties than an otherwise similar debtor country.
WILL DEBT/EXPORT RATIOS IMPROVE?

Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico are all expected to receive new loans
in 1984. One point of view is that this is throwing good money after
bad, that the loans will never be repaid, that the problem is one of
insolvency rather than illiquidity. According to this view, the present
case-by-case approach is unrealistic, and should be replaced by some
sort of general write-down of the debt. This view is accompanied by
widely ranging degrees of sympathy for the debtors. Some observers
call for a new agency to buy the written-down debt and extend more
favorable terms to the debtors. Others believe that the countries
should be left to fend for themselves.




76

An evaluation of the insolvency versus illiquidity issue is critical.
The question is what debt/export ratios are likely to do over the
course of the next decade. Ever-rising debt/export ratios imply insolvency. Ratios that decline over time, and eventually reach reasonable
levels, imply that the difficulty is only one of liquidity.
The debt/export ratio will decline if the rate of growth of debt is
less than the rate of growth of exports. The growth of the debt can
be identified with the current account deficit. (In the past, current account deficits could also to some extent be financed by foreign direct
investment and temporary drawing-down of international reserves. In
the long-term future, a successful resolution of the debt problem
would include a revival of foreign direct investment. But, as of 1984,
in many countries there is now little likelihood of a continuation of
these flows.) The current account deficit consists of interest payments plus the deficit in merchandise trade and non-interest services
and transfers. Rows 5 and 6 in Table 2-4 report interest payments
and the trade deficit, respectively, each as a percentage of the level of
the debt. If the expected rate of growth of exports is greater than the
sum of these two numbers, i.e., greater than the current account/
debt ratio reported in row 7, then the debt/export ratio can be expected to decline over time. This criterion was easily met by the 25
percent average annual growth rate in exports that prevailed from
1975 to 1980.
The sharp increases in interest rates after 1980 made the criterion
much more difficult to meet. If the trade balance had remained in
deficit or had been zero, the criterion would not now be met. But
Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico succeeded in switching their trade balances from deficit to surplus by 1983. Comparing expected export
growth with the average interest rate being paid on the debt (the
number in row 5, 12.2 percent in 1983) alone would be too strict a
criterion. It would not give the countries credit for the adjustment
they have accomplished. But the total current account deficit/debt
ratio in row 7 was only 2.8 percent in 1983. This is a more reasonable target against which to compare the rate of exporj growth.
What is export growth expected to be in coming years? The
answer depends on the growth rate in the industrialized countries,
among other factors. Even assuming the industrialized world's real
growth rate has now returned to that of the late 1970s, there is little
likelihood of the growth rate of export earnings returning soon to
the 25 percent average annual rate of the earlier period. The quantity of debtor country exports demanded is expected to respond less
favorably to this recovery than to past recoveries, in part because in
recent years the debtors had come to rely to a greater extent on exports to each other and to OPEC, and strong recovery in the near




77

term is expected only in the industrialized countries. But, allowing
for some improvement in the dollar prices that the debtor countries
are paid for their products—and the improvement might be large
over the next few years if the dollar depreciates—there does not
seem to be much doubt that the rate of growth of export revenue
will exceed 2.8 percent by a comfortable margin in 1984 and into the
indefinite future. Thus there is not much doubt that the debt/export
ratio will decline. Eventually, as export growth and lender confidence
are restored, the debtors can be expected to return to the trade balance deficits appropriate to developing countries.
SHARING THE BURDEN

Because the debt problem seems to be one of liquidity rather than
one of solvency, i.e., continued lending will permit exports to grow
more quickly than the debt burden, it is important to keep the lending going. Chart 2-6 illustrates the amount of foreign exchange available to Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico taken together. In the 1970s
imports exceeded exports, that is, they ran trade deficits. Because the
prospects for future growth looked good, voluntary private lending
was sufficient to finance both the trade deficit and interest payments
on previously incurred debt. By 1983 interest payments had become
very large and—because of worsened prospects—banks had become
reluctant to extend enough new lending to cover the interest payments, let alone any trade deficit. It was only as part of a cooperative
effort among the debtors, banks, industrialized country governments,
and the IMF that the debtor countries were able to get through the
year. The next four subsections consider in turn each of the four parties to this cooperative effort.
Adjustment by the Debtor Countries

By far the greatest share of the burden was borne by the debtors
themselves. Between 1981 and 1983 the three Latin American countries taken together succeeded in improving their aggregate trade
balance in goods and services (excluding interest) by $28 billion. In
the larger debtor countries, most of the change was accomplished by
cutting imports sharply, mainly by contracting income and expenditure, although partly by devaluation and other methods. From 1981
to 1983 imports were slashed about 52 percent in Argentina, 30 percent in Brazil, and 66 percent in Mexico. All three countries have had
to suffer severe recessions in order to reduce expenditure on traded
goods. Real GNP has been falling rapidly. In these and other countries, unemployment is very high, and the standard of living of most of
the population, including the middle class, has deteriorated sharply.

Calls for solutions to the debt problem through adjustment by the
debtor countries must acknowledge the fact that an enormous
amount of adjustment is already taking place. Indeed, it was the large
swing in the trade balance from deficit to surplus that allowed the
debt/export ratio to begin falling.
New Bank Lending

As can be seen from Chart 2-6, the increase in the debtor countries* trade balances in 1983 was still not enough to pay for all of the
interest they owed. In other words, most of them ran current account
deficits. The largest source of financing of the deficits was the banks.
New bank lending to Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico in 1983 was
about $9 billion.




79

The role of the banks has been controversial. One commonly expressed point of view is that the banks made unwise loans, and they
now deserve to suffer the consequences. A related viewpoint is that,
regardless of whether in the 1970s one could have foreseen the debt
crisis, a necessary part of the discipline of the marketplace is the
taking of losses when things go wrong, unmitigated by help from national or supranational government institutions. Proponents of this
philosophy will be skeptical of solvency calculations like those in
Table 2-4. They may ask why it is necessary for the IMF, and the
United States and other governments, to get involved, if the loans
are profitable and repayable.
In the current international financial system, an individual bank,
particularly one of the many smaller banks, has an incentive to discontinue new lending to a problem debtor. A new loan adds to the
amount of capital the bank has at risk. Yet—if the bank's share is
small relative to the total—a new loan does not visibly add to the
debtor's ability to remain current in its payments on its previously incurred debts. If all the banks, as part of a package, continue new
lending, this does add significantly to the ability of the country to
service its debt on schedule. But an individual bank has no incentive
to take into account that its actions might contribute to the failure of
the package, and thus precipitate the default that it fears. Left to
itself, the bank would be a "free rider," allowing the quality of its
portfolio to benefit from the new loans of others, without putting up
any new money itself. This free-rider problem is one justification for
a role for the IMF and other public institutions.
The International Monetary Fund

The IMF is the third of the four legs, after the debtors and the
banks, on which responsibility for managing the debt problem rests.
In 1983 the Administration sought, and eventually won, congressional approval for the U.S. share of an increase in resources for the
IMF.
The IMF lends money to any of its 146 member governments that
are in balance of payments difficulty. No member has ever defaulted
on an IMF loan. In the past the two biggest borrowers have been the
United Kingdom and the United States.
The IMF has increased total lending in the 1981-83 period of financial distress in the third world and tight liquidity worldwide, as it
did in the aftermath of the 1973 oil shock. However, the magnitude
of the resources supplied by the Fund is often less important than its
role as a catalyst. In the past this has meant giving a "seal of approval" to countries that have agreed to follow particular programs of
needed policy changes, enabling them to borrow from banks and
other sources. In the financial packages of the past 2 years, the Fund




80

has gone a step further. In these cases, as a precondition to the IMF
stamp of approval to a particular debtor country and to the availability of IMF resources, not only must the country agree to a set of policies, but the banks to which the country is indebted also must agree
to extend new loans. In this sense, the IMF is "bailing in" the banks,
rather than bailing them out. Chart 2-6 shows that the total amount
of Fund lending to Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico in 1983, about $4
billion, is less than half the amount of new bank lending, which is in
turn less than the reduction of net imports achieved by the three
countries.
In recent years, the Fund, recognizing that many countries' balance
of payments problems require more than short-term stabilization
policy and short-term financing, has at times extended financing for
longer term structural adjustment. However, longer-term development loans remain the special province of the Fund's sister institution, the World Bank. Neither institution offers substantially concessional interest rates. Only the World Bank affiliate, the International
Development Association (IDA), provides "soft" loans to poor countries. The recipients of IDA loans are not the debtors with which this
chapter has been concerned. The debtors were rapidly growing
economies until recently. Most of the IDA recipients are African and
Asian countries that are poor and have always been poor. They do
not have big debt problems because banks in the past have not been
willing to lend to them.
Thus the purpose of the IMF is neither to bail out banks, nor to
give foreign aid. The IMF is rather, as the President has described it,
"the linchpin of the international financial system."
The Role of National Governments

The fourth leg in the cooperative effort to resolve the debt problem, after the debtor countries themselves, the banks, and the IMF, is
the governments of the creditor countries. Besides supporting the
IMF, there are two ways in which the governments play a crucial role
in the process: direct credit and trade policy.
In a variety of ways, credit is extended directly by governments to
the debtors that are the most afflicted and the most important to
them. First, a crisis sometimes comes up so quickly that an IMF package cannot be assembled in time. Then the Bank for International
Settlements (the "central bank for central banks" in Basle, Switzerland), or monetary authorities in the industrialized countries acting
on their own, may extend a short-term "bridge loan," to tide the
debtor over until the longer term financing and adjustment program
are in place.
Second, most industrialized countries have government trade
credit agencies that grant short-term trade credit to countries buying




81

their exports. Many U.S. firms that normally export to the debtor
countries, especially Mexico and Brazil, are currently unable to do so,
as trade credit from private sources has disappeared. The U.S.
Export-Import Bank, as currently constituted, has a mandate to raise
its levels of credit in these circumstances, when reasonable assurance
of repayment exists. Such credit simultaneously increases the ability
of U.S. firms to export, and the ability of the debtor countries to
import. Other wealthy countries* trade credit agencies are granting
corresponding credits for their own firms' exports to the large debtor
countries.
Third is the Paris Club, a forum where debtor countries can negotiate debt-relief terms on credits extended by, or guaranteed by, official government agencies. Paris Club rescheduling, along with the
other forms of direct credit from national governments, is a significant element in the financing picture for many of the problem debtors.
Government financing for Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil, was
about $3 billion in 1983. This amount, like the IMF lending, is much
smaller than the shares of the burden borne by the banks and the
debtors themselves, as Chart 2-6 shows.
In the longer run, more important than the role of the national
governments in lending may be their role in trade. Currently, for the
debtor countries to meet their debt obligations, they must necessarily
run trade surpluses. Up until now they have mainly been cutting imports, but in the future they will have to boost exports. Even in the
short run, the promise of future export growth is necessary to keep
private capital flowing in.
In order for these countries to export, the industrialized countries
must import from them. Real growth in the industrialized countries is
the most important determinant of imports from the debtor countries. The 1983 U.S.-led worldwide recovery was the best possible development for the debt problem. While policies that bring down real
interest rates and sustain the recovery are desirable in any case, their
implications for the debt problem make them doubly desirable.
Trade policy in the industrialized countries is the second most important determinant of imports from the debtor countries. The industrialized countries have a variety of tariff and nontariff barriers
against imports from these countries. It would be inconsistent for the
industrialized countries to expect the debtors to meet their debt obligations, and at the same time expect their trade balance with the
debtors not to turn negative. It is essential to the successful resolution of the current international debt problem that the industrialized
countries not shut out the products that these countries wish to sell.




82

EASING THE DEBT-SERVICE BURDEN

The soundness of the current four-way strategy, and its success to
date, do not mean that future crises, even major ones, cannot occur.
It would take a major unforeseen event, such as a sudden end to the
world recovery, to change the outcome of the debt/export calculations; but it might take somewhat less than that for the four-way cooperation to fall apart.
The breakdown of the strategy could hypothetically come from
either of two directions: (1) declaration of default and withdrawal of
lending, by nervous banks, or (2) suspension of payments or even repudiation of the debt, by suffering debtor countries. Both of these
worst-case scenarios are unlikely. Nevertheless, there is an undesirable all-or-nothing element to the present system. From the viewpoint
of the creditor nations, a default or repudiation means that the value
of the loans drops essentially to zero. From the viewpoint of an individual debtor country it might mean ostracism from the world system
of trade and finance. Not only would many years pass before the
debtor could resume the long-term borrowing necessary for economic development, but it would be subject to legal entanglements and
probably cut off even from the short-term banking services necessary
to carry on trade. Ways might be found to reinforce the current strategy that, although not necessarily altering the distribution of gains
and losses in an average sense, would take some of the instability out
of the system.
Credit Terms Versus the Level of Financing

One way to ease the burden on the debtor countries would be to
increase the level of financing, and thus allow them to import more.
The obvious drawback to allowing too high a level of financing is
that it leaves the accumulated debt that much higher at the end of
the year and reduces the pressure on the country to adjust.
There is a more promising alternative to ease the burden of adjustment that is being implemented for the case of Mexico in 1984. The
banks, rather than increasing new lending to Mexico in 1984, are reducing it below 1983 levels, but are agreeing to lower the interest
rate and loan fees charged. This tradeoff reduces the banks' total exposure relative to what it would otherwise be, and at the same time
increases the probability that they will eventually be repaid in full.
Mexico's financial position is improved because, for a given trade
surplus, lower interest payments mean a lower current account deficit
and thus a lower level of indebtedness at the end of the year.
Any easing of terms on bank lending must be tied to good performance on the part of the debtor. If the criterion for granting reduced interest rates were the seriousness of the country's difficulties,




83

as measured for example by debt-service figures, then the incentives
facing the debtor governments would be perverse. Reducing the
costs of economic mismanagement can make it more likely to occur.
One possibility is to use as the criterion an improvement in the trade
balance to the point of a substantial surplus in the balance on goods
and (non-interest) services. This would ensure that the benefit is limited to those countries that have serious debt problems and have
taken the necessary steps to adjust.
Expenditure-Reducing

Policies Versus Relative Price Policies

The level of financing and the level of interest payments together
determine the trade surplus that a debtor is obliged to run to generate the foreign exchange needed to make interest payments. These
levels still leave open the question of whether to attain that trade surplus through high levels of exports and imports, or low levels of exports and imports. The course up until now has been closer to the
latter: expenditure on imports has been cut, largely through cuts in
government expenditure and in national expenditure generally. Both
Mexico and Brazil appear to have cut imports in 1983 below the
levels that had been agreed upon with the IMF. The price has been
low levels of output, income, employment, consumption, and investment. Particularly in the cases of the larger countries, where imports
are a small share of expenditure, cutting expenditure is an inefficient
way of cutting net imports.
The alternative strategy is to slow the rate at which budget-cutting
and other expenditure-reducing policies are implemented, and to
substitute policies that raise the prices of traded goods relative to the
prices of nontraded goods. Such "supply-side" policies would provide the incentives for labor and capital to shift into the production
of the now more profitable traded goods. (In the case of Brazil, for
example, a shift of resources into export production equal to 4 percent of gross domestic product would itself be enough to pay all the
interest on the debt.) At the same time, such policies would provide
the incentives for consumers to switch expenditure away from traded
goods. The trade balance, which is the difference between the production and consumption of traded goods, would increase without a
drastic decline in the level of output.
The obvious way to raise the prices of traded goods relative to
nontraded goods is to devalue the currency. Devaluations cause immediate corresponding increases in the prices of traded goods, at
least in the case of agricultural and mineral products. But there is no
reason why devaluations need to be reflected as fully or as quickly in
wages and the prices of nontraded goods. It is always easier to provide firms the incentive to export by reducing wages relative to the




84

prices of traded goods, rather than by reducing wages relative to the
general price level.
Three arguments are heard against an approach of substituting
some increases in the relative prices of traded goods for some decrease in the level of expenditure. The first is that devaluation is contractionary because of its negative effects on real wages, the real
money supply, and the balance sheet of firms with dollar-denominated liabilities. But this argument applies more strongly to the approach of attaining a given trade surplus through expenditure reduction than to the relative-price approach.
The second argument is that devaluation is a ''beggar-thy-neighbor" policy that is unlikely to be effective when other countries are
trying to do the same thing. This argument, however, applies equally
to the alternative expenditure-reduction approach. In other words
both the "contractionary'* and "beggar-thy-neighbor" arguments are
really arguments for allowing smaller trade surpluses through increased financing; they are not arguments about the best way to
attain a given trade surplus.
The third argument is that devaluation would result in a higher inflation rate than would expenditure reduction. Inflation is undesirable, and overexpansionary policies in the past were to some extent
responsible for both the inflation and the debt problem. But it does
not necessarily follow that there is an ironclad connection between
continuous progress on the inflation problem and progress on the
debt problem. The need to generate foreign exchange to meet interest obligations and the need to put a limit on the rate of decline of
production, consumption, and investment, would seem to be absolute
constraints. This calls for a judicious mix of policies that reduce expenditure and policies that change relative prices.
CONCLUSION
The strong U.S. recovery is creating jobs both at home and
abroad. It is helping to pull the other industrialized countries out of
recession, and is providing markets for the exports of the debtor
countries as well. For the first time since the 1973 oil shock, Canada,
Japan, and the European Community are all running current account
surpluses. Many of the debtors are showing sharply improved international payments positions; a few such as Mexico have even attained
current account surpluses. The United States is acting as an engine
of growth in the world economy.
The composition of the recovery remains lopsided as a result of
high real interest rates. If real interest rates can be brought down in
the United States, it will alleviate the pressure for capital inflow and




85

for current account deficits vis-a-vis Japan, Europe, and other trading
partners. At the same time, lower real interest rates would alleviate
the debt-service burden on the debtor countries, thus reducing the
trade surpluses that they must run and making things easier for all
concerned.
In the meantime, the greatest danger, in the United States as elsewhere, is that the desire to boost exports and reduce imports will be
reflected in protectionist measures. The only sound way to improve
the U.S. trade balance is to adopt macroeconomic policies consistent
with a recovery in which all sectors of the U.S. economy share. The
only sound way to promote world trade is to adopt policies consistent with a recovery in which all members of the world economy
share. In particular, it is essential to the favorable outcome of the
debt problem that the debtor countries be allowed to increase exports to the industrialized countries. The liberal world trading system
can only lose if its members resort to heightened barriers to the international flow of goods, services, capital, and labor. All parties can
only gain if the debtor countries are restored to health.




86

CHAPTER 3

Industrial Policy
SHOULD THE UNITED STATES adopt an industrial policy? Proponents argue that such a strategy is necessary to revitalize our manufacturing sector. They claim that U.S. manufacturing has done
poorly compared with the manufacturing sectors of other countries,
and that we are losing our international competitiveness. These
claims have led to the perception that manufacturing's share of our
economy is eroding and that we are "deindustrializing."
To reverse this alleged decline, some industrial policy advocates
propose that the government encourage new high-technology industries and help older industries regain their former strength. They
also recommend that the government assist declining industries to
adjust more smoothly to lower levels of output and employment.
Others propose government aid to prevent a decline in selected basic
industries.
Industrial policy solutions seem attractive to observers who think
that such policies have contributed to Japan's emergence as a major
economic power. Since World War II Japan has had rapid growth in
manufacturing output, productivity, and exports. The main sources
of this growth have been high rates of saving and investment, the migration of workers from farms to factories, and the adoption of
modern technology. In addition, the Japanese government has used
an array of tools to encourage certain industries to develop and
others to adjust to decline. Some observers argue that unless the
United States adopts an industrial policy of its own, Japanese growth
will contribute to U.S. decline.
In this country, industrial policy advocates have advanced several
proposals that would increase the government's role in directing resources into or out of specific industries. First, there would be a central agency to shape the Federal Government's industrial policy.
Second, councils including representatives of business, labor, and
government would gather information on specific industries and
forge a consensus strategy. Third, a Federal development bank would
invest money in industries deemed to receive inadequate capital from
private financial markets. Fourth, declining industries would receive




87

government aid and import protection to adjust to new economic
conditions.
Some industrial policy advocates claim that the United States already has an industrial policy. They argue that such policies as trade
protection and subsidies for exports and research and development
are components of an industrial policy simply because they affect the
composition of industrial output. The difference between our present
policies and what they advocate, they say, is that the former is ad hoc
industrial policy while the latter is coherent.
It is true that many Federal policies affect industrial output. But
the argument about whether they constitute industrial policy, like all
arguments about definitions, is pointless. What is relevant is whether
the proposals of industrial policy advocates are a good idea. Should
the U.S. Government have a larger role than it now has in deciding
the composition of U.S. industry?
The answer is "no." An industrial policy would not solve the problems faced by U.S. industry and would instead create new problems.
Industrial policy has a mixed record in Japan and has been unsuccessful in Europe. Most of the problems of U.S. industries can be
solved with prudent monetary and fiscal policies. The best way to
deal with the many changes in demand that occur in a dynamic economy is to allow investors and workers to respond to such changes.
Because they reap the rewards of their successes and bear the costs
of their failures, investors will seek out industries that pay the highest
rates of return. Similarly, workers have incentives to work where they
can earn the highest wages. The free movement of capital and labor
in response to new profit opportunities and wage differentials increases growth. Government allocation of investment that ignores
market signals usually stunts growth by diverting labor and capital
from more productive uses.
IS THE UNITED STATES DEINDUSTRIALIZING?
Although selected manufacturing industries face serious problems,
the United States is definitely not "deindustrializing." Table 3-1
shows that the output, employment, and capital stock of U.S. manufacturing grew from 1950 through 1980. Moreover, manufacturing's
share of total output and capital stock was roughly constant between
1960 and 1980. The manufacturing share of total employment progressively declined, but the decline is a sign of relative productivity
growth, not a sign of industrial demise. There is no evidence of
either an absolute or relative long-run decline of U.S. manufacturing
output.

It is true that the composition of U.S. manufacturing has changed
substantially over the past two decades. As Table 3-2 shows, between
1960 and 1980 U.S. manufacturing shifted away from capital-intensive, labor-intensive, and resource-intensive industries toward hightechnology-intensive industries. High-technology industries are defined as those with a high ratio of research and development spending to value added. (Value added equals industry revenue minus the
cost of inputs purchased from other industries.) In high-technology
industries, value added increased by more than 40 percent, and employment increased by more than 20 percent.
This shift in the composition of manufacturing output and the
movement of capital and workers toward other sectors is not a threat
to our economy or to our international competitiveness. Although we
commonly call some industries "basic/* the products of these industries are no more important than the products of the agricultural or
service sectors. Nor is our position in world markets endangered if
our exports shift from steel and machinery to engineering services.
Using industrial policy to halt the decline of our basic industries
would not increase growth. It would merely shift investment and employment from one sector to another. Increasing the total level of
saving and investment is the best way to increase economic growth.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER NATIONS

U.S. manufacturing output and employment have generally performed well compared with other major industrial nations. Table 3-3
presents manufacturing data for France, West Germany, Japan, the
United Kingdom, and the United States from 1960 to the first oil
shock in 1973, and from 1973 to 1980. The data show that the slowdown in the growth of output and employment in manufacturing
since 1973 was not limited to the United States, but also occurred in
Europe and Japan. Whatever the causes of this slowdown, it is shared
by our international trading partners, many of whom have industrial
policies.

The U.S. manufacturing sector grew more rapidly than most European manufacturing sectors between 1960 and 1980. Japanese manufacturing output increased most rapidly during this period, but the
difference between the Japanese and the U.S. growth rates declined
substantially after 1973. Between 1973 and 1980, U.S. manufacturing
employment grew slightly, while manufacturing employment fell in
France, West Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
Some industrial policy advocates also claim that the United States
is losing its competitive edge in high-technology. Since World War
II, other countries have followed the United States in developing this
sector. As the number of producers has increased, the U.S. share of
this rapidly expanding market has gradually declined. Between 1962
and 1980 the U.S. share of industrial countries' high-technology exports fell from 30.3 percent to 23.9 percent. During the same period,
the Japanese share rose from 4.1 percent to 12.3 percent and the
German share stayed constant at about 18 percent.
However, the United States is still the leading exporter of hightechnology products. In 1980 the United States exported $7.6 billion
of high-technology goods, compared to $7.5 billion for West Germany, $4.8 billion for Japan, $3.7 billion for the United Kingdom




90

and $3.2 billion for France. In that year we were the leading exporters of office machines and automatic data processing equipment, and
professional and scientific instruments. As Table 3-4 shows, from
1970 to 1980 the real value of net exports in many high-technology
industries increased more in the United States than in Japan, West
Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.

PROBLEMS OF U.S. MANUFACTURING

Although U.S. manufacturing in general is not in a long-term decline, it has experienced serious short-term difficulties. In addition,
certain industries have serious long-term problems.
Macroeconomic Problems

In the short run, U.S. manufacturing, like other cyclically sensitive
industries such as housing, declined during the recent recession.
Manufacturing employment fell from its peak of 20.4 million in July
1981 to 18.2 million in November 1982. Manufacturing output declined by 12.5 percent over the same period. However, employment
has risen sharply since then, and stood at 19.3 million by the, end of
1983, while output rose 17.8 percent between November 1982 and
December 1983. As the recovery continues, manufacturing employment and output will also continue to grow. In any event, monetary
and fiscal policies are the appropriate tools for avoiding cyclical
problems. Industrial policy cannot hope to eliminate the effects of
the business cycle on manufacturing.
A second short-run problem is the high value of the dollar relative
to other currencies. The dollar appreciated 45 percent between 1980
and December 1983, after taking inflation into account. This increase
in the dollar's exchange value has put U.S. producers at a serious
competitive disadvantage in world markets. However, the problem is
not limited to manufacturing, but extends to agriculture and such




91

services as construction, engineering, and tourism. As Chapter 2 explains, the solution once again lies with fiscal and monetary policies.
Problems of Basic Industries

Unfortunately, industries such as autos and steel, which have been
hurt by the recession and the rise in the dollar, also face longer run
problems. Foreign competition increased in both of these industries
during the 1970s. The two oil shocks increased the U.S. demand for
small cars, much of which was met by imports. Competition from imported steel increased as shipping costs fell and as foreign steel producers cut their prices in response to excess worldwide capacity.
During this period, management decisions may have worsened the
competitive positions of these industries. U.S. auto firms let quality
control slip, and they did not respond quickly to the shift in demand
toward smaller cars. Some observers claim that steel firms were slow
to adopt new technologies. In addition, labor costs increased more
rapidly in autos and steel than in other manufacturing industries. In
1970 hourly compensation for auto and steel workers was about 30
percent higher than the average compensation in manufacturing. By
1981 the difference had grown to 70 percent for steel workers and
50 percent for auto workers. Since then, workers in both industries
have made significant wage and benefit concessions, which may or may
not be temporary.
These industries are now going through significant adjustments. If
foreign firms continue to produce goods at lower costs than U.S.
firms, then domestic output and employment in the affected industries
will fall. The only ways to reduce the cost differentials are to increase
productivity or to reduce or even reverse the growth in real wages.
Otherwise, preserving output and employment would require a continuing subsidy from consumers or taxpayers to workers and stockholders in these industries.
Regional Problems

Employment declines in manufacturing have created serious problems because of the regional concentration of job losses. In the late
1970s manufacturing employment grew by about 1 percent a year for
the country as a whole but fell in the Middle Atlantic and Great
Lakes States. The recent recession exacerbated these regional disparities. Chart 3-1 shows the uneven distribution of unemployment
in fiscal 1983. Many of the States with high unemployment depend
heavily on basic manufacturing industries for jobs.
These State unemployment rates hide a wide diversity of economic
health within a State; real trouble spots are much smaller areas. In
Ohio, for example, the unemployment rate in Columbus was half of
Youngstown's in fiscal 1983. In Indiana, the unemployment rate in
Lafayette was half the rate of Gary's.

These small pockets of real distress persist in spite of job opportunities elsewhere because of the reluctance among some workers to
move. Many unemployed workers do move, and broad regional population changes reflect these movements. One detailed study of two
depressed areas found that among people who changed jobs, onethird found new jobs outside the region. However, many unemployed
workers in depressed areas do not move. Some are tied to their communities by financial and family commitments—working spouses,
homes that are hard to sell, and children in school. Unemployment
benefits and the hope of returning to a high-wage job near home
reduce the incentives for unemployed workers to move in order to
find new jobs.
But unwillingness to move is not sufficient to cause lengthy unemployment—workers who are unwilling to move can still find work if
their local economies are healthy. As one study shows, in regions
with healthy local economies unemployed workers from declining industries are not out of work any longer than unemployed workers
from other sectors. Geographic immobility together with depressed




93

local economies is the source of the special distress associated with
the decline in specific manufacturing industries.
For people in these depressed local areas, the shift in manufacturing
employment has been difficult. But the total amount of long-term
unemployment caused by shifts in the manufacturing sector is relatively small. Workers from declining industries who suffer long-term
unemployment are only about 2 percent of the unemployed. Other,
larger groups appear to have bigger labor market problems.
Since hardships caused by economic adjustment are often regional
problems, programs to ease adjustment should be targeted regionally. Otherwise, those in need do not get enough aid or budget costs
of the program become too large. But the prospects for regionally
specific programs are dim. Federal programs to extend unemployment benefits illustrate this problem. The original intent of the Federal program was to channel benefits to States with the highest unemployment rates. Under the current Federal Supplemental Compensation program, all States get benefits regardless of their unemployment rate. Complicated clauses in the law reduce the decline in benefits when State unemployment rates fall.
The general history of regionally targeted programs is a steady expansion of eligibility rules until all States get some portion of the
program. The prospects for a good Federal adjustment program may
be limited by the same problems that would plague industrial policy
initiatives in general—possibly deserving groups would be crowded
out by their less deserving but politically powerful competitors.
IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. POLICY

There is no evidence of a general deindustrialization of the U.S.
economy. Over the long term, U.S. manufacturing has accounted for
approximately 24 percent of real output. Although manufacturing's
share of total employment has declined, the number of workers employed in manufacturing rose by nearly 5 million between 1950 and
1980, and productivity growth was higher than in the rest of the
economy. Nevertheless, the combination of a recession at home and
a strong dollar abroad caused manufacturing output and employment
to suffer. However, manufacturing output is currently rising almost
three times as fast as the rest of the economy.
This suggests that the most important contribution of Federal
policy to the strength of American manufacturing would be monetary
and fiscal policies that are consistent with long-term economic
growth and a sustainable trade balance. Such policies would not resolve all the problems of the few industries in long-term trouble. But




94

they would probably resolve most of the concerns that have led to
the calls for industrial policy.
JAPANESE INDUSTRIAL POLICY
Proponents of an industrial policy often use Japan as a model for
the United States. First, Japan has enjoyed rapid economic growth
since World War II. Second, many Japanese products compete successfully in export markets. Although Japan has had great economic
success, it is not clear that industrial policy contributed on net to this
success. Other features of the Japanese economy, such as the high
saving rate and the transfer of labor from agriculture to industry,
were undoubtedly more important. Net saving in Japan over the past
three decades has been over one-fifth of Japan's net domestic product. By contrast, net saving in the United States has averaged less
than one-tenth of net domestic product.
THE INSTRUMENTS OF JAPANESE INDUSTRIAL POLICY

The first step in formulating an industrial policy for an emerging
or declining sector of the Japanese economy is gathering information
and creating a consensus. To gather the information about potential
growth industries and the best way of developing them, the Japanese
government meets with outside experts and convenes councils of informed individuals from banks, trading firms, producing and consuming firms, universities, and trade unions as well as relevant government agencies.
The final product of the council process is either a general
"vision" urging private firms to develop a sector, or a specific plan to
produce certain goods by some future date. The detailed plans, however, are simply targets that the government officials and private
experts believe are both possible and desirable to meet. Japan's
economy is not centrally planned, nor is there much government
ownership of manufacturing firms. Although the government may
provide incentives to encourage the development of certain industries, it does not force individual firms to comply with its targets.
The incentives provided by the Japanese government have included tariffs or import quotas, special tax treatment, research subsidies,
subsidized loans, antitrust immunity, and administrative guidance.
During the early postwar period of reconstruction Japan had steep
barriers against all imports. Japan began to relax these barriers over
20 years ago. Since the mid-1970s, Japan's tariffs on manufactured
goods have been similar to those of the other major industrial nations, and today they are among the lowest of all major industrial nations, including the United States. However, Japanese tariffs are




95

markedly higher than average on some manufactured goods in which
Japanese producers are relatively uncompetitive.
Significant nontariff barriers continue to protect parts of Japan's
manufacturing sector. Standards and certification requirements
impede imports of automobiles and many other consumer durables.
Government procurement restrictions protect Japanese electronics
and computer industries. These restrictions have recently been relaxed somewhat but they remain significant obstacles to trade.
Special tax treatment, subsidized loans, and loan guarantees have
been used to stimulate emerging industries, and to ease the adjustment of declining sectors. Until recently, firms purchasing numerically controlled machine tools were eligible for depreciation schedules
more generous than those available for other equipment. Today,
computer software producers and investments in robotics receive
special tax benefits. Subsidized loans and loan guarantees also have
helped to develop the steel, computer, shipbuilding, and semiconductor industries, and have assisted firms in the aluminum and petrochemical industries in reducing capacity and employment.
The Japanese government has also encouraged the development of
certain industries by providing subsidies for applied research. The
work subsidized with tax dollars is usually only part of larger joint
research projects financed mainly by private firms. Japanese firms
have used joint research successfully in developing several important
products, including the 64K RAM chip.
Finally, firms in industries with temporary or permanent declines
in demand are sometimes allowed to form cartels to restrict output in
order to raise or maintain prices. Cartels have been formed during
cyclical downturns in some segments of the aluminum, paper, and
steel industries, and have also been used to maintain prices and
reduce capacity in declining industries, including synthetic fiber, ammonia, and urea. In these cases, the government has allowed firms to
cooperate in restricting output in exchange for promises by firms to
scrap excess capacity. Higher prices have often meant lower domestic
consumption, reduced exports, and either increases in imports or increased trade barriers.
This list of industrial policy tools may understate the role of the
Japanese government in the development of specific industries. Various government agencies review conditions in industries within their
jurisdiction in consultations with outside experts. If they see problems or opportunities, these agencies look for solutions and then try
to persuade the private sector to follow their advice. The advice may
be accompanied by promises of loans, research subsidies, or other
government aid. The total effect of the advice and the aid on private




96

investment decisions may be greater than the actual amounts of aid
would suggest.
PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES

These industrial policy tools—import barriers, special tax treatment, research subsidies, subsidized loans, and antitrust immunity—
may have been important in stimulating the growth of Japanese industries such as steel, shipbuilding, machine tools, and computers.
However, government financial aid to many of these industries—including steel and computers—is only a small fraction of the investments made by the private sector.
Subsidized lending by the Japan Development Bank, for instance,
averaged only 1.4 percent of total bank lending to the steel industry
between 1961 and 1970, and only 3.8 percent between 1971 and
1980. Japan Development Bank loans to the electrical machinery
sector, which includes computers and semiconducters, were only 0.6
and 0.8 percent of total bank lending to those industries during the
same periods. Although they may have been instrumental in encouraging private banks to invest in favored sectors, government loans
were not a large factor in the growth of these industries.
Furthermore, Japanese subsidies to encourage the development of
certain manufacturing industries have been only a small fraction of
total government subsidies to specific sectors. As seems to be the
case for all developed countries, by far the largest subsidies and the
highest trade barriers go to agriculture. Energy projects designed to
decrease Japanese reliance on imported oil, subsidies to small businesses, and Japan's government rail system also claim a large share
of subsidies. Subsidies to emerging manufacturing industries are
small by comparison with subsidies to these other sectors.
The sectoral distribution of the Japan Development Bank lending
program reflects these priorities. In 1981 about 37 percent of the
total loans of $4.9 billion was earmarked for energy projects. The
next largest shares went to urban and regional development, ocean
shipping, and "quality of life" projects such as pollution control.
About 9 percent or $441 million was allocated to the development of
technology, which encompasses the computer, electronics, and semiconductor industries. For comparison, plant and equipment investment in Japan in 1981 was about $180 billion, and electronic computer production was $6.7 billion.
Total spending for research and development in Japan as a percent
of GNP exceeds that of France, but is less than that of Germany and
the United States. Furthermore, in contrast to these countries, the
Japanese government accounts for a small share of Japan's total research and development expenditures, and provides less than 2 per-




97

cent of the funding for all research and development undertaken by
the business sector.
Government research and development funds in the late 1970s
have been estimated to account for 6.7 percent of total research and
development in the computer and semiconductor industries, versus
18 percent in agriculture and 28 percent of transportation research
and development. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry
(MITI), Japan's most important industrial policy agency, controlled
about 12 percent of public research and development funds in 1983,
or about $708 million, and allocated about one-half of these funds to
energy-related research and development. About $350 million went
to manufacturing industries.
Finally, Japanese government spending goes primarily to social
welfare, aid for local governments, and public works rather than to
develop emerging industries. In spite of its unique industrial policy
process, Japan allocates government support to many of the same
sectors that are favored in other advanced market economies, including the United States.
HAS JAPANESE INDUSTRIAL POLICY BEEN A SUCCESS?

Japanese industrial policy has had both successes and failures.
Some targeted industries, including semiconductor and machine
tools, are almost certainly stronger than they would have been without government support and can be claimed as successes for Japanese industrial policy. Other industries, such as shipbuilding and
steel, probably grew more quickly because of government aid, but
undoubtedly would have developed without any government intervention. However, the Japanese government has also picked losers.
Aluminum smelting and petrochemicals were favored industries 15
years ago, but the public and private investments have paid off very
poorly and now their capacity is being reduced. There are also several examples of successful industries that did not receive government
assistance, including motorcycles and consumer electronics. Nevertheless, these industries have dominated world trade in the products
they produce.
The Japanese automobile industry also received protection from
imports. But the auto industry followed a course very different from
that suggested by MITI. In 1961 MITI tried to force the industry's
many firms to merge into a few. In 1965 MITI exhorted the industry
to develop a prototype "people's" model of its product so MITI
could designate the winning firm as the single producer. In both
cases, the industry rebuffed MITI. Moreover, although import protection helped the Japanese auto industry develop, protection given
to other industries hurt the auto industry by raising the price of




98

inputs such as steel. Furthermore, the auto industry has not received
special tax treatment or subsidized loans for over 20 years. Therefore
the success of Japan's auto industry cannot be attributed to industrial
policy.
Furthermore, Japanese industrial policy did not create additional
investment. It simply directed the existing pool of savings from one
industry to another. It is possible that the industries that lost funds
as a result of government industrial policy would have been at least
as successful as the industries that received the government's blessing.
In conclusion, Japanese industrial policies have undoubtedly influenced Japan's industrial structure. However, the government and its
councils of experts have a mixed record of success. They have indeed
picked some industries that turned out to be winners in part because
of their efforts, but they also picked industries that ended up losers.
They failed to pick some big winners and they also picked industries
that would have become winners without any help. The net effect of
these policies on economic growth is not clear.
EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL POLICIES
European economies have grown rapidly since World War II, primarily because of high rates of saving and investment, increases in
education, and migration from agriculture to other sectors. However,
many European policies that aid specific industries have been costly
failures. Large scale efforts by European governments to promote
high-technology industries have rarely produced commercially successful products. And attempts to ease the adjustment of declining
industries have generally produced little reduction in excess capacity
despite enormous government subsidies.
EUROPEAN INDUSTRIAL POLICY TOOLS

The tools used to implement industrial policies differ considerably
among European countries. In France, the country with the most
elaborate industrial policy, state efforts to develop the economy can
be traced at least as far back as the time of Louis XIV. Since World
War II, a series of 5-year "indicative" plans has set comprehensive
targets for the French economy, often with specific sectors selected
for special support. Although these targets have been voluntary, they
have been designed as a framework for French economic growth.
The government owns a large portion of France's manufacturing
and financial sectors, and thus is able to allocate resources directly
into targeted industries, projects, or companies. Most of the capital
for several emerging industries, including civil aircraft and comput-




99

ers, has come from the government. France has also used research
and development subsidies and government procurement to encourage high-technology industries. In addition, the French government
owns, subsidizes, and protects certain declining industries, including
steel. Other declining industries, such as textiles and shipbuilding,
receive subsidies and trade protection but are privately owned.
Britain does not have comprehensive economic plans or government ownership of banks and insurance companies, but government
equity involvement in heavy and high-technology industries is
common. Steel, autos, and semiconductors have received state equity
support. In addition, many declining industries have received trade
protection, manpower training grants, and financial subsidies.
As members of the European Community (EC), all the major industrial countries of Europe have common external trade barriers,
most notably in steel and textiles. But West Germany, with its relatively efficient steel industry, has been less energetic than France or
Britain in lobbying for barriers to protect declining industries. The
West German government has provided substantial subsidies for research and development, but its subsidies for declining industries are
low by European standards. There is little public ownership of manufacturing firms, but an important share of West Germany's banking
system is state owned.
LESSONS FROM EUROPE

In spite of massive aid to favored European industries such as aircraft, computers, and semiconductors, most of the firms in these industries are not commercially successful. The explanation for this
record may stem from the competing goals that governments generally pursue.
The Concorde is probably the most famous product of European
industrial policy. Built by a British-French joint venture and flown
only by their national airlines, the Concorde had cost French taxpayers $4.4 billion by 1979. At no time have revenues covered the costs
of operating the Concorde, much less the capital costs of the firms that
built it. Work on the Concorde helped develop France's aerospace
industry and may have achieved certain political and social objectives.
But, these benefits aside, the Concorde project is a clear reminder of
the costs of government encouragement of emerging industries.
The Airbus is another large scale project that has so far been a
commercial failure. Produced by a firm owned mostly by a consortium of European governments, the Airbus has been a profitable investment for the airlines that bought it, but a costly burden for the
sponsoring governments. The Airbus still requires production subsi-




100

dies despite the sale of about 350 planes. Bolstered by government
guarantees, Airbus did not follow the usual commercial practice of
collecting purchase agreements before beginning production. As a
result, early production levels were too low to benefit from scale
economies.
The French government also decided to develop an internationally
competitive computer industry in the mid-1960s. Today, neither of
France's two recently nationalized computer companies is profitable,
in spite of over $1 billion in direct subsidies, support through government procurement programs, and research and development subsidies. Many analysts conclude that the French government pursued
an unrealistic goal of self sufficiency and ignored its competitors'
comparative advantage and market share. Business decisions were
made by the government and did not always reflect commercial realities.
Britain's computer and semiconductor industries seem similarly
unable to overcome the competitive advantage of foreign producers
in the British market, despite aid programs that include equity financing, loan guarantees, and government procurement policies.
Neither the government-owned semiconductor firm nor the computer firm most heavily supported by the government is profitable.
Once again, the appeal of technological independence outweighed
economic considerations.
Aid to declining industries also reflects the sometimes competing
goals of government intervention. Efforts to ease the adjustment of
declining industries apparently slow that adjustment process, at enormous cost to European taxpayers. It appears to be difficult for governments to encourage an industry to decline sufficiently after giving
it subsidies. Government assistance to the steel, shipbuilding, and
textile industries has been designed to protect employment while
encouraging restructuring. Despite massive infusions of aid and trade
protection over a long period, there is still much excess capacity in the
steel and shipbuilding industries.
Since the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951, steel has been the most closely regulated and protected
industrial sector in Europe. After years of import protection, subsidies, and output controls designed to raise prices, many European
steel producers continue to sustain large losses. Although steel employment in the United Kingdom fell by almost 60 percent between
1974 and 1982, and has also declined in other EC countries, substantial restructuring remains to be done.
Restructuring of the European textile industry has also not been
generally successful according to most analysts. Even when progress
has been made in reducing excess capacity and modernizing equip-




101

ment, trade barriers have remained in place. Indeed, from bilateral
quotas on cotton in the early 1960s to the current form of the Multifiber Arrangement, protection from imports has increased in scope
and intensity.
European governments may be learning from their failures. The
current French policy in electronics seems to be more competitively
oriented than earlier policies, and since 1981 the British government
has cut subsidies to declining industries. However, the French commitment to early development of a new commercial airplane suggests
a continued belief that government can outguess the market.
SHOULD THE UNITED STATES HAVE AN INDUSTRIAL
POLICY?
The perception that the United States is deindustrializing has
spurred interest in industrial policy in this country. But we are not
deindustrializing. Moreover, Japan's record with industrial policy is
mixed, and industrial policy in Europe has generally failed. Industryspecific measures are not well suited to deal with the special problems of some U.S. industries and workers. Unemployment problems in
declining industries are best solved with programs that focus aid on
individuals rather than on entire industries. Allocating resources to
different industries is best done by the market. Profit opportunities
and wage differentials give investors and workers powerful incentives
to seek out industries where their capital and labor are most valued
and most productive.
Nevertheless, some people argue that industrial policy could promote growth and smooth adjustment. Many claim that government
now fails to take account of the effects on industries of its various
policies, and that better coordination within the government would
improve the situation. Others claim that investors are reluctant to finance emerging industries because the time horizons of private investors are too short. These advocates therefore propose government
aid to help emerging industries. Still others argue that government
aid is needed for industries with learning curves, high value-added
industries, linkage industries, and industries that compete with products subsidized by foreign governments. Finally, some industrial
policy advocates argue that special aid should be given to declining
industries to help them adjust.
COORDINATING AGENCIES AND TRIPARTITE COUNCILS

Industrial policy advocates argue that current Federal Government
programs often conflict with each other. Creating a new agency and
establishing tripartite councils of business, labor, and government,




102

they say, would bring these conflicts to the attention of government
officials who would then make more judicious tradeoffs among competing goals.
Different government programs sometimes do have conflicting effects on an industry. Unintended consequences are inevitable in a
complex economy where each policy affects a large number of sectors. More important, many policies have conflicting effects because
governments have competing goals. Reducing air pollution, for example, raises the cost of producing steel and conflicts with the goal
of a more competitive steel industry.
There is little reason to believe that introducing another agency
would improve coordination. Government agencies and forums already exist to coordinate policies, and many government departments already have advisory committees to provide information on
private sector views. Additional tripartite councils and a new agency
would not necessarily be able to obtain better information than what
is already available.
Tripartite councils are proposed to promote a consensus on policy
decisions. This would strengthen the current tendency of government policy to take inadequate account of the interests of consumers
and taxpayers, who have very weak incentives to organize on any particular issue. Business and labor groups are already heavily represented in Washington. An additional agency with stronger representation
of business and labor interests would make the policy debate even
more one-sided.
GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT BANK

Many industrial policy proponents propose a government development bank to augment private investment in certain industries. Some
proposals include other types of aid, such as research and development subsidies to specific industries. These proponents claim that
government support is necessary because the market does not invest
enough in several types of industries—emerging industries, industries
with learning curves, high value-added industries, basic or "linkage"
industries, and industries that have been targeted by foreign governments. To supplement private capital, the proposed bank would lend
additional money to industries in these categories.
Emerging Industries

Government investment in emerging industries is said to be desirable because private investors are too risk averse or have time horizons that are too short. Therefore they invest too little in risky ventures with long-delayed payoffs.
Investors may appear shortsighted or risk averse when they cannot
capture all the returns from their investments. For example, patent




103

and copyright protection for computer software and integrated circuits is probably inadequate and may have deterred investors from
taking risks and investing their time and money in these areas. More
generally, research and development gains are often spread among
many firms, not just the firm that incurs the costs.
The solution to these problems is not government investment in
specific firms, but policy changes that improve incentives for all firms
to invest in research and development. The Administration supports
the provision of copyright-like protection for integrated circuit designs, and in 1981 supported enactment of a temporary tax credit for
research and development expenditures.
The proposal to target emerging industries suggests that government can obtain better information than the private sector. It is difficult to understand how government officials, together with private
business and labor leaders, will be able to gather more accurate information and use the information more wisely than the private
sector. The United States has numerous investors willing to finance
new ventures through equity or bank loans. Private investment analysts spend a great deal of time and effort evaluating new technologies and advising private investors on the most promising firms. Information on emerging industries is also exchanged by job shifting
among scientists and engineers who are close to the development of
new technologies. Ties between industry and the academic community also contribute to the spread of new ideas. In the United States
the private sector already has information at least as good as the proposed government councils and banks could expect to gather.
In any event, a government agency is more likely to be shortsighted and risk averse than private investors. Since politicians face frequent elections, they often have very short time horizons. A government agency is also more likely to make decisions based on the
shared expectations that are the conventional wisdom of the time;
these processes tend to neglect or reject the idiosyncratic information
that is the basis for decisions by the most successful private entrepreneurs.
Finally, government officials will often make investments based on
politics rather than economics. One country tries to develop a computer industry before it has sufficient technical workers. Other countries invest in highly visible but wasteful energy projects that private
firms think are likely to fail.
Learning Curves

In some high-technology industries, production costs drop significantly as firms gain experience. Some proponents of industrial policy
say that the government should subsidize these industries or protect
them from foreign competition to allow them to move down a




104

"learning curve." This would presumably speed up the drop in costs
and increase their ability to compete in international markets.
Learning curves may exist for individual firms, for entire industries
within a country, or for an industry in the world as a whole. If the
learning curve is at the level of the firm, the U.S. market is likely to
be far larger than the cumulative production required to advance an
individual firm along its learning curve. Moreover, choosing a single
firm to subsidize and protect in the beginning stages of a new technological development would be very risky. In every new industry
there are false starts. Having government and private experts determine the best approach to a technical problem early in the process
will generally produce a worse result than letting different firms compete to see whose idea is best.
If the learning curve is for the entire world, then the optimal strategy may be to let other countries go first and enter the industry only
after initial research and development costs have been borne by foreigners. The Japanese have profited enormously by adopting U.S.
technology.
While there may be special cases in which learning curves justify
import protection, identifying them in practice would be very difficult.
Because of this difficulty, many firms and industries would incorrectly
claim that their learning curves justify import protection or subsidies.
A similar problem arises in the Federal procurement process. Firms
sometimes claim to have steep learning curves in order to justify
becoming the only supplier to the government. Often, actual learning
curves are flatter than predicted.
In short, knowing that a theoretical case exists may be of little
practical importance. The end result of protecting or subsidizing a
high-technology industry could be a domestic industry unable to
compete in international markets. The trade protection granted to
such industries could force U.S. buyers to pay higher prices and
erode their competitive position in other markets.
Industries With High Value Added

Some proponents of industrial policy advocate redirecting investment to industries with high value added per worker. Value added is
the revenue earned above that needed to purchase inputs from other
industries. Value added is therefore the return to labor, capital, and
know-how.
Total value added or, equivalently, real income in the economy is
raised when a dollar of investment is moved from a use where its
productivity is low to a use where productivity is higher. There is no
reason, however, to believe that a dollar of investment in an industry
with high value added per worker will be more productive than a
dollar of investment in a low value added industry. What matters is




105

not the average productivity of labor or capital in that industry but
the return on one more unit of capital. When markets work properly,
investment is distributed among industries until the rate of return on
additional investment is the same in all industries. In this situation,
shifting investment from one industry to another will not raise total
real income or value added.
The same is true of reallocating labor among industries. Although
the average productivity and value added per worker differ among industries, a well-functioning labor market assures that employees will
end up in industries where their contribution to output is highest. If
this were not so, the employee would have an incentive to shift jobs in
pursuit of a position with a higher wage.
The best way to promote high value-added industries is to expand
the total capital stock of the economy. Investors will naturally seek to
put that capital to its most productive use. If our tax laws distort the
relative payoffs from investing in different uses, then it is the tax laws
that need to be changed. Incentives to save and invest, such as Individual Retirement Accounts and accelerated cost recovery, are more
likely to expand and modernize the Nation's capital stock, and thereby promote economic growth, than a government bank that merely
reallocates a fixed amount of savings from one industry to another.
Linkage Industries

Some industrial policy proponents advocate government aid to
"linkage" industries, that is, manufacturing industries whose output
is a vital input into other industries' products. Steel and semiconductors are often cited as examples of "linkage" industries. However, if
such an industry is vital, then the industries that rely on it will
demand its output. The profit motive will ensure that this demand
will be filled. If the demand can be met more cheaply by producers
abroad, then it makes good economic sense for the firms that use the
input to buy it abroad. The more uses the input has, the more important it is for the U.S. economy that the companies obtain this vital
input at the lowest possible cost. Otherwise, the competitive position
of the U.S. companies that use the input would be threatened.
Proponents of aid to linkage industries may have another idea in
mind. They might be saying that producers of a particular good need
to have producers of inputs nearby so that they can coordinate their
plans. There do appear to be examples of industries that grew because they were near producers of vital inputs and therefore able to
coordinate plans. Some observers have attributed part of the success
of the U.S. personal computer industry to its location in the Silicon
Valley, near the semiconductor industry. But if the advantages of locating nearby outweigh the disadvantages, companies will do so. Just
as steel plants located close to coal mines earlier in this century, so




106

computer producers have located near semiconductor firms in the
Silicon Valley. No government direction is needed.
Industries Targeted by Foreign Governments

Some industrial policy proponents also argue that the United
States should subsidize industries targeted by foreign governments.
If we do not, they claim, our industrial structure will be determined
by other countries. A foreign subsidy that reduces the price of U.S.
products clearly distorts the market, but a policy of countersubsidy
by the United States would further depress prices and the return on
capital. A general policy of countersubsidy would lead to increasing
misallocation of capital and labor and lower economic growth.
Our present trade laws authorize countervailing duties on subsidized foreign products sold in the United States. In addition, selective subsidy of export financing may deter foreign export subsidies.
The Export-Import Bank of the United States provides loans, loan
guarantees, and export credit insurance for U.S. exports to counter
foreign export subsidies. The Administration has been successful in
the past 2 years in sharply reducing the export credit subsidies of
other countries.
Some observers think that certain foreign industrial policies are responses to what they perceive as a U.S. industrial policy. They point
to the stimulus provided by defense spending to our computer, aircraft, and nuclear reactor industries, and observe that our space program has made the United States the world leader in commercial
telecommunications satellites. It is certainly true that the billions of
dollars spent by the United States since World War II to develop
new weapons and explore space have given a fortunate boost to
some high-technology industries. However, the primary purpose of
this spending has been to protect the United States and its allies and
to pursue space science. If the main reason for this spending had
been to develop commercial computer, civil aircraft, or satellite industries, our defense and space programs would certainly not have
been the least expensive way of doing so.
AID FOR DECLINING INDUSTRIES

Most industrial policy proponents recommend government action
to slow or reverse declines in "basic" industries. In addition to loans
and special tax treatment, many proposals include government-sponsored restructuring plans that would spread adjustment burdens
among labor, management, shareholders, suppliers, and creditors. In
declining industries that face competition from imports, industry
commitments to restructure would be extracted in exchange for trade
protection, while expanded compensation and retraining programs
would be used to help workers whose jobs are lost.




107

A basic problem with such proposals is that they would divert resources from emerging industries and from healthy established firms.
Workers, stockholders, and suppliers in declining industries would
exert political pressure to gain government aid. Experience here and
abroad strongly suggests that resisting the pressure from declining
industries would be difficult.
Aid to Firms

Proponents of aid to declining industries often cite Chrysler as an
example of a company that has survived because of a government
loan guarantee tied to a restructuring plan. But the Chrysler case
should not be used as a model for several reasons. First, Chrysler
might have survived even if it had gone bankrupt. The concessions
extracted from workers, suppliers, and creditors in return for the
loan guarantee might well have been made as part of an ordinary
bankruptcy proceeding. Second, even if government aid were required to keep Chrysler in business, the auto industry and the economy as a whole may have derived little benefit from the guarantee.
Many of the autos produced and jobs saved at Chrysler were at the
expense of other U.S. automakers and their employees. Similarly, the
loans that went to Chrysler would have gone to other sectors, possibly including emerging industries.
Third, loan guarantees to Chrysler may have been successful because such guarantees to failing companies are now the exception,
not the rule. If loan guarantees became standard practice in such situations, workers, management, creditors, and suppliers might be less
willing to make sacrifices. They might come to expect government
aid whatever they did. Establishing a loan guarantee program would
certainly encourage many other firms to apply for aid, and could lead
to even more costly Federal commitments to firms that did not pull
through after the first round of aid. This has been the common European experience, and it could well happen here.
Import Protection and Restructuring

Some observers suggest that trade protection be granted to industries hurt by imports in exchange for commitments to restructure and
adjust. Without such commitments, trade protection reduces the
pressure on firms and workers to make painful changes. Under existing trade law, import protection is granted with no guarantees that
the workers and firms who benefit from the import protection will
make the necessary investments or take other measures to become
more competitive. The result is higher prices for consumers, often with
little long-term improvement in the industry. The protected industry
seldom becomes competitive and usually continues to pressure government for more protection.




108

Strictly enforced agreements, it is argued, could encourage workers
and firms to use the financial benefits of temporary protection either
to become more competitive or to scale down production. The current practice of granting import protection often has the opposite
effect. It forces consumers to pay higher prices without requiring the
industry to undergo difficult adjustments.
The main objection to this proposal is that once the presumption of
aid is established, it is difficult to extract concessions from an industry.
How often will government officials in this country be able to tell
workers that they must accept lower pay, suppliers that they must cut
their prices, and banks that they must write off loans in order to obtain
import protection? Political pressure as well as economic considerations would undoubtedly influence the process.
In addition, an agreement to grant trade restraint in exchange for
restructuring by an entire industry would be more difficult to enforce
than a loan agreement with one firm. Should the government
expect efficient firms as well as inefficient firms to make the same
sacrifice? How would conflict between different segments of an industry be resolved? How would the agreement be enforced if some
firms complied and others did not?
Aid to Workers

Industrial policy proponents who want to aid declining industries
are motivated in part by concern for the workers in these industries.
They often argue that manufacturing provides "good" jobs that
cannot be replaced by jobs in other sectors of the economy. In fact,
basic manufacturing jobs are no more important for the economy as
a whole than jobs in, say, the service sector. The real difference between manufacturing jobs and service sector jobs is that the former
often pay more than the latter because of differences in worker skills,
or in some cases, because of the monopoly power of the manufacturing firm or of its union.
CONCLUSION
Many people advocate industrial policy as a way of stemming the
alleged long-term decline in the U.S. manufacturing sector. But there
has been no such long-term decline. Manufacturing's share of national output in 1980 was virtually the same as its share in 1950. Moreover, since 1973 the U.S. manufacturing sector has grown more rapidly than the manufacturing sectors of many of the major European
industrial nations. And while our growth of manufacturing since 1973
has been less than Japan's, the difference in the U.S. and Japanese
growth rates is less than half of what it was between 1960 and 1973.




109

While there was a short-run decline in U.S. manufacturing due to
the recent recession, this was to be expected. Manufacturing is cyclically very sensitive, and our experience in the most recent recession
was similar to our experience in earlier postwar recessions. Since the
recovery began in the last quarter of 1982, manufacturing output has
increased at almost three times the rate of total output. The answer
to the short-run problems of most of our manufacturing industries is
economic recovery.
A few industries, however, may be in long-term decline, in part because they face foreign competition. The problems of these industries stem partly from past mistakes by management, partly from
wage increases that exceeded productivity gains, and partly from factors outside the industries' control. If these industries do not continue to make significant adjustments, either they will suffer additional
declines in output and employment, or they will require permanent
trade protection or subsidies at substantial cost to American consumers and taxpayers.
Using industrial policy to solve the problems of these few industries would be mistaken for two main reasons. First, industrial policy,
in the form of either subsidies or trade protection in return for industry restructuring, would slow adjustment. Once the government
helped these industries, it would find it very difficult to cut off or
even phase out the aid, as various European governments' experiences with declining industries have shown.
Second, if the goal of industrial policy is to help the long-term unemployed, then helping declining industries is not an effective way of
doing so. In healthy local economies, unemployed workers from declining industries find jobs as quickly as unemployed workers from
other industries. Depressed local economies, not declining industries,
are the real problem. The solution to the problem of the unemployed from declining industries is to enable them to find new jobs
and to focus aid on those workers who are hurt by industrial change,
as the Job Training and Partnership Act of 1982 is intended to do.
While some people advocate industrial policy to stem the alleged
decline in U.S. manufacturing, others see it as a way of nurturing
emerging industries, or industrial "winners." Some of these advocates argue that entrepreneurs in the United States have too much
difficulty getting "patient" capital, that is, capital whose owners or
lenders are willing to invest in a risky idea and to wait a few years for
their returns. These advocates therefore want the government to give
subsidies or subsidized loans to entrepreneurs with new ideas.
But to the extent the United States underinvests in new ideas, it is
because the investors cannot capture the returns from such investments. The straightforward solution to this problem, if it is general,




110

is to increase tax incentives to research and development, as this Administration did with the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act. If the
problem is specific to a few industries, the solution is to strengthen
patent and copyright protection.
Moreover, even if there were too little "patient" capital, there is no
reason to think that government finance would improve the allocation of capital. Government officials simply do not have the right incentives to make wise choices about which industries or companies to
invest in. Governments often invest in projects with high political
value but little economic value, or in safe projects favored by the
conventional wisdom of the time. Neither way of choosing is likely to
pick the potentially winning industries that lack capital and both kinds
of investments siphon off capital that could have gone to the real
winners.
To foster more rapid economic growth, the primary focus of government policy should be to strengthen the natural forces of the private economy by reducing the burdens and disincentives imposed by
existing government laws. The most important goal of these changes
should be to increase the rate of capital formation. A higher rate of
capital formation fosters growth directly and permits a more rapid introduction of new technologies. The lower cost of capital and the
faster technological advance also enhance the competitiveness of
American industrial products in world markets.
To increase the rate of capital formation, the tax laws were reformed in 1981 in ways that reduced the burden of taxation on personal saving and on business investment in plant and equipment.
The sharp decline in the rate of inflation since 1980 has also raised
real after-tax rates of return and thereby increased the incentives to
save and invest. As we look to the future, it is important to raise the
Nation's rate of saving by reducing the government budget deficits.
We must also seek new ways to revise the tax laws in order to reduce
the disincentives that still restrict the rate of capital formation.
Our market economy and its system of rewards for superior performance have made the American economy the most productive and
innovative in the world. An industrial policy that increases government planning, government subsidies and international protectionism
would only be a burden on our economic life and a threat to our
long-term economic prosperity.

CHAPTER 4

Food and Agriculture
AMERICAN AGRICULTURE is one of the most successful examples of agricultural development in the world. The industry is very
productive: only 3.1 percent of the civilian labor force produces
enough to feed the entire domestic population at low cost and still
export enough to earn almost 20 percent of the total export revenue
of the United States. Although farmers in most countries earn much
lower incomes than nonfarm workers, the average disposable income
of the U.S. farm population over the past decade has averaged close
to that of workers in the rest of the economy. Average wealth per
farmer is much higher than of people employed in the rest of the
economy, and half of American farmers have no debt.
Despite these successes, all is not well with American agriculture.
Farm export earnings and asset values have declined for the past 2
years. Recent entrants and farmers who have recently expanded their
businesses have experienced cash flow difficulties. Although the farm
bankruptcy rate is well below that for nonfarm businesses, the
number of farm bankruptcies has substantially increased. The fraction of the farm population with incomes below the poverty level is
still almost double that for the nonfarm population.
In fiscal 1983, Federal Government outlays for farm price and
income support programs totaled $18.9 billion, an increase of $12.3
billion in 2 years. To this must be added another $9.4 billion worth
of payment-in-kind (PIK) commodities committed in 1983 to compensate farmers for reducing their crop acreage in order to reduce
inventories These programs cost taxpayers almost $12,000 per farm.
While Federal expenditures have been curtailed in many domestic
program areas, the cost of farm programs has exploded.
Farm programs affect not only the taxpayer but also the consumer.
Some farm policies clearly benefit the consumer. In particular, federally sponsored research has lowered food costs by generating a
steady increase in agricultural productivity. Other policies artificially
raise food prices through price supports and restrictive marketing
and trade practices. This reduces consumers' purchasing power.
The present Federal farm programs were designed to address the
problems of farming as it existed in the 1930s, but American agricul-




112

ture has changed dramatically since then. Farming has become a
much more specialized, capital-intensive, and high-technology business. Many people justify farm income and price support programs
on the basis of low farm incomes. But average farm family incomes
of the commercial producers, to whom most benefits of the Federal
programs go, are above income levels in the rest of the economy.
Net farm incomes, however, vary substantially from year to year.
Exports now account for one-quarter of all farm sales. Yet present
price support programs, along with the strong dollar, make U.S. agricultural products less competitive on world markets. If we value the
foreign exchange earnings generated by farm exports and the market
this provides for a quarter of the Nation's farm sales, our farm
price and income support policies must become more market oriented than they are now.
THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
In 1982 the farm sector employed 3.1 percent of the U.S. civilian
labor force and generated 2.4 percent of national income. In 1930,
for comparison, 22 percent of the labor force was employed in farming and produced 9 percent of national income. With this shift have
come increases in employment and income in industries producing
goods and services purchased by farmers and processing farm products. Farmers now spend almost half of their gross income on inputs,
such as seed, feed, pesticides, fuel, and fertilizers, 58 percent of
which is produced in the nonfarm sector. After the products leave
the farm, for every dollar's worth of sales destined for domestic consumption, processing, packaging, transportation, and other services
add another $2 before it reaches the retail purchaser.
FARM INCOME

In 1983 farm cash receipts from product sales totaled about $144
billion (Table 4-1). This includes the net purchases by the government to support the prices farmers received for grains, cotton, tobacco, and milk. For example, to support the price of milk the government purchased $2.7 billion worth of dairy products. American farmers also received direct government payments in cash and in kind totaling about $9 billion. These total less than the fiscal 1983 budget
authority for price and income support programs because part of
those outlays occurred in the fourth quarter of 1982 and because
farmers will take delivery of over half of their PIK commodities in
1984. The PIK program was designed to reduce the stocks that had
accumulated following 2 years of bumper crops and weak demand,




113

particularly from exports. The acreage cutbacks, plus the severe
drought of 1983, reduced grain and cotton inventories by $9 billion.
Gross income of the farm sector totaled $159 billion. Production
expenses, which dropped substantially from 1982 because of reduced
plantings, came to $136 billion. This left net farm income of $23 billion, up marginally from 1982. Net cash income, which excludes nonmoney income, the value of inventory change, depreciation, and perquisites to hired labor, reached a record high of $43 billion in 1983.
In addition, farmers earned $41 billion of income from nonfarm
sources.

As officially defined, a farm is a place that sells at least $1,000
worth of agricultural products per year. So defined, there are 2.4 million farms, which in 1982 had an average net income from farming of
$9,188 and an average income from nonfarm sources of $16,430, for
a total $25,618. The average family income for the whole population
that year was $27,391.
More than one-third of the 2.4 million farms sell less than $5,000
worth of products per year, and 71 percent sell less than $40,000.
These smaller farms are not generally full-time commercial operations, produce only a small share of national farm production, and,
on average, have negative net income from farming.
The 29 percent of the farms with annual sales of more than
$40,000 generate 87 percent of total farm receipts. In 1982 these
690,000 commercial farms had average annual gross receipts of
about $190,000 and net farm income of about $36,000. Their net




114

farm income, however, varies substantially from year to year. These
farms have average assets of about $1 million and average equity of
about $800,000. This group received 78 percent of all direct government payments under farm programs in 1982. This accounted for 11
percent of their net farm income. These averages mask considerable
diversity. For example, the largest 1 percent of all farms, which have
annual sales of over $500,000, produce 30 percent of all farm sales.
SPECIAL CHARACTER OF FARMING

The commercial farm, like the small manufacturer, is a business
that buys raw materials, transforms them through a capital-intensive
process, and sells the finished products.
How then does a modern commercial farm differ from a small
manufacturing company? Its most distinguishing characteristic is a
biological production process that involves lags arising from growth
cycles. This severely constrains the speed with which farmers can respond to changing market conditions. In addition, the volume of
farm production is less predictable than in the nonfarm economy because of the random effects of weather, disease, insects, and genetics.
These supply conditions contribute to substantial year-to-year variability in farm incomes. Since the annual output of major field crops
is harvested within a few weeks in the autumn, this requires storage
capacity for most of a year's output.
Agriculture and manufacturing also differ in the role played by
land. Because crop production and livestock grazing are land based,
they have to be dispersed over a wide geographic expanse from
which the marketing system must assemble the production. The geographic differences in climate and soil limit what products can be
produced in each location.
Land has characteristics that distinguish it from other inputs. As
the demand for land increases, users must bid against a relatively
fixed supply. They bid on the basis of expected future returns to the
use of that land. The price of farm land increases in response to expectations of higher returns—whether from strong demand for what
it can grow, from inflationary expectations, or from artificial price enhancement associated with government policy. Appreciation of land
prices tends to increase the wealth of its owners, and often represents a significant fraction of an owner-operator's total returns. It
also raises the entry cost for new farmers. Physical capital, being reproducible, tends not to appreciate over time in this manner, but
rather to depreciate.
A third way in which farms differ from manufacturing plants is in
the proportions in which they use labor and capital. Most farms are
family owned and operated, with little hired labor. (Only 0.2 percent




115

are owned by nonfamily corporations.) In 1979 American agriculture
used $43,000 of physical capital stock (machinery and buildings) per
worker, compared with $21,500 for the economy as a whole. Farming
used three times as much physical capital per unit of production
(GNP basis) as the average for the total U.S. economy. In both agriculture and the rest of the economy, this capital stock tends to be
quite specialized, although machinery used to produce field crops has
multiple uses.
FIVE DECADES OF CHANGE

In the 20th century the structure of U.S. agriculture and the wellbeing of farmers have undergone profound change. Farm production
has tripled, while employment in agriculture has fallen by 80 percent
(Table 4-2). The increase in labor productivity and, in turn, farm
family income was achieved by improving technology and by increasing the land and capital used per worker. As a result, employment in
farming fell substantially.
In the 1930s disposable farm family income per capita was less
than 40 percent of that in the rest of the economy. Over the past
decade, however, farm family income has averaged 88 percent of that
in the rest of the economy and exceeded that in the nonfarm sector
in 1973. This income differential was the driving force behind the
structural change in agriculture. As the proportion of the labor force
employed in agriculture fell and the proportion employed in higher
productivity nonfarm employment rose, migration contributed to national economic growth.
The rate of migration from farming to the rest of the economy was
strongly motivated by the income differential. As the differential narrowed in the 1970s, the rate of migration slowed. The rate has also
been sensitive to the nonfarm unemployment rate—slowing when the
perceived chances of getting a nonfarm job were low and accelerating when the unemployment rate fell.
Rural industrialization has increased the number of off-farm jobs in
rural America. Most farmers who did not acquire more land and capital have become part-time farmers; almost two-thirds of all farm
family income now comes from nonfarm sources. This additional
farm family income has reduced significantly the farm-nonfarm
income differential.
The number of farms and the farm labor force peaked during the
1930s. Employment in farming went into a pronounced decline after
World War II, when a major technological revolution occurred in agriculture. The replacement of draft animals by the tractor, which had
begun in the 1930s, was virtually completed by 1960. This released




116

about one-fifth of our cropland, which had been used to grow feed
for draft animals.
The increased mechanization of farming permitted the amount of
land cultivated per farm worker to increase five-fold from 1930 to
1980. The amount of capital used per worker increased more than 15
times in this period. As Chart 4-1 shows, total farm production grew
140 percent, but total input use rose only 5 percent. Total productivity (production per unit of total inputs) more than doubled because
of adoption of agricultural research results such as hybrid seeds and
improved livestock feeding. Table 4-2 illustrates that use of both agricultural chemicals and feed grew very rapidly in the postwar period.
Agricultural production now relies heavily on the nonfarm sector for
machinery, fuel, fertilizer, and other chemicals. These, not more land
or labor, produced the growth in farm production. These changes
have also greatly increased the capital investment necessary to enter
farming; they have also generated new requirements for operating
credit during the growing cycle.
Education has been an important stimulus to growth in the economy as a whole and agriculture in particular. Rural education facilitated the move from farm to off-farm jobs. As the rate of technological
change accelerated, rural education also helped farmers to adopt new
technology and adjust to technological change.
The farm sector has undergone a major shift in what it produces.
Total farm production is now split about equally between crops and
livestock, as it was early in the century. The composition of each,
however, has changed in response to changes in demand and in technology. In value terms, the largest increases have been in beef cattle
and oilseeds production and to a lesser extent in feed grains and
poultry. The proportions of cotton, hogs, eggs, sheep, lambs, and
wool in farm output have fallen.
The two largest components of farm cash receipts today are beef
cattle and dairy products, making up 21 and 13 percent, respectively,
of the total. These are followed by corn and soybeans with 9 percent
each, and hogs and wheat with 7 percent each. Cotton, chickens,
greenhouse products, eggs, and tobacco each contribute about 3 percent of the total.
DEMAND FOR FARM PRODUCTS

Changes in demand have been an important factor underlying the
changes in the product mix of the farm sector. In 1982 the total
value of farm marketings was $144.6 billion, with $70.2 billion from
livestock production and $74.4 billion from crops. The largest
market for crops is domestic human consumption, which absorbed 43
percent of the value of crop sales. The second largest component of

demand is exports (31 percent) followed by livestock feeding (16 percent). The remaining 10 percent goes to industrial use and seed.
Within the crop sector there is great variation among these proportions. For example, most fruit and vegetable output goes for human
consumption, while virtually all of the tobacco and cotton is for domestic industrial use or exports. Most of the livestock production
goes to feed the domestic population, while by-products such as
hides and animal fats go to industry or exports.
Domestic Consumption

In 1982 Americans spent $350 billion for food (excluding alcoholic
beverages), of which $255 billion was for consumption at home and
$95 billion for eating away from home. On the average this represents 16 percent of their disposable personal income, although the
poor spend a larger percentage of their income on food than do the
more affluent. Of the total retail expenditures for domestically produced food, consumers spent 29 percent for meats, 21 percent for
fruits and vegetables, 15 percent for dairy products, 10 percent for
bakery products, 7 percent for poultry and eggs, and the remaining
18 percent for miscellaneous food items.
Eighty-five percent of retail food expenditure originates from domestic farm production, and 15 percent is from imported foods.
About one-third of our agricultural imports are products that we
cannot produce in a temperate climate, in particular, coffee, tea,
cocoa, spices, and bananas. Other imported goods that are produced
domestically, although perhaps less efficiently, include sugar, dairy
products, grass-fed beef, and some fruits, vegetables, edible oils, and
beverages. In 1982, agricultural imports totaled $16.9 billion, making
the United States the world's third largest agricultural importer, after
the European Community (EC) and the U.S.S.R.
Food consumption per capita appears to have reached saturation
levels in the United States, with most growth in aggregate consumption now coming from population growth. Total consumption (by
weight) per person of foods other than beverages (coffee, tea, and
soft drinks) has changed little since 1910. However, there have been
major changes in what products are consumed. In the 20th century,
direct consumption of grain products has fallen by more than half,
while use of fats and oils more than doubled. Consumption of meat,
poultry, fish, and sweeteners has risen sharply; consumption of dairy
products and eggs first rose and then fell. Nonalcoholic beverage
consumption has almost doubled since 1910.
Aggregate food purchases tend to be less sensitive to changes in
price and in family income than are purchases of manufactured
goods. However, within their food budgets, consumers select from
among many choices in food items. Purchases of meats and of miscellaneous foods are quite sensitive to changes in family income, while




119

consumption of fruits and vegetables and particularly of cereals and
bakery products are quite insensitive. Consumption of the more
income-sensitive products, such as meats, tends to be more cyclical.
As family income increases, people tend to purchase relatively
more services in the food they buy, including eating out more often.
The share of the retail food dollar received by the farmer, therefore,
has declined to about 28 percent. Labor, packaging, and transport
account for much of the additional cost after products leave the farm.
As a result, retail prices, particularly of bakery and cereal products,
tend to adjust much less than proportionately to changes in farm
prices.
Livestock consume about 16 percent of U.S. crop sales. This includes corn and other grains, protein meal, by-products from milling
grains, and forage. This understates the feed use of farm output,
however. For example, 35-40 percent of corn production is fed to
livestock on the same farm where it is produced. The demand for
feed is derived from consumers' demand for livestock and poultry
products. Forces that alter the demand for meat, in particular
income, are reflected in the demand for livestock feeds. Therefore,
feed demand tends to have a stronger cyclical response to the level
of economic activity than does consumer demand for cereal products.
Livestock feed demand for crop output also tends to be more responsive to price changes than does consumer demand for the final
products. An increase in feed prices that turns the profit margin on
livestock feeding negative can trigger a substantial slaughter of livestock. In the short run, consumers benefit from cheaper meat at the
supermarket. However, to rebuild their herds, farmers must later
withhold animals from slaughter for breeding. This rebuilding takes
time, during which meat supplies are reduced and retail prices tend
to be higher than normal. The use of crops in livestock feeding, then,
varies cyclically with herd size. In a sense, the livestock herd functions as a buffer stock of grains. In times of crop shortfall, high grain
prices trigger a herd liquidation, thereby freeing up grain for more
direct human consumption or exports.
The smallest component of domestic crop demand is industrial
uses. Tobacco and fibers, such as cotton and wool, are industrial raw
materials. There are also industrial uses of cereals, such as in alcohol
and starch production. Many livestock by-products, such as hides and
animal fats, are also industrial raw materials. Part of this industrial
demand is satisfied by imports, including rubber, wool, and other
fibers. Because there are many synthetic substitutes, industrial
demand for farm products tends to be quite sensitive to price changes.




120

Farm Exports

The United States supplies almost 20 percent of world agricultural
trade and is the world's largest agricultural exporter. In recent years
we have supplied half of the world soybean and product shipments,
55 percent of the coarse grain, 40 to 45 percent of the wheat, 30 percent of the cotton, and 25 percent of the rice that move in world
trade.
In fiscal 1983 agricultural exports of $34.8 billion represented
about one-quarter of U.S. farm sales revenue and the output of about
35 percent of the harvested cropland. Half of U.S. farm exports are
for direct food use—wheat, rice, fruits, vegetables, and meats—while
more than a third go for feed and other farm uses; the remainder are
raw materials used in industrial processes, such as textile, cigarette,
and shoe production. In 1983 we exported three-fifths of our wheat,
two-fifths of our rice, soybeans, and cotton, one-third of our tobacco,
and one-fourth of our corn and sorghum. In contrast, only 2 percent
of U.S. meat production and 5 percent of fruit and vegetable output
are exported.
During the 1970s the value of U.S. farm exports increased more
than five-fold, and the percentage of farm receipts coming from exports increased from less than 15 percent to almost 30 percent. This
growth in farm exports represented a major internationalization of
American agriculture. Chart 4-2 provides a historical perspective to
illustrate that after several decades of reduced importance, U.S. farm
exports recovered in 1980 the share they represented in farm marketings 60 years earlier. U.S. farm exports were relatively strong
during World War I and its aftermath. As European agriculture recovered after the war, grain exports fell and U.S. agriculture went
into depression in 1921. World trade in farm products shrank further
as protectionism grew during the 1920s and the Great Depression.
U.S. farm exports fell from 22 percent of farm sales revenue in 1922
to 6 percent in 1940. Because U.S. agriculture had a larger export
exposure than the manufacturing sector, the collapse of world trade
tended to have a relatively greater effect on farm than nonfarm incomes during the Depression.
In the 1920s and 1930s more than half of farm exports were industrial raw materials, mainly cotton, tobacco, hides, and tallow. Since
World War II, food, rather than industrial raw materials, has dominated our farm exports. In the 1960s, as economic growth occurred,
consumption of livestock products grew in the industrialized countries and in some developing countries. This was reinforced by a
major technological change in livestock feeding practices, which dramatically increased demand for feed grains and high protein feeds.

World War II, which substantially increased the profitability and use
of fertilizer, greatly expanded corn output and depressed its price.
Corn Belt and Mississippi Delta farmers discovered that the soybean,
a novelty crop before World War II, did well in their regions. With
the postwar productivity growth, production capacity grew faster than
domestic consumption, expanding U.S. agriculture's export potential.
Corn and soybean products, in particular, became high-growth exports.
During the 1970s the volume of world agricultural trade grew 45
percent, while global farm production grew only 24 percent. In the
1960s and 1970s, world trade in feed grains, soybeans, high protein
feeds, and vegetable oils grew fastest. Sugar, food grains, tropical




122

beverages, and cotton experienced low rates of growth, and meat was
intermediate. Trade in other fibers declined.
The pattern of world grain trade shifted dramatically in the past 50
years. The United States substantially increased its share of a rapidly
growing market. As Table 4-3 illustrates, as recently as the 1930s
Asia, the U.S.S.R., Eastern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East
were net exporters of grains. All have become significant net importers. From the mid-1950s to the late 1970s, world grain trade grew
from about 30 million to 130 million tons per year. The largest increase in exports was from North America.

The growth in world cereals imports in the last decade has been
fueled mainly by growth in per capita income, with growth in population being a significant but less important factor. The growth in imports occurred mainly in the centrally planned economies, the
middle-income developing countries, Japan, and the oil-exporting
countries. The U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe alone accounted for 40
percent of the increase. These, like Japan and the middle-income developing countries, experienced rapid growth in incomes and in meat
consumption but they lacked a comparative advantage to increase
feed production. This effect is reinforced in the centrally planned
economies by their policy of subsidizing food so that consumers pay
less than the world price for meat and other livestock products.
A small fraction of the growth in grain trade over the last decade has
gone to meet food needs of low-income countries. These economies
do not have the foreign exchange to pay for cereals imports, and
their food aid imports have risen.




123

Since the global recession began in 1981, growth in world trade
has slowed. This, together with record world production and third
world debt problems, has reduced the volume of agricultural trade.
The appreciation of the dollar has raised the cost of U.S. exports relative to other suppliers. Federal agricultural policies have also driven
up the price of U.S. exports. This and the strength of the dollar contributed to a fall in the U.S. market share in world agricultural trade
as well as the value of its exports.
The growth of exports in the last decade has radically changed the
structure of demand for U.S. farm output. From World War II until
about 1973, when exports were relatively unimportant, overall
demand was quite insensitive to price. However, because there are
other exporters and because most countries import farm products
only after consuming their own domestic production, export demand
tends to be more responsive to price and income changes. This
means, for example, that when supply grows faster than demand, the
market price may fall less than proportionately, and total farm revenue may increase.
Growth in exports has also introduced greater instability in the
markets for American farm products. Exports are affected by weather, trade policy, exchange rates, population, and income in the rest
of the world. All but population tend to be unpredictable and, therefore, generate shocks to the U.S. farm sector through the variability
they cause in export demand.
In the 19th century, a country's competitive position in agriculture
was strongly influenced by its endowment of fertile land and favorable climatic conditions. Today our fertile, abundantly rain-fed land
base, while still important, accounts for only part of the competitiveness of U.S. agriculture. Other countries less well endowed with fertile land have followed the U.S. pattern of agricultural development
by shifting to a more capital-intensive, science-based agriculture. A
relative scarcity of land is no longer as severe a constraint on agricultural growth as formerly. If U.S. agriculture is going to maintain its
competitive position, productivity growth must be sustained.
THE BROADER ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
American farmers responded strongly to the agricultural export
boom of the mid-1970s. They substantially expanded their capacity
by bringing previously retired land back into production and by
buying more and larger machinery and equipment. The price of land
was bid up to unprecedented levels. The boom attracted new entrants and encouraged many farmers to mortgage their present farms
to buy more land. When the global recession hit in 1981 and the




124

dollar appreciated substantially in foreign exchange markets, U.S.
farm exports and, in turn, prices and incomes, fell. This left U.S. agriculture with excess capacity relative to current demand. Many
recent entrants and farmers who expanded in the 1970s suffered
severe cash flow problems. These farmers have experienced capital
losses as land prices have declined from their 1981 peak.
INTERNATIONAL TRADING ENVIRONMENT

The current world trading environment is characterized by weak
demand and keen export competition. In the early 1980s the global
recession, third world debt, and the strong U.S. dollar have reduced
export demand.
Farm exports are not expected to grow as fast in the 1980s as they
did in the 1970s. A decline in the value of the dollar would help all
export sectors. However, in the past decade other major exporters
have made large capital investments in agriculture and in marketing
facilities to expand export capacity. They can be expected to compete
aggressively for our share of the growth in world farm trade even
when the dollar returns to a lower exchange rate.
Japan, Europe, and the U.S.S.R. are expected to continue to be
large importers of U.S. agricultural products, although further
growth is likely to be slow. The EC will probably continue to be a
protectionist, slow-growth market even for those farm products that
it imports. Eastern Europe, which was a rapid growth market in the
1970s, is experiencing such severe foreign debt problems that the
outlook for rapid expansion in imports of farm products in the next
few years is not bright.
The newly industrializing countries, particularly of East Asia, also
expanded their imports rapidly in the 1970s. Resumption of this
growth will depend upon their ability to generate foreign exchange
earnings from exports. This will depend in part on the trade barriers
erected against their exports by the developed countries. While the
low-income countries are likely to need significant amounts of agricultural imports to feed their rapidly growing populations, their limited foreign exchange earnings will severely constrain their effective
demand in the world market.
U.S. agriculture has a large interest in economic development of
the low-income countries and in growth in world trade. Until the
debt problems and foreign exchange earnings of Eastern Europe and
the low- and middle-income developing countries improve significantly, the prospects for much growth in farm product imports by
these countries are limited.
Competition is keen among exporters for the available markets in
the current situation of depressed world farm trade. This has been




125

reinforced by the increases in agricultural protectionism and in predatory export practices. In particular, the U.S. Government has protested to the EC that its use of agricultural export subsidies to erode
U.S. markets is a form of unfair competition. The internal price supports generally exceed world market prices by a substantial margin,
yet the EC has chosen not to build up large stocks of grains. Instead
the EC subsidizes farm exports in order to sell the surplus on the
world market. Unlike the United States, the EC has not until recently
required acreage or marketing reductions for farmers to qualify for
price supports. The EC recognizes the problems with its agricultural
policy, which now absorbs two-thirds of the total EC budget and imposes substantial additional costs on its consumers. The EC, like the
United States, now has excess capacity induced in part by high price
supports and is exploring means of reforming its farm policy to
reduce the cost to taxpayers. It is unclear how the necessary adjustment will occur in the EC, but the United States has emphasized that
other countries cannot be expected to bear the major burden of European adjustments.
MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

Modern American agriculture's relative capital intensity, reliance
on purchased intermediate inputs, and export earnings integrate it
tightly into the rest of the U.S. economy. Cyclical changes in the level
of economic activity now have larger effects on agriculture than formerly. The agricultural sector, like other trading sectors of the U.S.
economy, is strongly affected by interest rates and the value of the
dollar. The agricultural sector therefore has a strong interest in reducing the Federal deficit to which recent farm programs have contributed significantly. Macroeconomic policy may have as great an absolute effect on agriculture today as do the direct effects of farm
policy.
Prices of agricultural commodities tend to adjust to changes in the
rate of money growth more quickly than do many other prices. This
is true in part because contracts for raw materials tend to be written
for shorter durations than for other goods and services. In addition,
because of biological lags, agricultural supply tends to be very unresponsive to price changes in the short run. There are large differences among commodities in the degree to which demand responds
to changes in consumer incomes. While demand for farm products
tends to be less responsive than demand for many other goods, there
nevertheless is a positive response to income changes. Therefore, agricultural prices tend to increase relative to other prices during the
early phase of a monetary expansion and fall in relative terms at the
start of periods of monetary stringency.




126

Because contemporary agricultural production requires a larger
capital investment and uses more purchased inputs, a modern farmer's requirements for both mortgage credit and short-term operating
credit are larger than in recent decades. Interest rates, therefore,
have a greater effect on the cash operating costs of the modern
farmer. Moreover, because one could earn interest on the capital invested in commodity inventories, the expected increase in agricultural commodity prices during the year must be at least as large as the
forgone interest earnings if inventories are to be held.
Although the increasing overvaluation of the dollar impeded farm
exports in the 1960s, depreciation of the dollar in the 1970s encouraged larger exports. The move from fixed to floating exchange rates,
however, subjected all traded goods sectors to a new source of shortrun instability. Because the present strong dollar has made imports
cheaper to Americans and U.S. exports more expensive to foreigners,
all traded goods sectors, including agriculture, have suffered reductions in demand and lower incomes. Agriculture, which earns around
25 percent of its gross revenue from exports, has a larger export exposure than most sectors of the American economy. Therefore it has
been buffeted relatively more by the shifts in export demand that
have accompanied the floating dollar over the last decade.
FEDERAL POLICIES AFFECTING AGRICULTURE
The development of U.S. agriculture and the well-being of American farmers have been strongly influenced by Federal policies since
the Civil War, but particularly since 1933. During the Civil War a
number of policy measures were taken to stimulate farm production.
This helped satisfy the growing export market for grains. When the
export market shrank in the 1920s and 1930s* farm prices and land
values fell; bankruptcies became common. Several measures were
taken in 1933 to support farm prices and incomes and save farmers
from bankruptcy. When these, together with rapid technological
change, caused production to grow faster than demand, another set
of policies was implemented to expand demand. All three types of
policies exist today in forms not greatly different from their original
structure, despite the fact that conditions have changed markedly in
the past 50 years.
POLICIES THAT REDUCE PRODUCTION COSTS

In the 19th century the construction of canals and later the transcontinental railroad opened up the fertile interior of the country to
urban markets in the United States and Europe. Subsidized loans
from the Rural Electrification Administration in the 20th century




127

helped extend electric and telephone service to remote rural areas at
low cost. Because farm production is so geographically dispersed,
these policies not only stimulated its expansion, but also lowered its
cost. Federal regulation of transport and communication until recently kept rates to remote rural communities at or below cost. The implicit subsidies paid by high-density routes in other parts of the country, however, have been reduced recently by deregulation.
The Homestead Act, passed in 1862, provided a means of distributing public land in the unsettled regions of the Midwest and Great
Plains free to settlers who would cultivate it for 5 years. The Morrill
Act, also passed in 1862, established a land-grant college of agricultural and mechanic arts in every State. At first these were teaching
institutions, but they later took on important agricultural research
and extension roles as well. The Hatch Act of 1887 provided annual
Federal support for agricultural research in each State, and the
Smith-Lever Act of 1914 created the cooperative agricultural extension service. This land-grant system has developed and diffused
higher productivity technologies adapted to the conditions of each
State.
Research Policy

Since passage of the Hatch Act, a substantial portion of the cost of
agricultural research in the United States has been directly borne by
the Federal Government, especially in the biological area. The private sector has developed more of the mechanical and chemical technologies. Government support for agricultural research was appropriate because it was difficult to protect biological research results, such
as wheat breeding. A private firm carrying on such research would
not be able to control the dissemination of the results to capture
enough of the payoff to recoup its investment costs. The research results have been an important source of growth in agricultural production and exports. The annual rate of return to taxpayers from investing in agricultural research has been about 50 percent.
Farm Credit and Crop Insurance

Historically, the rural banking system was weakly integrated into
the national financial markets. Between 1916 and 1933, an independent, federally funded farm credit system was established. Although
now autonomous from the Federal Government, the close association
of the system to the Federal Government means that it can borrow
from the national financial markets at close to the same rate as the
Federal Government. Because the Federal rate is always less than the
prime rate, this provides to farmers an interest rate advantage over
what they could get at commercial banks. The system, which is cooperatively owned by its member borrowers, holds about one-third of




128

all credit outstanding to farmers. The Commodity Credit Corporation of the Department of Agriculture also provides shorter-term
credit at favorable interest rates to farmers who participate in price
support programs.
The lending activities of the Farmers Home Administration, another agency of the Department of Agriculture, tend to involve a
greater subsidy element and to incur a larger Federal budget cost.
The Farmers Home Administration makes real estate loans and other
loans to farm borrowers who cannot obtain credit from commercial
sources. The borrowers are mainly new entrants, small farmers, and
farmers who have lost their creditworthiness. Loans to these borrowers often result in higher risks and therefore larger losses than would
be acceptable to private lenders.
The Farmers Home Administration also has made emergency loans
at well under market interest rates in areas hit by natural disasters.
This program has been criticized for making subsidized credit available to farmers who already had access to credit from commercial
sources. Despite very generous repayment terms, this program has
not been noted for restoring financially troubled farms to profitability. During the 1970s the government also made direct payments to
farmers who suffered financial losses due to natural disasters. By
shifting part of the risk of failure to the Federal Government, these
programs have encouraged larger crop production in areas of the
country where the risk of crop failure is greatest.
The direct disaster payment program is being phased out as a
result of the 1981 farm bill. It is being replaced by Farmers Home
Administration lending and by a new and expanded Federal Crop Insurance program. Participation rates in the former crop insurance
program were low, in part because the premiums did not adequately
reflect individual differences in risk or in individual farmers' resources and management skills. The program was redesigned to encourage more commercial producers to participate than under the
previous program, and the government now subsidizes up to 30 percent of the cost of crop insurance to farmers.
Together, emergency loans, disaster relief, and subsidized crop insurance tend to induce excessive crop production in areas of the
country that are subject to a wide range of weather-related yield variation. The programs do this by raising farmers' expected returns
from crop production in such areas by shifting part of the risk of failure to the Federal Government.
Income Tax Policy

Several features of the income tax law, some of them unique to
farming, may encourage greater investment in productive capacity
and expanded production. First, most farms use cash accounting




129

rather than accrual accounting. Farmers enjoy some flexibility in reducing taxable income by paying for purchased materials in high revenue years and by delaying sales into years of lower revenue. Second,
under current tax laws, depreciation schedules for many capital assets
are considerably shorter than the economic life of the assets. Reducing near-term taxable income in effect gives the farmer interest-free
funds during part of the productive life of an asset. Third, use of the
investment tax credit lowers the effective cost of capital items. Finally, sales of breeding animals and dairy cattle held longer than 1 year
are treated as capital gains rather than ordinary income. This can
substantially reduce the tax on such receipts for higher-income taxpayers, especially those with high off-farm income.
Tax policy does not affect the profitability of all types of farms
equally. The tax laws encourage the substitution of capital for labor.
Larger farms, which generate higher incomes, appear to gain proportionately greater benefits than smaller farms. People in higher marginal tax brackets can benefit more from the tax provisions. This creates an incentive for higher-income people to invest in farming. In
practice, losses from farm operations reduce taxes on other income
by more than the total Federal tax revenue from farm profits, implying that total farm income for tax purposes is negative.
Input Subsidies

Some Federal policies raise agricultural output by stimulating the
uneconomic use of certain inputs. For example, the government
often sets the price of water artificially low by granting public subsidies to construct and maintain irrigation projects. These low prices
give farmers an incentive to use water in arid regions on crops that
require a great deal of water. If the price of water were set higher,
farmers would tend to grow less water-intensive products, leaving
production of crops that use more water to humid regions. Without
these public subsidies, some products now produced in arid regions
could not compete with the same goods from more humid regions of
the country.
There are other input subsidies for U.S. agriculture. For example,
in the name of conservation, the government has shared the cost of
terracing and contouring the land, applying lime, and otherwise improving the soil. The United States' relatively low energy prices have
also encouraged mechanization and energy-intensive practices, such
as irrigation and grain drying.
Farm Labor Policy

Farm labor policy mainly affects the labor-intensive agricultural activities, principally fruit, vegetable, and sugar production. The extension of minimum wage legislation to agricultural labor in 1966 pro-




130

vided an incentive for farmers to accelerate the pace of mechanization. Only about 1 percent of farm workers belong to labor unions,
which formed in the farm sector in the 1960s, compared with 20 percent of all American workers.
The farm labor market has been greatly affected by the entrance of
foreign workers into the United States. Until 1965, about 100,000
workers per year, mostly from Mexico, were authorized to enter temporarily under the Bracero program. Since the passage of the Immigrant Nationality Act in 1952, migrant workers have been given temporary immigrant status, under Section H2, if they do not compete
with American workers. In recent years, Section H2 has covered only
about 20,000 workers, mostly for sugar and apple harvesting.
PRICE AND INCOME SUPPORT POLICIES

The policies of the 19th century increased supply and helped the
farm sector satisfy the growing domestic and export demand. The
drop in export demand in the 1920s sent the farm sector into depression, and the effect was reinforced in the 1930s when protectionism increased and demand fell further. Farm prices and cash flow fell
so low that many farmers could not make their loan payments; foreclosures became widespread. The Federal Government then turned
to policies to support farm prices and to restrict the supply of agricultural products.
Origins of Price Supports

Although the depression in agriculture continued through the
1920s, it was viewed as a transitory problem resulting from excess capacity relative to demand. The Congress appropriated $500 million
for the Federal Farm Board, created in 1929, to purchase cotton and
wheat in order to bid up prices and thereby increase farm incomes.
The Board was expected to resell these products when the market
strengthened. The Board exhausted its capital stock in 3 years with
no perceptible effect on prices.
After the Board's failure to support farm prices, the Agricultural
Adjustment Act of 1933 created the Commodity Credit Corporation
(CCC). The CCC was permitted to borrow funds directly from the
U.S. Treasury to carry out its price support programs. These programs were viewed as a temporary expedient when they were initiated in 1933, but our present price support instruments are remarkably
similar to those put in place 50 years ago.
The CCC employs two measures for supporting farm prices—
direct commodity purchases and nonrecourse loans. Under the
former, the CCC stands ready to acquire any quantity of a supported
commodity offered in the market at a guaranteed minimum price, the
support price. This technique is still used today to support the price




131

of milk. (Because of the perishability of fluid milk, the CCC supports
its price by purchasing butter, cheese, and nonfat dry milk.) By authority of Section 32 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as
amended in 1935, the Agricultural Marketing Service, an agency of
the Department of Agriculture, purchases commodities whose prices
are depressed. Chicken, pork, fruits, and vegetables are periodically
purchased, although no formal support price is involved.
The CCC's other instrument is the nonrecourse loan. Under this
program the CCC offers loans to farmers with their crops pledged as
collateral. The size of the loan equals the support price (the "loan
rate") times the quantity of the farmer's crop put under loan. Most
loans are made for less than 1 year. If the market price rises sufficiently during the period of the loan, the farmer may pay off the loan
plus interest and reacquire control of his crop. If the market price is
not sufficiently above the loan rate when the loan comes due, the
farmer can then freely default. The CCC accepts the commodity as
payment in full and cancels the loan and interest. Loan rates were
originally established to support the prices of wheat, corn and cotton.
Rice, peanuts, and tobacco were soon added to the program.
In principle, both types of price support operations can be viewed
as involving buffer stocks. A price support puts a floor under the
market price in periods of slack demand, thereby protecting farmers'
incomes. If the market price rises to a sufficiently high level, the CCC
can sell the commodity back into the market at a profit, helping
thereby to defray its cost of operation. It has to pay interest to the
U.S. Treasury on its operating capital. A buffer stock is designed to
protect farmers against abnormally low prices and consumers against
unusually high prices. In practice, however, the support prices and
loan rates have often been set above the long-run market-clearing
level taking into account both domestic and international demand.
Although the loan rate has often been set above the market-clearing price for some commodities, farmers often argue that government stocks "hang over the market" and depress the price. They
therefore lobby to ensure that government stocks are released in a
manner that does not depress the price.
Rise of Restrictions on Input Use and Marketing

As government stocks of commodities accumulated under price
support operations, it quickly became apparent that the programs
were treating a symptom, not the root, of the problem—the excess
capacity of the farm sector relative to market size at current prices.
Three approaches have been used to address that—acreage allotments, marketing restrictions, and voluntary land retirement.
Acreage allotments are quantitative restrictions on the acreage a
farmer may plant to a given crop. Although these have been used on




132

wheat, rice, cotton, tobacco, and peanuts, only the last two remain in
effect. In practice, farmers tend to retire their least productive land
first. They also raise crop yields on the acreage planted by using
more fertilizer and other inputs per acre. Production, therefore, falls
by proportionately much less than the reduction in land area. Marketing quotas have also been imposed, at times in conjunction with
acreage allotments, such as with tobacco. Quotas based on historical
sales freeze the structure of the industry. Later entrants are forced to
buy or lease marketing rights from present quota holders.
While marketing restrictions were authorized in the Agricultural
Adjustment Act of 1933, another variant was authorized when the act
was amended in 1935. This 1935 act authorized the creation of marketing orders to regulate the sale of milk and various fruits, vegetables, and specialty crops. Once an order is approved by two-thirds of
all producers, all regulated processors or handlers must comply with
the regulations. While some marketing orders are only concerned
with grading and packaging standards, or collective support for research or advertising, others regulate the flow of products to market
and enforce price discrimination.
Allotments cause all producers to cut back jointly on marketing,
just as if they had formed a cartel with the government agreeing to
police the members. Examples include the marketing orders for
brewers hops and spearmint oil. These are now being phased out.
Other marketing orders permit price discrimination among markets
with different demand characteristics. A higher price is charged in
markets for certain fresh fruits and fluid milk, where demand is less
responsive to price, and a lower price is charged for identical fruit
used in canning or for milk that goes into butter, cheese, or other
manufactured dairy products. This raises producers' total revenue at
the expense of consumers. There is nothing unique about the commodities regulated by such marketing orders that requires volumecontrol on sales of fresh produce. For example, sales of California
and Arizona oranges and lemons, tart cherries and walnuts are controlled, while Florida citrus, sweet cherries and pecans are not.
While World War II and the Korean war provided a period of high
prices for U.S. agriculture, the lower farm prices and incomes which
followed brought renewed attempts to restrict acreage or marketings.
A voluntary land retirement program known as the Soil Bank was established in 1956, in which the government paid farmers to take land
out of production. By the late 1960s, farmers had retired more than
60 million acres under this program.
Nevertheless, with rapid productivity increases, surpluses continued to mount despite the downward drift of real support prices
through the 1960s. Chart 4-3 illustrates this trend for wheat. The in-




133

creasing overvaluation of the dollar in the late 1960s made this price
reduction less pronounced when viewed from the perspective of importing countries. Despite their downward drift, the support prices
appear to have exceeded market-clearing levels in most years
through 1972, when the dollar was devalued and farm exports and
prices increased dramatically. The effect of the dollar devaluation
was reinforced by simultaneous crop failures in many parts of the
world, the ready availability of credit, and a change in Soviet agricultural import policy that led to a large grain purchase from the United
States.

The Last Decade

As farm exports expanded, government programs were adjusted to
allow farmers to bring most of the retired land back into production.
In 1973 farm incomes exceeded those in the rest of the economy for




134

the only time in history. The excess capacity of the 1950s and 1960s
disappeared, and farmers quickly expanded their production capacity
to satisfy the export demand.
The moves toward an increasingly market-oriented farm policy,
begun in the late 1960s, culminated in the Agriculture and Consumer
Protection Act of 1973. Recognizing that loan rates, by interfering
with market prices, may limit our ability to compete in world markets, the 1973 act attempted to divorce the policy objective of farm
income support from price supports. The act retained loan rates as a
form of minimum price insurance, but established a system of target
prices and deficiency payments to provide farm income insurance.
Participating farmers can make production decisions based on the
target price, but unlike loan rates, the entire crop is sold on the
market for whatever it will bring. The difference between the target
price and the average market price (or the loan rate, whichever is
higher) in the first 5 months of the marketing year is paid to the
farmer in the form of a deficiency payment per unit of production.
By this means, the government avoids accumulating stocks unless the
market price falls to the loan rate.
One disadvantage of target prices and deficiency payments is their
large potential cost to the government, particularly if there is a wide
spread between the target price and loan rate. To overcome the cost
disadvantage and the tendency for target prices to encourage larger
production, the program often requires a farmer to reduce the acreage planted as a condition for participating in the benefits of the program. The forgone production on this acreage is, in effect, the premium paid for the price insurance provided by the loan rate and the
income insurance provided by the target price.
Because market prices were high during the export boom of the
mid-1970s, the then-existing farm policies had little effect. Concern
arose, however, about the much larger price instability that had accompanied the export growth in the absence of government stocks. A
3-year CCC loan program, known as the Farmer Owned Reserve, was
established by the Food and Agriculture Act of 1977. In exchange for
a higher loan rate, a farmer who satisfies any acreage reduction requirements can place commodities in the Farmer Owned Reserve for
a 3-year period. After the first year, the loan is interest free. The Department of Agriculture pays for the storage cost for all years of the
loan. In exchange, the farmer agrees not to sell the grain until the
market price rises to a specified release price.
Although the Farmer Owned Reserve was designed as a buffer
stock scheme for stabilizing market prices, in practice the price bands
have been altered frequently. In particular, since the 1980 embargo
of grain sales to the U.S.S.R., the Farmer Owned Reserve loan rate




135

has at times been set high enough to provide incentives to produce
for storage under the program. This is contrary to its objective of
providing price insurance when the market price falls below its longrun equilibrium level.
With the onset of the global recession and the strengthening of the
dollar 2 years ago, farm exports fell and farm prices dropped well
below loan rates. There were bumper crops in 1981 and 1982, and
stocks in the Farmer Owned Reserve and in CCC inventories burgeoned. With no imminent increase in exports foreseen, a Federal
policy decision was made early in 1983 to offer farmers payment-inkind if they would reduce their crop acreage in 1983. Farmers found
this proposition so lucrative that they cut back their harvested acreage by 55 million acres from the previous year. In addition, a devastating drought struck, drastically reducing production of corn, soybean, and cotton in particular. The payment-in-kind program is not
viewed as a permanent addition to the instruments of Federal farm
policy.
POLICIES THAT AUGMENT DEMAND

Farm production has grown more rapidly than demand during
most of the past 50 years, exerting downward pressure on farm
prices. Several Federal policies have attempted to increase domestic
and foreign demand in order to provide some price support to
farmers.
Consumer Policies

A number of Federal programs directly related to food have sought
to aid low-income consumers, who spend a larger fraction of their
income on food. When the government began purchasing agricultural commodities to support farm prices and farm income in the 1930s,
certain commodities were distributed free to the urban poor and unemployed. Direct distribution of surplus commodities acquired by the
CCC continues to this day, for example, the recent distribution of
surplus cheese and other CCC-owned products. In addition, the government subsidizes school lunches and donates commodities to
schools. These include meats, fruits, vegetables, eggs, and poultry.
The largest program is the food stamp program, which had a
budget cost in fiscal 1983 of $11.2 billion. This program distributes
food stamps to low-income consumers to augment their purchasing
power in a form that must be spent specifically on food. Nevertheless, because food stamps substitute for cash within a household
budget, low-income consumers tend to spend only about 12 cents
more on food for each dollar's worth of food stamps received. The
food stamp program probably added less than 1 percent to aggregate
consumer expenditures on food in 1983. This program is mainly a




136

welfare program for low-income consumers rather than a program to
expand food demand.
Agricultural Trade Policy

A country's agricultural trade policy is generally a consequence of
its domestic price support programs* Major changes in a country's
trade policy, therefore, generally require changes in that country's
domestic agricultural policy as well.
When price supports are set above the world market-clearing level,
they have particularly adverse side effects for internationally traded
commodities. Unless trade is constrained, a large trading country like
the United States cannot support the domestic price of a commodity
without also supporting its price for farmers in all other trading
countries. When the support price exceeds the world market price on
export products, the U.S. Government withdraws enough supplies
from the market to raise the world price to the domestic support
level. Exports fall, raising the world price for the commodity. This
higher price encourages farmers in other countries to expand their
production capacity. This has occurred for tobacco, cotton, and
wheat—at various times among our most important export crops.
To support the domestic price of goods that we import, the government must buy up domestic production and even imported supplies until the world market price is bid up to the support level. This
appears to be happening today under the price support program for
honey, although this is not typical. Instead, by authority of Section
22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended in 1935,
quotas or fees can be imposed on imports of any product whose domestic program is threatened by imports because of price supports
set above the market-clearing level. The United States currently has
such import quotas on sugar, dairy products, cotton, and peanuts.
The United States received a waiver for these quotas in the 1950s by
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Although there is no price support program for beef, the Meat
Import Act of 1979 mandates annual quotas to limit imports when
domestic supplies are large. Voluntary export restraints have been
negotiated with the principal beef exporting countries to avoid triggering the beef import quota.
In 1954, Public Law 480 created the Food for Peace program as a
means of reducing the large CCC stocks acquired through price support purchases. This act and subsequent amendments provided for
donations of commodities to poor countries and sales for local currencies. These funds are used for development projects or local expenses of the U.S. Government, such as embassy operation. Almost
40 percent of all U.S. grain exports in the 1960s were under Public
Law 480. While concessional sales have helped to reduce burden-




137

some government inventories and to develop new markets for U.S.
farm products, the years when government stocks have been largest
have often failed to coincide with years of crop shortfalls in developing countries.
Government stocks also have been reduced through export subsidies. Export subsidies on agricultural products are permitted under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, subject to certain conditions. In particular, export subsidies must not be used to obtain
more than an "equitable" share of world exports or to "materially
undercut" other suppliers' prices. Export subsidies were used by the
United States to avoid accumulating larger CCC stocks from the
1960s until 1972. In recent years, "blended credit" and special subsidized sales have been used to encourage other countries, particularly
the EC, to reduce their farm export subsidies. "Blended credit" consists of a mixture of no-interest loans "blended" with guaranteed or
nonguaranteed commercial credit.
Export subsidies set up a two-price system that permits producers
collectively to charge a higher price in the domestic market, where
demand is less price responsive, and a lower price in the export
market, where demand is more sensitive to price changes. By this
means, total revenue to producers is increased. Total revenue to producers is, of course, further enhanced by the fact that farmers receive
the higher domestic price for all they sell, but taxpayers pay the
entire cost of the export subsidy.
The target price system can also act as an export subsidy under
certain circumstances. Unless sufficient acreage reduction is required,
target prices tend to cause larger production and lower market prices
than would otherwise occur. Such price reductions have the same
effect, when viewed from other countries' perspective, as export subsidies, unless loan rates are set at or above the long-run world
market-clearing prices. For example, it appears that the wheat loan
rates were sufficiently low in 1977, 1978, and 1979, that the target
prices did depress market prices. Since 1980, however, the wheat loan
rates have been set at such high levels that exports have been reduced.
The United States generally endorses free trade. During the various rounds of multilateral trade negotiations, the United States has
regularly urged that trade in agricultural commodities be treated simultaneously with other goods, only to see it split off for separate
treatment. The various rounds of trade negotiations have significantly lowered tariffs but have been relatively unsuccessful at achieving
similar reductions in nontariff barriers, the principal barriers to trade
in agricultural commodities.




138

On several occasions in the 1970s, the U.S. Government embargoed exports of certain agricultural products—either globally or to
selected destinations. Exports of soybeans, for example, were embargoed in 1973 to hold down domestic prices to livestock producers
who use soybean meal as an input, and indirectly to protect domestic
consumers from higher prices of livestock products. In 1980 a partial
embargo was imposed on grain sales to the U.S.S.R. in response to the
invasion of Afghanistan. As a result of these embargoes, questions
have been raised about the reliability of the United States as a supplier
and about the sanctity of U.S. export contracts. This Administration
has publicly stated that farm exports will not be selectively embargoed
in the future, and has entered into long-term sales agreements with
China and the U.S.S.R.
Since 1981 the adverse trade effects of the strong dollar, third
world debt problems, and high price supports have motivated legislative requests for special export assistance through price or credit
subsidies and expanded export credit guarantees. Credit guarantees
have become a major tool in the effort to maintain U.S. farm exports.
In addition, public expenditures in support of U.S. agricultural
export promotion and foreign market development activities have increased.
NET EFFECTS OF FARM PROGRAMS

Table 4-4 lists the major Federal farm programs for the most important American farm products. In fiscal 1983 the Federal price and
income support programs cost the taxpayer more than $28 billion,
but this number tells only part of the story. Price supports and restrictive marketing and import practices impose an additional cost on
consumers by reducing their purchasing power.
Federal farm policies tend to have two opposing effects on consumer prices. Public support for agricultural research and development has produced a stream of productivity-increasing, cost-reducing
technological improvements, which have lowered market prices. Food
price reductions benefit the poor in particular, because they spend a
larger fraction of their income on food than do middle- and upperincome groups.
Offsetting this positive effect on consumer prices are public policies that artificially raise farm product prices above the market-clearing level through price supports and restrictive marketing and trade
practices. By raising food prices, these policies tend to reduce consumers' purchasing power. Because the policies alter relative prices,
they also distort the mix of products consumed. They have stimulated the development of synthetic substitutes for natural products, for
example, high-fructose corn sweeteners and low-calorie sweeteners

for sugar, synthetic fibers for cotton and wool, margarine for butter,
nondairy creamers for cream, and artificial cheese for natural cheese
on frozen pizzas. Such substitutions have offset part of the adverse
effects of price-enhancing policies on consumer welfare. Finally, lowincome consumers have realized some benefits through income-augmenting programs such as food stamps and commodity distribution.
Public policies also affect the farm sector's export performance.
Past public investments in agricultural research account for part of
the increase in farm exports. At least in the long run, export demand
is elastic, so this export growth has increased agricultural export revenue. On the other hand, policies that administratively set U.S. farm
support prices above the world market-clearing level tend to reduce




140

export revenue in the long run. This occurred in the 1960s and again
for some commodities in the early 1980s. Such policies prevent agriculture from realizing its full potential as a trading sector.
What matters to producers is how government policy affects the
net returns to their land, labor, and capital. For a given technology,
any public policy that raises the price of products or lowers the cost
of purchased goods and services raises net returns. This has been the
effect of price supports, import quotas, and export subsidies, as well
as of cheap water and cheap energy policies. On the other hand, the
price supports on grains have raised the price of feed to the livestock
and poultry sectors. In this way, public policy raises the net returns
to one set of farmers, while lowering those to another.
different rates of protection to different sectors tend to cause inefficient resource allocation. Resources tend to move to where they
earn the highest returns. If public policy artificially raises the returns
in one sector relative to another, this will attract excessive investment
and result in excess capacity. Inefficient resource allocation lowers
the potential production of the economy as a whole and reduces per
capita income. When public policy diverts, say, investment capital or
water from more to less productive uses, this lowers national income.
While farming has changed a great deal since the 1930s, farm
policy instruments have not been adapted to the changing structure
of farming and the environment in which it operates. Average sales
of commercial farmers have grown rapidly, and the benefits from
farm programs tend to be concentrated on the largest producers, despite payment limitations for some programs. Moreover, the benefits
from the programs have tended to become capitalized into land
values, thereby increasing landowners' wealth. Once this happens,
land values can fall unless the government continues to support the
product price. The threat of reduced land values and reduced returns
on past capital investments provides farmers with a strong incentive
to lobby against reductions in price supports, even when it has
become obvious that existing price supports are well above marketclearing levels. The prospect of continued price supports thus creates
false expectations and encourages investments that would be unprofitable if price supports fell. Farmers who act in good faith upon these
expectations feel they have been cheated if price supports are later
reduced or eliminated. Nevertheless, short of paying farmers to retire
resources from production, the only way to induce the needed resource adjustment is to allow capital losses and attempt to ease the
adjustment by reducing price supports gradually.
Public policy appears to have induced excessive investment in parts
of U.S. agriculture at various times. The cost of these misallocations
does not always show up in the Federal budget. For example, sugar




141

producers and processors enjoy substantial income transfers as a
result of protection from imports. Because of the way the program
operates, the consumer bears all of the cost of these income transfers. Nevertheless, the costs are no less real than if the prices were
supported by direct Federal Government purchases.
GUIDELINES FOR FUTURE FARM POLICY
Modern American agriculture has become well integrated into the
world market and into the rest of the U.S. economy. As exports have
grown, total demand for American agricultural products has become
more price responsive, but the variability of that demand has also increased. This deepens the sector's susceptibility to periodic excess
capacity, as at the present. When the Agriculture and Food Act of
1981 was passed, most observers thought that real farm prices would
rise through the 1980s. In less than a decade, we have gone from
fears of worldwide food shortages to such large stocks that we paid
farmers to reduce harvested acreage by 55 million acres in 1983.
This experience illustrates the need for flexibility in setting farm support prices. The present U.S. farm policies support the price to farmers in countries that compete with us for export markets and impede
our ability to export. We need to allow prices to reach market-clearing levels if we wish to compete in the export market. If this is not
done, a significant part of the resources in American agriculture will
remain underemployed until the total quantity of these resources is
significantly reduced.
Price supports do little to help farmers with below-average income
because benefits are distributed in proportion to sales. A more efficient and equitable way to help low-income farmers would be to
transfer income to them directly. While most commercial farmers do
not have low average incomes, their incomes are variable, because
variability in weather and in exports create instability in both supply
and demand. The resulting instability in cash flow makes modern
American farming a risky business.
There are better ways to reduce risk besides outright price supports. One is through insurance. Historically, when farmers lacked insurance markets in which to insure against fluctuations in yield and
prices, the government provided price supports and various forms of
subsidized crop insurance. Today farmers can ensure a specific price
through forward contracting or selling futures contracts, although
relatively few avail themselves of this opportunity. Farmers generally
prefer not to commit themselves early, worried that they may lose the
opportunity to sell at a higher price later if the market price rises.




142

This year trading in commodity futures options is scheduled to recommence on a trial basis for the first time in 50 years. With a put
option, crop producers will be able to buy the right to sell their
future production at a specified price without incurring the obligation to sell at that price. This may be more attractive to producers
than selling on the futures market. In a similar manner, livestock producers will be able to buy insurance against increases in the price of
their feed by buying call options. Thus, the resumption of trading in
commodity futures options will allow farmers to insure against price
risk. If the experiment is successful, there will be less need for the
Federal Government to provide price insurance through price supports.
Buffer stock programs such as the Farmer Owned Reserve are designed to reduce variability in agricultural commodity prices. If these
programs are continued, the acquisition price should be set below
the expected long-run world market-clearing price. Setting the acquisition price too high would reduce exports and support the whole
world market price structure. Stocks would become excessive, as happened in 1981 and 1982. In addition, the price band needs to be adjusted over time on the basis of world price movements, as is now
done with soybeans, to reflect long-run trends in market conditions.
Agriculture, like other trading sectors, is strongly affected by interest rates and the value of the dollar. Therefore, macroeconomic
policy is as important to farmers as farm policy. Special measures to
shield one sector from the adverse effects of macroeconomic policy
draw resources away from other sectors and place a greater adjustment burden on them. It would be more efficient to alter the macroeconomic policies that are damaging the traded goods sectors.
Because the United States is a large agricultural trading country, it
has a large interest in further liberalization of agricultural trade and
in securing more satisfactory rules concerning use of agricultural
export subsidies. In past rounds of multilateral trade negotiations,
substantial progress was made in lowering tariff barriers to agricultural trade. However, little progress on reducing nontariff barriers,
such as quotas and variable import levies, has occurred. If we hope
to persuade other countries to liberalize access to their markets for
our exports, we have to be ready to offer freer access to our market
for their exports. Freer access would also tend to stimulate economic
growth in developing countries, and, over the longer run, increase
their demand for our exports.
American agriculture has a long and remarkable record of producing abundant supplies of wholesome food for a growing Nation and
for export around the world. But, the budget cost of farm programs
has reached a level that is not sustainable. We must adopt policies to




143

encourage the necessary resource adjustment. National income would
likely increase as a result of more efficient resource allocation, consumers would pay an even smaller fraction of their income for food
than they do now, and farmers would benefit from greater economic
health of their industry.

CHAPTER 5

Financial Market Deregulation
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, financial markets have undergone
sweeping changes of a magnitude not seen since the 1930s. Despite
these changes, the process of market restructuring and regulatory
reform remains incomplete. Additional regulatory changes of historic
dimensions are being debated. The shape and scope of these reforms
will be important to the American economy for decades to come.
The issues in financial regulation are many and complex. They include the safety and soundness of financial institutions, the problems
of dealing constructively with changing technology, and the reduction
of regulatory burdens to the maximum extent possible. Similar concerns are important in other industries where regulatory reform is
being debated. But the financial regulatory reform issues are in many
respects far larger.
Financial regulation is not simply a matter of protecting poorly informed investors—the usual focus of consumer protection regulation—but of protecting everyone. In the financial crises experienced
in 1933 and earlier in U.S. history, well-informed, prudent investors
and depositors found themselves ruined financially. From painful experience, we know that a failure of public policy with respect to financial markets can create damage that extends far beyond the financial services industry. Financial market failure can mean economywide failure—recession, widespread unemployment, and bankruptcies.
The essential functions of financial regulation are to ensure the
safety and soundness of the financial system, and to foster efficient
allocation of capital by promoting competition and limiting opportunities for fraud and self-dealing. The competitive capital markets in
the United States, long encouraged by public policy, have provided
highly efficient links between the providers of funds and the users of
funds, directing resources into the most productive investments in
the economy. But instability in financial markets has been a continual
concern, and at times a highly disruptive fact, throughout U.S. history. The challenge for regulatory policy is to maintain stability while
realizing the benefits of competition.




145

MAJOR HISTORICAL FORCES SHAPING FINANCIAL
REGULATION
It is best to begin the analysis of the key financial regulatory issues
by considering the major forces that have shaped the industry and
led to the present regulatory environment. These forces have included public reaction to periods of financial instability that occurred in
the 1930s and earlier, public concerns over the credit powers of financial institutions and their ties with other institutions, and strong
competitive pressures coming from both within and among the various segments of the industry.
FINANCIAL INSTABILITY

Much of our inherited regulatory structure involves extensive and
far-ranging legislation enacted in response to crisis. Periods of acute
financial instability have resulted in the disappearance of major institutions and the introduction of new governmental regulations. For
example, in the 1860s, problems of Civil War finance and increasing
currency disorders led the Congress to establish the national banking
system and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Congress also defined the arrangements under which national banks
would issue a national currency. Later, a series of banking panics—
periods of numerous bank failures and bank suspensions of payments—culminating with the panic of 1907, created demands for a
stronger Federal mechanism to prevent instability. This led to the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.
In the 1930s, the collapse of the banking system and the Great Depression led to major banking and securities acts that set the basic
structure of our banking and financial regulation. The legislation,
among other things, established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Home Loan Bank System, and the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
The basic problem of financial instability that existed before extensive Federal involvement to stabilize the system arose because banking is based on a fractional reserve system. Banks accept deposits
payable on demand. To meet depositors' demands, banks maintain
reserves of cash and liquid assets that are a fraction of total deposits.
In normal circumstances, the net drain on a bank's cash and liquid
assets is small, because some depositors are putting funds into the
bank while others are taking funds out. Moreover, if one bank is running short, another bank ordinarily has surplus funds. Bank funds
can be borrowed and lent in the interbank market, known as the Federal funds market. This market is extremely large and well developed.




146

In the financial panics that occurred in the 1930s and earlier, however, depositors came to distrust banks; they withdrew funds and held
them in the form of currency. One bank's deposit drain was not
offset by another bank's deposit inflow. Because bank assets consist
partly of cash reserves but mostly of loans to households and businesses, banks experiencing cash drains were forced to curtail lending,
and perhaps to liquidate outstanding loans. As a result, borrowers
were forced to scramble for funds. Business activity and employment
fell, and interest rates on business and consumer borrowing often
rose.
As the business contractions continued, previously sound firms
found that they could not service their debt, nor could unemployed
workers pay theirs. Banks that had been unaffected by the developing
crises found that their once sound loan portfolios had become shaky.
Fearing more bank failures, depositors rushed to withdraw funds
from those sound banks. As the downward pressures accumulated,
the financial crises deepened.
This brief description of the development of financial crises shows
that a financial system based on fractional reserve banking is potentially unstable: given a big enough shock or disturbance, rational and
predictable responses by banks, businesses, and households will tend
to make the problem worse. There need be no villains for a financial
crisis to occur. A crisis could develop even though every participant
acted responsibly.
Two types of governmental institutions now serve to prevent a financial panic from cascading into a collapse of the banking system.
First, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corporation, and the National Credit Union Administration provide deposit insurance so that the failure of one unhealthy institution will not produce panic runs on healthy institutions. Second, the Federal Reserve System, as the Nation's central
bank, stands ready to provide extra liquidity to the banking system.
When a scramble for a relatively fixed amount of currency threatens
to produce a crisis, the Federal Reserve can increase the total
amount available, thus meeting extraordinary demands. A scramble
for currency forces cumulative reductions in the total money stock,
but the Federal Reserve can prevent the process from starting in the
first place by using its policy instruments to keep the money stock
growing reasonably smoothly.
CREDIT POWERS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

A major theme running through U.S. financial history is that of
concern over the power of financial institutions, primarily banks, as
lenders, and not just as depositories. This concern is responsible for




147

many banking and financial market regulations. Issues of competition
and concentration, of fair and reasonable interest rates, and of equitable access to credit, have long been controversial topics in the regulatory debates.
It is essential that monetary and credit issues be kept analytically
separate. We have tended to extend regulation over the credit activities of financial firms because of incomplete understanding of the
monetary functions of banks. For example, although there is no evidence to support this proposition, bank failures in the early 1930s
were attributed in part to the role of banks in the securities business.
This belief led to provisions in the Banking Act of 1933 (Glass-Steagall Act) requiring the separation of banking and securities activities.
Similarly, regulations setting minimum margin requirements for securities purchases, prohibiting the payment of interest on demand deposits, and limiting the interest paid on time and savings deposits,
were based on the view that regulation of the credit markets was necessary to ensure financial stability.
The evidence, however, indicates that banking abuses are not
themselves the basic cause of financial instability. A steady stream of
bank failures occurred in the 1920s without causing generalized financial stress. On the other hand, in the absence of a proper governmental monetary framework, there is a danger of banking system collapse even if all banks individually pursue sound and conservative
banking policies.
THE FORCES OF COMPETITION

Competitive pressures have been an important force in shaping the
financial industry. Yet much of the legislation of the 1930s, and in
other periods as well, has been designed to restrict competition, particularly in banking, so as to maintain financial stability. Much of this
legislation rested on faulty analysis. Indeed, restrictions on competition have not only led to costly inefficiencies in the provision of financial services and reduced consumer choice, but also may have
contributed to instability.
The forces of competition in financial markets are powerful. The
organized exchanges and over-the-counter markets in standardized financial instruments are obviously highly competitive. What is less obvious is the competitive nature of transactions involving nonmarketable financial instruments. For example, a bank's loan to a small business or a household, which is ordinarily not a marketable financial
instrument, is often negotiated in a competitive setting. In many
areas of the country borrowers can choose among numerous possible
lenders. By shopping around, they can select the most favorable com-




148

bination of interest rate, terms, and service. In doing so, they constrain lenders to provide competitive loan rates and terms.
Although most financial markets are highly competitive for most
participants, there are exceptions. In some cases geographical restrictions reduce the competition in local markets because financial firms
from other areas are denied entry. The loss of competition primarily
affects smaller local businesses and households; larger businesses can
place deposits with, and obtain credit from, the larger financial firms
competing in regional or national markets.
One measure of the depth of competition among financial firms in
the United States is that there are more than 35,000 independent
banks, mutual savings banks, savings and loan associations, and
credit unions with approximately 100,000 offices nationwide. To be
sure, some part of this large number may reflect unit banking and
other restrictions, but it is likely that even without such restrictions
the number of depository institutions would be large. In addition, insurance companies, securities firms, money market mutual funds, finance companies, and other types of financial institutions compete
with * the depository institutions in providing many services.
Table 5-1 provides data on the numbers and assets of these institutions. Finally, many large borrowers can bypass financial intermediaries altogether by selling stocks, bonds, and commercial paper directly
to the market.

There is an important consequence of this competitive environment. Many of the regulations put in place in the 1930s that were
designed to prevent "excessive competition" have been eroded by
pressure for efficiency and innovation. In many instances profitability
can be improved by avoiding costly regulation. When firms find ways
to avoid regulation, other firms are attracted to similar strategies,




149

both to maintain their profitability and to protect their competitive
positions.
Although the forces of competition usually prevail in the long run,
the costs of unnecessary regulation should not be ignored. The
amount of unproductive labor devoted to regulatory compliance and
avoidance is far from trivial. Moreover, established firms can find
their market positions, expertise, and capital eroded as they attempt
to cope with outmoded regulatory constraints while competing
against less constrained firms. Regulation, more than restraining
competition, forces it into new channels. As a result, resource allocation is distorted and unnecessary costs are imposed on consumers,
shareholders, and taxpayers.
The importance of the competitive constraint on financial regulation can hardly be overemphasized. But neglect of it in the past has
led to many of the regulatory problems the Nation has faced. Important recent examples include the market distortions engendered by
ceilings on the interest rates financial institutions were permitted to
pay to their depositors, and the growing banking competition from
nonbanking firms such as securities firms that are not subject to traditional banking regulations.
Many observers decry the effects of competition in breaking down
regulation, but it is not possible to obtain the benefits of competition—the market constraint on interest rates, the incentives for efficiency and innovation, and the dispersion of economic power—without having these same forces work toward the avoidance of regulation. Indeed, competition may break down unwise regulation that
never should have existed.
It is often the case that legislation designed to solve one problem
creates others. Most observers agree that the danger of a financial
crisis has been reduced to an extremely low level. However, deposit
insurance, interest rate controls, and other restrictions on bank activities introduced in the 1930s—initiatives viewed at the time as contributing to financial stability—have had unexpected side effects.
Recent legislation, the Depository Institutions Deregulation and
Monetary Control Act of 1980 and the Garn-St Germain Depository
Institutions Act of 1982, have begun to deal with these new issues.
Fortunately, the new legislation has been enacted in a setting very
different from the crisis atmosphere existing in the 1930s. To be
sure, recent years have seen major stresses on the financial system;
the failure rate of financial institutions has risen. But the driving
force behind recent and newly proposed legislation has been an attempt to modernize the regulation of financial markets and institutions—to retain what is essential in earlier legislation and sweep away
what has proved unnecessary or counterproductive.




150

CEILINGS ON INTEREST RATES
The market's response to interest rate ceilings on time and savings
deposit accounts provides an example of regulatory avoidance in a
highly competitive market and the unnecessary costs incurred in the
process. Interest rate ceilings evolved from the legislation of the
1930s. The intent was to restrain "excessive price competition/' then
thought to have contributed to the banking collapse in 1933. It was
also felt that the introduction of Federal insurance of bank deposits
gave the government a special responsibility to protect the commercial banking industry from competitive pressures that might strain the
resources of the insurance funds.
Until 1966 interest rate ceilings on commercial bank deposits were
intermittently changed to remain above market interest rates. In
1966, however, market interest rates rose significantly above the rates
thrift institutions were earning on their long-term mortgage portfolios, threatening their solvency. The ceilings on bank rates were allowed to become binding in an attempt to prevent commercial banks
from bidding funds away from mortgage lending. To prevent thrift
institutions from engaging in a self-destructive bidding war, ceilings
were also extended to federally chartered savings and loan institutions and mutual saving banks.
In the short run, this emergency 1966 legislation may have helped
to stave off the bankruptcy of some thrifts. However, as the "emergency" ceilings were extended year by year, the artificially low rate of
interest on bank and thrift accounts encouraged savers to withdraw
their funds from financial intermediaries in favor of other forms of
saving. This phenomenon came to be known as disintermediation.
Chart 5-1 shows savings deposit inflows at banks and thrifts against
the interest rate gap between the ceiling on passbook accounts and
market rates. It illustrates the volatility of deposit flows with binding
interest rate ceilings in place.
In many ways the effects of the ceilings were the opposite of those
intended. For example, the ceilings were intended to ensure a stable
flow of mortgage funds. However, they actually led to widespread
disintermediation whenever rising market interest rates made other
savings vehicles more attractive, so that they effectively destabilized
the flow of mortgage money. The ceilings were supposed to make it
easier for lower-income families to afford housing by lowering mortgage rates. In fact, the interest rate ceilings advantaged wealthier investors who could meet minimum balance requirements on higher
yielding accounts, and who had access to unregulated investments.
As a result, the greatest burden of the regulation was borne by small-

er savers. Moreover there is little evidence to suggest that the rate
ceilings were effective in keeping mortgage interest rates down.
Rate ceilings were often effectively circumvented through nonprice
competition and through investment in unregulated instruments. Extensive branching, free checking and financial services, expensive
promotions, and "free" gifts were among the many forms of implicit
interest that banks and saving institutions used to attract customers.
As market interest rates rose through the 1970s, the diversion of
funds into unregulated instruments led to attempts to "tune" the
ceiling structure for different categories of deposits. The number of
different accounts subject to ceilings went from 2 in 1965 to 24 by




152

1979. These attempts to restrain disintermediation were not very successful. A new ceiling-free investment vehicle, the money market
mutual fund, became increasingly popular. Balances in these accounts jumped from $6.4 billion in 1978 to $150.9 billion by 1981.
Unintended effects and widespread opportunities for avoiding the
ceilings, among other things, led to the passage of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act in 1980, which
mandated the gradual removal of ceilings by 1986. At the Administration's request the Depository Institutions Deregulation Committee
has accelerated the phaseout of rate ceilings. By the end of 1983
fewer than one-fourth of interest-bearing deposits were in rate-restricted accounts.
DEREGULATION AND MONETARY CONTROL
Interest rate ceilings not only provoked bouts of disintermediation,
but also damaged the ability of the Federal Reserve to measure and
control the money stock. The ceilings also reduced the stability of
the link between changes in the monetary aggregates and changes in
nominal income, making the task of managing monetary policy more
difficult.
When market interest rates rose significantly above ceiling rates,
funds flowed out of traditional financial intermediaries, new deposit
categories were defined by the regulators, and money market mutual
funds emerged to offer deposit-like accounts that were beyond the
direct control of the monetary authorities. As a result, market reaction to binding interest rate controls resulted not only in a less predictable environment for making monetary policy, but also in conceptual changes in the definitions of the monetary aggregates.
The 1980 Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act contained provisions that, when full adjustment to them is
completed, will significantly improve the potential for accurate Federal Reserve control over the monetary aggregates. For one, the act
mandated a phaseout of interest rate ceilings on interest-bearing accounts. The Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982
continued the process by authorizing a new ceiling-free account, the
money market deposit account. Both steps should prevent circumstances in which these components of the broader monetary aggregate, M2, become suddenly less attractive than savings vehicles not
included in M2. As a result, new episodes of large-scale disintermediation are unlikely to occur.
A proposal currently being discussed, that would go still further in
the direction of decontrolling deposit interest rates, would allow
banks to pay interest on ordinary demand deposit accounts, and




153

would require the Federal Reserve to pay interest on required reserves held against deposits. The cost of paying interest on reserves
could be offset by increasing taxes or charges on institutions subject
to reserve requirements. There are good arguments for such a proposal. Paying interest on reserves would eliminate the disadvantage
that deposit accounts subject to reserve requirements have in relation
to nonreservable accounts, such as money market mutual fund accounts. But perhaps the strongest is that once portfolio adjustments
associated with the change are completed, paying interest on deposits
and reserves would tend to stabilize Ml velocity—the ratio of gross
national product (GNP) to the narrowly defined money stock, Ml—
and therefore facilitate monetary policy.
One cause of fluctuations in velocity is changes in the opportunity
cost of holding money—the difference between market interest rates
and interest rates on deposit accounts. Because ordinary demand deposits do not earn interest, the willingness of individuals and businesses to hold deposit balances changes inversely with market interest rates. For example, when market rates rise, depositors may attempt to economize on their holdings of non-interest bearing deposits by acquiring interest-earning assets. In the process, monetary velocity rises; for any given level of GNP, depositors hold less money.
Changes in the velocity of money complicate the job of stabilizing
nominal incomes. If interest were paid on both demand deposits and
reserves, the spread between the rate that competition would force
banks to pay on those deposits and the rate that could be earned on
other assets would reflect the resource costs associated with providing transactions services to depositors. As a result, the opportunity
cost of holding money would be more stable, and it is likely that this
would tend to stabilize Ml velocity.
Another provision in the Depository Institutions Deregulation and
Monetary Control Act that has improved the climate for monetary
control is the imposition of uniform reserve requirements for most
types of accounts. Under the legislation, the Federal Reserve is empowered to set reserve requirements, not only for member banks, but
also for nonmember banks and nonbank depository institutions, such
as savings and loans, mutual savings banks, and credit unions. The
reserve requirements cover all transaction accounts, including negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW), Super-NOW, and other automatic
transfer accounts. Uniform reserve requirements are being phased in
gradually. The process will be complete in 1987.
When uniform reserve requirements are fully phased in, the link
between reserves and transactions balances should be tighter than in
the past. Transaction deposits at depository institutions have been
subject to widely varying treatment. These institutions have faced dif-




154

ferent reserve requirements depending on their size, location, and
whether they were members of the Federal Reserve System. Some
State-chartered institutions have not been subject to any reserve requirements. As deposits have shifted among accounts subject to different reserve requirements, the lending and money-creating capacity
of the banking system would change without any change in the
supply of reserves. Thus, the relationship between reserves and deposits has been subject to unexpected changes. Uniform reserve requirements will reduce this source of variability, and enhance the
ability of the Federal Reserve to control the money stock.
GEOGRAPHICAL AND LINE-OF-BUSINESS RESTRICTIONS ON
DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS
Depository institutions have historically been subject to a number
of Federal and State laws that restrict their entry into new geographical markets and nonbanking lines of business. These laws were generally intended to prevent capital outflows from rural areas into financial centers and to stabilize the banking system. However, there is
little evidence that they have served either purpose. Instead, they
have impeded the development of integrated financial service companies and resulted in a financial services sector with smaller and more
numerous firms than would have otherwise developed. They also
have impeded the development of businesses that offer both financial
and nonfinancial services, despite possible economies from such a
structure.
Technological changes, limited deregulation, and the introduction
of bank-like services by securities firms and others have eroded the
force of these legal prohibitions and encouraged some expansion and
diversification by banking firms. These changes have intensified the
debate over further loosening geographical and line-of-business restraints. At issue is whether further deregulation will lead to more efficient and competitive financial services markets or promote concentration, instability, and undesirable trade practices.
GEOGRAPHICAL MARKET REGULATION

A complex set of Federal and State laws governs expansion of depository institutions into new geographical markets. In general, the
controlling law depends on the type of institution, whether it is chartered under Federal or State law, and the State in which it is located.
The most cumbersome restrictions are those imposed on commercial banks. With few exceptions, interstate branching is prohibited for
banks, whether national or State chartered. Intrastate branching of
both national and State banks is controlled by the law of the host




155

State. Historically, most States have restricted intrastate branching,
either by prohibiting it altogether or limiting the number or location
of branches (Table 5-2). Some relaxation of these restrictions has occurred, but approximately half the States still place some limitations
on intrastate branching. Federal geographical restrictions generally
conform to State policies.

The restrictions on geographical expansion by State savings and
loan associations are similar to those on banks, except that many
fewer States limit intrastate branching. There are no statutory limitations, intrastate or interstate, on branching by Federal savings and
loan associations. However, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
limits interstate branching except where necessary to rescue failing
institutions, and it observes the limitations imposed by the few States
that do restrict intrastate branching of State-chartered savings and
loans.
States generally enacted geographical restrictions on bank expansion for two reasons. First, it was thought that such restrictions
would prevent the outflow of funds from localities into financial centers and thereby increase the availability of loans to farmers and
small businesses. Second, the laws were intended to preserve local
ownership and management of banks.
There is no evidence that branching limitations do in fact constrain
the flow of loanable funds. Interinstitutional and interregional capital
markets are so well developed that local deposits are as easily loaned
out across the country as across the neighborhood.
Even the effect of these laws in promoting local control is questionable. Depository institutions have been able to circumvent the
prohibitions either by using holding companies or by offering only
limited services in geographical areas where they cannot establish
regular branches. In all but five of the States that impose restrictions
on intrastate bank branching, for example, bank holding companies
may be used to create a statewide banking system by acquiring multiple charters. The growth in the use of multibank holding companies
over the past 20 years, from approximately 50 independent companies holding less than 10 percent of total bank deposits to more than
600 companies with over 57 percent of total bank deposits, is attrib-




156

utable in substantial part to the ease with which they can be used to
circumvent intrastate branching limitations.
Until the enactment of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956,
the holding company structure could be used to circumvent interstate
as well as intrastate branching prohibitions. Provisions of the act,
however, prevent a bank holding company from acquiring more than
a small interest in a bank outside the States in which it is already engaged without the approval of the State to be entered.
In 1970 changes to the Bank Holding Company Act permitted
most banking-related services to be offered interstate, except for deposit-taking. The 1970 changes also narrowed the definition of
"bank" to include only institutions that both accept demand deposits
and make commercial loans. As a result, bank holding companies and
others have been able to establish interstate networks of "nonbank
banks," consumer finance companies, mortgage companies, and the
like, that escape regulation by either not accepting deposits or not
making commercial loans. More recently, the Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 empowered bank regulatory authorities to permit acquisition of failing institutions across State lines.
These changes, plus recent advances in communications and data
processing technologies that appear to have reduced the costs of
managing multi-office banks, have led to a substantial increase in the
level of interstate banking activity. Of approximately 55,000 offices
engaging in banking-related activities, more than 7,800 are now located outside the home State of the parent entity. Even these numbers understate the amount of interstate banking activity because
they do not reflect the substantial use of shared interstate automated
teller machine networks or the phenomenal growth in the provision
of bank-like services by interstate securities firms.
The rapid pace at which de facto interstate banking is emerging—
despite seemingly substantial legal barriers—is one obvious indication of the strength of the forces for change within the financial services industry. These forces are also manifest in the numerous proposals for changes in both Federal and State law. Three New England
States have recently adopted laws that provide for entry by out-ofState banks headquartered in other New England States with similar
laws, and similar regional reciprocal entry arrangements are under
active consideration in several other areas of the country. Other
States have modified their banking laws to permit at least some entry
from out-of-State, and the evolutionary movement away from intrastate limitations continues. At the Federal level, a number of legislative proposals are now pending that would reduce Federal restrictions on interstate banking.

ECONOMIC ISSUES IN GEOGRAPHICAL MARKET DEREGULATION

If geographical restrictions are relaxed, the number of independent
banking entities would almost certainly be reduced. States with unitbanking laws presently have approximately 107 independent banking
entities per million residents, compared with 72 for limited branching
States and only 20 for States with unrestricted branching. The most
credible explanation is that branching restrictions impede access by
large banks to deposit accounts and small loan business outside their
home territories. Deposit accounts have historically been the lowest
cost source of funds for banks, and full-service branches are important in marketing consumer and small business loans. Impeded
access has therefore inhibited the growth of large firms and favored
smaller firms.
However, geographical market deregulation would probably increase the number of banking offices operating in most communities.
"Unit-banking*' States, those that prohibit all branching, have approximately 182 commercial bank offices per million residents compared with 243 offices per million residents for other States. Although other factors may contribute to the difference, branching prohibitions are probably a significant reason for the lower ratio of
banking offices to population in unit-banking States.
On balance, these two changes should increase competition and
benefit consumers. The relevant market for retail deposits and small
loan customers is compact—the locality or even the neighborhood.
Although geographical market deregulation is likely to decrease the
total number of depository institutions nationally, each competitor
will compete in more local markets. Moreover, the number of potential entrants into each local market will also increase.
Nor would deregulation eliminate all smaller institutions. A recent
study concluded that there are unlikely to be large, if any, economies
of scale for most important banking services. The best existing data
indicate that the costs of providing traditional banking services reach
a minimum for institutions in the $50 million to $100 million asset
range. Moreover, it does not appear that most bank customers will
pay a premium to bank with interstate firms. The experience in
States without intrastate branching restrictions is that many small institutions survive and prosper. In fact, smaller banks and thrifts not
only coexist with larger ones, but generally have higher profitability
on bank assets. Although some institutions, particularly less wellmanaged ones, will disappear as separate entities, they will most
likely be acquired by more efficiently run organizations that will operate them as branches.

LINE-OF-BUSINESS RESTRICTIONS

Federal law embodies a long-standing policy of separating banking
from unrelated lines of commerce. Today, as a general rule, banks
may not engage in nonfinancial businesses unrelated to banking,
either directly or through subsidiaries, nor may bank holding companies or their affiliates. Similar, though somewhat less stringent, prohibitions apply to savings and loan associations and holding companies controlling two or more savings and loan charters. Holding companies that control a single savings and loan association or any
number of "nonbank" banks, however, are not subject to Federal
line-of-business limitations.
The line separating commercial banking from other financial services is much less distinct. Until the 1930s, State and national banks
regularly engaged in underwriting and dealing in securities, often circumventing legal prohibitions by pursuing such activities through affiliated companies. Because of the popular belief that banks had contributed to the Great Crash by promoting speculative securities and
unloading worthless issues into trust and customer accounts, the
Banking Act of 1933 (the Glass-Steagall Act) was passed. Provisions
of the act attempted to divorce banking and the securities industry by
barring banks from underwriting or dealing in nonbank securities,
whether debt or equity.
The Glass-Steagall separation is incomplete in a number of ways.
First, the act's prohibitions against the affiliation of banks with securities firms apply only to banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System, and not to the many State-chartered nonmembers. All
banks, however, are prohibited from underwriting securities directly,
and securities firms may not take deposits. Second, Glass-Steagall
allows all banks to distribute and trade in general obligation government securities. Third, the act authorizes banks to buy and sell any
securities for the account of bank customers, provided that such
transactions are "without recourse" against the bank.
Until recently, the gaps in the Glass-Steagall Act, except those permitting trading in government securities, were inconsequential.
Banks did not aggressively pursue brokerage business because regulatory restraints made it unprofitable. In January 1983 these restraints were relaxed, and as a result thousands of depository institutions now engage in securities brokering.
ECONOMIC ISSUES IN LINE-OF-BUSINESS DEREGULATION

Proposals to ease line-of-business restrictions on depository institutions have spurred much debate. Proponents argue that economic efficiency would be increased by permitting these institutions to underwrite and deal in securities and by expanding their power to engage




159

in collateral lines of business such as insurance underwriting and
sales, real estate development, and management consulting. Opponents argue that these changes would increase the riskiness of banking, result in unacceptable concentrations of market power, lead to
self-dealing and conflict-of-interest abuses by banking firms, and be
unfair to bank competitors.
Product-line deregulation may promote economic efficiency in two
ways. First, it may reduce the total cost of providing multiple services
by consolidating their provision within a firm. Such savings can result
from spreading fixed costs over more activities, improving communications, and effecting synergies in production. Second, customers
may benefit from the extra convenience associated with conducting
their business with a single firm.
The magnitude of the economic benefits from relaxing line-of-business restrictions is uncertain. Specific cost data for depository institutions and their customers are limited, and reliable estimates of the
cost savings from product line deregulation do not exist. Over the
past several years, however, several large firms have integrated over a
broad spectrum of businesses, including insurance, real estate, and
securities underwriting and brokering. Although it is too early to
assess the economic success of these ventures, their development is
evidence that the market believes that substantial economies from the
integration of these businesses are possible. Indeed, much of the
pressure for reconsidering line-of-business restrictions on banks has
come from members of the banking community who argue that relaxation of these restrictions is necessary for them to meet competition
from nonbanking firms offering integrated services.
Product line diversification does, however, raise issues of some
concern regarding banking stability. The existence of Federal deposit
insurance gives insured institutions an incentive to take undue risks
in the hope of earning greater than normal returns. Accordingly,
much of the supervisory efforts of banking regulators is directed at
preventing excessively risky banking practices. As a practical matter,
as the range of business activities increases, it may become much
more difficult for regulators to thwart excessive risk-taking.
The Administration's proposed legislation, the Financial Institutions Deregulation Act, strikes a balance by easing restrictions on
nonbanking activities but requiring that they be conducted only by
separate corporate affiliates that are not bank subsidiaries. This approach has two significant advantages. First, by removing nonbanking
activities to affiliates, the bank itself can be regulated and supervised
on the basis of the traditional methods developed by the regulatory
agencies over many years. Second, because the affiliates are to be
subsidiaries of the holding company rather than of the bank itself,




160

the bank would be insulated from any financial problems that occur
in the subsidiary.
There is, of course, no way to guarantee that difficulties in an affiliate will not affect the bank. But with proper safeguards the problems
can be minimized. Moreover, it is important to recognize that attempts to seal off banking from collateral activities is a recipe for an
endless expansion of regulation. Brokerage firms are now expanding
bank-like activities rapidly. Extending regulation to these bank competitors would simply push regulatory avoidance to another channel.
There is, in addition, far more danger of financial instability from unregulated banking substitutes than from properly supervised banks
permitted to expand their powers within well-designed corporate
structures.
A similar point may be made with respect to predictions that increases in self-dealing and conflicts of interest will result from repeal
of Glass-Steagall. The potential for these abuses is already present in
both commercial and investment banking. For example, broker-dealers already represent both purchasers and sellers, deal for their own
account, provide investment advice, manage mutual funds, and act as
fiduciaries with respect to trust or discretionary accounts. Bank trust
departments may transact in the securities of bank customers.
In fact, legal and market forces have limited self-dealing and conflict-of-interest abuses. Legal standards governing fiduciary behavior
are strict, and the conduct of fiduciaries is subject to regulation. In
addition to legal mechanisms, market forces are extremely important.
Systematic abuses by a bank's trust department would, for example,
reduce the return on the portfolios it manages, causing it to lose
business to competitors. Although one cannot say that no such
abuses will occur, existing controls should keep them to a minimum.
Line-of-business deregulation also poses issues of fairness. Opponents of changes to existing law have argued that depository institutions could operate collateral lines of business with low-cost capital,
benefiting from access to the Federal Reserve's discount window, and
an implicit subsidy from Federal deposit insurance. They charge, for
example, that some industrial companies and retailers have acquired
a deposit-taking "nonbank" bank or a single savings and loan association to finance their own activities or customer purchases of their
products and services with low-cost capital.
This argument ignores the fact that the profitability of a consolidated enterprise cannot be increased by charging an affiliated business or customer a submarket rate of interest. Any attempt to do so
will reduce the profitability of the bank, leaving the earnings of the
enterprise unchanged. In other words, if a bank has access to lowcost capital, it will be profitable to its owner even if the bank pro-




161

vides no financing whatsoever for the parent company or its customers. As long as the capital market is competitive, the cost-of-funds
differential between financing customers from bank deposits on the
one hand and from selling commercial paper on the other will only
be enough to cover the costs of operating the bank and to earn the
going rate of return on the assets invested in the bank.
Another argument is that financial intermediaries would be able to
compete unfairly by tying loans to the purchase of other services. It
is not likely, however, that many financial intermediaries would find
tying arrangements advantageous. Tying arrangements are a way in
which a firm with market power can circumvent laws against price
discrimination and increase its profits by selling different customers
different quantities of tied-in products. It is unlikely that many banks
have such market power, but even if some do, they could directly
price discriminate by charging different interest rates to different customers.
Banking organizations, however, enjoy certain regulatory and tax
advantages over nonbank competitors, particularly securities firms.
Banks are largely exempt from regulation under Federal and State
securities laws and, therefore, could enjoy a cost advantage in
broker-dealer, underwriting, and investment management activities.
Moreover, in determining taxable income depository firms may
deduct interest paid on deposits, even if they are used to finance
holdings of tax-free securities. This provision of the tax law may give
them an advantage in carrying inventories of securities relative to
nonbank securities dealers.
The problem of asymmetrical tax and regulatory treatment could
be solved, either by modifying tax and securities laws or by allowing
only affiliated entities to undertake such activities. The latter approach has been adopted in the Administration's Financial Institutions Deregulation Act. Under this act affiliated entities would not be
exempt from the securities laws, nor be subject to favorable tax treatment.
DEPOSIT INSURANCE REFORM
In today's financial market, the traditional depository institutions,
commercial banks, and thrifts compete with money market mutual
funds and brokerage firms in offering highly liquid deposit accounts
that pay competitive rates of interest. Commercial banks and thrifts,
however, retain a unique position relative to their newer competitors,
because their liabilities are federally insured. The system of Federal
deposit insurance was created as part of the Banking Act of 1933.
Under this law the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in-




162

sures deposit accounts for banks that are members of the corporation. A year later the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) was established to provide a similar arrangement for the
savings and loan industry.
The purpose of the FDIC was to eliminate the financial panics and
bank runs that had long plagued the economy, one of which culminated in the collapse of the banking system in 1933. Measured by
that criterion, deposit insurance has been tremendously successful.
There is wide agreement that earlier problems with financial market
instability were not solved by creating a national currency, nor by imposing reserve requirements on banks, nor by the establishment of
the Federal Reserve System, but by deposit insurance. Chart 5-2 illustrates the dramatic decline in bank failures after the FDIC was established.

1980

The volume of deposits insured by the FDIC and FSLIC has increased greatly in recent years as coverage limits have been raised
and as new insured accounts have been introduced. Since 1950, the
limits have increased at faster rates than inflation, and now stand at
$100,000 per depositor. The introduction of money market deposit
accounts in mid-December 1982 and ceiling-free Super-NOW accounts in January 1983, and the elimination of ceilings on most small
time deposit accounts in October 1983 have also produced increases
in the amount of insured deposits, as many customers have switched
out of the uninsured accounts issued by money market mutual funds
into the insured deposit accounts issued by banks and thrifts.
Federal deposit insurance gives banks, savings and loans, and
credit unions an advantage in the competition for funds, and alters
the structure of incentives in the industry. To some extent these advantages have been offset by competition-inhibiting restrictions on
the amount of interest payable on deposit accounts, on allowable activities, and on opportunities for expansion into new markets. In
recent years, deregulation and private market innovation have eliminated or reduced the force of many of these restrictions on competition, thereby increasing efficiency in the industry. However, the FDIC
and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the parent of FSLIC, have
argued that their ability to control risk-taking by institutions offering
insured accounts has been impaired in the new environment. As a
result, the deposit insurance system is currently being reassessed.
Because most of the expansion in the range of opportunities available to insured depository institutions has taken place only recently,
conclusive evidence on the effect of these changes on failure rates of
insured institutions and the dollar magnitude of actual payouts is difficult to determine. There has been a large increase in the number of
failures in recent years. But this increase can be attributed primarily
to the depth of the recent recession, which has exacerbated problems
associated with insufficient diversification and mismatches between
asset and liability maturity structures at some institutions that have
long existed.
Nevertheless, changes in the risk characteristics of financial institutions that are taking place now may have a significant effect on failure rates in the future. In addition, financial institutions are still refining their strategies and tactics in the new financial environment,
and so further changes in market practices can be expected.
THE IMPACT OF DEPOSIT INSURANCE

If deposit insurance were unavailable, depositors would have incentives to evaluate the riskiness of a depository institution's balance
sheet and policies, because their deposits would be at risk. The exist-




164

ence of these incentives, and competition among intermediaries for
funds, would impose strong discipline on managers to adopt sound
portfolio policies. One obvious consequence of insuring deposits is
that the incentives of insured depositors to evaluate risk are eliminated, so that market discipline is greatly diminished. As a result, it is
up to the insurer either to design an insurance system that provides
the correct incentives for the intermediaries or to impose restrictions
on intermediaries that limit possibilities for excessive risk-taking.
Currently, the premiums charged by the FDIC and FSLIC are proportional to the amount of assessable deposits regardless of the riskiness of the intermediary's assets. Under this system, insured institutions have an incentive to take on more risk than they would otherwise, either by making riskier loans or by increasing leverage. Doing
so does not subject them to higher premiums, and they obtain the
benefits of the higher yields that normally accompany the assumption
of greater risk.
With premiums unrelated to risk, therefore, regulation of insured
intermediaries is justified. It is not coincidental that many restrictions
on competition accompanied the introduction of deposit insurance in
the Banking Act of 1933. In fact, the primary thrust of financial legislation through the 1930s, much of which is still in place, was to supplant or limit competition in the market for financial services, both to
prevent bank failures and to protect the assets of the insuring agencies.
The undesirable consequences associated with many of these restrictions have already been discussed. To some extent the restrictions have simply redirected competition into other areas, some of
which are socially wasteful, and have caused the industry to evolve in
a less efficient manner than it otherwise would have. Moreover, to
the extent that competition has been limited, the restrictions have
served to reduce incentives to lower costs, and therefore prices.
Reform must focus on incentives for limiting risk, rather than on restrictions on competition.
PROPOSALS FOR REFORM

Many proposals have been advanced to strengthen private incentives to control risk-taking by institutions offering insured accounts.
The proposals can be grouped into the following categories:
•
•
•
•
•

Tie insurance premiums to some measure of risk.
Strengthen capital requirements.
Increase the risk exposure of large depositors.
Strengthen disclosure requirements.
Privatize all or part of the deposit insurance system.




165

It appears that none of these proposals, taken alone, offers a completely satisfactory solution, but a combination could accomplish the
goal of strengthening private incentives to control risk-taking, while
preserving stability of the financial system.
Relate Insurance Premiums to Risk

Charging insurance premiums that reflect the riskiness of an institution's balance sheet and management capabilities is a solution with
great theoretical appeal. If the premium paid to the insurer were actuarily fair, in the sense of covering the expected losses of the insurer given the risk and capital of the firm and the terms of the insurance contract, the incentive to take on additional risk at the expense
of the insuring agency would disappear. This approach would seem
to obviate the need for extensive regulatory constraints. Insured institutions would be free to structure their assets and liabilities and to
compete in the financial marketplace on terms of their own choosing.
Those electing to adopt aggressive strategies with respect to risk and
return would simply pay higher premiums to compensate the insurer
for their higher expected claims.
There are problems with risk-related premiums, however, stemming from the difficulties associated with measuring risk properly
and determining an appropriate schedule of premiums. One important measurement problem arises from the role that diversification
plays in reducing risk. The riskiness of a portfolio cannot be evaluated simply by examining the riskiness of individual assets. Portfolio
risk depends more on the interrelationships among the assets and
how they match up with the structure of liabilities.
Banks and thrifts have traditionally faced different types of portfolio risks. This is reflected in the experiences of failed or troubled institutions in these two industries. A major cause of bank problems
and failures has been insufficient diversification. For example, many
of the banks that have recently failed, or are now experiencing difficulties, had heavily invested in real estate loans, loans to the oil and
gas industry, or to foreign borrowers. For savings and loans the principal problem has been excessive exposure to interest rate risk—the
result of borrowing short, by accepting deposits either payable on
demand or with comparatively short duration, and lending long, by
writing long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. Until recently, savings and
loans were subject to regulatory and tax provisions that encouraged
them to accept substantial interest rate risk, since the provisions provided strong incentives to invest in long-term fixed-rate mortgages
and since they were prohibited from reducing their exposure by
other means.
In principle it is possible to quantify certain types of risk, for example, interest rate risk, provided that complete enough balance sheet




166

information is available. However, other types of portfolio risks are
more difficult to assess objectively. The bank examination process,
though important, contains subjective elements that make it unsuitable as an exclusive basis for setting premiums.
For these reasons, sole reliance on risk-based insurance premiums
is impracticable. However, risk-based premiums may play a useful
role as part of a package of reforms designed to deter excessive risktaking. To implement a risk-based system, the elements of risk that
are measured must be clearly related to failure, and the premium
structure must not create perverse incentives for institutions to
assume other risks that are not used as a basis for premiums. Given
the limited present ability to meet these criteria, premium differentials across risk categories should probably be kept small, at least initially.
Strengthen Capital Requirements

Ratios of deposits to bank capital for the banking .and thrift industries have increased steadily over the past 30 years. Under the
present policy for pricing insurance, it may be advantageous for
owners of insured intermediaries to drive these ratios to very high
levels, unless other restrictions are in place. Strengthening capital requirements would be advantageous for two reasons. First, the additional capital would directly provide an extra margin of safety both
for the insuring agencies and uninsured depositors. Second, by placing more of an intermediary's own capital at risk, incentives to control risk-taking would be strengthened.
It may be desirable to allow strengthened capital requirements to
be satisfied either through the issuance of new equity or subordinated debt—bonds whose claim on bank assets is subordinate to the
claims of depositors and the insuring agencies, but prior to the
claims of equity holders. Bondholders would be another class of investors with incentives to monitor an intermediary's practices.
Proposals that rely solely on strengthened capital requirements
without any other reforms have some serious drawbacks. For one, the
question of the appropriate level of capital should not be addressed
apart from the riskiness of the rest of an institution's portfolio—two
institutions with identical ratios of deposits to capital can represent
very different risks to the insuring agency. There are also problems
with properly measuring net worth. Large discrepancies can exist between true and accounting values of assets and liabilities. The measure of true net worth that many prefer—the market's estimate—is
generally not available since the majority of financial institutions are
not publicly held. Further, the market value of banks that are publicly
traded may reflect the guarantees that are implicit in deposit insurance.




167

Increase the Risk Exposure of Large Depositors

Many observers have argued that any reform of the deposit insurance system should include provisions that would increase the risk
exposure of large depositors as a way of imposing greater market discipline. Insured depositors presently have little or no incentive to
evaluate the soundness of an intermediary. If virtually all depositors
are effectively insured, the discipline of the market that would come
from private sector scrutiny of the intermediary's policies is lost. The
existence of ceilings on the amount of insured deposits in any given
account suggests that some large depositors are at risk, so that intermediaries competing for their business would be subject to private
sector scrutiny. However, this discipline has not been important in
recent years.
The reasons for the current lack of market discipline differ somewhat for savings and loans and commercial banks. Savings and loans
have few uninsured deposits—fewer than 4 percent of total deposits
at the end of 1982. In contrast many banks have sizable uninsured
deposits. The FDIC has estimated that as of June 1983 approximately
27 percent of all domestic deposits in commercial banks were uninsured. For large banks with more than $10 billion in deposits the
figure is approximately 40 percent, and for the largest money center
banks the figure approaches 80 percent. However, particularly for
medium- and large-sized banks, the FDIC's procedure for handling
failures—which involves arranging a merger with a sound bank while
covering the failed bank's losses—has meant that few uninsured depositors have suffered losses. Since the establishment of the FDIC,
no depositor has ever incurred a loss as a result of a failure of a
member bank with more than $1 billion in total deposits.
A recent FDIC report submitted to the Congress on the subject of
deposit insurance reform stresses the importance of restoring the
perception that large depositors are at risk, possibly by abandoning
the policy of arranging mergers. However, as recently as October
1983, the FDIC provided de facto insurance for uninsured depositors
at a large bank by arranging a merger. The FDIC appears to face a
classic problem in its management of bank failures: it would like to
represent itself as being willing to permit uninsured depositors to
suffer losses so as to restore private incentives to monitor risk, but
for any given failure the FDIC often finds it cheaper to assume the
losses in the process of arranging a merger. Moreover, under present
arrangements, doing otherwise might require a lengthy bankruptcy
proceeding perhaps lasting years and tying up billions of dollars of
assets and deposits. If the institution were large, this could be highly
disruptive.




168

One factor complicating the task of increasing the risk exposure of
large depositors is the emergence of the deposit brokerage industry.
In recent years a network of brokers has emerged to parcel large deposits into insurable increments and place them in financial institutions nationwide. Deposit brokers perform the useful function of facilitating interregional flows of funds. However, they also have been
known to place insured funds in banks without any credit analysis, or
worse yet, place them in known problem banks in order to collect
higher fees. In an attempt to check this type of activity, both the
FDIC and FSLIC have recently announced that problem institutions
would be subject to limitations on the amount of brokered deposits
they could accept.
A common prescription for increasing market discipline is to lower
the limits on insured accounts. However, the emergence of the deposit brokerage industry suggests that unless the limits are lowered
very substantially, the impact may be slight. A more promising way to
accomplish large reductions in the coverage levels, and at the same
time protect small depositors, would be to return to the fractional
coverage scheme that was a part of the original Federal deposit insurance legislation. The act President Roosevelt signed into law
called for full coverage of the first $10,000 of a deposit, 75 percent
coverage of the amounts between $10,000 and $50,000, and 50 percent coverage for amounts above $50,000. This plan never took
effect, as a temporary plan adopted by the Congress was extended
indefinitely. A partial coverage plan of this type is in effect in the
United Kingdom, where 75 percent of deposits in failed banks are reimbursed up to a ceiling amount.
There is one significant advantage of a fractional coverage system.
When a failure takes place, depositors maintaining funds above the
ceiling amount for full coverage could receive immediate payment up
to the amount of their coverage. Additional amounts could be paid
later, depending on what is realized from the failed institution's portfolio. As a result, the disruptive effects on the payments system that
could be associated with the liquidation of a large institution's portfolio would be minimized.
There is, however, an important tradeoff associated with implementing a fractional coverage system. In order for market discipline
to be a credible deterrent to excessive risk-taking by financial intermediaries, uninsured depositors must be prepared to move funds out
of troubled institutions. Exposing large depositors to greater risk,
therefore, increases the likelihood of deposit flight from those institutions. Because deposits can be moved quickly and cheaply to a new
institution, such a system might mean that an intermediary subject to
moderate but well-reported problems would experience deposit out-




169

flows that could prevent its recovery. The recent expansion of access
to the Federal Reserve discount window to both nonmember banks
and thrift institutions should be important in preventing unwarranted
deposit flights from causing the failure of marginal institutions.
Improve Disclosure

Any proposal that relies heavily on increased market discipline
should be accompanied by improved disclosure and strengthened reporting requirements. Federal bank regulators have not required insured institutions to carry assets and liabilities on their balance
sheets at market value, or until recently to report financial information that would permit an assessment of the interest rate risk and
credit risk to which an institution is exposed. However, the Securities
and Exchange Commission does now require bank holding companies to report some market value data and data that could lead to an
assessment of interest rate and credit risk.
Privatize Deposit Insurance

The provision of deposit insurance is now a virtual Federal monopoly. Consequently, it is impossible to use market measures to assess
the performance of the FDIC and FSLIC in setting premiums, either
under the current system or under a new system with variable premiums. Further, if incorrect assessments were applied under a system of
risk-related premiums, the insured institutions might have few other
sources of insurance. In principle, a private market for deposit insurance would seem to avoid these problems; market forces could be
relied upon to guarantee that intermediaries were evaluated fairly. In
addition, private insurers would have an incentive to share many of
the costs of monitoring their behavior. Privatizing deposit insurance
might, therefore, be another means of bringing the discipline of the
market to bear on financial institutions.
It may be possible to introduce some elements of a joint publicprivate deposit insurance system. There is already some private participation in the market for financial guarantees. For example, at least
one major money market mutual fund has obtained private insurance
for its shareholders, and private insurance of mortgages and credit
union deposits is well established.
It is not likely, however, that responsibility for insuring deposits
can be shifted to any great extent to the private sector. Some ultimate Federal guarantee may be necessary to maintain public confidence. In addition deposit insurance was established primarily to
protect against the risk of a banking crisis—the prospect of many
bank failures occurring simultaneously. It is precisely this kind of risk
that the private insurance industry is least equipped to handle.




170

SUMMARY

The benefits of a credible deposit insurance system should be
achievable in an environment with fewer restrictions than the present
one, provided certain basic reforms are implemented. A deposit insurance system tied to risk would be a significant reform. Strengthened capital requirements, the introduction of fractional coverage for
relatively large accounts, and improved disclosure should also play
roles. A deposit insurance system relying more heavily on incentives
of this kind can be expected to involve significantly lower net costs
than restrictions on entry, activities, and the pricing of financial services that serve either to limit competitive pressures in the marketplace, or to redirect competition into other areas.

REFORM OF THE REGULATORY STRUCTURE
Today the regulatory structure is characterized by considerable
overlap and duplication of function among numerous Federal and
State authorities. In December 1982 the Administration announced
the creation of the Task Group on Regulation of Financial Services,
chaired by the Vice President to study Federal regulation of financial
institutions and to develop proposals for comprehensive reform. A
principal objective of the Task Group has been to address the overlap and duplication in Federal banking regulation.
The regulatory structure for depository institutions developed in a
piecemeal fashion over many decades. Until the Civil War, all banking activities, with only minor exceptions, were conducted by Statechartered institutions. Between 1863 and 1865 the Congress enacted
legislation that was designed to force State banks to recharter under
Federal law. State-chartered banks did not disappear, however, largely because State bank regulations were often less stringent than Federal regulations. Hence a dual banking system developed, in which
banks could operate with either a Federal or State charter, under the
jurisdiction of separate regulatory authorities. This aspect of the regulatory structure for banking, and more recently thrifts, has played
an important role in shaping the industry. It has fostered innovation
by permitting many possible paths of evolution instead of one. Two
important examples of innovations first permitted by State regulators
are branch banking and NOW accounts.
Successive layers of Federal regulation of commercial banks were
applied in response to financial crises and the emergence of new institutions and forms of organization. A bank today can hold a national charter, in which case it is supervised by the Comptroller of the
Currency, or a State charter. All nationally chartered banks are also
members of the Federal Reserve System, but State-chartered banks




171

can be either members, in which case they are regulated by the Federal Reserve Board, or nonmembers, in which case they are regulated
by the FDIC. However, holding companies of both national banks
and State nonmember banks also fall under the jurisdiction of the
Federal Reserve. Because of tax, regulatory, and financing advantages, the holding company form of organization has become dominant. As a result, the Federal Reserve has at least some jurisdiction
over the majority of commercial banking entities, particularly the
larger ones. Although Federal deposit insurance is not mandatory for
State-chartered banks, virtually all commercial banks are members of
the FDIC, and so come under its jurisdiction as well. Chart 5-3 illustrates the complexity of current arrangements.

Because several agencies typically share responsibility for regulating a particular bank, and because different banks are regulated by
different agencies, depending on their charter and form of organization, gaps and overlaps of regulatory power among the many agencies have developed. In addition, these agencies have sometimes had
conflicting objectives and motivations in dealing with regulatory




172

issues. For example, the Federal Reserve has traditionally exerted a
conservative influence, while the chartering agencies at both the Federal and State levels have been more inclined to encourage growth
and development.
An advantage of the regulatory structure for the savings and loan
industry is that the problems of duplication of effort and gaps and
overlaps of authority are much less pronounced, since the FHLBB
performs the functions that three separate Federal agencies—the
Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC—
now perform for commercial banks. Of course, if federally insured, a
State-chartered savings and loan association is regulated by both
FSLIC and its State-chartering agency.
In the 1930s when separate regulatory structures were established
for commercial banks, thrifts, and securities dealers, those firms comprised distinct industries with little competition across industry lines.
Because of differences in the products and services offered (for example, between brokerage houses and commercial banks), or between customer groups (for example, commercial borrowers using
commercial banks and small savers and home buyers using savings
and loan associations), regulatory decisions applying to those industries could be made independently. Consequently, there was, at first,
little reason to consider reform of the regulatory structure.
In recent years the lending and investment powers of thrift institutions have been broadened as a result of both Federal and State legislation. As a result of these new powers, thrift institutions may now
engage, with some limitations, in virtually all the activities that are
lawful for commercial banks. This new state of affairs has highlighted
differences in their regulation and supervision. For example, it is now
legally possible for a thrift institution to become functionally equivalent to a commercial bank, while remaining eligible for regulatory
programs designed to create incentives for traditional thrift activities.
In addition, banks and thrifts now face aggressive new competition
from brokerage firms, money market mutual funds, and "nonbank"
banks in their traditional markets. At the same time, technological
change, notably computer-based accounting and communication, has
opened up opportunities for substantial increases in the scope of
business across a broadening range of products and customer
groups. As a result, there has been renewed interest in reforms that
would produce a level playing field on which the various providers of
financial services could compete on equal terms, and that would
permit emerging economies in the provision of financial services to
be exploited to the fullest extent possible.
The long-standing opportunities banks have had for selecting a
charter and form of organization that places them under different




173

primary regulators, and the growing similarities in the legal powers
of banks and thrifts, have implications for the behavior of the regulatory agencies. The various regulatory agencies must offer sufficiently
attractive terms to institutions operating under their charters to
maintain their existing clientele bases and to attract new firms. There
are different opinions as to whether this situation is desirable. One
view is that the present scheme leads to "competition in laxity" and
therefore insufficient restraints on unsound practices. Another view is
that it tends to eliminate the most onerous regulatory strictures, and
fosters innovation and efficiency.
Because of the enormous changes that have occurred in financial
markets in recent years, the regulatory structure has become progressively out of date. As a result the case for regulatory reform is now
very strong. The Administration's Task Group on Regulation of Financial Services is expected to issue its report in early 1984. The
report will focus debate and attention on a specific set of legislative
proposals to streamline Federal regulation and reduce the overlap
between Federal and State regulators.
CONCLUSIONS
Of all the goals of financial regulation the goal of financial stability
is paramount. In the 1930s, financial instability was widely attributed
to the natural operation of competitive markets, and this view supported a very substantial extension of regulatory controls over financial markets. More recently, however, a renewed respect for the efficiency of competitive markets has developed, as well as increased recognition of the costs of regulation. Regulation tends to spread in unproductive directions and often causes industries to evolve less efficiently than they otherwise would. For these reasons, the promotion
of efficiency by furthering competition is also an important regulatory goal. The purpose of regulation should not be to protect poorly
managed individual firms from failure, but rather to prevent such
failures from shaking the stability of the financial system as a whole.
Regulations should be designed to achieve stability of the system,
while individual firms are afforded the maximum possible freedom to
compete and innovate.

CHAPTER 6

Review and Outlook
IN 1983 THE U.S. ECONOMY experienced a year of vigorous cyclical recovery. As the economy snapped back from recession, employment increased by 4.0 million persons and the unemployment
rate fell by 2.5 percentage points. Real gross national product (GNP),
the broadest measure of output, rose by 6.1 percent, while industrial
production rose by 16.1 percent. These gains in employment and
output were achieved in an environment in which the rate of inflation
continued to decline—the increase in the consumer price index of
3.8 percent was the lowest in 11 years. Both productivity and real
wages rose, continuing an advance that began in 1982. For both
series the 2-year increase was the largest in 6 years. Major stock price
indexes rose significantly through the first half of the year and then
leveled off, while interest rates increased somewhat starting in the
spring. The U.S. dollar appreciated in the foreign exchange market,
continuing a trend that began in late 1980.
The performance of the economy involved much more than a
simple reversal of the output declines experienced during the recession. The decline in inflation and resumption of productivity growth
are expected to provide the base for a long continuing expansion in
coming years. The Administration's outlook for 1984 and economic
assumptions through 1989 are described in the final section of this
chapter, following the review of the economy's performance in 1983.
REVIEW OF THE 1983 ECONOMY
Gains in output were widespread across most sectors of the economy. By the end of 1983 the expansion was 1 year old—the quarterly
dating of the business cycle trough is the fourth quarter of 1982,
while the monthly dating is November 1982. In discussing the 1983
recovery a comparison with other recoveries is useful. Table 6-1 provides summary information on the other recoveries since 1949. From
Table 6-1 it can be seen that in 1983 real GNP grew slightly less and
employment considerably more than over the comparable period of a
typical recovery. Indeed, the employment gain was larger than experienced in any of the seven recoveries reported in Table 6-1 with the




175

exception of the recovery following the 1949 trough. Industrial production in 1983 rose somewhat more rapidly than over the first year
of a typical recovery.

In order to provide a reference standard for interpreting the
growth of GNP and its components in 1983, a "typical** recovery may
be defined by averaging the first year of business expansion following the earlier cyclical troughs listed in Table 6-1 excluding those in
1949 and 1980. The strength of the recovery from the 1949 trough
was greatly distorted by the outbreak of the Korean war in mid-1950
and the accompanying expectation of a renewal of wartime production and price controls. The expansion from the 1980 trough lasted
only 12 months—a recovery only half the length of any recovery in
the last 50 years.
A perspective on the composition of the expansion in real GNP is
provided in Table 6-2. The major categories of real GNP are reported in terms of percentage point contributions to the total change in
GNP over the four quarters of 1983. For example, real personal consumption expenditures accounted for 3.6 percentage points of the
total 6.1 percent growth in real GNP; by comparison, during the first
four quarters of the typical postwar recovery, personal consumption
accounted for 3.6 percentage points out of the total 6.8 percent increase in real GNP. The major conclusion to be drawn from
Table 6-2 is that the magnitude and composition of the 1983 expansion was similar in most respects to the typical first four quarters of
business expansion following a cyclical trough.

Fluctuations in output over the business cycle are ordinarily larger
for durable consumption and investment goods than for other sectors. In 1983 despite apparently high real (inflation adjusted) interest
rates, durable consumption, business fixed investment, residential investment, and inventories all experienced growth matching or exceeding that of the typical postwar recovery, based on the accounting
in Table 6-2. Business investment in equipment was especially
strong.
This strong performance can be attributed to several factors. Both
disposable personal income and after-tax business profits recovered
significantly from their 1982 levels. Relative prices for consumer durable goods and fixed investment goods fell. Tax policies, especially
accelerated depreciation allowances, increased the after-tax return on
business investment. The rising stock market probably also contributed both to the demand for durable goods and business fixed investment. The decline in mortgage rates that began in mid-1982 was important for the housing recovery.
Rising profits and incomes are likely to have a large effect on investment expenditures in the early stages of the recovery when the
swing in output from contraction to expansion is relatively large and
disposable personal income and business cash flow increase significantly. Later in the expansion, output and income growth tend to




177

slow relative to business investment as firms approach high utilization rates. At this stage, interest rates become more important in determining the level of investment and subsequent growth in total
output.
In addition, business fixed investment may have been subject to
"accelerator" effects. As final demand rises, so too does the capital
stock needed to produce the higher volume of goods and services efficiently. With a resumption of economic expansion, even a relatively
small increase in the desired capital stock may result in a substantial
increase in the rate of investment spending. Inventory investment
also tends to increase with rising final sales in order to keep the ratio
of inventories to sales within the desired range. An expansion of inventories requires additional production, further increasing the use
of existing capacity. These types of effects are likely to play a significant role through 1984.
Expenditures on consumer durables and housing may have been
affected by a similar phenomenon. During recessions, with real
income growing slowly or falling, desired stocks of housing and consumer durables rise slowly if at all. Most purchases reflect replacement demand. In the early recovery phase, with rising employment
and income, purchases of consumer durables may expand rapidly as
efforts to increase stocks of durables and housing create additional
demand above normal replacement demand.
In 1983 total real domestic demand rose by 7.4 percent, and
export demand added another 0.3 percent. However, of this 7.8 percent increase of aggregate demand, 1.7 percentage points were satisfied by imports of goods and services. Thus, U.S. real output and
income rose by 6.1 percent; in an accounting sense, net exports reduced real GNP growth by 1.4 percentage points in 1983 compared
to a reduction of 0.4 percentage point for a typical recovery. As can
be seen from Table 6-2, the decline in net exports in 1983 was more
a reflection of growing imports than of declining exports. However,
exports had declined significantly in 1982; thus, the small growth in
exports in 1983 was from a depressed base.
Government purchases of goods and services declined over the
four quarters of 1983 by an amount sufficient to lower GNP by 0.4
percentage point in the accounting reported in Table 6-2. State and
local government purchases grew more slowly than is typical of the
first four quarters of recovery. Total real Federal purchases actually
declined somewhat as a rise in Federal defense purchases was more
than offset by a fall in nondefense purchases. It is important to note,
however, that a comparison of real Federal purchases in the fourth
quarter of 1983 with those in the fourth quarter of 1982 is distorted
by a large shift from net purchases to net sales (which include pay-




178

ment-in-kind) of agricultural commodities by the Commodity Credit
Corporation (CCC). As shown in Table 6-2, Federal expenditures excluding CCC contributed 0.3 percentage point of GNP growth compared to a negative contribution of 0.3 percentage point for the typical recovery.
In summary, the major differences in the composition of GNP
growth between the 1983 and the typical recovery are these: a) nonresidential fixed investment rose more than usual in the 1983 recovery; b) net exports, which fall somewhat in the typical recovery, fell
substantially in 1983; and c) Federal purchases, which are usually
about unchanged, fell in 1983 due to an atypical swing in CCC purchases.
PERSONAL INCOME AND CONSUMPTION

Over the course of the year real personal income rose by 4.0 percent, while real disposable income grew somewhat more rapidly, by
5.1 percent, reflecting the third stage of the Administration's tax reduction program. These increases in both personal and disposable
income continued advances that started in 1982.
As shown in Table 6-3, the 4.0 percent rise in real personal
income reflected a 5.1 percent rise in real payroll disbursements and
related fringe income. Higher employment and hours worked and an
increase in real hourly earnings all contributed to this increase.
Other sources of income including interest and dividend income,
rental income, and proprietors' income recorded a 4.7 percent increase. Real net transfer payments declined 3.7 percent as unemployment payments dropped, and as the surge in employment produced a
large increase in contributions to social insurance. Federal personal
income tax liabilities fell by 6.2 percent while other taxes—largely
State and local—rose by 11.1 percent.
Increases in consumption expenditures were widespread across
various product categories. As is typical of periods of cyclical recovery, the expansion of real consumption expenditures was led by expenditures on durable goods. Real consumer durables expenditures,
which in 1982 were below their 1978 level, rose substantially in 1983.
Expenditures on automobiles, representing about 43 percent of total
consumer durables expenditures, rose by 19.3 percent. Furniture and
household equipment, linked to the housing recovery, grew by 11.5
percent and other durables by 8.4 percent.
In real terms, the services component of personal consumption expenditures has grown every quarter since the first quarter of 1954,
reflecting stable growth of services generally, and especially of imputed
services of owner-occupied dwellings which represent one-quarter
of total services outlays. The nondurable goods sector—of which

food represents about one-half and clothing about one-quarter—fluctuates over the cycle but is dominated by trend. Real nondurable
consumption rose 4.7 percent over the year.
By the second quarter of 1983, the vigorous recovery had already
lifted durable consumption expenditures above the prior peak quarter in 1978. The increase began in the fourth quarter of 1982 when
special promotional efforts by the automobile industry and declining
fuel prices increased auto sales and substantially reduced inventories.
The growth of consumer spending in 1983 exceeded that of disposable income. Hence, the personal saving rate fell over the course
of the year. The average rate for the year, 4.8 percent, was below the
5.8 percent rate in 1982 and substantially below the 6.9 percent average for the 1950-80 period. In comparing 1983 to prior recoveries, it
is better to examine the average saving rate for the year because the
personal saving rate can be rather volatile from quarter to quarter.
There has been no consistent pattern for the saving rate over the
first year of business cycle recoveries. In this stage of the cycle, sub-




180

stantial declines on the order of the 1983 decline are certainly not
unknown; for example, in the first year of recovery following the
1954 trough the saving rate averaged 6.0 percent, down from an
average of 7.2 percent over the preceding four quarters. The main
issue concerning the 1983 personal saving rate is that it declined
from a 1982 level that was already considerably below the average
for the last three decades.
The decline in the saving rate in 1983 may reflect in part the effects of a vigorous stock market advance in encouraging rising consumer spending. After rising 27 percent from its July low to December 1982, the Standard & Poor's composite index rose by another 19
percent over the 6 months ending June 1983. The index ended the
year at about its June level, having increased the value of outstanding
stock held by households by about $500 billion from July 1982. This
stock market advance was somewhat larger than the average over
comparable phases of previous business cycles.
RESIDENTIAL INVESTMENT

In 1983 monthly housing starts fluctuated between an annual rate
of 1.5 million and 1.9 million units, averaging 1.7 million units, the
highest level since the 1.75 million units reached in 1979. The increase in starts from 1982 was the largest year-to-year advance in
over 35 years. In addition, mobile homes—not included in the starts
figure—averaged about 300,000 units, bringing total new dwelling
units to about 2 million. About two-thirds of the starts were singlefamily units and one-third were in structures with two units or more,
a split that was about typical of the average in the 1970s. Expenditures on residential housing construction increased 38.2 percent in
real terms from the fourth quarter of 1982.
The recovery in new housing construction was accompanied by a
rise in sales of existing homes, which rose 16.4 percent in the first 11
months of 1983. Total gross mortgage originations for one- to fourfamily nonfarm housing in the first 9 months of 1983 was over $148
billion compared to $65 billion in 1982. The proportion of mortgage
loans devoted to refinancing was the highest ever recorded, with a
major portion devoted to refunding short-term financing, which was
widely used in 1981-82 when long-term mortgage money was scarce
and rates high.
Over the first three quarters of 1983, thrift institutions provided
about one-half of the net increase in mortgage borrowings, including
mortgages and mortgage-backed pool and agency securities. This
marked a return to the market share that prevailed in the 1970s. In
1982 thrift institutions contributed less than 10 percent of the increase in net mortgage borrowings, as mortgages were swapped for




181

agency securities in an attempt to increase liquidity. The rising share
for the thrifts reflects a variety of factors including a lower average
level of mortgage rates and the introduction of new, more competitive savings instruments. There was a large flow of savings into the
thrifts; their total deposits were at a rate of $143 billion over the first
three quarters of 1983 compared to $55 billion for the same period
in 1982.
Of even more significance, perhaps, has been the growth of mortgage-backed certificates. Unfortunately much of this growth reflects
governmental activity that has probably stunted the growth of privately issued certificates. Federally sponsored mortgage-backed pool
purchases of home mortgages that are used to back pass-through certificates exceeded $67 billion at an annual rate over the first 9
months of 1983. Combined with a total of $12 billion of home mortgages acquired by Federal, State, and local government credit agencies, government participation—chiefly as a mortgage market intermediary—exceeded two-thirds of the $116 billion net dollar volume
in the home mortgage market.
The increase in housing construction and mortgage lending was
spurred by increases in disposable income and employment and by
the decline in mortgage interest rates that occurred over the second
half of 1982. Compared to mortgage rates in the middle of 1982 the
average rate in 1983 reduced the monthly payment on a 20-year term
$60,000 mortgage by about $120.
BUSINESS FIXED INVESTMENT

Real nonresidential fixed investment grew by 11.5 percent over the
four quarters of 1983. Strength was concentrated in business equipment while nonresidential structures investment declined 2.7 percent.
Real expenditures on producers5 durable equipment rose 18.3 percent from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983.
This rapid growth reflected the relatively short lead times on many
equipment purchases, a rising capital utilization rate as the recovery
proceeded, and the investment incentives in the 1981 and 1982 tax
legislation. The growth was particularly strong in the office, computing, and accounting machinery category, and in cars and trucks. Real
outlays for office equipment have almost doubled since 1979, reflecting the high productivity of computers in many lines of activity.
Growth in business purchases of motor vehicles accounted for 29
percent of the total rise in equipment expenditures.
The decline in real expenditures on structures reflects the depressing effects of high interest rates, long lead times in large construction
projects, and excess capacity existing at the beginning of 1983. Office




182

building had been especially strong before 1983; office construction
peaked in late 1982 at a level three times greater than in 1977.
A sharp drop in the relative price of business fixed investment was
an important element in the rise in investment. The fixed-weight
price index for nonresidential fixed investment rose by 1.3 percent in
1983. By comparison, the fixed-weight index for final sales rose by
4.2 percent in 1983.
INVENTORY INVESTMENT

Inventory fluctuations are important in the business cycle process.
Inventories have a buffer stock role, permitting a more constant rate
of production in the face of transitory demand fluctuations. Under
normal circumstances demand fluctuations for individual firms* products largely offset one another; growth in aggregate demand and in
aggregate inventories is relatively smooth. Over a business cycle,
however, demand fluctuations are larger and more pervasive. Then,
inventories tend to be destabilizing as aggregate inventory adjustments move in the same direction as final demand. The impact on
total output of a change in aggregate demand is then amplified by an
inventory cycle. In 1983 inventory accumulation did not begin until
the third quarter, in contrast to the usual recovery pattern in which
accumulation begins somewhat sooner. In each of the first two quarters of 1983 the decline in inventories was smaller than in the prior
quarter. Consequently, the swing in inventory investment from an
unusually large liquidation of $22.7 billion (1972 dollars) in the last
quarter of 1982 to an accumulation of $7.5 billion in the last quarter
of 1983 added significantly to the growth in production over the
year.
With final sales rising and inventories declining in the first half of
the year and rising only modestly in the second half, the real business inventories/final sales ratio, shown in Chart 6-1, fell substantially
over the course of 1983. By the fourth quarter of the year that ratio,
at 3.02, was below the average of 3.33 in the fourth quarter of previous recoveries. The lean inventory situation at the close of the year
reflects the effects of high interest rates and conservative inventory
management policies. It could also be a consequence of underestimating the growth of final demand. With inventories lean at the end
of 1983, predicted future gains in final demand will likely be met by
increases in production and employment rather than by reductions in
inventories.
THE FARM ECONOMY

Reflecting the combined effects of a severe drought and the payment-in-kind (PIK) program, agricultural output fell in 1983. From

the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983 real farm
output fell 16.5 percent to $33.9 billion. Reflecting the decline in
output, real farm inventories, excluding those under government
loans, fell $2.9 billion. Real exports of agricultural products were
roughly unchanged, falling only $0.4 billion. Nominal exports, however, rose 13.6 percent, to $37.6 billion, in the fourth quarter of
1983 as agricultural export prices rose 16.3 percent over the year.
The cost of Federal programs to support farm incomes probably
exceeded total net farm income in 1983. Farm production expenses
fell in 1983, for only the third time since 1940. This was primarily
due to the reductions in acreage under cultivation that farmers made
in reponse to the PIK program. The decline had significant adverse
effects on producers of farm inputs including fertilizers, other chemicals, and seeds. The farm situation is discussed in detail in Chapter 4
of this Report.




184

THE INTERNATIONAL SECTOR

Exports of goods and services in constant (1972) dollars rose
slowly in 1983, but imports of goods and services grew at a much
faster rate (Table 6-2). The result was a decline of net exports in
constant dollars, from a surplus of $23.0 billion in the fourth quarter
of 1982 to a surplus of only $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of
1983.
In the national income and product accounts net exports measured
in constant (1972) dollars registered a surplus while net exports in
current dollars registered a deficit. The difference is due to a higher
price deflator for imports than for exports. Further, the current
account deficit in the balance of payments accounts, which is widely
discussed, is considerably larger than the net exports deficit in the
national income accounts. Most of that difference is accounted for
by the fact that the balance of payments accounts include, and the
national income accounts exclude, transfer payments and government
interest payments to foreigners. However, the interpretation of major
trends in the foreign sector is little affected by alternative accounting
systems. By either measure, the deficit has been rising in current dollars, and the surplus has been declining in constant dollars.
The merchandise trade balance, which has been in deficit since
1976, further deteriorated in 1983. However, the United States has a
substantial surplus from investment income and a smaller surplus in
the "other services" component of net exports.
One cause of the decline in net exports in 1983 was the strong
dollar, which made imported goods and services relatively less
expensive to American buyers and exported goods and services relatively more expensive to foreign buyers. U.S. exports also were limited by the problems of financially troubled debtor nations, particularly those in Latin America. Another cause was the earlier recovery in
the United States relative to that abroad. In 1983 the rate of increase
of real GNP in the United States was three times that expected for
the other 23 industrialized countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). As
output and income in the United States grew rapidly over the course
of the year, imports of goods and services also grew. However, with
the expansions in the economies of major trading partners lagging
behind that in the United States, growth in demand for U.S. exports
of goods and services was restrained.
These events demonstrated an important result of the growing integration of the world economy. In 1983 countries outside the
United States had a substantial influence on U.S. output, and the vigorous recovery in the United States was a source of stimulus to the




185

world economy. These matters are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2 of this Report
GOVERNMENT PURCHASES OF GOODS AND SERVICES

Growth in government purchases of goods and services was not a
major element propelling the expansion of output in the economy in
1983.
Over the year, Federal purchases of goods and services in 1972
dollars fell by $7.5 billion. The decline was a consequence of a special factor not likely to recur in 1984, namely a swing in CCC purchases of $12.6 billion. CCC purchases in the fourth quarter of 1982
were unusually large, while the PIK program and the drought led to
net sales of commodities in the fourth quarter of 1983. Excluding the
CCC component, real Federal purchases rose by 4.4 percent over the
four quarters of the year. In 1972 dollars national defense purchases
rose from $81.4 to $85.6 billion, while the nondefense purchases
other than CCC rose from $33.3 to $34.1 billion.
The growth in State and local government purchases of goods and
services was small in real terms. Over the four quarters of the year
expenditures rose by only 0.6 percent. The small growth in purchases continues a pattern that has been apparent for several years.
Indeed, in real terms, purchases for the entire year of 1983 are
slightly below their level in 1979.
The fixed-weight price index for Federal purchases increased 2
percent over 1983, while the State and local price index rose 5.4
percent.
EMPLOYMENT, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND PRODUCTIVITY

Employment, as measured by the household survey, rose by 4.0
million persons over the 12 months of 1983. As shown in Chart 6-2,
the civilian unemployment rate, after reaching a peak in November
and December of 1982, dropped by 2.5 percentage points over the
next 12 months, the largest 12-month decline in 32 years.
Changes in the unemployment rate are the result of conditions determining labor force growth—growth in the working-age population,
and changes in the fraction of that population participating in the
labor force—and changes in employment. Labor force participation
rates and employment details are reported in Table 6-4. The increase in employment was by far the largest determinant of the decline in the unemployment rate. Civilian employment, as measured
by the household survey, grew by 3.6 percent over the 12 months
following the cycle trough in November 1982, an above-average increase compared to previous postwar recoveries.

Lower growth in working-age population, taken alone, reduced the
unemployment rate by 0.4 percentage point compared to what it
would have been with average population growth. The number of 16
to 19 year olds, the population group that provides many of the new
additions to the labor force, actually declined over the year. The
labor force participation rate was essentially unchanged over the
year. Thus the slower-than-average labor force growth in this recovery is a demographic phenomenon; it is not an unusual economic response of participation rates to labor market conditions.
Above-average growth in employment raised the employment to
population ratio—the ratio of civilian employment to working-age
population—by 1.7 percentage points. At the end of 1983, 58.8 percent of the population was employed, compared to postwar peaks of
60.1 percent in February and December 1979.
All demographic groups have shared in the recovery. Employment
gains were strong among blacks, particularly among black men over
20 years of age, who experienced an 8.5 percent employment gain

over the year. However, the employment picture for black teenagers
(aged 16 to 19) remains bleak. Compared to white teenagers, black
teenagers have lower participation rates. In addition, the unemployment rate for black teenagers was twice as high as that for white
teenagers. Consequently, fewer than 20 percent of black teenagers
are employed, compared with almost 50 percent of white teenagers.
Job opportunities for Hispanics improved markedly during 1983.
Employment among Hispanics grew by 10.4 percent, more than twice
the increase in the working-age Hispanic population. The Hispanic
unemployment rate fell from 15.5 percent in December 1982 to 11.6
percent in December 1983.
Following a period of little growth from 1977 to early 1982, labor
productivity began to rise in the third quarter of 1982. Productivity
trends in the economy are most reliably measured for the nonfarm
business sector, which accounts for about 83 percent of total GNP.
Nonfarm business output and related measures are shown on Table
6-5.
Productivity began to rise before the end of the last recession as
employment continued to drop after output leveled off. Productivity
in the nonfarm business sector rose at a 1.8 percent annual rate in

the last two quarters of 1982 and at a 3.5 percent rate over 1983. In
the recovery unemployment fell without a lag. Consequently, the unemployment rate fell more rapidly than usual for the increase in
output.
PRICES, WAGES, COMPENSATION, AND PROFITS

Over the 12 months from December 1982 to December 1983 consumer prices rose by 3.8 percent and producer prices by 0.6 percent.
For consumer prices the increase was the smallest since 1972; for
producer prices the 12-month increase was the lowest for any calendar year since 1964. Table 6-6 provides detail for major components
of the price indexes, and also a comparison of the past year's inflation with the average rate over the last 5 years.

Inflation as measured by the consumer price index for all urban
consumers (CPI-U) was somewhat higher over the second half than
over the first half of 1983 (Chart 6-3). Over the 6 months ending
June the CPI-U rose at a 2.9 percent annual rate; over the 6 months
ending December, the annual rate was 4.7 percent. To some extent
the slight increase in inflation over the course of the year reflected
the timing of changes in energy prices which fell in the first quarter
due to reductions in crude petroleum prices.

Reflecting the drought and unexpectedly large acreage reductions
for the PIK program, food prices rose more rapidly in the second
half of the year than they had in the first. The tendency toward
slightly higher inflation as the year progressed is indicated by the fact
that the CPI-U, excluding food, energy, and shelter, rose at a 4.1
percent rate over the first 6 months and at a 5.8 percent rate over
the 6 months ending in December.




190

The tendency toward a slight increase in inflation over the year
was also registered by the producer price index. Over the 6 months
ending June, the index for total finished goods fell at an annual rate
of 0.9 percent, but over the second half of the year this index rose at
a 2.0 percent annual rate. Even so, inflation by this measure was
lower than that in the recession phase of the cycle. The GNP implicit
price deflator, the broadest measure of inflation, rose by 4.0 percent
over the four quarters of the year.
The rate of increase of money wages declined in 1983. An important contributor to this decline was the slack in labor markets. However, the reduction in the rate of inflation was also important as
many wage increases are tied, formally or informally, to the rate of
price inflation. Collective bargaining agreements with escalator
clauses ordinarily tie wages to the consumer price index for urban
wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W), which differs from the
CPI-U primarily with respect to the method used to measure housing
costs. Over the 12 months ending December, the CPI-W rose 3.2
percent, slightly less than the CPI-U increase of 3.8 percent.
Based on the first three quarters of 1983, it appears that for the
second consecutive year both union and nonunion wage increases
were less than the previous year, as contracts and wage patterns established in the highly inflationary 1980-81 environment represented
a diminishing portion of wage agreements. Major collective bargaining agreements negotiated in the first three quarters of 1983 have resulted in wage adjustments that are the lowest for the entire 15-year
period over which these data have been collected, and less than half
the rate of increase when the parties last negotiated.
Because price increases in 1983 were lower than wage increases,
real hourly wages rose, as they had in 1982. As shown in Table 6-7,
the adjusted hourly earnings index for the private nonagricultural
sector (production or nonsupervisory workers) rose by 3.9 percent
over the four quarters of 1983, compared to 6.0 percent for the previous four quarters. In constant (1977) dollars the increase in the
hourly earnings index was 0.9 percent in 1983 compared to 1.5 percent in 1982. These gains in real hourly earnings may be compared
to declines averaging 2.7 percent per year from 1978 to 1981.
In addition to the higher real hourly earnings, an increase in average weekly hours worked raised average weekly earnings. Average
weekly hours in the nonagricultural sector rose from 34.8 in December 1982 to 35.2 in December 1983. The net result of higher hours
and higher real hourly earnings was an increase of 2.4 percent in
average real weekly earnings over the 12 months ending in
December.

Overall, 1983 was an excellent year for real incomes. With a higher
real hourly wage, higher average hours worked by those employed,
rising employment, and the third stage of the Administration's tax reduction program, real per capita disposable personal income rose 4.1
percent over the year. This increase was the highest since 1977.
The combination of restrained increases in money wages and continued productivity growth served to hold the increase in unit labor
costs to only 1.3 percent. This increase was the lowest since 1965.
Corporate profits before tax totaled about $205 billion in 1983.
Corporate profits after tax were about $130 billion, a level well
above 1982 but still below 1981.
FINANCIAL MARKETS

Most market interest rates rose somewhat over the 12 months of
1983. In December 1982 the 3-month Treasury bill rate averaged 7.9
percent; in December 1983 it averaged 9.0 percent. Over this same
period 30-year Treasury bonds rose from 10.5 percent to 11.9 percent, and Aaa corporate bonds rose from 11.8 percent to 12.6 percent. The effective new home mortgage closing rate fell over the
course of the year, from 13.7 percent in December 1982 to 12.5 percent in December 1983.
The Standard 8c Poor's composite stock price index rose sharply
over the year, with all of the gains coming in the first half. In December 1983 the average was 17.9 percent above its level 12 months earlier. This rise was on top of the 27 percent increase in the second
half of 1982.




192

As shown in Table 6-8, the credit markets absorbed a very large
flow of financing in 1983. Reflecting record U.S. Government deficits, Treasury debt in the hands of the public rose by $187 billion
over the year. As noted above, the markets also financed a very large
flow of mortgages.

The nonfinancial corporate sector did not place significant demands on the credit markets in 1983. As cash flow rose markedly due
to the strength of the recovery, corporations obtained most of their
funds from internal sources. Despite increases in business fixed investment outlays and a move from inventory liquidation to accumulation within the year, the nonfinancial corporate sector is estimated to
have borrowed about $33 billion in the first three quarters of 1983,
well below the amount borrowed over the same period in 1982. The
1983 borrowing was also considerably less than the amount borrowed in the second half of 1981. The strong stock market led to a
significant increase in common stock offerings. Over the first three
quarters of the year, gross proceeds from primary public offerings of
common stock totaled $33.8 billion, compared to $25.4 billion over
the entire year of 1982. As reported in Table 6-8, funds raised by
nonfinancial business through debt and equity issues together have
been falling since 1981.
Growth in the monetary aggregates in the first half of 1983 was
high. Ml grew at a 14.5 percent annual rate, up somewhat from the
11.2 percent annual rate over the last 6 months of 1982. The two
other monetary aggregates reported by the Federal Reserve, M2 and
M3, grew at rates of 16.4 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively, over
the same period. These two aggregates had grown at rates of 10.5
percent and 10.7 percent, respectively, over the last 6 months of
1982. The high rates of money growth in the first half of the year
were the result of an accommodative monetary policy stance that had




193

the effect of avoiding sizable changes in interest rates during a
period in which the Federal Reserve was uncertain about the significance of the large deposit flows associated with new deposit instruments.
The new money market deposit accounts (MMDAs), first offered by
depository institutions in mid-December 1982, attracted $320 billion
by March 1983. Funds in MMDAs, which are included in M2 and M3
but not in Ml, grew to about $370 billion at the end of the year.
Another significant innovation was the introduction in early January
of Super-NOW Accounts which have unlimited checkwriting privileges and are not subject to interest rate ceilings. Funds in these accounts, which are included in Ml, grew to about $27 billion by the
end of March, and to $37 billion by the end of the year.
Most of the adjustment to the new accounts appears to have taken
place early in the year. In addition, most of the funds flowing into
MMDAs seem to have come from other components of M2. Between
December 1982 and March 1983, while MMDAs were attracting $320
billion, general purpose and broker/dealer money market mutual
funds lost $28 billion and conventional time and savings accounts
lost $162 billion. The components of Ml and M2 are shown in Table
6-9.

In the middle of 1983 the Federal Reserve became less accommodative in its provision of reserves. As a result, interest rates rose
moderately. Also, the greatest part of the portfolio adjustment to the
introduction of the new deposit accounts was probably complete by
that time. Growth of the monetary aggregates slowed; over the 6
months ending in December, Ml, M2, and M3 grew at annual rates
of 3.7 percent, 6.8 percent, and 8.2 percent, respectively.
In February the Federal Reserve announced 1983 target growth
ranges for M2 and M3. But because of the uncertainty it felt over the
effect of the new accounts on the demand for money, the Federal Reserve announced only a "monitoring" range for Ml, which was set at
4 to 8 percent from its average level in the fourth quarter of 1982.
The M2 target growth range was set at 7 to 10 percent from its average level in February and March. The M3 range was set at 6.5 to 9.5
percent from its average level in the fourth quarter of 1982. Following rapid growth in Ml over the first half of 1983, in July the Federal
Reserve revised the Ml growth range to 5 to 9 percent from its average level in the second quarter. Chart 6-4 shows Ml and its target
ranges in 1983.
THE OUTLOOK FOR 1984
Table 6-10 summarizes the basic elements in the Administration's
economic projections for 1984 and corresponding data for 1983. The
rate of growth in real GNP is expected to decline as is typical in the
second year of expansion. Real GNP is projected to grow at 4.5 percent over 1984. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to an
average of 7.6 percent in the fourth quarter of the year.
The inflation rate as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator is
expected to rise slightly in 1984, to 5.0 percent over the four quarters of the year. The slight increase in projected inflation reflects the
view that 1983 inflation was depressed to some degree by cyclical
factors and two special factors that seem unlikely to recur in 1984.
The two special factors were the decline in energy prices early in
1983 and the continuing appreciation of the foreign exchange value
of the dollar over the year. These cyclical and special factors should
be viewed as transitory disturbances to the underlying rate of inflation determined by money growth and trends in the income velocity
of money.
The Administration's economic outlook is based on an analysis of
business cycle regularities and other information, including forecasts,
obtained from the private sector. The projections for real GNP and
inflation in 1984 are close to the median of private sector forecasts

for those variables. Further details on the Administration's outlook
are reported in Table 6-10.
THE OUTLOOK FOR 1985-89

The Administration's economic assumptions for 1985-89 are reported in Table 6-11. These economic assumptions reflect the Administration's view on probable basic economic trends under the assumption that the Federal budget deficit and the rate of money
growth decline over time. A different set of economic assumptions
would, of course, be appropriate if different policies were pursued.
Because economic outcomes are dependent on numerous conditions other than the assumed economic policies, it is appropriate that
the long-run economic assumptions reflect underlying trends. Moreover, because the primary use of the long-term economic assump-

tions is program and budget planning, no issue of Federal policy depends on precise predictions of year-to-year fluctuations in GNP.
The Administration's economic assumptions for 1985-89 involve
higher real growth and lower inflation than many private forecasters
are predicting; Administration and private sector nominal GNP
growth rates are similar. Compared to many private forecasts the Administration's higher real growth assumption probably reflects a different fiscal policy assumption and a different analysis of the growth




197

prospects for the U.S. economy. The underlying fiscal assumption is
that reduced growth in Federal spending and lower budget deficits
will enhance the economy's long-run growth. The Administration's
real growth assumptions are based on the assumption that labor productivity growth will be higher than that over the last decade, reflecting an environment of lower inflation and higher rates of saving and
capital formation. In contrast, many private forecasters seem to be
anticipating a continuation of the low productivity growth that characterized the 1970s.
GROWTH IN REAL GNP

Administration policies are designed to achieve a long, sustainable
economic expansion that takes the economy back to full employment
with declining inflation. The assumption of 4.0 percent growth in
real GNP for the 1985-88 period is a trend or average growth rate
projection; the economy may grow somewhat more or less rapidly in
any given year. In the Administration's view, any attempt to induce a
substantially higher real growth rate by monetary stimulus might be
temporarily successful, but growth accelerated in this way would not
be sustainable. The result would soon be rising inflation and another
recession.
The Administration's real growth assumption falls to 3.6 percent
by the fourth quarter of 1989. This assumption for 1989 does not
reflect a "forecast" as that term is normally used, but rather the recognition that the economy's long-run growth potential most likely is
below 4 percent. For example, over the 33-year period between the
business cycle troughs in 1949 and 1982, real growth averaged 3.4
percent per year.
The Administration's economic assumption of 4 percent real
growth for the 1985-88 period, therefore, assumes a gradual increase
in the utilization of the economy's labor and capital resources. For a
number of reasons, however, it is impossible to determine the specific year in which real GNP growth will slow. One of the principal reasons for this indeterminacy is that the sustainable level of resource
utilization is not known with precision; moreover, that level can be
altered through changes in microeconomic policies. The underlying
rate of growth of the economy is not known with precision either.
The importance of this factor is well illustrated by a simple calculation. A difference of only 0.1 percentage point in the underlying
growth rate accumulates to 0.5 percentage point in 5 years, sufficient
in one direction to permit 4.0 percent real GNP growth to continue
after 1989, or, in the other direction, to cause growth to slow in 1988
instead of 1989. The year-to-year variations in real GNP growth rates




198

require an allowance for errors several times the size of the one in
this illustration.
Another perspective on the Administration's real growth assumptions may be obtained by comparing them with real growth following
prior business cycle troughs. Under the Administration's economic
assumptions, average annual real GNP growth over the 7 years from
the cycle trough in the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter
of 1989 is 4.3 percent. Real growth over comparable periods following prior business cycle troughs, excluding the ones in 1949 and
1980, averaged 3.8 percent. The highest of these 7-year growth rates
followed the 1961 trough; the rate for that period was 5.0 percent.
The lowest was 3.0 percent following the 1954 and 1975 troughs.
A visual perspective on the Administration's real GNP assumptions
through 1989 can be obtained from Chart 6-5. This chart shows
actual quarterly real GNP from 1970 through 1983, and projected
real GNP from 1984 through 1989. Superimposed on the chart is a
trend line fit to the data from the business cycle peak in the fourth
quarter of 1969 to the business cycle peak in the third quarter of
1981 and then projected forward.
From the chart it can be seen that the Administration's economic
assumptions take real GNP back to the indicated trend line by 1989.
Differences in the way the trend is fit would affect the relationship
between the 1989 trend and assumed levels of real GNP.
INFLATION

As seen in Table 6-11, the Administration has assumed a gradually
declining rate of inflation over the 1985-89 period. This assumption
reflects the view that the goal of stability in the general price level is
appropriate because inflation not only is costly and inequitable in
and of itself but also is disruptive of economic growth and employment stability. Also, eliminating inflation can be expected to reduce
volatile changes in inflationary expectations, which are a major contributing factor to business cycle fluctuations.
The gradual reduction in inflation assumed by the Administration
does not depend on a policy assumption that such a result will be
"forced" by deliberate actions to choke off economic growth whenever there is any sign of a rise in inflation. Rather, the decline in inflation is the anticipated outcome of the assumed steady and predictable monetary and fiscal policies. As with real growth, it is expected
that inflation may sometimes be higher and sometimes lower than
the Administration's assumption, but that the trend will be downward
as indicated.

INTEREST RATES

Given the assumed decline in the inflation rate, it is reasonable to
assume that the expected rate of inflation will also decline, thereby
reducing the inflation premium in nominal interest rates. In addition,
under the assumptions of a declining budget deficit and a more stable
economic environment, the real rate of interest should decline,
ultimately reaching a level approximating the real rate prior to the
onset of the inflationary 1970s.
Interest rates, of course, have been quite variable historically and
very difficult to forecast. Although the Administration's economic
policies are designed to produce a more stable economy than in the
1970s, interest rate fluctuations around the declining trend should be
anticipated.

THE FULL EMPLOYMENT AND BALANCED GROWTH ACT OF
1978
The Full Employment and Balanced Growth (Humphrey-Hawkins)
Act of 1978 sets certain national economic goals and requires that
the Economic Report of the President, together with the Annual Report of
the Council of Economic Advisers, provide an analysis of the Nation's
progress toward meeting those goals. This section contains such an
analysis. In addition, as required by the act, it contains an Investment
Policy Report. The requirement for such a report reflects the finding
of the Congress, stated in this act, that "high rates of capital formation are necessary to ensure adequate rates of capacity expansion and
productivity growth, compliance with governmental health, safety,
and environmental standards, and the replacement of obsolete production equipment.'*
ECONOMIC GOALS

In setting goals for the unemployment and inflation rates in the
Balanced Growth Act, the Congress was mindful of the fact that "aggregate monetary and fiscal policies alone have been unable to
achieve full employment and production . . . and reasonable price
stability." In the act, the Congress made clear that exclusive concentration on any one goal could impede progress in achieving other
goals.
A central economic goal of the Congress, as indicated by the title
"Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act,'' was and is the
achievement of full employment. That goal is also a high priority for
this Administration.
A key observation from experience over the last two decades is that
rising inflation has been associated with rising unemployment. Each
time inflation accelerated, as measured by the change in the consumer price index—to 6.0 percent over the 12 months of 1969, to 12.2
percent in 1974, and to 13.4 percent in 1979—a temporary boost in
employment was achieved at the cost of a subsequent recession.
Moreover, the recessions became more serious. The unemployment
rate rose from a monthly low of 3.4 percent in May 1969 to a monthly peak of 6.1 percent in December 1970; from 4.6 percent in October 1973 to 9.0 percent in May 1975; from 5.6 percent in May 1979
to 7.8 percent in July 1980; and from 7.2 percent in April 1981 to
10.7 percent in November 1982. As interest rates rose to new
peaks—the monthly 3-month Treasury bill rate reached 7.9 percent
in 1970, 9.0 percent in 1974, 15.5 percent in 1980, and 16.3 percent
in 1981—strains accumulated in the financial system. Few accurately
forecasted the severity of these recessions, and consequently it was




201

difficult for both the private sector and the Federal Government to
deal with them. During each recession some businesses were forced
into bankruptcy and unemployment rose sharply.
From this experience it is clear that rising unemployment and
rising inflation can occur together. Indeed, each time prices accelerated substantially it proved impossible to avoid higher unemployment. Moreover, economic expansion and essentially stable, or declining, inflation can also occur together, as they did in the early
1960s, 1975-76, and most especially 1983. The tradeoff from inflationary economic policies is between lower unemployment temporarily and higher unemployment a short time later.
The Administration is committed to macroeconomic policy designed to avoid this boom-bust cycle and to achieve long-run balanced growth through steady and sustainable policies. Stable and
predictable policies offer the greatest promise of achieving a high
rate of employment over an extended period of years, with the smallest risk that the economy will experience severe recession.
The Balanced Growth Act set a goal that unemployment not
exceed 3 percent among individuals aged 20 and over, and 4 percent
among individuals aged 16 and over, by 1983. The act also set an
inflation goal of 3 percent by 1983 and zero by 1988, provided that
achieving the inflation goal did not impede achieving the unemployment goal. Finally, the act provided that the President could, if he
deemed necessary, recommend modification of the timetables for
reaching these goals.
Given the experience of the last two decades, recounted very briefly above, it is clear that the essential ingredient of Federal policies to
further the employment and inflation goals of the Balanced Growth
Act must be sustainability. Table 6-11 above, which reports the Administration's economic assumptions for 1984-89, provides a timetable for progress toward the employment and inflation goals of the
act. This table is pursuant to the act's requirement that this Annual
Report contain numerical goals. Reflecting the situation inherited by
the Administration when it assumed office and the severity of the
1981-82 recession, the table does not project complete realization of
the act's unemployment and inflation rate goals, but substantial progress toward them.
INVESTMENT POLICY REPORT

The 1983 Annual Report of the Council of Economic Advisers contained,

in Chapter 4, an extensive analysis of capital formation issues. That
analysis serves as the foundation for this much briefer report.
Updating the information published a year ago, and as discussed in
more detail earlier in this chapter, 1983 was a year of rising invest-




202

ment spending from the recession trough. Nevertheless, for the full
year 1983 real gross business fixed investment rose by only 1.1 percent over 1982 and'real net investment fell by 11.4 percent, however, rising equipment investment over the course of 1983 suggests
that the investment incentives in the tax acts of 1981 and 1982 are
now having the desired effect.
In addition to the investment incentives in the tax law, a higher
rate of investment is being encouraged by the lower rate of inflation.
Lower inflation increases the real value of capital depreciation allowances. Lower inflation also helps to provide the more stable economic environment needed to reduce risks and make business planning
easier.
The Administration's efforts to provide a stable and more productive business environment conducive to rising investment also include a number of microeconomic policies. Deregulation reduces
costs and promotes efficient use of the economy's resources. A general policy of relying on the market reduces the risks to the profitability of investment from future extensions of regulation. Financial
deregulation, discussed in Chapter 5 of this Annual Report, can be expected to improve the efficiency with which financial capital is allocated. Expanding international trade by resisting protectionism, as
discussed in Chapter 2, will also assist in raising real growth.

Report to the President on the Activities of the
Council of Economic Advisers During 1983
The Employment Act of 1946 (P.L. 304-79th Congress), as amended, provides the statutory base for the activities of the Council of
Economic Advisers. The Council, through the Chairman, provides
advice to the President on a wide range of domestic and international
economic policy issues, assists in the preparation of the President's
Economic Report to the Congress, and conducts analyses and studies
on a wide range of economic issues in support of its primary mission.
Martin Feldstein, William A. Niskanen, and William Poole continued to serve as Council Members in 1983, with Mr. Feldstein as
Chairman. Mr. Feldstein is on leave from Harvard University where
he is a Professor of Economics. Mr. Niskanen is on leave from the
University of California at Los Angeles where he is a Professor of
Business Administration. Mr. Poole is on leave from Brown University where he is a Professor of Economics.
MACROECONOMIC POLICIES
As is its tradition, during 1983 the Council devoted much of its
time to assisting the President in the formulation of broad economic
policy objectives and the programs to carry them out. The development of economic assumptions and monitoring of current developments, under Mr. Poole, were areas of major interest. Monetary
policy developments received especially close attention.
Mr. Poole chaired the interagency subcabinet forecasting group,
consisting of representatives from the Department of the Treasury
and the Office of Management and Budget, with participation by the
Department of Commerce. The Chairman of the Council continued
his responsibility for presenting to the President the economic assumptions developed with the Office of Management and Budget and
the Department of the Treasury.
MICROECONOMIC POLICIES
A wide variety of microeconomic issues received Council attention
during the year. Council Members chaired or participated in numerous Cabinet level groups dealing with such issues as international
trade, economic statistics, Federal credit programs, alternatives to
Federal regulation, Federal housing programs, and fuel economy




209

standards. Mr. Niskanen chaired Cabinet Council working groups
dealing with employee pension legislation.
The Chairman actively participated during the early months of the
year, and then during the late fall budget cycle, in Cabinet level reviews of the Federal budget.
PUBLIC INFORMATION
The Council's Annual Report is the principal medium through which
the Council informs the public of its work and its views. It is also an
important vehicle for presenting and explaining the Administration's
domestic and international economic policies. Distribution of the
Report in recent years has averaged about 50,000 copies. The Council
also assumes primary responsibility for the monthly Economic Indicators, a publication prepared by the Council's Statistical Office, under
the supervision of Catherine H. Furlong. The Joint Economic Committee issues the Indicators, which has a distribution of approximately
10,000 copies. Information is also provided to members of the public
through speeches and other public appearances by the Council Members.
ORGANIZATION AND STAFF OF THE COUNCIL
OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN
The Chairman is responsible for communicating the Council's
views to the President. This duty is performed through discussions
with the President and written reports on economic developments.
The Chairman also represents the Council at Cabinet meetings and
at many other formal and informal meetings of government officials.
He exercises ultimate responsibility for directing the work of the professional staff.
COUNCIL MEMBERS
The two Council Members are responsible for all subject matter
covered by the Council, including direct supervision of the work of
the professional staff. Members represent the Council at a wide variety of interagency and international meetings and assume major responsibility for selecting issues for Council attention.
In practice, the small size of the Council permits the Chairman and
Council Members to work as a team on most policy issues. There
was, however, an informal division of subject matter among them in
1983. Mr. Poole assumed primary responsibility for domestic and international macroeconomic analysis, economic projections, and monetary and financial issues. Mr. Niskanen is primarily responsible for




210

mieroeconomic and sectoral analysis, international trade questions,
and regulatory issues.
PROFESSIONAL STAFF
At the end of 1983 the professional staff consisted of the Special
Assistant to the Chairman, the Senior Statistician, nine senior staff
economists, five junior staff economists, and three research assistants.
The professional staff and their special fields at the end of 1983
were:

Employer contributions for social insurance and to private pension, health, and welfare funds; workers' compensation; directors'
fees; and a few other minor items.

^ h e term "family" refers to a group of two or more persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption and residing together; all such
persons are considered members of the same family. Beginning 1979 based on householder concept and restricted To primary families,
b e g i n n i n g 1979, data are for persons 15 years and over.
3
Based on revised methodology; comparable with succeeding years.
4
Based on 1980 census population controls; comparable with succeeding years.
Note.—The poverty level is based on the poverty index adopted by a Federal interagency committee in 1969. That index reflected
different consumption requirements for families based on size and composition, sex and age of family householder, and farm-nonfarm
residence. Minor revisions implemented in 1981 eliminated variations in the poverty thresholds based on two of these variables, farmnonfarm residence and sex of householder. The poverty thresholds are updated every year to reflect changes in the consumer price
index. For further details see "Current Population Reports," Series P-60, No. 138.

Unemployed as percent of labor force including resident Armed Forces.
Labor force including resident Armed Forces as percent of noninstitutional population including resident Armed Forces.
4
Civilian labor force as percent of civilian noninstitutional population.

Not strictly comparable with earlier data due to population adjustments as follows: Beginning 1953, introduction of 1950 census
data added about 600,000 to population and about 350,000 to labor force, total employment, and agricultural employment. Beginning
1960, inclusion of Alaska and Hawaii added about 500,000 to population, about 300,000 to labor force, and about 240,000 to
nonagricultural employment. Beginning 1962, introduction of 1960 census data reduced population by about 50,000 and labor force and
employment by about 200,000. Beginning 1972, introduction of 1970 census data added about 800,000 to civilian noninstitutional
population and about 333,000 to labor force and employment. A subsequent adjustment based on 1970 census in March 1973 added
60,000 to labor force and to employment. Beginning 1978, changes in sampling and estimation procedures introduced into the
household survey added about 250,000 to labor force and to employment. Unemployment levels and rates were not significantly
affected.

Monthly average for year and total for month.
Seasonally adjusted, end of period.
Inventory/sales ratio. For annual pew
average inventories to average monthly sales; for monthly data, ratio of
inventories at end of month to sales for month.
Note.—Earlier data are not strictly comparable with data beginning 1958 for manufacturing and beginning 1967 for wholesale and
retail trade.
The inventory figures in this table do not agree with the estimates of change in business inventories included in the gross national
product since these figures cover only manufacturing and trade rather than allijusiness, and show inventories in terms of current book
value without adjustment for revaluation.

Includes alcoholic beverages, not shown separately.
Series beginning 1967 not comparable with series for earlier years.
See tables B-53 and B-54.

Note.—Data beginning 1978 are for all urban consumers; earlier data are for urban wage earners and clerical workers.
Data beginning 1983 incorporate a rental equivalence measure for homeowners' costs and therefore are not strictly comparable with
earlier figures. See Economic Report of the President, February 1983 for homeownership costs as measured prior to 1983.

Fuel oil, coal, and bottled gas; gas (piped) and electricity; and motor fuel. Motor oil, coolant, etc. also included through 1982.
Note.—Data beginning 1978 are for all urban consumers; earlier data are for urban wage earners and clerical workers.
Data beginning 1983 incorporate a rental equivalence measure for homeowners' costs and therefore are not strictly comparable with
earlier figures. See Economic Report of the President, February 1983 for homeownership costs as measured prior to 1983.

Changes from December to December are based on unadjusted indexes.
Fuel oil, coal, and bottled gas; gas (piped) and electricity; and motor fuel. Motor oil, coolant, etc. also included through 1982.
Note.—Data beginning 1978 are for all urban consumers; earlier data are for urban wage earners and clerical workers.
Data beginning 1983 incorporate a rental equivalence measure for homeowners' costs and therefore are not strictly comparable with
earlier figures. See Economic Report of the President, February 1983 for homeownership costs as measured prior to 1983.

:

Reserve aggregates include required reserves of member banks and Edge Act corporations and other depository institutions.
Discontinuities associated with the implementation of the Monetary Control Act, the inclusion of Edge Act corporation reserves, and
other changes in Regulation D have been removed. Beginning with the week ended December 23, 1981, reserves aggregates have been
reduced by shifts of reservable liabilities to international banking facilities (IBFs). On the basis of reports of liabilities transferred to
IBFs by U.S. commercial banks and U.S. agencies and branches of foreign banks, it is estimated that required reserves were lowered on
average by $10 to $20 million in December 1981 and $40 to $70 million in January 1982.
2
Reserve balances with Federal Reserve Banks (which exclude required clearing balances) plus vault cash at institutions with required
reserve balances plus vault cash equal to required reserves at other instititions.
3
Includes reserve balances and required clearing balances at Federal Reserve Banks in the current week plus vault cash held two
weeks earlier used to satisfy reserve requirements at all depository institutions plus currency outside the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve
Banks, the vaults of depository institutions, and surplus vault cash at depository institutions.

BUDGET OUTLAYS..

1
Starting in 1985 military retired pay will be financed from a trust fund in the income security function. The national defense
function will include accrual charges to pay for retirement benefits earned by currently active duty personnel, and these will be offset in
the undistributed offsetting receipts (employer share, employee retirement). The data for the earlier years have been adjusted to be
comparable to this new usage.
2
The Social Security Amendments of 1983 require that social security and medicare show in the budget as a separate function. In
previous budgets social security was in the income security function and medicare was in the health function. The data in this table
nave been reconstructed to be comparable for all years shown.

Note.—Under provisions of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the fiscal year for the Federal Government shifted beginning with
fiscal year 1977. Through fiscal year 1976, the fiscal year was on a July 1-June 30 basis; beginning October 1976 (fiscal year 1977),
the fiscal year is on an October 1-September 30 basis. The 3-month period from July 1, 1976 through September 30, 1976 is a
separate fiscal period known as the transition quarter.
Data for 1929-39 are according to the administrative budget and those beginning 1940 according to the unified budget.
Refunds of receipts are excluded from receipts and outlays.

Farm population as defined by Department of Agriculture and Department of Commerce, i.e., civilian population living on farms in
rural areas, regardless of occupation. See also footnote 7.
2
Total population of United States including Armed Forces overseas, as of July 1.
3
Includes persons doing farmwork on all farms. These data, published by the Department of Agriculture, differ from those on
agricultural employment by the Department of Labor (see Table 6-29) because of differences in the method of approach, in concepts of
employment, and in time of month for which the data are collected.
4
Acreage harvested plus acreages in fruits, tree nuts, and farm gardens.
5
Fertilizer, lime, and pesticides.
6
Nonfarm constant dollar value of feed, seed, and livestock purchases.
7
Based on new definition of a farm. Under old definition of a farm, farm population (in thousands and as percent of total
population) for 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, and 1982 is 7,806 and 3.6; 8,005 and 3.6; 7,553 and 3.4; 7,241 and 3.2; 6,942 and 3.0;
and 6,870 and 3.0, respectively.
8
Previous basis for farm employment series has been discontinued. Employment after 1980 is estimated.

Note.—Population includes Alaska and Hawaii beginning 1960.

investment income and included in other services, net.

In concept, balance on goods and services is equal to net exports and imports in the national income and product accounts (and
the sum of balance on current account and allocations of special drawing rights is equal to net foreign investment in the accounts),
although the series differ because of different handling of certain items (gold, extraordinary military shipments, etc.), revisions, etc.

1
Civilian unemployment rates, approximating U.S. concepts. Data for United Kingdom exclude Northern Ireland. Quarterly data for
France, West Germany, and United Kingdom should be viewed as less precise indicators of unemployment under U.S. concepts than the
annual data. Beginning 1977, changes in the Italian survey resulted in a large increase in persons enumerated as unemployed. However,
many also reported tnat they had not actively sought work in the past 30 days. Such persons have been provisionally excluded for
comparability with U.S. concepts; their inclusion would more than double the rates shown for Italy.
2
Hourly compensation in manufacturing, U.S. dollar basis. Data relate to all employed persons (wage and salary earners and the selfemployed) in the United States and Canada, and to all employees (wage and salary earners) in the other countries. For France and
United Kingdom compensation adjusted to include changes in employment taxes that are not compensation to employees, but are labor
costs to employers.
