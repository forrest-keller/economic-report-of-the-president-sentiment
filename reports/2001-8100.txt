ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT
To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to report that the American economy today is strong. We are
enjoying the longest economic expansion ever recorded, with more than
22 million new jobs since 1993, the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years,
the lowest female unemployment rate in 40 years, the lowest Hispanic and
African-American unemployment rates ever recorded, and the highest home
ownership rate on record.
This economic expansion has been not only unusually long, but also
broad and deep. For the first time in decades, wages are rising at all income
levels. We have the lowest child poverty in 20 years and the lowest poverty
rate for single mothers ever recorded. Since 1993 the median family income
has gone up more than $6,000, and for African-American families it has
risen even more. The number of families who own stock has grown by
40 percent.
Our current economic strength is the result not of chance, but of a choice
the American people made 8 years ago. At that time, 10 million of our fellow
citizens were out of work. Interest rates were high. The Federal budget
deficit was $290 billion and rising. And the Federal debt had quadrupled in
the previous 12 years, imposing a crushing burden on our economy and on
our children.
The American people chose to change direction, and empowered by that
choice, Vice President Gore and I put in place a new economic strategy:
fiscal discipline, greater investment in our people, and expanded trade. The
result of that three-part strategy has been 8 years of prosperity and progress.
Continuing with this proven strategy is the best way to keep that prosperity
and progress going.

The Administration’s Economic Agenda
Our strategy has been based, first and foremost, on a commitment to fiscal
discipline. By first cutting and then eliminating the deficit, we have helped
to create a virtuous cycle of lower interest rates, greater investment, more
jobs, higher productivity, and higher wages. In the process we have gone
from the largest deficits in history to the largest surpluses in history. We have
extended the life of the Medicare trust fund to 2025—when I was elected
President, it was scheduled to go bankrupt in 1999. And we have paid off
$362.5 billion in debt.

Second, our strategy has focused on investing more in education, health
care, and science and technology, to strengthen our people’s capacity to
make the most of the new opportunities of the 21st century. We have
doubled funding for Head Start, provided after-school opportunities and
mentoring to more than a million young people, and begun putting 100,000
new, well-trained teachers in the early grades to lower class size. These investments, combined with an insistence on high standards for all students and
accountability for results, have helped improve student achievement nationwide: reading, math, and SAT scores are all up. And with the largest
expansion of college aid since the G.I. Bill, more students than ever are going
on to college.
We have also invested in our people through targeted tax relief, to help
Americans meet the challenges of work and child rearing. Last year alone,
our HOPE Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credits helped 10 million
families pay for college. Our expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit
will help 15 million families work their way toward the middle class. And
25 million families will get a $500 child tax credit. The typical American
family today is paying a lower share of its income in Federal income taxes
than at any time during the past 35 years.
Since 1993 we have increased funding for long-term research and
development—investments that lead to more economic growth, more
high-wage jobs, more cures for diseases, and a cleaner environment. Funding
for the National Institutes of Health, for instance, has nearly doubled over
the past 7 years.
Meanwhile we have continued to make important investments in our
Nation’s communities. Our Empowerment Zone tax credits are bringing new
business and new jobs to our hardest pressed communities, from the inner
cities to Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta to Native American communities.
With the help of 100,000 more community police officers funded for our
streets, and commonsense measures such as the Brady law and the assault
weapons ban that keep guns out of the wrong hands, crime has fallen to
a 26-year low. Under the State Children’s Health Insurance Program,
2 million previously uninsured children now have health coverage.
Third, our economic strategy has focused on opening markets around the
world. Today, with more than 300 new trade agreements in place, including
the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay Round agreements, American workers and firms are competing in more markets than
ever before, and our economy is stronger for it.

4 | Economic Report of the President

Continuing Our Economic Strategy
Last year we took important new actions to secure our economic future,
guided by the same three-part strategy. We normalized trade with China, a
move that will open China’s markets to American products from wheat to
cars to consulting services. It will also ensure that American companies will
be better able to sell goods in China without having to move factories or
investments there. Congress also passed, and I signed, a 2001 budget that
maintains our commitment to fiscal discipline. Under this new budget we
will continue to pay down the debt. If we stay on this path, we can make
America debt-free by 2012 for the first time since Andrew Jackson was
President in 1835, thereby keeping interest rates low and prosperity going strong.
The 2001 budget also continues our strategy of investing in our people.
It includes the largest-ever increase in funding for the National Science
Foundation and major increases in funding for education. A new,
$1.2 billion investment will help thousands of school districts make emergency
repairs and renovations to our children’s classrooms. We have increased by
25 percent the funding dedicated to our goal of hiring 100,000 new, highly
qualified teachers, to reduce class size. We have nearly doubled funding for
after-school programs to help more than 1.3 million students, while
increasing support for teacher training and for turning around failing
schools. And to open the doors of college even wider, we have increased
the maximum Pell grant to an all-time high of $3,750—up nearly $1,500
since 1993.
The new budget also includes our historic New Markets and Renewal
Communities Initiative, the most significant effort ever to help hard-pressed
communities lift themselves up through entrepreneurship and access to new
capital. With our New Markets tax credit, 40 Empowerment Zones, and
40 renewal communities, this initiative will spur billions in private investment
in communities that have not yet shared in our great economic revival.
This is a unique moment in U.S. history, a time of unrivaled prosperity
and progress, with few internal crises or external threats. We have the responsibility to use our good fortune wisely. If we maintain our current economic
strategy, we can sustain our prosperity, expand the circle of opportunity, meet
the long-term challenges of this new century, and provide our children the
chance to live their dreams.

The Making of the New Economy

O

ver the last 8 years the American economy has transformed itself so
radically that many believe we have witnessed the creation of a New
Economy. This Report presents evidence of fundamental and unanticipated
changes in economic trends that justify this claim. In the 1990s, after two
decades of disappointing performance, the economy enjoyed one of its most
prosperous periods ever. Strong and rising growth in real gross domestic
product (GDP), declining and then very low unemployment, and a low,
stable core inflation rate characterize the long expansion. Even though
growth moderated in the second half of 2000, the achievements of the past
8 years remain impressive.
From the first quarter of 1993 through the third quarter of 2000, real
GDP grew at an average annual rate of 4.0 percent—46 percent faster than
the average from 1973 to 1993. This exceptional growth reflects both strong
job creation and increased productivity growth. Americans are working in
record numbers: the number of payroll jobs has increased by more than
22 million since January 1993, and in 2000 the share of the population
employed reached its highest level on record. Also in 2000 the unemployment
19

rate dipped to 3.9 percent, the lowest level in a generation. Unemployment
rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans were the lowest since
separate statistics for these groups were first collected in the early 1970s.
Americans are not only working more; they are also working smarter. The
economy has rapidly become more productive. Since the beginning of 1993,
output per hour in the nonfarm business sector has grown at an average rate
of 2.3 percent per year, compared with an average of 1.4 percent per year for
the previous 20 years. Even more remarkably, since the fourth quarter of
1995 productivity growth has averaged 3 percent per year. This acceleration
in productivity has produced higher incomes and greater wealth. From 1993
to 1999, the real income of the median household grew more than in any
period of similar length in the last 30 years. Meanwhile the value of corporate
stocks has nearly trebled, even after taking into account the downward
adjustment in stock prices during 2000.
These income gains have also been widely shared: even incomes at the
bottom of the distribution have risen rapidly (Chart 1-1). Disadvantaged
groups have seen their situation improve markedly. The overall poverty rate
declined to 11.8 percent in 1999 (the most recent year for which data are
available), its lowest level since 1979 and 3.3 percentage points below the
rate in 1993. The poverty rate for African Americans was 23.6 percent in
1999—still too high, but far below the 1993 level of 33.1 percent. The poverty
rates for Hispanic Americans and elderly Americans have also fallen sharply.

20 | Economic Report of the President

This chapter describes the remarkable achievements of the 1990s and the
factors that gave rise to the New Economy. The chapter identifies the sources
of the economy’s faster growth and estimates the contribution of each. The
focus is on information technology and the factors that reinforce its impact:
organizational change and sound economic policy. Updated, sector-specific
data on productivity gains indicate that those sectors that have invested the
most in information technology—wholesale trade and finance, among
others—experienced some of the greatest productivity gains during the
1990s. The chapter then highlights the importance of innovation in business
practices in firms throughout the economy. It goes on to discuss the importance of sound fiscal policy, competition-enhancing trade and technology
policy, and effective social policy—all working together to further the
progress of the New Economy—and the gains that have already been made.
The chapter concludes by looking ahead to the challenges we will face in the
coming years to sustain the virtuous cycle of growth and innovation—and to
share fully in its rewards.

The Economy from 1973 to 1993
The remarkable economic trends of the 1990s took many by surprise.
They represent a distinct change from the 1970s and 1980s, decades in
which the economy was plagued by persistent inflation, periodically high
unemployment, slow growth in productivity, rising inequality, and large
Federal budget deficits. Stagflation was an unwelcome phenomenon of the
1970s, as two major oil shocks were followed by simultaneous inflation and
recession. The massive and costly recession of the early 1980s and the
collapse of oil prices in 1986 broke the back of the very high inflation rates
that had emerged in the late 1970s. But as unemployment fell below
6 percent in the late 1980s, core inflation started to climb again. Between
1973 and 1993, GDP growth received a boost from the large numbers of
women and baby-boomers entering the work force. But at the same time,
persistently slow productivity growth (averaging less than half of what it had
been during the preceding 25 years) kept GDP growth in check.
These trends affected the incidence of poverty. In the 1960s and early
1970s, poverty had been declining as economic progress gradually raised the
incomes of those at the bottom. The nationwide poverty rate, which had
stood at 22.2 percent in 1960, fell to 11.1 percent in 1973. But the combination of slow productivity growth and a relatively slack labor market likely
played a role in ending this improvement, dragging down household
incomes, especially for the poorest. The poverty rate continued to fluctuate,
falling during expansions in the business cycle and rising during contractions.
Chapter 1

| 21

However, throughout the 1980s it never fell lower than 12.8 percent,
far above the low of the early 1970s. And by 1993 poverty had risen to
15.1 percent, almost matching the 1983 level of 15.2 percent, its worst since
the 1960s.
Federal budget deficits had become commonplace in the 1970s, but they
increased rapidly in the 1980s in the presence of a fiscal policy based on
overly optimistic budget forecasts. Efforts to restore fiscal discipline in 1990
failed because of a weakening economy, and deficits grew worse rather than
better, reaching almost $300 billion in fiscal 1992. By the end of fiscal 1981,
publicly held Federal debt had fallen to 25.8 percent of GDP. By the end of
fiscal 1993 it had almost doubled, to 49.5 percent.
Given these problems, few believed in 1993 that the U.S. economy could
achieve and sustain low unemployment rates, moderate inflation, or robust
productivity growth, let alone all three. The Federal Government seemed
incapable of balancing its budget, and there was little to suggest that U.S.
incomes could grow more rapidly than those in other major industrial countries. Yet in the years that followed, all of these seemingly improbable events
occurred—and at the same time.

What Makes the Economy New?
The U.S. economy today displays several exceptional features. The first is
its strong rate of productivity growth. Since 1995 the trend rate of productivity growth has been more than double that of the 1973–95 period. A
second is its unusually low levels of both inflation and unemployment. In the
past, low levels of unemployment have usually meant sharply rising inflation.
Yet despite an unemployment rate that has been close to (and at times
below) 4 percent for 2 years, core inflation has remained in the 2 to 3 percent
range. A third is the disappearance of Federal budget deficits. Federal fiscal
policy often becomes more expansionary as a period of economic growth is
sustained, yet in the past 8 years the structural budget balance has moved
steadily from a massive deficit to a large surplus. A fourth is the strength of
the U.S. economy’s performance relative to other industrial economies. As a
world technological leader, the United States might have been expected to
grow more slowly than countries that can benefit from imitating the leader’s
technological advances. Yet over the second half of the 1990s, the United
States continued to enjoy both the highest income per capita and the fastest
income growth of the major industrial nations. These developments reveal
profound changes in economic trends that justify the term “New Economy.”
Three interrelated factors lie behind these extraordinary economic gains:
technological innovation, organizational changes in businesses, and public
22 | Economic Report of the President

policy. Information technology has long been important to the economy.
But in the early 1990s a number of simultaneous advances in information
technology—computer hardware, software, and telecommunications—
allowed these new technologies to be combined in ways that sharply
increased their economic potential.
In part to realize this potential, entrepreneurs instituted widespread
changes in business organizations, reconfiguring their existing businesses
and starting new ones. These changes included new production methods and
human resource management practices, new types of relationships with
suppliers and customers, new business strategies (with some firms expanding
the scope of their enterprises through mergers and acquisitions, and others
streamlining them to best utilize core competencies), and new forms of
finance and compensation.
Public policy was the third driving force. This Administration embraced
policies and strategies based on fiscal discipline, investing in people and technologies, opening new markets at home and abroad, and developing an
institutional framework that supported continued global integration.
Together these created an environment in which the new technologies and
organizational changes could flourish.
The interactions among these three factors have created a virtuous cycle in
which developments in one area reinforce and stimulate developments in
another. The result is an economic system in which the whole is greater than
the sum of its parts. New technologies have created opportunities for organizational innovations, and these innovations in turn have engendered demand
for these technologies and others still newer. The increased growth prompted
by the new technologies helped the Federal Government restrain its spending
growth and boosted its revenue; the resulting smaller budget deficits (and
later surpluses) have helped keep interest rates down, encouraging further
investment in new technologies. Economic policies directed toward
promoting competition have prodded firms to adopt the new technologies,
spurring other firms to innovate or be left behind. Policies aimed at opening
foreign markets have increased earnings in the U.S. technology sector,
leading to yet more innovation, including innovation in information technologies, which have lowered barriers to trade and investment still further.
These market-opening policies have also allowed U.S. producers to become
more productive, by expanding the variety of key inputs available to them.
This Report defines the New Economy by the extraordinary gains in
performance—including rapid productivity growth, rising incomes, low unemployment, and moderate inflation—that have resulted from this combination
of mutually reinforcing advances in technologies, business practices, and
economic policies.

Chapter 1

| 23

Sustaining the Virtuous Cycle
Americans can be gratified by the achievements of the last 8 years, but we
must not become complacent. The economy has been performing well for so
long now that there is a danger of taking growth for granted. There are good
reasons to believe that the long-term trend rate of productivity growth has
increased relative to the post-1973 trend, and many new technologies do not
yet appear to have exhausted their potential for further improvements.
On the other hand, more moderate economic growth is projected for
2001 and beyond. Hence the economic forecast described in Chapter 2 is
optimistic, but also cautious about the future.
In addition, it would be a grave error to assume that the economy has been
so transformed that the basic rules of economics no longer apply. The potential for faster growth exists, but demand cannot run ahead of supply without
the danger of rising inflation. The economy also remains susceptible to
cyclical fluctuations. Indeed, the rewards of the New Economy are associated
with increased risk, since the economy depends more heavily than before on
financial markets, which remain volatile.
Abandoning the public policies that have helped transform the economy
would also be a mistake. The current prosperity certainly reflects, above all,
the efforts of the private sector, but it would be wrong—and dangerous—to
ignore the contribution of policy. In particular, it would be risky to put aside
the policies that have helped us move from huge budget deficits to large
surpluses and have laid the groundwork for the capital formation that has
been so important in stimulating growth. It would be just as dangerous to
undermine the policies that have supported the investments in people and
technologies that are the keys to advancing productivity. It would be folly to
abandon the efforts to increase competition in markets at home and abroad,
because it is this competition that helped create a domestic business environment in which entrepreneurs can flourish and a global economy from which
all Americans can benefit. Finally, the government should continue its efforts
to ensure that prosperity is more widely shared, because this is something the
private sector will not automatically accomplish on its own.
A strong economy, even the extraordinary economy of the last 8 years,
cannot solve all America’s problems or guarantee that every American will be
better off. Important steps have been taken to spread the benefits of
economic growth to disadvantaged regions and families. But much remains
to be done. The resources are available to tackle the problems of insufficient
access to health insurance, of aging educational facilities, and of a Social
Security system that lacks adequate long-term reserves, to name a few. The
challenge is how best to use these resources to improve the well-being of
all Americans.
24 | Economic Report of the President

Information Technology and the New Economy
Spending on information technology has clearly played a leading role in
the recent acceleration of economic growth. Although this sector remains a
fairly small part of the economy—its share of GDP was an estimated 8.3
percent in 2000—it accounted for almost one-third of all output growth
between 1995 and 1999 (Chart 1-2). Even more remarkable, in 1999
business spending on information technology equipment and software was
responsible for more than 11 percentage points of the 14 percent real growth
in total equipment and software spending by business. The information
technology sector is also one that has seen a surge in innovation. To be sure,
the computer, the cell phone, optical fibers, lasers, and the Internet had all
been invented before the mid-1990s. But over the course of that decade, a
series of innovations in computer hardware and software and in telecommunications took place that has allowed for new and complementary
interactions among these technologies on an unprecedented scale—
a dramatic example of which is the emergence and increasing commercial use
of the World Wide Web.
There is a broad consensus that information technology has been important in the recent surge in economic performance. But the role of
developments beyond this sector remains more controversial. One view of
the recent economic transformation identifies the New Economy narrowly
with the production and use of information technology. Some proponents of

Chapter 1

| 25

this view argue that performance in the rest of the economy has simply
followed previous trends, or that the recent strong economic growth has
boosted it only temporarily.
Although the innovation and diffusion of information technology have
clearly been important, the broader definition of the New Economy adopted
in this Report more accurately conveys the pervasiveness of the recent
economic changes. A growing body of evidence now shows that the widespread application of information technologies has stimulated remarkable
improvements in production processes and other business practices outside
the information technology sector. But innovations in information technology and its use have not been the only source of such change. Indeed,
there has been a surge in innovation in other technologies as well. Together
with supportive public policies, these changes have fundamentally transformed the economy. An examination of recent productivity growth
supports this view.

The New Trend in Productivity Growth
Productivity is now growing considerably faster than it did over the 20
years after 1973 (Chart 1-3). What can be said about the sources of this
acceleration? Two simple analyses help to answer this question. The first estimates the contributions to growth in aggregate private nonfarm business
productivity from each of the different sources of that growth, such as
increases in the amount of capital per worker. The second uses data on
output and employment by industry to pinpoint the areas of economic
activity where the acceleration has taken place.

Sources of Growth: Capital, Labor Quality,
and Total Factor Productivity
A standard model of economic growth allows us to estimate how various
sources have contributed to the recent acceleration of productivity. Table 1-1
shows that productivity, measured as output per hour in the private nonfarm
business sector, accelerated in the late 1990s. Its growth rate rose from
an annual average of 1.4 percent before 1995 to an annual average of
3.0 percent from 1995 through 2000. The total acceleration from the first
period to the second is thus slightly more than 1.6 percentage points. (The
results reported in Chart 1-3 and Table 1-1 are based on real output increases
that are averages of growth in production and growth in income, each of
which is a valid measure of private nonfarm output. The chart and the table
differ slightly in that the latter covers the private nonfarm sector and therefore excludes government enterprises.) The first question to ask about this
26 | Economic Report of the President

total acceleration is how much, if any, of it is the result of business cycle
effects and how much is structural.

Productivity Growth and the Business Cycle
Productivity growth varies over the course of the business cycle, typically
speeding up in the early stages of booms and slowing or even turning negative in slumps. But changes in productivity also have an underlying
structural, or trend, component. There is no foolproof way to tease apart
these cyclical and structural components in the productivity changes one
actually observes. The increase in productivity growth after 1995, however, is
noteworthy in that it occurred at a time when the economy already was
enjoying a high rate of resource utilization. Sharp increases in productivity
have usually occurred in economies recovering from recession (Chart 1-3).
By contrast, since 1995 the U.S. economy has followed a steeper productivity
trend, which started well after the 1990–91 recession was over.
Statistical estimates suggest that almost none of the acceleration in productivity after 1995 has been cyclical. An econometric model in which hours
worked adjust gradually to changes in output indicates that, by 1995, strong
demand had already pushed actual productivity about 2 percentage points
above where it would have been otherwise. From 1995 through 2000, the
cyclical component of productivity edged up only slightly relative to its
trend, so that actual productivity grew only slightly faster (by 0.04 percentage
point) than structural productivity (Table 1-1). As of the third quarter of

of Labor (Bureau of Labor Statistics) for hours and for capital services and labor quality through 1998; and Council
of Economic Advisers for the business cycle effect and for capital services and labor quality for 1999 and 2000.

2000, the cyclical component of productivity was still above trend,
suggesting that actual productivity growth is likely to fall below trend growth
over the next year or so, as GDP growth moderates. But the estimates indicate that there has been a structural acceleration in productivity since 1995 of
slightly less than 1.6 percentage points.
Even though economists differ as to the correct way to adjust for responses
to the business cycle, the finding that a structural acceleration has taken place
is robust. For instance, even if the cyclical adjustment used here proved to be
in error, and in fact productivity growth after 1995 received a boost of as
much as 0.5 percentage point a year from shifts due to the business cycle, one
would still conclude that a structural acceleration of productivity of greater
than 1 percentage point has taken place.
The fact of a shift in the trend of structural productivity growth does not
tell us how permanent that shift will turn out to be. All one can say is that
the post-1995 acceleration does not appear to be associated with the normal
business cycle variation of productivity. Whether the structural trend that
emerged in 1995–2000 will continue for many more years, or whether
structural productivity growth will moderate sooner, remains uncertain. We
could be observing not a long-term shift to a faster productivity growth rate
but simply a shift to a higher level of productivity, with faster growth for a
while followed by a return to the pre-1995 trend. Or we may be witnessing
28 | Economic Report of the President

the opportunity for faster trend growth over a longer time span. Chapter 2
revisits this issue in the discussion of the forecast.

Contributors to the Structural Productivity Acceleration
In general, a structural acceleration in productivity can come from an
increase in any of the following four sources of growth or their combination:
• growth in the amount of capital per worker-hour throughout the
economy (capital deepening)
• improvements in the measurable skills of the work force, or labor quality
• total factor productivity (TFP) growth in computer-producing
industries, and
• TFP growth in other industries.
TFP growth is the increase in aggregate output over and above that due to
increases in the quantities of capital or labor inputs. For example, TFP
growth may result when a firm redesigns its production line in a way that
increases output while keeping the same number of machines, materials, and
workers as before.
Capital investment has been extremely strong during the current expansion. Particularly after 1995, investment in computers and software
responded markedly to robust economic growth, low real interest rates, a
strong stock market, and rapidly falling computer prices. As Table 1-1
shows, investment in information technologies added slightly more than
0.6 percentage point to the increase in structural productivity growth after
1995. Because the rate of investment in capital goods other than computer
hardware and software slowed during that period, the contribution of overall
capital deepening to increased productivity growth was only about
0.4 percentage point, or roughly 24 percent of the post-1995 acceleration
of structural productivity.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics measures labor quality in terms of the
education, gender, and experience of the work force. Using statistical
methods, the Bureau determines differences in earnings paid to workers with
different characteristics and infers that these relative wage differences reflect
relative productivity differences. Measured in this way, labor quality has risen
as the education and skills of the work force have increased. Because that
increase occurred at about the same rate before and after 1995, however, the
contribution of labor quality to the recent acceleration in productivity has
been negligible.
The rate of growth in TFP in computer-producing industries has been
rising. Computer prices have been falling as technological improvements are
adopted and made available commercially. The decline in prices was particularly marked from 1997 to 1999 (Chart 1-4). Calculations based on
Chapter 1

| 29

these price changes indicate that computer manufacturing accounts for about
0.2 percentage point, or about 11 percent, of the acceleration in structural
productivity.
The final contribution comes from accelerating TFP in the economy
outside the computer-producing industries. The contribution of this
“non–computer sector TFP” category is calculated as a residual; it captures
the extent to which technological change and other business and workplace
improvements outside the computer sector have boosted productivity growth
since 1995. This factor accounts for about 1.0 percentage point of the acceleration in productivity, or about 63 percent of the total. (The percentages do
not sum to 100 because of rounding.) This implies that improvements in the
ways capital and labor are used throughout the economy are central to the
recent acceleration in productivity. Some of these gains have likely resulted as
firms learn to apply innovative information technology to their particular
business and production methods.

Productivity Increases by Sector and Industry
The figures reported above indicate that both the more widespread use of
information technology and improvements in business practices have
boosted productivity growth. Data on productivity growth by industry
provide a further means of exploring this idea. If the story is correct, these
30 | Economic Report of the President

data should show, for example, an acceleration in productivity in wholesale
and retail trade as a result of improvements in distribution and supply chain
management. Improvements would also be expected in financial and
business services, both of which are heavy users of information technology.
Table 1-2 shows growth in value added per full-time equivalent employee
by industry in 1989–95 and 1995–99. With some important qualifications,
the evidence does show that productivity growth increased after 1995 in
industries that are heavy users of information technology. A further analysis
sorted industries into two groups according to the intensity with which they
use information technology (as indicated by the ratio of their spending on
information technology to their value added in 1996). The dividing line
between the two groups was determined such that each group accounted for
roughly half of the value added in the economy in 1996. The analysis found
that growth in value added per employee was considerably more rapid in the
more information technology–intensive group of industries between 1989
and 1999. In addition, the acceleration of value added per employee in this
group was more than 50 percent greater than the acceleration in the less
information technology–intensive group (Table 1-2).
Striking evidence of improvements in distribution and in the management
of the supply chain comes from wholesale and retail trade, both of which
experienced much faster productivity growth after 1995. In 1999 these
industries accounted for 25 percent of full-time equivalent employees in
private industry. Output in these industries increased significantly without
corresponding increases in employment.
Data for financial institutions as a group also show an acceleration in
productivity after 1995, supporting the view that these heavy users of information technology have performed well. Within financial institutions,
however, this observation holds true only for nondepository institutions and
brokers. Banks and other depository institutions experienced a reduction in
productivity growth after 1995. The insurance industry also experienced an
acceleration in productivity, reversing what had previously been negative
productivity growth.
The services sector showed an acceleration in productivity, but this sector
still experienced negative productivity growth after 1995. Business services
shifted from negative to positive productivity growth, as did personal
services. Health services, the largest industry in this sector, reduced its rate of
productivity decline.
On balance, the pattern of productivity growth by industry is consistent
with (although it does not prove) the view that improved business practices
and more-productive use of information technology have played an important role in the acceleration of productivity. In addition, some of the gain in
productivity is presumably associated with capital deepening.

Source: Council of Economic Advisers, based on data from Department of Commerce (Bureau of Economic Analysis).

Some difficulties in the data, however, both help explain certain puzzles or
anomalies in Table 1-2 and suggest that these results should not be taken as
definitive. First, consistent data on output and labor input by industry are
available only for 1987–99. The cyclical peak year of 1989 is taken as the
starting point here, further shortening the span of the data. The brevity of
the time periods before and after 1995 mean that observed growth rates may
not reflect actual industry trends. Second, output in the private sector (or in
nonfarm business) is computed initially at the aggregate level and then
broken down by industry. Because this process is inexact, productivity
growth can be overestimated in one industry and underestimated in another.
32 | Economic Report of the President

Third, difficulties in constructing price deflators for industries such as business services, insurance, and health care add errors and uncertainties to
estimates of productivity in these industries and in every industry that
purchases inputs from these hard-to-measure industries. The negative
productivity growth reported for health care, for example, seems inconsistent
with the rapid pace of technological innovation in that industry (see Chapter 5).
Despite these data problems, the industry results are important. Some
prior analyses based on earlier data appeared to conflict with the view that
productivity growth was increasing in computer-using industries. This new
evidence, however, broadly supports the view that the new technologies are
yielding economic benefits.

Learning from the New Productivity Trends
The breakdown of the sources of accelerated productivity and the analysis
of industry data suggest three important lessons:
• The information technology sector itself has provided a direct boost to
productivity growth. Part of the recent surge in productivity is the direct
result of productivity growth within this sector.
• The spread of information technology throughout the economy has been a
major factor in the acceleration of productivity through capital deepening.
Increasingly, companies have been eager and able to buy powerful
computers at relatively low prices. The rapid advances in computer
technology, together with favorable economic conditions, have fueled a
computer and software investment boom.
• Outside the information technology sector, organizational innovations and
better ways of applying information technology are boosting the productivity of skilled workers. A variety of changes that go beyond the direct
application of new computer technology, including structural changes
in private businesses and more effective use of worker skills, have
further boosted productivity.
What accounts for the changes revealed in this productivity analysis?
Answering this question requires moving behind the aggregate and industry
numbers to consider three sets of complementary developments: changes
within the information technology sector, changes in other sectors, and
changes in economic policy.

Chapter 1

| 33

Innovations in the
Information Technology Sector
Dramatic developments occurred within the information technology
sector in the 1990s, particularly in the second half of the decade, when the
pace of innovation accelerated. The top left panel of Chart 1-5 shows the
surge in private research and development (R&D) spending on information
technology, and the top right panel shows the increase in the pace of innovation (as measured by the number of information technology patents granted
annually). The bottom left panel depicts the surge in the production of
computers, semiconductors, and communications equipment: between 1992
and 2000, real output in this sector increased more than 13-fold. The
bottom right panel shows the rapid increase in employment in the industries
providing computer, data processing, and communications services.
The process by which new information technologies are created in the
United States has undergone a number of major changes that have transformed the ways in which such innovation occurs. In much of the postwar
period, defense spending was a major driver of innovation, and the Federal
budget was a more important source of R&D funding than it is today.
Innovation, however, was undertaken predominantly by large manufacturers,
and the U.S. economy was less integrated with the international economy
than it is today. That situation has changed considerably, as Chapter 3
describes in detail. Four developments in particular deserve mention: changes
in the competitive environment, changes in organizational structures,
changes in compensation and finance, and innovations in complementary
technologies.

Growing Competition
The information technology sector is being driven by heightened competition in an increasingly deregulated economy in which international trade
plays an ever-growing role. These pressures foster the creation and adoption
of new technologies, especially in the private sector, which has begun to play
a greater role in innovation since the end of the Cold War. When businesses
bring innovations to market, their rivals are given strong incentives to innovate as well. In the area of information technology, the firm that is the first to
gain market acceptance for a new type of product often gets to set the standard for that product, and therefore is most likely to capture the lion’s share
of the market. The innovating firm can then exploit its early success, to
develop the next generation of technology and products. The prospect of
second-generation success thus raises the premium on rapid innovation.

34 | Economic Report of the President

Chapter 1

| 35

For firms to have strong financial incentives to innovate, there must be
strong demand for such innovation from other firms in other industries.
Almost 70 percent of all information technology products are purchased by
the wholesale and retail trade, finance, and telecommunications industries.
Competition in these industries (often on a global level) encourages them to
seek out new technologies to improve their own productivity. Unlike in some
other countries, in which barriers to entry, pricing restrictions, and other
business restrictions restrain competition, in the United States competitive
pressures are generally strong. Deregulation in finance and telecommunications has helped create an increasingly competitive environment.
The number of new firms in the information technology sector is a
measure of the incentives and opportunity to innovate—and the figures
paint a dramatic picture. Between 1990 and 1997 the number of information technology firms more than doubled (Chart 1-6). Many innovations
have come from talented individuals in small startup companies that are
willing to take risks.

Organizational Changes
Competitive pressures have increased the importance of introducing new
products and processes quickly. Yet the know-how required to create these
products has become more complex and more dispersed. Today it is rarely

36 | Economic Report of the President

cost-effective for a single firm to control an entire innovation process. As a
result, businesses have altered the organizational structures within which
innovation takes place.
A smaller fraction of R&D now takes place within large, integrated
companies. Small firms are responsible for an increasing share of the Nation’s
industrial research. Collaboration between innovating firms has become
commonplace, as the dramatic growth in interfirm technology alliances in
the 1990s demonstrates. Furthermore, today’s innovations increasingly draw
upon scientific knowledge, much of which is developed by universities and
national laboratories. To take advantage of this science base, private firms are
now performing more basic research than ever before. And because proximity to these universities and national laboratories matters—by improving a
firm’s chances of capturing spillovers and of hiring high-quality researchers—
innovation today is often characterized by geographic concentration into
high-technology clusters such as Silicon Valley, California. In these clusters
and elsewhere, many new firms, free of the constraints often imposed in
large, established corporations, continually enter the market with new technologies and innovative business ideas.

Innovations in Compensation and Finance
New methods of financing have evolved to address the needs of new
entrants and of R&D in the information technology sector. Traditionally,
firms have used their physical plant and equipment as collateral for
financing. But the unique challenges of promoting innovation in sectors
where much of the know-how is based on intangible capital, plus the considerable risks involved in financing high-technology companies, have generated
new institutional arrangements. Venture capital, in particular, has played a
crucial role, supplying funds and providing management know-how and
connections for entrepreneurs. Initial public offerings (IPOs) have also been
instrumental. The information technology sector has made extensive use of
new compensation mechanisms that provide incentives to talented workers
and managers. For example, stock options enable firms to attract and retain
talent while passing some risk on to workers. The vibrant stock market has
also been important, allowing venture capitalists to cash out more easily
through IPOs and enabling workers holding stock options to boost their
earnings. In an important sense, success has generated success, as venture
capitalists score big and then use their augmented capital to seek out new
profit opportunities.
The excitement over the technology revolution drove technology stocks to
extraordinary heights in the spring of 2000, although they have retreated
since then. The volatility in technology equity markets can be disruptive to
companies seeking new funding, but investors’ willingness to take risks and
Chapter 1

| 37

the availability of financial resources for successful entrepreneurs continue to
make U.S. financial markets important contributors to the New Economy.
Even after the recent decline in the technology sector, price-earnings ratios
remain high. This indicates that investors are still willing to take a chance
on companies with low current earnings but the potential for rapid
future growth.

New Complementarities
The changes in the information technology sector have been both cumulative and complementary. Innovations in one area have created demands in
another. Breakthroughs in communications and data compression techniques, for instance, generate demand for improved software and for more
powerful computers. Complementarities operate on both the supply and the
demand sides. In particular, the falling costs associated with the use of
computers have made certain types of research feasible for the first time—
the mapping of the human genome, for instance, was made feasible by
computers. Information technology is becoming increasingly important in
the development of new treatment options, and the Food and Drug
Administration uses computers to streamline the analysis and approval of
new drugs. Demand is particularly powerful when it generates positive
feedback through network effects. E-mail, for example, becomes increasingly
useful as more people use it.
The evidence suggests, then, that a number of factors have combined to
create a uniquely favorable climate for entrepreneurs. These factors include a
growing demand for new and improved technologies (spurred by intense
domestic and global competition and technological complementarities), the
improved capacity of reorganized firms and networks to supply the new
technologies, and innovations in thriving financial markets.

Innovation Throughout the Economy
Simply buying and installing new technology does not automatically
increase productivity, profitability, or job creation. Yet some views of the
New Economy reveal a kind of naïve technological determinism that ignores
the vital role of complementary changes in production and business practices. Companies throughout the U.S. economy have been radically
transformed by new technologies that enable entire product networks to
become more efficient, effective, and integrated. These transformations are
detailed in Chapter 3, but a few of the most important changes are noted
here, including changes in production, inventory and supply management,
customer relations, and corporate structure.
38 | Economic Report of the President

New Production Methods
Innovations in information technology have generated many changes in
manufacturing processes. New technologies permit workers to analyze data
and make detailed adjustments to production lines on the plant floor,
boosting productivity, improving quality, and lowering costs. The availability
of data, often on a real-time basis, allows for continuous performance evaluation that can improve efficiency. Workers who have access to information
technology can be empowered with more decisionmaking responsibility. In
addition, the new technology allows organizations to disseminate information and coordinate their activities more easily, resulting in less hierarchical
organizational structures. In turn, these new structures may reduce costs and
further increase efficiency. Finally, as in the information technology sector
itself, innovations in the way workers are compensated can help firms achieve
greater productivity gains from new technology, spurring further innovation
in compensation and finance. Studies suggest that worker performance
improves when incentives are tied more closely to performance. Stock
options have become more common as a method of attracting, retaining, and
rewarding employees.

Changes in Inventory and Supply Chain Management
Firms typically hold inventories as a cushion against uncertainties.
Producers keep excess raw materials and other inputs on hand to prevent
shortages on the production line, for example, and stores maintain inventories to meet fluctuations in demand. The need for inventories springs in part
from incomplete information about demand. For this reason, technologies
that improve the dissemination of information enable companies to react
more promptly to market signals and to economize on inventories (by
sharing point-of-sale data, for example). Indeed, aggregate inventory-to-sales
ratios have fallen significantly since the early 1990s (Chart 1-7).
The new information technologies have also changed the nature of relationships between firms and their suppliers. Procurement practices have
changed radically, as firms become linked to suppliers through Internetbased business-to-business marketplaces. This capability allows businesses to
streamline procurement activities, lower transactions costs, improve the
management of supplier relationships, and even engage in collaborative
product design. “Just-in-time” delivery, facilitated by a more efficient transportation network including both surface and aviation infrastructure, has
been instrumental in allowing firms to reduce inventories and lower costs
while continuing to provide essential services to producers and consumers.

Chapter 1

| 39

New Relationships with Customers
Information technologies give firms the ability to develop richer, more
targeted relationships with their customers. Firms are able to tailor marketing
and product design more precisely to customer needs. Customers, in turn,
are able to find and compare the products that most closely match their preferences. Scanner data from retail stores allow companies to monitor which
items are selling and which are not. This information can be transmitted
back to manufacturers, who can then adjust their production schedules. This
avoids stockouts and surplus inventory. The information from scanners can
also be used for marketing. Customers who have purchased outdoor adventure products, for example, can be sent information on related gear or travel
opportunities that they may wish to purchase.

Shifting Corporate Boundaries
Markets allocate resources efficiently by setting prices, expanding choices,
and encouraging competition. But in situations where pricing and writing
contracts is costly and difficult, where uncertainty is high, and where information is difficult to come by, some activities may be more efficiently
undertaken within the firm than in the marketplace. Transactions costs thus
affect the make-or-buy decision, which determines where the firm’s boundaries end and the market begins. Information technologies can radically
change where these boundaries should be drawn, and this sets in motion
40 | Economic Report of the President

both centrifugal and centripetal forces. An example of the latter is the large
number of recent mergers, some motivated by the belief on the part of some
firms that new technology allows the span of organization to be extended. As
Chart 1-8 shows, both the number and the value of mergers and acquisitions
have moved to new heights as firms seek to capitalize on both efficiency gains
and increased market power. On the other hand, many small firms may be
able to benefit by specializing in a few core activities. This can lead companies to spin off parts of their operations—an example of centrifugal forces
at work.

Behind the New Trends: The Role of Policy
The Administration’s policy strategy has complemented and fostered the
private sector initiatives that generated these new trends. The approach has
rested on three major pillars: fiscal discipline, investing in people and technologies, and opening markets at home and abroad. Each of these policy
emphases has contributed to the economic environment in which the New
Economy has thrived. They have promoted the emergence of an economy in
which innovative new businesses are stimulated by relatively low interest
rates, an abundant supply of risk capital, world-class educational and research
institutions, a well-educated and well-trained work force, competitive
product and labor markets, and the development and diffusion of the
Chapter 1

| 41

Internet. In addition, the Administration has pursued new social policies to
ensure that the American people have the opportunities to share in the gains
of the New Economy.

Fiscal Discipline
The Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1993 was the right policy
package at the right time. The Federal funds rate had been moved to a low
3 percent in 1992 in an attempt to stimulate the economy and create jobs.
But long-term interest rates remained stubbornly high. The 10-year Treasury
bond rate averaged 7.0 percent in 1992—unusually high for a weak
economy. Bond yields were being predictably affected by the forces of supply
and demand: the Federal Government was set to run a deficit of almost
$300 billion, adding a massive new increment to the already swollen stock of
outstanding debt. With an oversupply of government bonds and the
prospect of even more to come, bond and stock prices were depressed, and
yields were correspondingly high.
In 1992 the new Administration was elected on a promise to turn the
deficits around. After a tough political battle in 1993, the Administration
was able to deliver on that promise. The 1981 reductions in tax rates for
those in the upper income brackets were partly rolled back, and Federal
spending was restrained. The markets responded quickly to this serious effort
to address the deficit by lowering expectations of future inflation, and longterm interest rates accordingly fell. The 10-year Treasury rate hit a low of
5.3 percent in October 1993. Over the next year or so, the combination of a
stronger economy and the Federal Reserve’s decision to boost short-term
rates pushed long-term rates slightly upward again, but they remained lower
than they would have been without deficit reduction.
As economic growth and further restraints on spending (including the
bipartisan 1997 budget agreement) turned the huge deficits into surpluses, a
new fiscal environment emerged. The 10-year Treasury rate fell below
6 percent in 1998 and 1999. And despite the extraordinarily strong economy
and associated upward movement in short-term rates, that rate stood at only
5.7 percent in November 2000. With a swing in the budget balance of an
impressive $492 billion over the last 7 years, the budget surplus for fiscal
2000 came in at $236 billion, or 2.4 percent of GDP.
Chart 1-9 shows budget deficits and surpluses in each fiscal year from
1970 to 2000. The ups and downs caused by the business cycle are clearly
visible. But even clearer are the trend prior to 1993 and the subsequent sharp
turnaround. The 1993 deficit reduction act and subsequent restraints on
spending both fueled and capitalized on the private sector’s potential for
rapid growth. (See Chapter 2 for more discussion of fiscal policy and
the deficit.)
42 | Economic Report of the President

The most direct link between improved fiscal discipline and growth is that
through low interest rates, which encourage investment. As interest rates fall,
financing of all kinds of activities becomes less costly. In addition, low
interest rates help keep the stock market strong, allowing companies both old
and new to lower their cost of capital. Ultimately, the combination of falling
prices for investment goods and reduced interest costs stimulated dramatic
growth in investment. Led by equipment and software purchases, investment
grew 13 percent per year between the first quarter of 1993 and the third
quarter of 2000. Investment is not the only engine of growth, but new technologies cannot be acquired without it. Strong investment is essential to
rapid growth, and by reducing the amount of saving that must go to finance
the public debt, fiscal discipline has made room for strong investment.
The result has been a virtuous cycle, in which the right policies in 1993
kicked off a chain reaction of smaller deficits, lower costs of capital, higher
investment, increased technology in the workplace, and faster economic
growth. As the deficit became a surplus, the virtuous cycle kept turning.

Investing in People and Technology
If fiscal discipline had been achieved through cutbacks in education,
training, and technological development, it probably would have failed. At
the least it would have undermined the potential for long-term growth. But
Chapter 1

| 43

the Administration did not make this mistake; instead its budget proposals
consistently pushed for increased spending for growth-oriented programs
while reducing total outlays. And although not all the requests were approved
in the final budgets, substantial funding increases did occur in these areas.
Investments in people have come along several fronts. The Administration
has invested in children through support of kindergarten through 12th grade
(K-12) education, it has helped Americans attend college, and it has worked
hard to improve the training opportunities available to American workers.
Our public schools play a crucial role in determining the future productivity of American workers. The Federal Government has been an important
contributor to K-12 education by helping to ensure a more equitable distribution of opportunities. Federal funds offset a good deal of the difference in
educational spending between rich and poor districts. Through the E-rate
program, the Administration has helped schools invest in new technologies
for the classroom. The Administration has also provided leadership on initiatives to reduce class size, raise standards, and improve accountability.
Programs such as the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program
help communities utilize their school buildings after school hours to provide
enriching programs for children.
The New Economy has provided increasing rewards for higher education.
Responding to this fundamental change in the labor market, the
Administration has helped students prepare for college through the GEAR
UP (Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs)
and TRIO programs. These programs help students in high-poverty schools
and from low-income families through academic enrichment programs and
mentoring. For students who are admitted to college, Administration
programs such as the HOPE Scholarship tax credit and the Lifetime
Learning tax credit help students and their families afford the tuition. The
Administration has also substantially increased the funds available through
the Pell grant program.
Because learning continues throughout a lifetime, and skills often need to
be updated, the Administration has strongly supported training programs for
those already in the work force or seeking to rejoin it. The Workforce
Investment Act provides job training and job search assistance, with priority
given to low-income and displaced workers. In conjunction with the
programs of the Workforce Investment Act, Youth Opportunity Grants help
at-risk youths develop job skills. The Administration has also supported the
NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance program to address the needs of
workers affected by economic dislocations resulting from the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
During the past 8 years, research funding at the National Science
Foundation has been increased by more than 60 percent, and that for the
44 | Economic Report of the President

National Institutes of Health by more than 80 percent. Information technology has also been targeted for increased research. For fiscal 2001 the
President requested more than $2 billion in Federal support for information
technology research, which will substantially increase the Federal commitment to R&D in this area. He also called for a new initiative in
nanotechnology, which could someday lead to the ability to store the information equivalent of the Library of Congress in a device the size of a sugar
cube, and the development of materials that are 10 times stronger than steel
but a fraction of the weight.
Of equal importance has been the Administration’s commitment to
fostering innovation in the private sector. The Research and Experimentation
tax credit has been extended through 2004. The Administration supported
the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which imposed a moratorium on Internet
taxes, enhancing the ability of entrepreneurs to explore new commercial
applications of this medium. The White House’s Framework for Global
Electronic Commerce called for private sector leadership and limited government involvement: government should intervene only to support a
predictable, consistent, and simple legal environment for e-commerce. The
Administration has also supported reform through the Telecommunications
Act of 1996, which encouraged competition in the telecommunications
industry and has led to lower prices, more customer choice, and faster
deployment of broadband networks to homes and businesses.

Setting the Rules for Fair and Open Competition
The United States has long had a bipartisan agenda aimed at expanding
world trade and investment, and a succession of Administrations have negotiated trade agreements in various forums. Over the past 8 years, this
Administration has sustained the Nation’s agenda for international trade,
signing and achieving ratification of a series of important international agreements. These include the North American Free Trade Agreement establishing
a free-trade area throughout Canada, Mexico, and the United States; the
Uruguay Round agreement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
which set up the World Trade Organization (WTO), a rules-based, memberdriven organization that regulates tariffs and trade worldwide; multilateral
agreements within the WTO on trade in financial services, basic telecommunications, and information technology; a moratorium on tariffs on
digitally delivered goods; and an agreement with China that has paved the
way for its entry into the WTO. This extraordinary record of achievement
has already paid off in improved economic performance and will contribute
to continued growth ahead.

Chapter 1

| 45

Globalization, spurred in part by these and other agreements, has been
particularly important in promoting the competitive pressures that have
made the U.S. economy so innovative. Foreign competition encourages U.S.
firms to improve and innovate, as firms that compete against the best companies in the world are likely to adopt best practices themselves. U.S.
companies have also had the opportunity to take their own best technologies
and practices overseas through exports and foreign direct investment.
Globalization has also increased price competition, helping to keep
inflation down.
Globalization has also played a key role in enhancing domestic production
and adoption of information technologies. By exporting to global markets,
U.S. innovators have achieved scale economies that can increase the returns
to R&D in information technology. U.S.-based producers also use components that can be produced more cheaply abroad than at home to make
products that are internationally competitive. The importance of such global
linkages for the computer industry is vividly indicated in Chart 1-10, which
shows that, in 1999, imports accounted for fully 60 percent of U.S. domestic
spending on computers, while about 50 percent of domestically produced
computers were exported.
International competition has reinforced competition at home. The vast
U.S. market provides a competitive environment for most industries, even
without foreign trade. This large national market has been one of the great
strengths of the U.S. economy over the years. But competition can be threat-

46 | Economic Report of the President

ened if a single company abuses its dominance in a market. Under this
Administration, this threat has been met by the active enforcement of U.S.
antitrust laws. These laws do not discourage successful companies from
growing and gaining market share by creating competitive products and
services. Rather, they prevent companies from seeking to gain a market position that would threaten competition in an industry. Antitrust laws limit
corporate conduct that undermines competition and consequently harms
consumers. Indeed, the ultimate goal of antitrust legislation is to protect
consumers’ interests.
Regulatory policies have also promoted competition. The regulatory
reform movement has been bipartisan ever since its beginnings in the 1970s,
and the 1990s have been no exception. The 1996 Telecommunications Act
and auctions of portions of the electromagnetic spectrum to telecommunications providers have allowed new companies to compete against existing
ones and dramatically expand the availability of wireless service. This
industry has exploded with new investment and new services, and with a
third generation of wireless service on the horizon, it is vital that progress
not be slowed.
In financial services, the Glass-Steagall provisions instituted in the 1930s
prevented banks from joining with stockbrokers and insurance companies to
create financial monopolies. Restrictions on interstate banking prevented
bankers from straying too far from the geographic areas they knew well.
Given the massive financial instability of the 1930s, narrowing the range of
banks’ activities was arguably important for that day and age. But those rules
are not needed today, and the easing of interstate banking rules, along with
the passage of the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, have
removed them, while maintaining appropriate safeguards. These steps allow
consolidation in the financial sector that will result in efficiency gains and
provide new services for consumers.

Social Policies
As shown earlier, the stunning economic performance over the past 8 years
has generated sharp reductions in poverty and across-the-board improvements in income. The expansion has created a high-employment economy
that has provided economic opportunities for disadvantaged workers and
those who have not yet acquired marketable skills. Faster growth in labor
hours made an important contribution to the acceleration in output that
occurred in the second half of the 1990s. In a tight labor market, employers
hire and train workers they might previously have passed over. During the
1990s employers hired and trained young people and older workers, who
typically comprise an untapped pool of potential. But specific policies have
also expanded opportunities.
Chapter 1

| 47

The Earned Income Tax Credit increases the payoff from work for lowincome families, especially those with children. Since 1993 the benefits and
coverage of this credit have been expanded. In 1999 beneficiaries received a
total of nearly $31 billion (compared with $15.5 billion in 1993), and the
number of families receiving assistance increased by one-third, from 15
million to nearly 20 million. The minimum wage operates in tandem with
the Earned Income Tax Credit to raise the incomes of working families. The
Administration proposed an additional $1 increase in the minimum wage in
2000. Even without this change, when combined with the maximum
40 percent subsidy from the Earned Income Tax Credit, the effective
minimum wage is $7.21 per hour of work. The cost to employers, however,
is much lower. Meanwhile welfare reform has encouraged families to become
self-sufficient and has supported them as they make the transition to work.
The Administration is reaching out to communities left behind by economic
growth with its New Markets Initiative, passed with bipartisan support.
Some have suggested that all government programs designed to help the
disadvantaged reduce incentives and discourage economic growth. This argument maintains that only a laissez-faire policy is compatible with the labor
market flexibility necessary to achieve strong economic performance. But the
Earned Income Tax Credit, welfare reform, assistance with the transition
from welfare to work, and support for lifelong learning all indicate that
government intervention can both improve incentives to work and reduce
economic inequality.

Challenges for the Future
Economic performance in the last 8 years has been so strong and so qualitatively different from that of the previous two decades that it may seem
obvious that a New Economy has emerged. When productivity growth and
GDP growth both accelerate sharply, when unemployment and inflation fall
to their lowest levels in 30 years, when poverty starts to fall again after years
of worsening, and when incomes accelerate across the board, clearly a significant change has occurred.
In addition, the economic transformations described in this Report point
to a truly New Economy. Information technology has become a pervasive
part of economic life, changing the way nearly all Americans work—from
farmers using the Internet to check a satellite report on soil moisture, to software designers using the latest technology to create a new learning program.
Computers have been facilitating change in business systems for some time,
but the explosive growth in the production and use of information
technology that has taken place in recent years has gone much further. The
48 | Economic Report of the President

American economy has been profoundly altered. The innovations that have
taken place both within the information technology sector and throughout
the rest of the economy have included complementary developments in
organization, business practices, and public policies.
But the New Economy label is easy to misuse. The New Economy cannot
be invoked as the solution to all of America’s problems. Its emergence does
not mean that the lessons of economic history can be discarded or that
concern for the disadvantaged and elderly can be forgotten. As we describe in
the rest of the Report, there remain many challenges ahead. This chapter
concludes with a brief summary of each of the remaining chapters and the
principal challenges that they identify for policy.

Preserving Fiscal Discipline
Chapter 2 describes how changes associated with the New Economy
continued to be reflected in macroeconomic performance during 2000.
Although growth began to moderate in the third quarter, it was still on track
to be about 4 percent over the course of the year. The remarkable combination of very low unemployment and tame inflation remained evident even as
the economy proceeded through its 10th year of expansion. Investment
in equipment and software remained robust, and productivity growth
was very strong.
The chapter goes on to describe the challenges faced in 2000 as the
economy negotiated some speed bumps, such as the cooling off of the stock
market and rising oil prices. Although risks can never be eliminated, the
virtuous cycle of sound budget policies and strong economic performance
has left future policymakers with an economy that is well positioned
to weather possible storms. The chapter also presents the Administration’s
forecast for the next 11 years.
For the longer term, the chapter examines the historic turnaround in the
budget outlook since 1993 and the challenge of preserving the fiscal discipline that has been achieved. The aging of the population will put increased
pressure on budget resources for such programs as Social Security and
Medicare as the new century progresses. The chapter describes how, by
taking appropriate actions now to preserve the budget surplus and make
sound investments, the resources can be made available to deal with these
pressures when they arise. And although the New Economy will not stop the
population from aging, its continued manifestation in strong productivity
growth can be a further help in dealing with this challenge.

Chapter 1

Nurturing a Vibrant Private Sector
Chapter 3 looks at the sources of performance improvements in plants,
firms, and industries. It traces these improvements to technological innovation, particularly in information technology, along with complementary
organizational practices that enhance the productivity of this technology and
the emergence of a more competitive business environment. The analysis
attributes the recent surge of technological innovation to strong demand for
new technologies, financial market innovations such as venture capital and
initial public offerings, organizational changes, increases in private sector
R&D (including funding for basic research), and strong legal protection for
intellectual property.
Technological innovation has been particularly important for two reasons.
First, the information technology–producing sector itself is highly productive, and the growth of this sector has led to increased performance for the
economy as a whole. Second, the adoption of information technology has led
to performance gains in other sectors of the economy, making other inputs
more productive by changing the way firms do business. Manufacturing
plants are increasingly automated, and workers are being given more flexible
job assignments and stronger incentives through new compensation arrangements. Supplier relationships are becoming more closely integrated through
the use of computer systems that coordinate the various aspects of production and warehousing, allowing firms to reduce inventories dramatically.
Firm boundaries are also shifting rapidly, as firms outsource their noncore
businesses and move toward flexible, collaborative relationships such as
strategic alliances with suppliers, customers, and even rivals.
The end result is an economy that is unusually vibrant, dynamic, and
entrepreneurial, with a high rate of business formation—and of business
failure. It is important that this dynamic, competitive framework be retained.
Although government action is often needed to lay out the rules of the
competitive game, it is essential that market participants be allowed to innovate and experiment. For example, the Administration took important steps
in September 2000 to ensure that adequate electromagnetic spectrum will be
available for new commercial communications technologies such as thirdgeneration wireless technology. At the same time, however, U.S. wireless
carriers will be free to work with their customers and suppliers to determine
exactly how these technologies should be delivered.

Ensuring That Globalization
Enhances the New Economy
Chapter 4 examines two interrelated phenomena: how advances in
communications and technology allow for expanded international trade and
50 | Economic Report of the President

financial flows, and how increased globalization is spurring competition and
innovation. Indeed, it is no coincidence that the New Economy has emerged
in the United States at the same time that U.S. participation in the global
economy has reached new heights, because globalization and the recent
advances in information technology are inextricably linked. On the one
hand, globalization has played a crucial role in promoting the technological
innovation and facilitating the organizational restructuring that has yielded a
New Economy. On the other hand, improvements in information technology have spurred deeper integration between the United States and the
world economy.
The economic policy of this Administration has played a vital role in
fostering globalization, and thus in raising the incentives for competition and
innovation. Among the accomplishments of the Administration are the
historic agreements listed earlier in this chapter. At the same time, a focus of
U.S. trade policy has been to ensure that these and other agreements safeguard global natural resources and respect our Nation’s values, including our
commitment to core labor standards.
The effects of globalization and improved communications and technology are evident in U.S. international transactions. Trade in capital goods
has soared since 1996, with particularly strong growth in items central to the
New Economy, such as computers, semiconductors, and telecommunications equipment. There has also been strong export growth in intellectual
properties and in services that reflect the value of U.S. innovation, such as
business and technical services and financial services.
Although increased globalization and technological improvements have
raised U.S. economic performance and contributed to our prosperity, they
have also brought new challenges. Chapter 4 focuses on several of these,
including the widened U.S. current account deficit, ways to increase growth
in our major trading partners, and the implication of globalization and technology for developing countries. Along with the gains, globalization and
technology have required adjustments as change affects workers, industries,
and communities in the United States. The chapter therefore discusses the
Administration’s efforts to ensure that those who have not shared in the gains
are helped to acquire the tools that will allow them to do so. Finally, the
chapter examines the ways in which U.S. economic policy seeks to preserve
the environment and support labor standards, and discusses the challenges
that technology poses for countries’ legal institutions, for example through its
misuse for tax evasion.

Creating an Economy That Works for All
The New Economy has brought a great many good things to our Nation.
But it cannot solve all our problems. Left unassisted, it will not guarantee an
Chapter 1

| 51

equitable distribution of opportunities or an optimal use of all resources.
Chapter 5 analyzes the programs and policies designed to help those who
might otherwise be left behind and to improve the quality of life for all
Americans. The chapter focuses on four important topics that have a direct
impact on the well-being of Americans. It examines the Nation’s welfare,
education, and health care programs and the best ways to manage the
growing pains of our most rapidly growing communities.
Each of these areas has been characterized by important innovations
during the last 8 years. Our system of providing for the least well off
Americans has changed substantially. Public assistance programs now reward
work, making it easier for families to leave welfare and share in the New
Economy. Policies such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, child care subsidies, and extensions of health insurance coverage provide assistance to
low-income working families. Innovations in health care are directly
improving the quality of life for many, and new programs are bringing
computers and the Internet to the classroom, helping improve teacher effectiveness, reducing class size, and narrowing the digital divide. Finally,
policies that aim to reduce sprawl and encourage smart growth are being
implemented by forward-looking communities nationwide.
Despite the vast improvements in the quality of life experienced by many
Americans, several challenges remain. Welfare rolls have fallen sharply: the
number of people receiving welfare benefits is down by 59 percent since
January 1993. However, some who have left welfare are in jobs that leave
them with less income than they had while on welfare, and these individuals
are likely to be among the first to lose their jobs should the economy slow.
There is also the challenge of what to do for those who remain on welfare.
Current law sets a lifetime limit of 5 years on receipt of welfare benefits. It is
not clear what will happen to those who exhaust these benefits and are
unable to find jobs. More broadly, substantial disparities in economic wellbeing remain across racial groups and across regions; minorities and residents
of the Nation’s central cities and rural areas suffer disproportionately high
rates of poverty and unemployment. Educational opportunities are also
unevenly distributed. Wealthy school districts spend more per pupil than
poor ones, and white children continue to score substantially higher on
national examinations than African-American or Hispanic children. They are
also more likely to go on to college. Our health care system presents
numerous challenges as well. It is important to continue to control health
expenditures to ensure that care is affordable to all. Issues related to managed
care must be resolved in a way that appropriately aligns incentives so that
health care is not overly restricted or overly prescribed. Even with these issues
under control, many Americans will continue to lack health insurance
coverage and will therefore be unable to take advantage of the quality of care

Macroeconomic Policy and Performance

T

he United States achieved a growth milestone early in 2000. In February
the duration of the economic expansion, measured from the last business cycle trough in March 1991, reached 107 months, eclipsing the previous
record set in the 1960s. With private payroll employment growth strong in
November 2000, the expansion appeared to still have steam left after 116
months. Even more remarkable than the length of this marathon expansion
has been its ongoing strength. In the ninth consecutive year of economic
growth, driven by vigorous investment and accelerating productivity, real
GDP grew a torrid 6 percent between the second quarter of 1999 and the
second quarter of 2000, yet core inflation (which excludes changes in
food and energy prices) remained tame. It is probably not surprising after
such a surge that growth moderated in the third quarter. Nevertheless, the
unemployment rate in November remained a low 4.0 percent.
Strong and rising productivity growth well into an expansion and the
prolonged coexistence of low unemployment and low inflation have not
previously been seen together in the postwar period. Together with a
sustained high rate of investment in new technology, this confluence of
55

indicators is evidence that the United States is indeed in a New Economy.
But even a New Economy cannot claim to have banished the business cycle,
and indeed risks remain. For example, oil price shocks were associated with
the onset of recession twice in the 1970s and again in 1990, and oil prices
have increased sharply in the past 2 years. Yet the fundamental soundness of
today’s economy augurs well for its ability to weather the oil price storm, just
as it weathered the turmoil of the Asian, Russian, and Latin American financial crises in 1997–98. Indeed, the U.S. economy appears to be at a unique
juncture in its modern history, reaping the benefits of sound policies and a
business environment rife with new technological possibilities.
This chapter describes the fruits of these policies and technological developments as they manifest in the recent performance of the overall economy.
But it also looks to the future. In particular, the chapter discusses the importance of preserving the fiscal discipline that has contributed in a major way to
encouraging investment and supporting the strong economic performance of
recent years.
The chapter begins with a review of macroeconomic developments during
2000. This review identifies several positive trends that herald a New
Economy, such as sustained high investment rates, continued strong productivity growth, and low unemployment with stable core inflation. But it also
notes two potential caution signals: a low and falling private saving rate and
a widening trade deficit. Although either of these could become the source of
problems, each appears, in the short run at least, to be a side effect of the
economy’s investment-led growth rather than an indicator of poor performance. Low private saving, as measured in the standard national income
accounts, has been accompanied by large increases in wealth that are not part
of saving as conventionally measured. In large part these increases in wealth
stem from the unprecedented recent rise in the stock market, reflecting,
among other things, investors’ optimism about the prospects for continued
rapid growth in corporate profits. Similarly, the widening deficit in the
Nation’s international accounts may well reflect not only low private saving
out of current income here at home but also, as discussed in Chapter 4, the
attractiveness to foreigners of investing in the United States.
Although the evidence is widespread that there really is something new
about the economy, it is not clear just how much the basic parameters of
macroeconomic performance have changed. Productivity growth has
certainly been strong of late. But just how much of the increase in productivity growth is due to temporary factors such as the phase of the business
cycle, and how much represents an improved long-term trend? The economy
has been able to achieve remarkably low unemployment rates without
igniting inflation. But has the concept of a minimum sustainable rate of
unemployment consistent with stable inflation lost relevance, and if not, has
56 | Economic Report of the President

that rate changed? Recently, the succession of positive developments that
suggest we are in a New Economy has also led forecasters to keep revising
their short-term forecasts upward. But does this mean simply that those
particular forecasts were wrong, as forecasts have been before, or has the New
Economy rendered the forecasters’ models obsolete? None of these questions
can yet be answered definitively, but this chapter’s discussion of the
Administration’s forecast and the short-term economic outlook addresses
some of them. Because the forecast plays such an important role in the
budget process, this Administration has consistently been cautious about
giving too much weight to recent favorable deviations from longer term
trends. But if productivity continues to accelerate and policy remains sound,
the economy could yet again outperform the forecast.
The last part of the chapter shifts the focus from the short-term performance of the economy and the economic outlook to the long-term fiscal
outlook. The remarkable turnaround in Federal Government finances over
the past 8 years has created a virtuous cycle in which fiscal prudence has
helped keep interest rates attractive for investment, and the resulting strong,
productive investment has generated a healthy and growing economy that
yields ever-larger budget surpluses. As a result, the United States is on track
to be free of public Federal debt before the middle of the next decade. Even
if the economy continues to perform reasonably well, however, that outcome
is not guaranteed if the government makes unwise fiscal choices. Moreover,
as this chapter will document, demographic trends are pushing us toward a
situation in which an aging population will put pressure on the budget and
deficits could reemerge. Maintaining fiscal discipline today is critical to
building up the resources and the economic strength needed to address these
demographic pressures down the road.

The Year in Review
After growing rapidly between mid-1999 and mid-2000, the economy
showed signs of moderating in the second half of 2000. Nevertheless, real
GDP grew at a 4.2 percent annual rate over the first three quarters of 2000,
following 4 consecutive years of growth in excess of 4 percent. Once all the
data are in, growth in 2000 is likely to have been near the 4 percent average
annual rate that has been achieved since 1993 (Chart 2-1). The pattern of
spending in 2000 was similar to what it had been in the preceding 2 years
(Table 2-1), with consumer expenditures growing faster than income, business investment in equipment and software growing robustly, and domestic
spending outpacing domestic income to produce a further decline in
net exports. With the economy already operating at a very low level of

58 | Economic Report of the President

unemployment, one measure of labor input, hours worked, grew at only a
1.3 percent annual rate in the first 11 months of 2000, and the labor force
participation rate was flat. Nevertheless, economic growth continued to be
strong because of surging labor productivity (Chart 2-2). Although rising
energy prices contributed to an increase in overall inflation, core inflation
increased only modestly despite continued tight labor markets.
In 2000 the economy had to negotiate several speed bumps. First, the
explosive growth in the stock market that in recent years has fueled both
consumer spending and investment came to a halt. Technology stocks in
general and Internet stocks in particular fell sharply after peaking in the
spring, and near the end of the year they were down from their 1999 close.
This cooling of the stock market most likely played a role in slowing growth
in consumer spending and business investment as the year progressed. Rising
energy prices probably also helped slow the economy, as did increases in
interest rates associated with monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve
between June 1999 and May 2000. The challenge for policymakers has been
to negotiate these speed bumps and keep the economy on a sustainable
growth path with low unemployment and stable inflation. Success in doing
so thus far has given the United States a record-breaking economic expansion
that has now lasted almost 10 years.

Chapter 2

Private Domestic Spending
The rich technological opportunities and booming stock market that characterize the New Economy have affected the shape of aggregate demand in
recent years. The effect of these technological opportunities can be seen most
directly in the very high rates of investment in business equipment and software. And it is the expectation of substantial payoffs from those investments
that has fueled much of the increase in the stock market. The surge in the
stock market between 1994 and 1999, in turn, generated enough wealth to
affect consumption noticeably. And even though the stock market stumbled
in 2000, consumption retained considerable momentum from the buildup
of wealth in prior years.

Households
Consumer spending was exceptionally strong in the first quarter of 2000
and then slowed somewhat in the second and third quarters. Even with the
slowdown, real consumer expenditures rose 5.3 percent between the third
quarter of 1999 and the third quarter of last year, continuing to outpace
growth in disposable personal income (Chart 2-3). Purchases of motor vehicles and parts, which surged in the first quarter, fell back later in the year.
Even so, through November at least, 2000 was on track to become the bestselling year ever for light motor vehicles. After growing at a very rapid pace in
1998 and 1999, residential investment was lower in the third quarter of 2000

60 | Economic Report of the President

than it had been a year earlier, as higher mortgage interest rates contributed
to slowing demand.
The increase in consumption expenditures in 1999 and 2000 is generally
explained by the sharp increase in household wealth since 1994. According
to the standard life-cycle model of consumer behavior, increases in wealth are
not spent all at once; instead, people generally aim to raise their living standards over the remainder of their lives by spending only a portion of that new
wealth each year. Historical evidence suggests that each $1 change in stock
market wealth leads to a permanent change in future consumer spending of
about 3½ cents per year, with most of the effect phasing in by the third year.
The rate of growth in consumption is affected during the transition from one
permanent level to another, but persistent changes in the rate of growth of
consumption require persistent changes in wealth. The increase in stock
market wealth from 1994 into early 2000 raised consumption growth by
about 1⅓ percent per year. The lagged effects of these past increases in stock
market wealth probably continued to boost consumption in 2000.
Increased consumption due to this wealth effect reduces saving out of
current income, and in fact the household saving rate as conventionally
measured in the national income and product accounts fell below zero in the
third quarter of last year (Chart 2-4). However, this measure of saving does
not include capital gains, because these gains do not represent income earned
from current production. When income and saving are augmented by
changes in net worth—mainly capital gains—that are not related to current

Chapter 2

| 61

saving, the picture is quite different: the resulting “wealth-adjusted saving
rate” jumped up in 1995 and has generally stayed high since. To the extent
that these changes in household net worth reflect revised views of the future
productivity of the underlying assets, the low official personal saving rate is
not evidence that households are overextended or living beyond their means.
It does mean, however, that households are contributing little or nothing to
the pool of national saving available for new investment.
Looking more closely at the financial condition of households, there is
little question that, even with some stock market setbacks last year, the
overall picture of household net worth remains strong. Within this sector,
however, some households are net creditors, while others are net debtors and
could be subject to financial stress. The Federal Reserve’s Survey of
Consumer Finances shows, for example, that 14.5 percent of families in
1998 (up from 13.6 percent in 1995) owed annual debt payments exceeding
40 percent of their income. Other indicators of the financial condition of
households, such as credit card delinquencies and bankruptcies, show less
potential stress. Although these indicators suggest that some households
could find themselves in trouble if economic conditions weakened sufficiently, the kinds of credit imbalances that could precipitate financial
problems for the macroeconomy are not in evidence.

Businesses
Very strong investment in the equipment and software category, and especially in information processing equipment and software, is one of the
hallmarks of the New Economy. In 1999 and 2000 growth in investment in
information processing equipment and software was roughly 25 percent at
an annual rate (Chart 2-5). An important component of this growth appears
to reflect replacement of the large but rapidly depreciating stock of this
equipment that has been built up in recent years. The primary motivation for
this strong pace of investment continued to be rapidly declining prices of
computer equipment. Fears of year-2000 (Y2K) problems may have
suppressed computer investment in the fourth quarter of 1999. But when
these worries passed with the New Year, computer investment rebounded
strongly in the first half of 2000. Moreover, the strong stock market gains
since 1994 have made such investment easier to finance. Stock market valuations continued to support investment spending in 2000, as the
dividend-to-price ratio remained low.
Construction of office buildings was strong in 2000, but industrial
construction continued at a pace below rates seen earlier in the decade. With
energy prices up sharply, investment in drilling and mining was also strong,
accounting for nearly one-third of the growth in total investment in nonresidential structures between the third quarter of 1999 and the third quarter
of 2000.
62 | Economic Report of the President

After declining sharply relative to sales in 1998 and 1999, inventories
moved up a bit in late 2000. Nevertheless, the aggregate inventory-to-sales
ratio remains very low by historical standards, and an inventory overhang
that could threaten the expansion is not in evidence.
Credit conditions tightened for some borrowers over the course of 2000.
Arguably, however, credit markets were doing a good job of distinguishing
among borrowers according to their credit risk. As the year progressed, lower
rated corporate borrowers faced higher interest rates, and banks appeared to
have tightened their lending standards. High-quality borrowers did not see
the same increase in borrowing costs, and profits in general remained high,
suggesting that business investment in general was not subject to a credit
crunch. As with households, some businesses would have trouble borrowing
or meeting their debt service obligations if economic conditions weakened
sufficiently, but the overall financial condition of businesses was sound in
2000, with little or no indication of the kinds of imbalances that would
precipitate an economic or financial crisis.

Government Spending and Fiscal Policy
Government expenditures for consumption and investment have grown
more slowly than GDP during this expansion, and Federal expenditures have
fallen in real terms. In the first three quarters of 2000, Federal Government
expenditures fell at a 2.9 percent annual rate. Increases were recorded at the
Chapter 2

| 63

State and local level, but government in the aggregate made a negligible
contribution to growth in GDP.
One measure of whether fiscal policy is stimulating or restraining
economic activity is the change in the standardized, or structural, budget
balance. In contrast to the actual budget balance, the structural balance
controls for the effect of cyclical economic activity by estimating what
receipts and outlays would be if the economy were operating at potential
output. After 1995 the structural deficit shrank, although not as fast as the
actual deficit (Chart 2-6), indicating that fiscal policy was restrictive. The
structural balance turned positive in 1999 and is estimated to have increased
further in 2000 as fiscal restraint has continued. As discussed later in this
chapter, the turnaround in the Federal budget balance has been so substantial
that, until recently, increases in public saving have more than offset declines
in private saving, and national saving has increased as a share of GDP.

International Influences
U.S. exports grew robustly in 2000 as many of our foreign trading partners
experienced renewed economic growth after a slump caused by the Asian
economic crisis. But imports grew even more rapidly, reflecting strong
growth in consumption and investment. Imports of capital equipment
accounted for more than one-third of the growth in imports during the first
three quarters of the year. As a result, the U.S. current account deficit

64 | Economic Report of the President

continued to widen. And real net exports (exports minus imports) continued
to make a negative contribution to aggregate demand. As discussed in
Chapter 4, however, the widening of the trade and current account deficits in
the past few years most likely is a sign of the strength of the new American
economy, not a sign of weakness.
A country runs a current account deficit when its domestic spending
exceeds its income earned from production and it borrows abroad to fund
that extra spending. Put another way, a current account deficit reflects an
excess of domestic investment over domestic saving, with the excess
investment funded by foreigners. The wealth effects discussed previously
have generated substantial growth in consumption, some of which has been
met through imports. Moreover, as discussed in Chapter 4, imports represent
a significant share of U.S. investment, including investment in information
technology. At the same time, investment in the New Economy of the
United States has been attractive to foreigners, and this has supported the
dollar. Arguably, the U.S. economy is in a transitory phase in which national
saving is being held down by especially low private saving out of current
income, and foreign saving is being attracted by the extraordinary investment
opportunities in the United States, the clear frontrunner in making New
Economy investments.

Monetary Policy and Financial Markets
Monetary and financial market developments in 2000 were not particularly unusual for an economy experiencing a long expansion with a period of
extraordinary stock market gains. The stock market took a breather last year,
and credit conditions reflected the exercise of monetary restraint by the
Federal Reserve.

Equity Markets
The 1990s saw a remarkable bull market in stocks. The Wilshire 5000
index (the most comprehensive index of U.S. stock prices) quadrupled
between the end of 1989 and the end of 1999, with more than three-quarters
of the gain coming after 1995. At the end of 1999 the market value of U.S.
stocks was over $17 trillion—more than $10 trillion higher than at the end
of 1995. Indicative of the importance of the New Economy, technology
stocks, and particularly Internet stocks, showed spectacular gains in
1998–99. The market capitalization of Internet companies (defined as those
in the Wilshire 5000 Internet index, which seeks to include all companies
that derive a substantial fraction of their business from the Internet)
increased from $145 billion in December 1997 to $1.6 trillion in December
1999. Internet stocks alone accounted for about 23 percent of the total
increase in stock market wealth over that period.
Chapter 2

| 65

The sharp increase in stock prices came to a halt in 2000. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 index of large-company stocks was down 11 percent as of
December 15, while the Nasdaq Composite Index, after climbing 22 percent
between January and its peak in March, fell sharply and was down 35
percent as of December 15. Total stock market wealth had fallen by 10
percent as of November 30, compared with an average annual increase of
around 17¾ percent over the past decade. Reversing their previous pattern of
outperforming the overall market, technology and Internet stocks did even
worse than stocks generally in 2000 (Chart 2-7). Internet stocks were particularly notable for their roller-coaster ride. Instead of being a major
contributor to growth in market capitalization as in 1999, Internet stocks
subtracted $630 billion from the broader market in 2000 (Chart 2-8).
In the absence of irrational investor behavior, stock market prices reflect
the discounted present value of future corporate cash flows, where the
discount rate includes a risk factor. Thus, rational explanations for the performance of the stock market last year are likely to be found in the factors
affecting such a valuation. For example, a rise in interest rates reduces the
present value of future cash flows; hence the rise in interest rates since last
summer was probably a dampening factor. Increasing expectations that
Federal Reserve tightening and other factors would slow the economy could
also have reduced expectations of future profits and hence of future cash
flows. Disappointing earnings reports may have reduced expectations of
future profitability as well. Finally, it is possible that the higher growth

66 | Economic Report of the President

potential that technology companies have enjoyed—and continue to
enjoy—has already been priced into the market, as this sector ceased to
outperform the rest of the market.

Interest Rates
Between June 1999 and May 2000 the Federal Reserve raised its target for
the Federal funds rate (the rate banks charge each other for overnight
lending) by 175 basis points, from 4.75 percent to 6.5 percent. (A basis point
is 1/100th of a percentage point.) In the second half of 1999, when the Fed
began its rate hikes, both Treasury yields and corporate bond yields rose as
the Federal funds rate rose. Yields on Treasury and other fixed-income securities of all maturities increased (Chart 2-9). Beginning in early 2000,
however, the Treasury yield curve (which plots the yields of Treasury securities of different maturities, from shortest to longest) began to exhibit atypical
behavior. Instead of displaying its normal, upward-sloping shape, the yield
curve became inverted: yields on longer term securities fell below those on
shorter term securities. This development appears to have been determined
mostly by supply conditions in the market for Treasury securities, associated
with a growing recognition that substantial Federal budget surpluses were
likely to emerge, and therefore that the stock of Treasury securities might
decline. This perception was reinforced in January 2000, when the Treasury
detailed plans for buying back Federal debt.
Chapter 2

| 67

The decline in intermediate- and long-term Treasury yields was not
mirrored in the market for private sector securities, where yields on longer
term corporate bonds did not retreat much from their late-1999 levels. The
anomalous behavior of Treasury yields raised questions about their role as a
benchmark for evaluating interest rates (Box 2-1). Although yield curves for
corporate bonds and other privately issued instruments did not become
inverted, they were flatter than usual in the first half of the year, reflecting the
Fed tightening and the perceived likelihood that economic activity would
slow to a sustainable, noninflationary pace. As discussed earlier, borrowing
costs increased for the riskiest borrowers, but yields on higher quality
corporate debt remained relatively stable.

Labor Markets and Inflation
For the most part, 2000 marked another year in which the unemployment
rate remained very low without generating excessive inflation or inflationary
expectations. The unemployment rate averaged 4.0 percent in the first
11 months of 2000. Sharp increases in oil prices beginning in early 1999 did
push up the overall consumer price index (CPI) by 3.4 percent in the
12 months ending in November. Until very recently, however, the rise in oil
prices did not feed into most other prices, and core inflation (which does not
include changes in oil prices) rose only 2.6 percent over the same period. On
the other hand, import prices are no longer as much of a restraint on overall
inflation as they were for several years in the late 1990s. In contrast to earlier
68 | Economic Report of the President

Box 2-1. Are Treasuries Being Swapped out of Their Benchmark
Role?
U.S. Treasury securities provide investors with a financial vehicle that
is both free of default risk and highly liquid (that is, easily turned into
cash). These properties have made Treasuries a widely used benchmark
for determining and assessing interest rates on other assets that are
less liquid or less safe. Historically, for example, new corporate debt
has typically been marketed in terms of its yield relative to that of a
benchmark asset, such as Treasury securities, rather than at a price in
dollars or a yield in percent, and the performance of corporate bonds is
often assessed relative to that of Treasuries. Thus changes in the pricing
of the credit risk associated with other financial instruments (the
spread between their yield and that of Treasuries) can be separated
from changes in interest rates generally (as represented by changes in
the yield on Treasuries). The Treasury yield curve is also a useful tool in
economic forecasting. For example, a narrowing of the spread
between short-term and long-term rates is often taken as a sign that
economic activity is expected to moderate.
Many observers believe that yields on long-term Treasuries were
driven down in 2000 by the growing consensus that the supply of
these securities would be markedly reduced in the future. Interest rate
swaps began to receive more attention as an alternative benchmark. A
swap is the exchange of a stream of variable-interest-rate payments,
usually tied to the London interbank offer rate (LIBOR), for a stream of
fixed-interest-rate payments. Swaps have durations ranging from a
few months to many years. For example, one party to a swap may
expect to receive a variable stream of payments tied to LIBOR (and an
implicit principal balance) over the next 5 years but would prefer the
certainty of fixed payments. The second party agrees to pay a fixed
periodic amount in exchange for that variable stream of payments. The
swap rate is expressed as a fixed rate that market participants are
willing to exchange for a floating rate. Underlying implicit balances are
not exchanged.
The swaps market is sufficiently deep and liquid, and trading takes
place across a sufficiently broad range of maturities, to provide an
alternative yield curve to that of Treasuries and an alternative benchmark for assessing other interest rates. The increased prominence of
the swaps market illustrates how financial markets have begun to
adapt to the anticipated paydown of marketable Federal debt associated
with the improved U.S. fiscal situation.

years when import prices (including oil prices prior to 1999) were falling,
nonpetroleum import prices are now on a rising trend, although the rates of
increase have so far been modest (Chart 2-10).
Chapter 2

| 69

Wages and compensation registered solid increases in nominal terms in
2000. From the standpoint of businesses, however, these wage increases were
more than offset by strong productivity gains, with the result that unit labor
costs (compensation per unit of output) did not put upward pressure on
product prices (Chart 2-11). From the standpoint of workers, increases in the
CPI associated with higher energy prices have meant smaller increases in real
wages and compensation than in some recent years.

The Economic Outlook
Although economic performance remained strong in 2000, the resilience
of the new macroeconomy of fast productivity growth and a very strong
labor market could be tested in the coming year or so. Chapter 3 provides
ample reason to be optimistic about future productivity increases, but it
remains uncertain how much of the recent increase in productivity growth
will be sustained in the long run. Absorbing the inflationary pressures from
the recent rise in oil prices, as well as diminishing restraint from non-oil
import prices, will be easier if productivity growth continues strong. On the
demand side, the very low private saving rates of recent years might not
persist, raising the question of whether the transition from a stock market–
fueled consumption boom to a more sustainable consumption pace will be
70 | Economic Report of the President

accomplished smoothly. Toward the year’s end, stock market declines and
higher interest rates charged to high-risk corporate borrowers added a note of
uncertainty to financial markets. Fortunately, the economy remains remarkably free of the kinds of imbalances typically associated with the ends of
expansions. Core inflation remains low, inventories in most industries remain
lean in relation to sales, and the outlook for the economy remains good.
Growth of GDP is projected to moderate to 3.2 percent during 2001 and
to remain at or near this growth rate through 2007 (Table 2-2). These
growth rates are below estimates of the trend growth in aggregate supply, and
as a result, the unemployment rate is projected to edge up gradually to
5.1 percent, the middle of the range of unemployment compatible in the
long run with stable inflation. The growth of aggregate supply is projected to
edge down over the 11-year budget window, reflecting a return to more
traditional rates of productivity growth, a slower rate of population growth,
and the anticipated retirement of the first wave of the baby-boom generation.

The Near-Term Outlook
The prospects for another year of solid growth rest on continued growth of
aggregate supply, stable core inflation, and the sound application of fiscal and
monetary policy. When inflation is used as an indicator, economic activity

now appears to be in the neighborhood of its potential, as measures of core
inflation have risen slightly or not at all.
Potential output is expected to increase at a solid 3.8 percent annual rate
in 2001 and 2002, about the same as its growth rate from 1995 to 2000.
This estimate is based on the prospect that a large and rapidly growing level
of investment spending will continue to support rapid growth of capital
services per hour worked. At these levels of investment spending, structural
productivity is expected to increase at about a 2.8 percent annual rate. The
labor force, another component of aggregate supply, is expected to grow at
about a 1 percent annual rate.
The projected real GDP growth rate of 3.2 percent per year during 2001
and 2002 is somewhat slower than the rise in potential output, and as a
consequence the unemployment rate is projected to edge up 0.3 percentage
point per year during those years. At these growth rates, any tightness in
labor and product markets will unwind.
Consumption, which constitutes two-thirds of GDP, is expected to be the
major factor in the deceleration of GDP, as the stimulus to consumption
growth from the 1995–99 bull market in stocks recedes into the past. Real
private nonresidential investment, which has grown more than twice as fast
72 | Economic Report of the President

as real GDP during the past 2 years, is projected to continue to outpace
activity as a whole. Even so, its growth is expected to moderate. The fall in
the relative price of investment goods, a cause of the recent investment
strength, is expected to persist.
Exports have rebounded strongly since mid-1999, reflecting the rebound
in activity from the depressed levels of the Asian economic crisis. Looking
ahead, activity in the industrial countries as a group—which has grown
rapidly in the past year—is projected to slow slightly in 2001. As a result,
exports are projected to grow at a slower, but still strong, rate in 2001. As fast
as exports have grown, imports have grown even faster, and so both net
exports and the current account deficit have deteriorated. During the next
few years, import growth is expected to come down with the projected deceleration of U.S. GDP. Nevertheless, imports generally grow roughly two
times faster than GDP, and as a result, the current account deficit is projected
to widen further before it narrows.

Productivity and the NAIRU
The level of unemployment consistent with stable inflation remains
temporarily depressed by the still-surprising increase in productivity growth.
Permanent declines in this unemployment rate may have been caused by,
among other things, the development of the temporary help industry and the
Internet job market. These factors were discussed in more detail in last year’s
Report. The acceleration of productivity after 1995 appears to have initiated
a process that allows the unemployment rate to fall lower temporarily, with
less consequence for inflation, than would have been possible otherwise. The
rate of growth of nominal hourly compensation has increased during the past
4 years, but these nominal increases have not resulted in much of an increase
in price inflation. Businesses have been able to grant these larger pay
increases without higher inflation, partly because increases in unit labor
costs have remained stable, as rising productivity growth offset the rising
compensation gains.
The new, higher trend growth of productivity since 1995 has temporarily
lowered the NAIRU (the nonaccelerating-inflation rate of unemployment,
that is, the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation), because it
can take many years for firms and workers to recognize this favorable development and incorporate it into their wage setting. In the meantime the
productivity surprise can stabilize inflation of unit labor costs and prices even
at unemployment rates below the previous NAIRU. A 1-percentage-point
surprise in trend productivity growth is estimated to lower the NAIRU by
1¼ percentage points. The effect of the increase in productivity growth in
holding down the NAIRU cannot last indefinitely, however. If productivity
growth is maintained at the current high level, it will cease to be unexpected,
Chapter 2

| 73

demands for real wage increases will eventually rise to match productivity
growth, and the short-term NAIRU will gravitate back to its long-term level.
Some evidence points to an upward drift of real wage expectations—
although the jury is still out. Private sector wages, as measured by the
employment cost index, have increased 1½ percentage points faster than
expected inflation over the past four quarters (as measured by the University
of Michigan Survey of Consumers). This is the largest gain in expected real
wages in more than 15 years. Even so, this growth in expected real wages
remains well below recent productivity increases. Nor has real hourly
compensation (deflated by the price of output) grown as fast as productivity.
As a result, the labor share of GDP has continued to erode and is now about
1 percentage point below its 40-year average.
As the slow process of adjustment by wage setters to a higher level of
productivity growth proceeds, the NAIRU—currently estimated to be in a
range centered around 4¼ percent—is expected to edge up gradually to
5.1 percent by 2007. This upward drift closely mirrors the projected path
for the unemployment rate. As a result, the Administration expects price
inflation to flatten out at levels barely above current rates: 2.1 percent for the
GDP price index and 2.7 percent for the CPI.

Inflation Measurement and the Federal Surplus
The wedge between the CPI and the GDP measures of inflation has an
important effect on Federal budget projections. A larger wedge reduces the
Federal budget surplus because cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security
and other indexed programs increase with the CPI, whereas Federal revenue
increases roughly in line with the slower growing GDP price index. The
effect is reinforced by the use of the CPI to index income tax brackets and
other features of the tax code. Of the two indexes, the CPI tends to increase
faster because it measures the price of a fixed market basket. In contrast, the
GDP price index increases less rapidly than the CPI, because it reflects
choices of economic agents to shift their purchases away from items with
increasing relative prices and toward items with decreasing relative prices. In
addition, the GDP price index includes investment goods, particularly
computers, whose relative prices have been falling rapidly. Computers, in
particular, receive a much larger weight in the GDP price index (1.2 percent)
than in the CPI (0.08 percent in November 2000).
Over the past 6 years, the version of the CPI designed to be consistent
with current methods (the CPI-U-RS) has increased 0.6 percentage point per
year faster than the GDP price index. The projected wedge is in line with
this 6-year average, and this is reflected in the Administration’s inflation
projections.

The Stock Market, Saving,
and Consumption Prospects
Consumption has been an engine of demand growth during this expansion, growing faster than income in 7 of the past 8 years. By the third quarter
of 2000, personal outlays exceeded disposable personal income, and the
personal saving rate dropped to –0.2 percent. The rise in the ratio of net
worth to income—a consequence of the 5-year surge in stock prices from
1995 to 1999—accounts for the strength of consumption over this period
(Chart 2-12). The increase in the consumption-to-income ratio over the past
5 years is roughly consistent with the rule of thumb that attributes an eventual 3½-cent gain in consumption from every dollar increase in stock market
wealth. In the near term, current stock market values support the current level
of the consumption rate.
The growth rate of consumption, however, is another matter. The stock
market declined in the second half of 2000, foreshadowing a period when
consumption growth is unlikely to exceed the growth of income. As a result,
it appears probable that consumption will decelerate in the year ahead.
Because consumption accounts for about two-thirds of GDP, this deceleration,
if it comes to pass, will have a restraining effect on aggregate demand.
Over the long term (the next 5 years or so) the saving rate is likely to
increase from its current level. But predicting whether the saving rate will rise
from a pickup of income or from a slowdown of consumption depends on

Chapter 2

| 75

the interpretation of the increase in the stock market from 1995 to 1999.
Today’s stock valuations do not bear the same relation to apparent dividend
prospects as in the past. Through about 1996, a stable rule of thumb tied the
value of the stock market to a proxy for the apparent present value of dividends. But this relationship broke down after 1996 as the stock market
soared ahead of this valuation model.
Assuming that the current value of the stock market is appropriate, either
dividend prospects have greatly improved or the so-called equity risk
premium (discussed below) has fallen. These two alternative explanations for
the rise in stock market values have different implications for the sustainability of consumption growth. If dividend prospects have improved, the low
saving rate means that consumers are spending some of their future dividend
income today. In this scenario, consumption need not slow; rather, the saving rate
will rise if and when dividend income outpaces other components of income.
A substantial but still controversial literature suggests that stocks have been
undervalued for most of the past century. As discussed in last year’s Report,
the additional riskiness of stock returns over that of bond returns does not
appear to be enough to justify the higher returns on stocks (the equity risk
premium), unless investors are extraordinarily risk averse or their investment
horizon is very short. According to this line of argument, it follows that the
lower initial price (and higher expected return) traditionally demanded by
investors has been excessive. As investors have come to regard the equity risk
premium as excessive, they have bid up stock prices to current levels.
But if stock prices have risen because of erosion of the equity risk
premium, then investors are paying more for the rights to a given stream of
dividends—that future stream has not increased. And without any change in
the stream of dividends, the path of future consumption cannot differ much
from the one that the consumer had planned before the decline in the equity
risk premium. Certainly those investors who have received large capital gains
are richer and can spend more, but this effect should be partly offset by those
who wish to become stockholders and who must now save more to purchase
a given quantity of stock.
With the actual prospects for dividends and profits uncertain, one cannot
know today which of these explanations for the 1995–99 stock market rise is
correct. But some may incorrectly perceive that the rise in stock prices foreshadows higher dividends when it only reflects a decline in the equity risk
premium. If the increased stream of dividends fails to materialize, consumption will probably slow relative to income. In any case, the present value of
future consumption must equal the present value of future income. It follows
that either dividends must grow much faster than other forms of income, or
consumption must grow more slowly than nondividend income, or some
combination of these two. In either case, the saving rate would be expected
to increase.

The Long-Term Projection
Growth of productivity during the past 5 years has been impressive—so
impressive that it seems reasonable to wonder whether it can be sustained. As
discussed in Chapter 1, productivity accelerated by 1.6 percentage points
from 1973–95 to 1995–2000, about 0.4 percentage point of which can be
explained by capital deepening and the direct contribution of productivity
growth in the computer sector. Although business cycle dynamics often
underlie much of the year-to-year variation in productivity growth, this
factor appears to have played only a minor role in the post-1995 acceleration.
The growth of output from 1991 to 1994 put underutilized labor back to
work, and so the traditional cyclical rebound from the 1990–91 recession
had largely played itself out by 1995. The Council of Economic Advisers
estimates that the level of productivity had risen about 2 percent above
its trend by 1995, and that it edged up only slightly further above its trend
from 1995 through 2000.
Another 1.2 percentage points of the productivity acceleration can be
attributed to faster growth in total factor productivity, the variation in aggregate output that is not explained by changes in inputs. This acceleration
represents improvements in technology and means of organization, and
Chapter 3 describes evidence that supports this view. However, the evidence
is not conclusive, and forecasters are left wondering whether some of the
acceleration represents one-time improvements that have shifted productivity
to a higher level rather than a permanently higher rate of growth.
Capital deepening is projected to play just as strong a role in the near
future as in the recent past. However, it is not prudent to expect the same
contribution from total factor productivity as in the recent past, and therefore the Administration projects that structural productivity will grow at
about a 2.8 percent annual rate during the next 2 years. Actual productivity
may grow somewhat less rapidly, as the economy slows. With the labor force
and the other components of aggregate supply expected to grow about 1
percent per year, potential output is projected to grow about 3.8 percent at
an annual rate.
Structural productivity is projected to slow a bit further in the later years of
the 10-year budget window. It is expected to grow at a 2.3 percent annual
rate from 2003 to 2007, and then to trail off to 2.1 percent from 2007 to
2011. These slower growth rates are more in keeping with the pace of
productivity growth over the past two decades or so.
In addition to productivity, the factors on the supply side whose growth
rates affect GDP growth include population, the labor force participation
rate, the employment rate, and the workweek, as shown in Table 2-3. In line
with the latest projection from the Bureau of the Census, the working-age
population is projected to grow at a 1.1 percent annual rate through 2008.

The labor force participation rate is expected to inch up by less than 0.1
percent per year. The average workweek is projected to remain flat over the
entire projection period. In contrast, the employment rate is projected to
decline roughly 0.1 percent per year as the unemployment rate edges up to
5.1 percent—the middle of the range judged consistent with long-run inflation stability. From 2008 forward, growth in the working-age population is
projected to slow a bit, and the labor force participation rate will begin to fall
as the first cohort of the baby boom, those born in 1946, reach the early
retirement age of 62. Together, the supply-side factors imply potential real
GDP growth of 2.9 percent by the end of the decade.
Long-term interest rates are expected to remain flat over the entire 11-year
projection span at a yield of 5.8 percent on 10-year Treasury notes. The
91-day Treasury bill rate is currently above the yield on 10-year notes—an
unusual situation that tends to occur when the market expects the economy
to slow. Another reason for this inversion of the yield curve is that the
ongoing reduction in Federal debt has led investors to expect a diminishing
supply of Treasury securities. (See the earlier discussion of the yield curve.)
78 | Economic Report of the President

Consistent with the projected slowdown in real activity, the interest rate on
91-day Treasury bills (which was 6.2 percent at the time the Administration
projection was finalized) is projected to decline to 5.3 percent during the
next several years. Real long-term interest rates, calculated by subtracting the
Administration’s expected rate of inflation (2.7 percent as measured by
the CPI) from projected nominal rates, are projected to be similar to their
historical average.
On the income side, the Administration’s projection is based on the longrun stability of the labor share of GDP. At present, the labor share of GDP is
the lowest it has been in more than 30 years, and the Administration projects
this share to rise, returning partway toward its long-run average. Wages as a
share of total compensation are expected to erode, as other labor income,
especially employer-provided medical insurance, is expected to grow faster
than wages. With the labor share of GDP rising, the capital share is expected
to edge down. Within the capital share, a rise in the depreciation share (a
consequence of a high-investment economy) is projected to come at the
expense of the profit share. Profits before tax, which were 9.4 percent of GDP
in the third quarter of 2000, are projected to fall to 7.1 percent by 2011.
The Administration does not believe that an annual growth rate of just
over 3 percent is the best the economy can do. Rather, it is hoped that the
policies that this Administration has in place will generate even better results
than in the projection. For the purpose of prudent budget planning,
however, this projection reflects a balance between upside and downside risks.
As of November 2000 the current expansion, having lasted 116 months,
was the longest on record, and there is no apparent reason why it cannot
continue. Expansions do not die of old age. The current situation of low
inflation, high productivity growth, and lean inventories reveals no sign of an
end to the expansion, although growth is expected to moderate. The likely
prognosis remains similar to that of last year: sustained job creation and
continued noninflationary growth.

The Fiscal Terrain in the New Economy
The turnaround in the finances of the Federal Government since 1993 has
completely changed the fiscal outlook for decades to come. Whereas just a
few years ago the Nation faced deficits as far as the eye could see, the
prospect now—if appropriate budget discipline is maintained—is for an
extended period of surpluses that would wipe out the entire outstanding
public Federal debt. Instead of being a drain on the saving available to
finance investment, the Federal Government is acting as an additional source
of national saving. Indeed, until very recently the annual rise in public
(Federal plus State and local government) saving has more than offset the
Chapter 2

| 79

annual decline in private saving. A virtuous cycle has been created in which
fiscal discipline has promoted strong economic growth, and that strong
growth has boosted the surplus.
Challenges lie ahead, however, and it will be important to preserve the
fiscal discipline that was so hard won. In particular, the aging of the population will begin to put downward pressure on the surplus just a few years from
now, as the number of Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries rises relative to the number of workers paying into these systems. Imprudent,
irreversible decisions to dissipate the surplus now would leave little time to
recover before the first members of the baby-boom generation begin to
retire. Prudent decisions today about what to do with the surpluses currently
projected will not only help sustain the current performance of the economy
but also address the fiscal policy challenges posed by population aging. Fiscal
responsibility requires restraint in cutting taxes and in launching new
spending programs, so that the public debt will continue to fall. It also calls
for flexibility in our policy priorities, as the composition and hence the needs
of our population change.

Strong Public Saving: The Payoff from
Deficit Reduction
Changes in Federal policy produced large budget deficits in the 1980s, and
despite deficit reduction measures taken in the Omnibus Budget and
Reconciliation Act of 1990, the country still faced a bleak budget outlook in
1993. But a succession of subsequent actions helped to turn this situation
around. The Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA93)
reduced the deficit through progressive changes in the income tax structure
and effective constraints on spending. Welfare reform legislation changed the
Nation’s welfare programs in ways that encouraged work and hence reduced
government spending needs. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 dramatically
reduced real growth in Medicare expenses through restraint on provider
prices and payment systems. The difference between the pre-OBRA93 deficit
path and the current situation is stunning. Where Federal deficits were once
projected to grow from 4.6 percent of GDP in 1992 to double-digit percentages by 2009, the current outlook is for a long string of surpluses in excess of
2 percent of GDP (Chart 2-13). The national debt, which had reached
almost half of GDP in 1992 and was projected to surpass GDP by 2009, has
instead begun to decline and, under June 2000 projections, will be eliminated before the middle of the next decade (Chart 2-14).
One very important consequence of this turnaround has been an increase
in national saving. The large Federal budget deficits in the 1980s and early
1990s represented public dissaving (that is, negative saving) and thus were a
drain on the pool of national saving (the sum of public and private saving)
80 | Economic Report of the President

Chapter 2

| 81

available for investment. The improvement in the Federal budget balance
since 1993 has turned the public sector into a net saver. National saving rose
as a share of GDP in the 1990s (Chart 2-15). As discussed earlier, private
saving has been particularly low recently, and this has restrained national
saving. Thus, without the improvement in the Federal budget balance since
1993, national saving would have been lower than it has been, interest rates
would have been higher, and investment would have been constrained.
In the 1980s the Federal Reserve sought to keep the economy stable in the
face of the fiscal stimulus from large Federal budget deficits, and the result
was to push interest rates up. Although fiscal stimulus can be helpful in
propelling an economy out of a recession, it is a source of inflationary pressure when the economy is close to full employment. Moreover, a mix of loose
fiscal policy and tight monetary policy produces high interest rates, which
discourage investment relative to current consumption. This is what
happened in the 1980s. In the 1990s, by contrast, an improved Federal
budget outlook and fiscal restraint allowed the Fed to pursue an accommodative monetary policy—one that not only promoted economic
expansion but also was more conducive to keeping interest rates down and
stimulating investment.
Lower interest rates and a declining national debt have important direct
consequences for the budget. Federal interest outlays have already fallen from
their 1991 high of 3.3 percent of GDP (or nearly 15 percent of total Federal
outlays) to less than 2½ percent of GDP most recently (12 percent of

82 | Economic Report of the President

outlays), and they are projected to fall still further. The cumulative savings in
interest payments on the national debt since 1993 amount to over $330
billion, compared with the pre-OBRA93 baseline. Lower interest rates have
also benefited household borrowers. In mid-2000 each percentage point
added to interest rates would have added about $860 per year to payments
on a $100,000, 30-year mortgage; $70 per year to payments on a $10,000,
4-year car loan; and $140 per year to payments on a $20,000, 10-year
student loan. A rough estimate is that interest rates would be 2½ to 3
percentage points higher if pre-OBRA93 economic and budget conditions
had prevailed. Under that scenario Federal debt held by the public would be
roughly 1½ times as large as GDP by the middle of the next decade, rather
than essentially eliminated as under current projections.

What Caused the Surpluses?
The changes in fiscal policy that began in 1993 played an important role
in bringing down the budget deficit. In addition to those already mentioned,
these changes included budget enforcement rules that Congress imposed on
itself requiring that tax cuts or increased spending in one area be offset by
deficit-reducing measures elsewhere in the budget. Finally, changes in the
economy generated large increases in income that caused Federal tax revenue,
particularly individual income tax receipts, to rise faster than GDP despite
no further increase in statutory tax rates.

Controlling Expenditure
Spending discipline and a strong economy have combined to push Federal
budget outlays to their lowest level as a share of GDP since 1974. Total
outlays declined from 22.2 percent of GDP in fiscal 1992 to 18.2 percent in
the most recent fiscal year. Only 1 percentage point of this decline represents
a retracing of the increase in spending between 1989 and 1992 associated
with the 1990–91 recession (Table 2-4). The changes in net interest outlays
already mentioned accounted for 0.9 percentage point of the 4.0-percentagepoint reduction from 1992 to 2000. Declines in discretionary outlays for
national defense accounted for another 1.9 percentage points.
Discretionary outlays are outlays for defense and nondefense programs
subject to annual appropriations by the Congress; they account for about a
third of total Federal spending. Discretionary spending has been subject to
dollar caps since 1990, and these caps were generally effective over the 1990s
in limiting the growth of outlays. The rest of the budget besides interest and
discretionary spending consists of mandatory outlays for programs such as
Social Security, Medicare, and food stamps. Spending on these programs
generally depends on the number of beneficiaries and the benefit amounts to
which they are entitled by law. Budget enforcement provisions did not put

specific dollar limits on spending for mandatory programs but did require
that any legislation that would increase mandatory spending be offset by an
equivalent amount of deficit reduction elsewhere in the budget.
Some Federal Government expenditures, such as unemployment compensation, are sensitive to the business cycle, so that overall spending might be
expected to fall as the economy booms. In general, however, the cyclical
component of spending is much smaller than that of revenue, which is
discussed below. In the past, spending for welfare was also sensitive to the
business cycle, but the 1996 welfare reform legislation devolved control of
program spending to the States and transformed this component of Federal
spending into fixed block grants. Thus any cyclical fluctuations in spending
on these programs are now more likely to occur at the State and the local
levels than at the Federal level. The combination of low inflation and low
unemployment has been especially helpful in keeping government spending
down during this economic expansion, because both keep down the levels of
expenditure from transfer programs whose benefits are indexed to inflation.
Changes to expenditure programs during this Administration have also been
a factor. As already noted, the 1996 reform reduced welfare caseloads by
encouraging work, and the 1997 Balanced Budget Act made changes to the
Medicare payments system that have at least temporarily constrained growth
in health care spending.

Rising Incomes and Revenue
Federal Government receipts vary with the business cycle in the opposite
direction from expenditures, growing during booms and shrinking in recessions. In fact, receipts, especially income tax revenues, play an important role
as an automatic stabilizer of the economy. The progressivity of the income
tax system causes income tax receipts to fall faster than income during a
recession, cushioning the impact of the recession on after-tax income. Thus
some of the improvement in the Federal budget since 1993 reflects a normal
cyclical recovery. But growth in receipts, especially personal income tax
receipts, has been especially strong in the past few years, when
the economy has been expanding rapidly. This has happened even though
statutory tax rates have not increased.
Individual income tax receipts have risen from less than 8 percent of GDP
in 1994 to nearly 10 percent most recently. From 1994 to 1998 the growth
in that ratio contributed approximately $140 billion in additional cumulative revenue. This faster growth in revenue relative to GDP reflects two
main factors: faster growth in taxable income than in income generally, and
a rise in receipts due to rising real incomes and the progressive structure of
income tax rates.
According to Treasury Department and Congressional Budget Office
analyses of the 1994–98 period, nearly 60 percent of the increase in individual income tax liabilities relative to GDP arose from rapid growth
in adjusted gross income (AGI) relative to GDP. Of this 60 percent, about
17 percentage points occurred because the taxable components of personal
income grew faster than the other income components of GDP. The rest
reflects strong growth in sources of AGI that are not included in GDP
(because this income is not earned as a result of current production), such as
capital gains realizations and retirement benefits. The former have been
particularly important (Chart 2-16): growth of capital gains alone accounts
for 30 to 40 percent of the additional revenue.
The remaining growth in individual income tax liabilities relative to GDP
(about 40 percent) reflects the growth of revenue that results from rising real
incomes in a progressive tax system. Although statutory individual income
tax rates have not increased since 1993, the average tax rate on non–capital
gains AGI has increased. Two factors account for most of this increase. First,
for taxpayers in general, income has grown faster than inflation. As a result,
more taxpayers have more income taxed in the higher brackets, even though
the brackets are indexed for inflation. Second, more taxable income is
accruing at the top of the distribution of taxpayers, and hence more is
subject to the top tax rates. Tax return data indicate that the share of
taxpayers with AGIs above $200,000 (in 1998 dollars) rose over the
1994–98 period, and those taxpayers experienced faster growth in income
Chapter 2

| 85

than the average taxpayer. Incomes grew even faster for taxpayers with more
than $1 million in AGI.
The share of income taxes collected from taxpayers at the top of the distribution has increased in recent years, but only because their before-tax
incomes have increased significantly; their share of total after-tax income has
increased as well. Impressive growth in the stock market contributed to the
taxable incomes of these households through higher capital gains realizations,
greater taxable retirement benefits, and increased compensation in the form
of stock options. Labor earnings, which have increased the most for married
couples at the top of the income distribution, have also contributed. Capital
gains, and the taxes on those gains, had already been surging for a few years
before the significant reduction in tax rates on capital gains that took place
in 1997—and both capital gains and the taxes on those gains continued to
surge after tax rates were cut.
It bears repeating that the additional tax revenue that has contributed to
an improved budget outlook has come during a period in which income tax
rates have not been increased at all for the overwhelming majority of
taxpayers, and no income tax rates have been increased since 1993. The
increases in marginal tax rates in OBRA93 affected only the highest-income
households (1.2 percent of all taxpayers), but many of these households (and
others) got tax relief in 1997 when capital gains tax rates were reduced. Many
taxpayers with more modest incomes enjoyed meaningful tax relief over this
period from other changes in the tax code. The Earned Income Tax Credit
86 | Economic Report of the President

was expanded several times in the 1990s, most significantly in 1993, and
taxes were reduced substantially for lower and middle-income families in
1997 through the child tax credit and new, education-related tax credits,
which are phased out at higher income levels. Thus, at any given level of real
taxable income, average tax rates have been constant or falling since 1993.
For a family of four earning the median income, real income has been rising
while the average tax rate has fallen, even after accounting for payroll taxes.
Thus the strong revenue growth that has helped produce growing budget
surpluses and rising national saving has been associated with very strong
increases in income. Indeed, real after-tax incomes throughout almost all of
the income distribution rose strongly over the 1993–99 period. The rising
tide has lifted all boats, even after inflation and taxes, and even as government deficits were eliminated. This experience contrasts with that of the
1980s, when higher after-tax private incomes came at the expense of public
saving, and increases in income were more skewed toward the top of the
income distribution.

The Importance of Maintaining Fiscal Discipline
The improved budget outlook since 1993 reflects real changes in the
economy and in policy and represents the achievement of budget discipline.
The U.S. economy has reaped the benefits of reduction in the public debt
and increased public saving. Nevertheless, the course of the budget and of the
economy in the years ahead remains highly uncertain. This makes it especially important to maintain fiscal discipline now, when the economy is
strong and the Nation can most afford it—just as a prudent family saves
extra income in good times for a future rainy day.

Economic and Policy Uncertainty
As noted in the discussion of the economic outlook, the economic
assumptions underlying the budget projections reflect a cautious view of
whether recent favorable economic developments will continue. However, a
serious economic downturn or an adverse productivity shock would cut into
the projected surpluses and slow the paydown of the national debt. Also, the
recent very strong growth in revenue relative to GDP is unlikely to be
sustained, because taxable income—in particular, the capital gains component—cannot continue to grow faster than GDP indefinitely. (The surplus
projections do, in fact, assume a leveling off of individual income tax collections relative to GDP, and a decline in total taxes relative to GDP.) Even
when uncertainties are acknowledged, however, it seems most likely that the
budget can be kept in surplus if budget policy remains disciplined.
Maintaining that discipline entails an appropriate recognition of current
policy priorities while preserving significant amounts of the available
Chapter 2

| 87

surpluses as a margin of safety and to meet future needs. Budget projections
are typically based on current law and practice, but there are always pressures
to change current law. For example, analysts have pointed to the possibility
that discretionary spending might well rise faster than projected. Also,
various tax provisions now scheduled to expire could be extended, and
changes could be made to the alternative minimum tax, in ways that would
reduce revenue. The pressures to deviate from existing policies do not invalidate the usefulness of projections based on those policies, but they do
remind us that part of the challenge of maintaining fiscal discipline will
involve addressing these issues.

The Demographic Challenge
One force affecting future budget surpluses that is both large and
inevitable is the aging of the population. Projections indicate that the population aged 65 and over will rise from its current share of about 12½ percent
of the total population to nearly 21 percent by 2040 (Chart 2-17). As a
result, the share of the population that is at or beyond retirement age relative
to that of the working-age population (the elderly dependency ratio) will
rise dramatically.
These demographic changes imply changes in the demands that certain
government programs place on the Nation’s resources and in the role these
programs play in the dynamics of the Federal budget. Currently, Federal
outlays for health and retirement programs for the elderly are a large share of
the budget, but payroll contributions tied to Social Security and Medicare
are even larger. Thus the Social Security and Medicare systems are net
contributors to the unified budget surplus today. Fairly quickly, however, the
surpluses in these systems will start to shrink and eventually turn into deficits
if changes are not made. At the same time, retirement and health programs
for the elderly will take up an increasing share of Federal outlays. The costs
per beneficiary of both Social Security and Medicare are expected to rise in
the future, implying an even more dramatic increase in spending on the
elderly than population projections alone would suggest. The Medicaid
program will also be affected through its coverage of nursing home care: over
time, Medicaid is projected to pay an increasing share of the health care bills
of the elderly.
Long-term projections indicate that, under current policies, spending on
Social Security and Medicare will grow dramatically as a share of GDP,
from 6.1 percent in fiscal 2000 to 11.2 percent in 2040 (Chart 2-17) and
12.4 percent by 2075. The Social Security trust fund has been growing since
the 1980s and will continue to grow over the next several years. But current
projections (based on assumptions of the Social Security trustees) show that
Social Security payroll tax revenue will fall short of outlays starting in 2015
and that the trust fund will be depleted in 2037. At that point current
88 | Economic Report of the President

receipts will cover only about 70 percent of outlays. In addition to the demographic challenge, Medicare faces pressures associated with projected
increases in health care costs. During this Administration the strong
economy, along with a slowing in the growth of health costs, have significantly brightened the short-term outlook for Medicare. However, policy
changes still appear necessary to maintain its financial soundness in the long
run. Outlays for the hospital insurance portion of Medicare are now expected
to exceed corresponding tax receipts starting in 2010, and the hospital insurance trust fund is expected to run out in 2025. Finally, the long-term
implications of demographic change for national saving are aggravated by the
fact that private saving is also likely to decline as the population ages, because
older people tend to draw down their private assets during retirement.
The projected erosion of the Social Security surpluses will reduce the
unified budget surplus starting fairly soon. Moreover, the gap between benefits and receipts continues to widen beyond the 75-year window used for the
long-run projections of the Social Security trustees; hence the pressure on the
budget intensifies over time. Although they have not eliminated these longterm pressures, developments in the economy that have produced a long
expansion and higher productivity growth have improved the budget
outlook over that 75-year period even more dramatically (primarily through
the power of compounding) than they have improved the shortterm outlook. A projection of the Administration’s economic and policy
assumptions based on the June 2000 Mid-Session Review of the budget
Chapter 2

| 89

suggests that the unified budget could remain in surplus throughout the next
75 years (Chart 2-18).
Of course, 75-year projections are fraught with uncertainty, because over
this span it is easy for a particular set of economic and policy assumptions to
be proved wrong. For example, starting with the baseline projection in Chart
2-18, slower-than-expected growth in tax revenue—or a tax cut—that
reduced receipts as a share of GDP to their 1994 level of 18.1 percent would
hasten the return of deficits. A similar outcome would occur if discretionary
spending were to rise proportionally with GDP instead of merely rising with
inflation, as the projections assume. Obviously, various combinations of tax
cuts and spending increases could produce even more adverse changes. Other
assumptions could also prove inaccurate. More rapid productivity growth or
a larger-than-expected increase in immigration would improve the long-term
surplus outlook. Slower productivity growth or continuing rapid growth in
health care costs would significantly worsen it. So, too, could a lower fertility
rate or longer life expectancy than is assumed by the Social Security trustees.

Addressing the Challenge
Current economic and demographic projections indicate that, with the
benefits and tax rates specified under current law, Social Security and
Medicare will not pay for themselves over the long run. Some combination
of modified benefits, increased payroll taxes, or alternative financing will

90 | Economic Report of the President

be necessary to resolve the imbalance. A growing economy helps with this
resolution, even if needed changes are postponed to the future. But starting
to address the challenge now would reduce uncertainty about what, if any,
adjustments future generations will face and would give today’s workers
greater notice so that they can better plan for their retirement.
A strong economy with adequate saving is critical. The virtuous cycle of
fiscal discipline and changes in the economy that have boosted productivity
and growth has already paid off: with the vastly improved long-run budget
outlook, national saving has increased in a way that contributes to preserving
prosperity over the long run and meeting the demographic challenge. But
even in a New Economy policymakers must confront scarcity and trade-offs.
New tax cuts or spending programs should be well thought out, target highpriority public needs, and include an assessment of overall benefits, costs,
and risks. The most effective fiscal strategy to prepare for the future is to
pursue policies that boost the productive capacity of the economy. These
include encouraging productive public investments in infrastructure and
human capital—as well as maintaining fiscal discipline, to encourage public
saving and private investment.
Productive public investment complements private investment in raising
the economy’s capacity to produce goods and services. For example, decades
of economic growth have overwhelmed many of the Nation’s sanitation,
public transportation, and road systems whose original designs date back 50
to 100 years. Investments in modernizing and expanding this infrastructure
can improve health outcomes, reduce pollution, ease congestion, and
enhance job prospects. As discussed in Chapter 5, education is especially
important for preparing Americans to prosper in the New Economy, yet an
estimated $127 billion in additional repairs is needed to rebuild the Nation’s
schools. Clean, safe schools are better learning environments that will pay
dividends well into the middle of this century.
To the extent such investments in infrastructure increase the Nation’s
capital stock and productive capacity, they contribute to stronger economic
growth and raise real incomes. This in turn increases future revenue and
reduces the payout of government transfers. But such investment must
be undertaken wisely. Poorly thought out investments could prove
counterproductive by crowding out more-productive private investment.
Investments in human capital provide another means of maintaining prosperity and preparing for the future. Increased education and training can
enhance workers’ productivity in much the same way that increases in the
amount and quality of physical capital do. State and local governments are
mainly responsible for primary and secondary education, but as described in
Chapter 5, the Federal Government’s more limited role can be crucial as well.
Federal programs are also important for postsecondary education and lifetime learning. In recent years the Federal student loan program has been
Chapter 2

| 91

especially successful at making college more affordable, helped along by the
fiscal discipline that has allowed an easing of interest rates; at the same time
the Administration’s efforts to improve loan repayment have saved taxpayers
more than $14 billion. The Administration’s Lifetime Learning tax credit
allows some educational expenses to be deducted from income, further
improving the affordability of college. Although such tax credits reduce
current government revenue, the investment in human capital that they
stimulate adds significantly to future private income and income tax receipts.
In 1998 the mean earnings of high-school graduates aged 18 or over
amounted to $22,895, whereas persons with a bachelor’s degree had mean
earnings of $40,478. This difference in income generated an estimated tax
liability for the bachelor’s degree holder that was 2.4 times as large as that of
the high-school graduate, suggesting that funding education can be good for
the Nation’s fiscal integrity as well as for personal incomes.
Finally, preserving some share of future budget surpluses will allow public
saving to continue to contribute to national saving, increase the amount of
capital available in the economy, and support continued economic growth. It
will also allow a continued paying down of the public debt, perpetuating the
virtuous cycle that has been so good for the New Economy. Debt reduction
also helps shrink the demands on the Federal budget as interest payments are
reduced and eventually eliminated. Interest savings alone could pay for a
large share of the added expenses associated with demographic change and
provide a margin of safety against unforeseen adverse economic events.
One way to emphasize the importance of not spending the surplus is to
create a “lockbox” for the Social Security and Medicare trust fund surpluses.
Funds placed in a lockbox could not be used to pay for other programs, but
instead would have to be saved. Although the precise amount that the
government should save is not necessarily equal to that which would accumulate in the lockbox, such a provision might be an effective way to ensure
that significant saving does occur.
Fiscal prudence that preserves the current surpluses, combined with appropriate public investment, would generate more national saving and
investment than a policy of large tax cuts or spending increases. Greater
saving and investment, in turn, would produce a stronger and more productive economy in the future. Besides directly improving the outlook for Social
Security and Medicare under their current structure, such an outcome would
provide more resources to deal with any changes to those programs in
the future.

92 | Economic Report of the President

Conclusion
U.S. economic performance in 2000 continued to illustrate the benefits
that have accrued from a combination of sound policies and a blossoming of
technological opportunities. Strong growth, accelerating productivity, low
unemployment, and low inflation continue to characterize the longest
economic expansion on record. The fiscal stance of the Federal Government
has been completely turned around, from one of spiraling deficits to one in
which it is reasonable to contemplate the elimination of the public debt. The
critical task now is to maintain the fiscal discipline that has been achieved
and to focus on ensuring that adequate resources are available for the coming
demographic challenge.

The Creation and Diffusion
of the New Economy

A

t the heart of the New Economy lie the many dramatic technological
innovations of the last several decades. Advances in computing,
information storage, and communications have reduced firms’ costs,
created markets for new products and services, expanded existing markets,
and intensified competition at home and abroad. These innovations
have sprung from a remarkable recent flourishing of entrepreneurship,
much of it concentrated in high-technology corridors such as California’s
Silicon Valley. Indeed, the rapid growth of the information technology
sector was one of the most remarkable features of the 1990s. Domestic
revenue in this sector—which comprises computer hardware, software, and
communications—has grown by 120 percent over the last decade. In just the
last few years, the Internet has spawned thousands of new companies and
created billions of dollars in market value. Wireless telephone carriers alone
now employ over 150,000 people in the United States and generate 10 times
the annual revenue they posted a decade ago.
95

The information technology sector has been going about its highly innovative business since the 1970s. The last decade, however, saw a rapid
convergence of several of its most important technologies—processing
power, data storage and transmission, and software—that translated these
innovations into real productivity gains. This chapter will show that these
improvements in technology, along with intense competition and innovative
organizational practices, have brought significant benefits to many industries
throughout the economy. In manufacturing industries such as steel and
automobiles, and in service industries such as retail trade and financial
services, firms that have embraced information technology and developed
custom applications are increasingly productive. Steel furnaces now use highspeed computers running what are called neural networks to improve quality
and reduce wear and tear on equipment. In automobile production,
networked computers are used for a whole range of activities from the design
of new products to the coordination of supplier relationships. In financial
services, advances in information technology have led to significant scale
economies, reducing the costs of back-office operations, risk management,
and customer support. Similar patterns of technological innovation are
visible in many other industries.
Technology, however, is not the sole driver of this exceptional performance. During the 1990s, firms in many industries found that technology
had its biggest impact when combined with complementary organizational
innovations such as incentive pay, flexible work assignments, and increased
training. Meanwhile intense competition, both at home and abroad, has
forced firms to improve their performance—and weeded out those that
do not.
This chapter surveys recent technological improvements, explores the
causes of the recent surge in innovation, and explains how changes in technology, regulation, and competition have transformed organizations
throughout the economy, leading to significant performance gains. The story
is told in four parts.
The first part reviews recent improvements within the information
technology sector, focusing on microprocessors, disk drives, and data transmission, and showing how costs have plummeted as capabilities have
increased. Future advances in networking, wireless communications, and
biotechnology—all fueled by the rapid technological advances of the last 20
years—will likely lead to even more impressive gains.
The second part examines the causes of the surge of innovation. Although
the ultimate cause of all innovation is human creativity, the scope and
complexity of technical innovation today require a particular support structure. Scientific and technical research and development (R&D) must be

96 | Economic Report of the President

funded, researchers must be trained and equipped, inventors must receive
adequate legal protection for their intellectual property, and so on. The
discussion here focuses on the demand for technology, on financial market
developments such as the growth in venture capital and a stronger market for
initial public offerings (IPOs), on private and public R&D activity, and on
intellectual property protection. None of these factors alone explains why
the United States now finds itself awash in new technology. Rather, it is
the convergence of these factors during the last decade that has created a
unique climate for entrepreneurs to discover new technologies and bring
them to market.
The chapter’s third part explains how firms are producing goods and
services more efficiently through greater use of computers and other information technologies and the development of complementary organizational
practices. The emphasis is on how technology, regulation, and competition
interact to create new business opportunities and spur performance gains.
The financial services industry provides a useful illustration. As mentioned
above, advances in information technology have led to significant scale
economies in this industry. Deregulation now provides financial institutions
the opportunity—and increased global competition provides the incentive—
to exploit these scale economies. The combination of these factors helps
explain the dramatic consolidation seen in this industry during the last few
years. Further examples of changes in firm boundaries, internal organization,
and performance are discussed, from the use of outsourcing and strategic
interfirm alliances to new arrangements for compensation and job design.
These changes in firm behavior, in many cases facilitated by the dramatic
improvements in information technology, are immediate causes of the rapid
productivity growth of the last 5 years.
The chapter turns finally to an investigation of the performance gains
brought about by these new ways of doing business. There is considerable
evidence that information technology and organizational change improve the
performance of plants, firms, and industries. Globalization is also closely
linked to improvements in firm performance: access to global markets gives
firms strong incentives to improve their products and services, and the presence of foreign competitors in domestic markets forces firms to make those
improvements or perish. As the competitive environment has changed, firms
in many industries are increasingly turning to intangible capital—patents
and trade secrets, organizational routines, reputation, and the like—as a
source of competitive advantage. This has important implications for firm
strategy, as firms seek new ways to build and exploit their stocks of
these intangibles.

Chapter 3

The Advance and Convergence
of Information Technologies
The productivity improvements associated with the New Economy have
their origins in a series of gradually unfolding advances in information technology that grew out of post–World War II defense research. Over the
decades following these discoveries, the costs of processing, storing, and
transmitting information fell dramatically. During the 1990s this process
accelerated rapidly as computers became increasingly powerful, communications networks became much faster and cheaper, and firms developed the
necessary software and organizational capabilities to translate these new technologies into performance gains. The emergence of the commercial Internet
in the mid-1990s promises to extend these gains even further.
Clearly, the information technology sector has been one of the most innovative and visible in the New Economy. The sector now accounts for an
estimated 8.3 percent of GDP, up from 5.8 percent in 1990. Private investment in information technology rose at a 19 percent annual rate over the
1990s as a whole and accelerated to 28 percent after 1995 (Chart 3-1).
Advances within each area of information technology have created new
markets, extended existing markets, and improved the efficiency of firms
and industries.

98 | Economic Report of the President

The most impressive technological advances have come in terms of speed,
storage capacity, data transmission capacity, and the improvement of user
interfaces. Moore’s law—the prediction by semiconductor pioneer Gordon
Moore back in 1968 that transistor density on silicon wafers would continue
to double every 18 months—has generally held true, generating one of the
most remarkable phenomena of the late 20th century. Since 1980 the speed
of microprocessors used in personal computers has increased more than a
hundredfold, while the cost of performing 1 million instructions per second
has fallen from over $100 to less than 20 cents. These advances, along with
intense competition in computer assembly and distribution, drove qualityadjusted prices for computers and peripheral equipment down by 71 percent
between 1995 and 2000. This coincided with a dramatic increase in private
investment in computers and peripheral equipment (Chart 3-2).
Complementary investment in software has nearly doubled. However,
quality-adjusted prices of software have fallen by only 2 percent, reflecting in
part the fact that labor is the major input into software production, and in
part the difficulty of measuring quality improvements in this area (Chart 3-3).
Advances in data storage, which complement these advances in computer
processing power, have also been impressive. The cost per megabyte of hard
disk storage has fallen from over $100 in 1980 to less than 1 cent today. The
newest generation of “microdrives,” designed for handheld devices such as

Chapter 3

| 99

wireless phones and digital music players, hold a gigabyte of data, are smaller
than a matchbook, weigh less than an ounce, and sell for under $500. (By
contrast, the first gigabyte-capacity disk drive, introduced in 1980, was the
size of a refrigerator, weighed 550 pounds, and cost $40,000.)
Finally, data transmission capacity has skyrocketed: since 1996 the
capacity of a single fiber-optic cable has increased by a factor of 20 in widely
available commercial systems, and experts expect such technological progress
to be sustained over at least the next 5 years. These improvements, again
along with healthy competition, have reduced the cost of communications
dramatically. Information can now be accessed from anywhere in the world
via the public Internet at no cost once the user has connected. The emerging
communications infrastructure allows firms to collect, store, process, and
transmit information at ever-higher volume and lower cost. Between 1980
and 1999 the cost of sending 1 trillion bits of information electronically fell
from $129,000 to 12 cents.
A revolution in software development has been built upon these advances
in hardware. Private investment in software has risen from $11 billion in
1980 to $50 billion in 1990 and about $225 billion in 2000. The trend in
software design is toward independent modules that can be combined for a
variety of applications, and away from less flexible programs designed for
individual users. Software has also become more sophisticated. Since about
1990, large firms have been spending billions on “enterprise resource
100 | Economic Report of the President

management” programs: complex systems that integrate ordering, procurement, inventory, finance, and human resources. Smaller firms can get similar
services from what are called applications service providers operating over
the Internet.
To reap the full benefit of these technological advances, firms are reorganizing many of their business practices. In some industries, firms are taking
advantage of technological improvements by refining, expanding, and
consolidating their operations so as to reduce costs; in others, startup companies are using technology to create new products, processes, and markets.
Consumers are now being offered an increasing array of goods and services
for wireless communication, digital entertainment, shopping, education, and
other activities.
As firms have rushed to adopt this increasingly ubiquitous, lower cost
technology and incorporate it into their businesses, employment in the
computer and data processing services sector has exploded, more than
doubling between January 1993 and November 2000 (Chart 3-4). This
compares with only a 23 percent increase in total private U.S. employment
during the same period.
Each on its own, these dramatic technological advances would have been
unlikely to generate the profound transformations of firms and of consumer
behavior that define the New Economy. Rather, it is the simultaneous
convergence of these technologies that has made the difference. The rapid
expansion of computer networks, culminating in the commercial Internet,

Chapter 3

| 101

clearly illustrates this convergence. Economists use the term “network effects”
to describe how the benefits of participating in a network depend on how
many other people are also on the network. (Who would want to be the only
person in the world with a fax machine?) The number of Internet hosts, a
proxy for the number of existing connections to the Internet, has increased
exponentially since 1990 (Table 3-1). Nearly 42 percent of U.S. households
have access to the Internet, and surveys indicate that over 50 percent of U.S.
businesses sold products on line in 2000. The number of secure web servers
for e-commerce in the United States rose from 7,513 in 1997 to 65,565 in
2000. Traditional firms and new firms alike are competing to deliver
consumers higher speed access to the Internet and more sophisticated
content and services for this new medium. Together this evidence suggests
that the benefits of being on the Internet are growing at an extraordinary rate.
As the case of the Internet clearly shows, the most important breakthroughs of this information era have resulted from the convergence of fast
processing, inexpensive data storage, and rapid communications. This technology is considerably more valuable to firms when combined with
complementary human capital and the appropriate organizational routines,
and when contractors outside the organization are available for development,
implementation, and maintenance. The convergence of these technological
advances, in combination with changing firm routines, has fueled much of
the development of the New Economy.

102 | Economic Report of the President

Why Is the U.S. Economy
Awash in Technology?
What explains the recent surge of technical innovation? Of course, the
ultimate cause of all innovation is human creativity. But technical innovation
does not occur in a vacuum; it requires a structure of incentives and institutions. Firms demand new technology that will let them reduce costs and
provide new products and services valued by their customers. For other firms
to respond to that demand, scientific and technical R&D must be funded,
researchers must be trained, their inventions must receive legal protection,
and so on.
Government policies that foster competition, encourage R&D, and reduce
trade barriers are important in this regard. The Administration has worked
hard to provide an environment that allows entrepreneurship to flourish,
particularly in the high-technology sector. For instance, the Administration
supported a moratorium on U.S. Internet taxes under the Internet Tax
Freedom Act and worked for a freeze on trade duties for electronically traded
goods within the World Trade Organization (WTO). To encourage open
markets in high-technology goods and services, the Administration signed
the WTO’s Information Technology Agreement, which will eventually eliminate tariffs on $600 billion worth of goods, and the WTO’s Basic
Telecommunications Agreement, which will promote competition and privatization in a global telecommunications services market worth $1 trillion.
To help ensure the competitiveness of U.S. firms in that market, the
President signed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the first comprehensive telecommunications reform legislation in over 60 years. In September
2000 the President signed an executive memorandum directing Federal
agencies to work with the Federal Communications Commission and the
private sector to identify the radio spectrum needed for third-generation
wireless technology.
To encourage private sector R&D across the gamut of U.S. industries, the
Administration worked to extend the Research and Experimentation tax
credit through 2004, the longest extension of this policy ever. At the same
time, the Administration has supported significant increases in funding for
the National Science Foundation (NSF), an independent government agency
responsible for promoting science and engineering. The NSF budget was
increased by more than 13 percent in fiscal 2001, the largest increase ever.
Overall, the President’s 2001 budget request included more than $2 billion
for R&D in information technology, a marked increase over the previous
year’s amount.
Within this favorable climate, technological innovation has proceeded at a
rapid pace. This part of the chapter discusses the demand for technology,
Chapter 3

financial market developments such as the surge in venture capital and
initial public offerings that support technology firms, the role of R&D
expenditure in technological development, and the importance of legal
protection for technical discoveries. It highlights four important features
of the New Economy.
First, intense competition and feedback drive the development and adoption of new technologies. The availability of one technology stimulates
demand for complementary technologies, which in turn lowers production
costs and encourages further demand for the initial technology.
Second, significant financial market developments have lowered the cost
of capital for new businesses. Although the public stock markets are still
extremely important, providers of private equity such as venture capital
firms are playing a larger role, particularly in the technology sector.
Third, the process of funding R&D has changed. The Federal
Government continues to be a major provider of this funding. However, the
emphasis of Federal funding has shifted from defense-related technologies to
civilian products and services. More important, private R&D has soared,
particularly at smaller firms and service firms. Private firms are also devoting
an increasing fraction of their research budgets to basic, rather than applied,
research. This suggests that the current technology boom is far from over.
Fourth, the innovative process has itself been transformed. Traditionally,
innovation has been a highly integrated activity, performed mostly by large
firms working independently of each other. Today, innovation is a less integrated process, performed increasingly by large and small firms in
collaboration with each other, with academic institutions, and with government agencies. This is seen clearly in the computer hardware industry.
Formerly dominated by large, vertically integrated firms, the industry is now
frequently led by smaller, more specialized firms using modular technologies
that are easily shared among market participants.
The combination of these features explains why the United States has seen
so much technological innovation over the last decade. For the most part,
these appear to be long-term trends, implying that technological progress
will continue to be an important driver of U.S. economic performance.

The Demand for New Technology
Central to the dynamics of the demand for new technology is positive
feedback: technological improvements generate increased demand for technology, which fuels further improvements. Several types of feedback are
important here. First, in a market characterized by network effects, the more
users have adopted a particular technology, the more valuable that technology will be for additional users. For example, the telephone, the fax
machine, e-mail, and instant Internet messaging all are more valuable to any
104 | Economic Report of the President

given user the larger the number of other users. Today, household telephone
penetration in the United States is nearly 95 percent, more than 9 million fax
machines are in use, over 100 million Americans have e-mail accounts, and
more than 60 million use instant messaging software.
Second, for products that exhibit increasing returns to scale or strong
learning effects in production, sufficient demand can generate larger markets
by reducing the unit cost of production, which in a competitive market
lowers price and drives demand even higher. Firms in the commercial aircraft
and chemicals industries have long recognized the need to “price down the
learning curve” to drive demand and maximize the returns on their investments. Semiconductor manufacturing, for example, is characterized by
increasing returns to scale. Producing microprocessors or memory chips
entails high fixed costs and low variable costs. The more the firm sells, the
lower it can price its chips and still profit from its investment. As technological innovation brought ever-faster chips, the fixed costs of building a
semiconductor manufacturing plant rose from $100 million in the early
1980s to $1.2 billion in the late 1990s. This suggests that increasing returns
in the semiconductor industry are becoming increasingly important.
Finally, feedback can occur when strong complementarities between
component products of a given system create an interdependent system of
demand. For example, the demand for computers depends on the price and
quality of software and of peripherals such as printers, modems, and scanners. Yet the demand for software and peripherals is, to a certain extent,
determined by the price and quality of computers. More generally, since the
complexity of so many information technology products makes it efficient to
design each component for a particular purpose, and to establish standardized interfaces between components and even entire products, demand for
individual components and given products becomes highly interdependent.
In the United States, deregulation, openness to foreign competition, and
low administrative barriers to entry and exit have led to highly competitive
markets, providing strong incentives for firms to adopt new technologies. Yet
organizations often resist technological change. Adopting new technologies
can be costly and risky for firms; some of this risk stems from the changes in
relationships, communications practices, and organizational structures that
are required to take full advantage of the new technology. A firm with a
protected market position can avoid making these productivity-enhancing
changes and still remain viable and profitable. Firms in competitive environments cannot. Beyond the highly competitive information technology
manufacturing sector, which has been a remarkable user of new technology,
competition has driven the demand for new technology in such service
industries as telecommunications services, trucking, banking, and retailing,
to name a few.

Financial Market Developments
Firms—especially small, innovative startup companies—need funds, guidance, and other forms of support for all aspects of their operations. The
United States has offered a uniquely supportive climate for technology startups. In many cases a single individual investor, or “angel,” has provided
money at the seed stage, where a new firm’s product concept is developed.
Additional funds may be obtained through the private placement market—
essentially equity offerings to a limited group. The Federal Government has
also played a role in supporting innovation through the Small Business
Innovation Research program. One of the most important factors in the
financing of new technology, however, has been the recent acceleration in
growth of venture capital, which itself has benefited from a thriving market
for IPOs. The availability of venture capital has lowered the startup costs for
aspiring entrepreneurs, and favorable taxation of capital gains has increased
the demand of entrepreneurs for capital. Furthermore, a rising stock market
may encourage venture capitalists to support startups, in the expectation that
a subsequent public offering or private sale will generate large returns.

Venture Capital
Venture capital is a form of private equity that targets startup firms
primarily in emerging industries. Venture capitalists do much more than
supply funds, however. Besides matching entrepreneurs with investors, such
as wealthy individuals, banks, and pension funds, they also advise, monitor,
and support the projects they fund. Technology firms face two special obstacles in procuring finance. First, the profitability of the projects they pursue
is extremely difficult to assess, and second, the entrepreneur’s behavior is
difficult for providers of capital to monitor and evaluate. Venture capital
firms address these difficulties by getting deeply involved in the development
of the typical startup. Typically, one or more of the venture capital firm’s lead
investors join the board of directors of the new firm, and from that vantage
point they closely monitor the entrepreneur’s activities. The method in which
financing is provided allows additional control: the investment is typically
staged, with funds disbursed only as the firm passes certain preset milestones.
Venture capitalists often advise firms on the selection of key personnel and
on the acquisition of legal and financial services. They are also deeply
involved in the firm’s strategic choices.
During the 1980s venture capital investment grew on average by 17
percent per year; then, during the 1990s, the pace doubled. Total venture
capital investment jumped from $14.3 billion in all of 1998 to $54.5 billion
in the first three quarters of 2000 alone (Chart 3-5). One company that
tracks the venture capital industry estimates that $134.5 billion was under
venture capital management at the end of 1999. Analysts pointed to the large
106 | Economic Report of the President

sums raised at the beginning of 1999, and to a new group of promising
projects in Internet-related businesses, as the driving factors behind this
surge in financing. Whether the rapid pace of growth can be maintained
depends on a number of economic factors, one of which is the strength of
the IPO market. Venture capital firms frequently move on to new projects
once a firm has been successfully launched. For example, 3 years after an
IPO, only 12 percent of lead venture capitalists retain 5 percent or more of
the funded company’s shares. And the most profitable manner for venture
capital investors to exit their investment positions and take their profits is by
having the new firm float a public issue. Therefore maintenance of a large
and buoyant public equity market is critical.
The Federal Government has long been active in the venture capital business. Congress created the Small Business Investment Corporation (SBIC)
program in 1958. This program allows the formation of SBICs, which are
privately owned and managed investment firms, licensed by the Small
Business Administration, that may borrow funds from the government in
order to provide venture capital funding to entrepreneurs. In 1999 SBICs
provided $3.7 billion to 3,700 companies.
Does the enormous growth in the amount of funds described as venture
capital really signal a correspondingly large increase in the net resources available to entrepreneurs, or does some of it merely substitute for other sources
of funding? There is evidence that not all venture capital is new money: some
Chapter 3

| 107

large firms, often in the computer hardware and software industries, now
make about 15 percent of total venture capital investments through semiautonomous organizations they set up. These investments might have been
counted as internal corporate investment in the past. However, venture
capital and traditional corporate R&D do seem to have different effects. In
particular, recent evidence suggests that venture capital spurs innovation, as
measured by patent activity.
More generally, the thriving venture capital industry is but one part of a
growing domestic private equity sector (as distinguished from the public
capital markets, that is, the stock and bond markets). In the United States the
private equity sector has largely divided itself into two subsectors, each
focusing on different types of investments. One consists of the venture
capital firms already described, which focus on early-stage investments in
startup or newly formed entities. The other consists of investment groups
that pursue opportunities in existing, more mature companies. At least 800
established buyout firms operated in the United States during the 1990s.
These privately held firms specialize in leveraged acquisitions, recapitalizations, management buyouts, and other restructurings. In principle, buyout
firms perform an important function by actively monitoring corporate
managers, thus avoiding the collective action problems that limit effective
control of management by institutional owners such as banks and pension
funds. During the last five years or so, the distinction between venture
capital and buyout firms has blurred: several buyout firms have begun
investing in Internet startups, while venture capital firms that previously
specialized in managing early-stage ventures have participated in buyouts of
established technology firms.

Initial Public Offerings
In addition to venture capital, the public capital markets have also served
as an extremely important source of capital during the second half of the
1990s and beyond. Between 1993 and the end of November 2000, IPOs
raised $319 billion, more than twice the amount raised in the preceding
20 years, even after adjusting for inflation (Chart 3-6). Although some of the
largest IPOs have been those of established firms seeking to raise additional
capital, IPOs have also been an important source of capital for new firms,
particularly in information technology and biotechnology. An active IPO
market fosters innovation by providing capital for new enterprises and, as
already mentioned, by providing an attractive exit mechanism for financiers
of early-stage, risky ventures, making these financiers more willing to provide
risky capital. It also provides liquidity for entrepreneurs, who can appropriate
some of the value their efforts have created while retaining at least partial
control of their firms.
108 | Economic Report of the President

Of some concern, however, is the recent strange behavior of IPO pricing,
especially in 1999 and 2000. In 1999 the average first-day return (calculated
as the percentage by which the price at the end of the first day of trading
exceeds the offering price) for IPO securities was an amazing 69 percent
(Chart 3-7). This was three times higher than the average first-day return in
any year between 1975 and 1999. This anomaly could be due to either
“irrational exuberance” on the part of investors, persistent underpricing by
the underwriters of these securities, or both. Economists have developed
several possible explanations for the underpricing of IPO securities. Some
focus on differences in the information held by the firm and the market,
whereas others focus on the incentives of managers, underwriters, and
investors. In general, underpricing is not necessarily the result of a market failure.
Evidence on the long-term performance of IPOs is mixed. Equity markets,
particularly in the technology and Internet sectors, were extremely volatile in
2000. Internet commerce and Internet services firms recorded remarkably
high market values between 1998 and early 2000, but their market values fell
sharply after peaking in March 2000. Consequently, although the average
number of IPOs per month in late 2000 was only slightly less than the
average for the first half of 2000, the average monthly proceeds from IPOs
fell by nearly 40 percent. The overall market value of equities remains high,

Chapter 3

| 109

however. As of December 2000, the price-to-earnings ratio of S&P 500 firms
stood at 26, substantially above its average of 22 in the 1990s. The price-toearnings ratio of the Nasdaq composite stock index, which includes a high
concentration of technology firms, was 98 near the end of 2000.
The availability of well-developed, sophisticated capital markets has
provided important support for the technological advances of the last decade,
although whether they will continue to do so in the next decade remains to
be seen. The flourishing venture capital market and the dynamic IPO market
are unique features of the U.S. economy and may help explain why the New
Economy emerged here rather than in Europe or Asia.

R&D in the New Economy
As the economy has become “lighter,” shifting toward products that
embody more knowledge capital and less physical capital, R&D—the
principal means by which knowledge capital is created—has risen dramatically. The entire R&D process today is in the midst of a transformation away
from the vertically integrated model pursued by large R&D laboratories and
toward a more decentralized model involving more small-firm R&D
and increasing collaboration between firms to bring products and services
to market.
110 | Economic Report of the President

Between 1995 and 1999, real R&D spending in the United States grew at
an annual rate of nearly 6 percent, evidence of a substantially increased
commitment to innovation. Private sector R&D accounts for most of this
growth, having increased at a remarkable 8 percent annual rate over the same
period. In this era of budgetary restraint, real Federal support for R&D
remained approximately constant but shifted somewhat away from defense
R&D toward civilian applications (Chart 3-8). Other key indicators offer
corroborating evidence of an increase in R&D activity. The number of scientists and engineers doing R&D rose 34 percent between 1995 and 1999.
Immigration has been an important source of engineers and scientists in the
United States, not only in R&D but in many other activities as well. Foreignborn persons make up only about 10 percent of the U.S. population, but
about 13 percent of scientists and engineers.
Private sector support of basic research also increased rapidly in the 1990s,
growing at an astounding 17 percent annual rate since 1995. Indeed, one
survey observes that “industry is doing more long-range, high-risk, discoverytype research than ever before.” This is somewhat surprising, because
economists have typically argued that private firms will tend to focus on
applied, rather than basic, research. Because basic research may not produce
commercially exploitable results, and because firms fear that competitors will
free-ride on their basic research investment if it does bear fruit, private firms
are thought to invest little in basic research. In the early 1990s, in fact, several

Chapter 3

| 111

large firms famous for supporting basic research scaled back their research
budgets after experiencing sharp declines in earnings, raising concerns that
private sector support for basic research would dwindle.
Why, then, did private sector support for basic research increase in the
1990s? A recent study shows that patent applications increasingly cite scientific research, and not just existing patents; this suggests that basic science is
becoming more important for technological change. (This trend has been
particularly strong in information technology and in biotechnology.) For this
reason, firms that employ individuals skilled in performing basic R&D may
be better able to take advantage of the scientific research performed by
universities, the national laboratories, and other firms. Furthermore, as a
recent study of postdoctoral biologists’ job choices suggests, allowing
researchers to pursue basic science and publish their results helps firms
attract high-quality researchers and reduces the financial compensation that
researchers demand.

The Organization of Innovation
Small firms have been responsible for much of the growth in private
R&D. Between 1993 and 1998, real spending on R&D by firms with more
than 25,000 employees increased by 8 percent, but R&D conducted by
firms with fewer than 500 employees nearly doubled. In 1998 R&D
conducted by firms with fewer than 500 employees accounted for 18 percent
of all industrial R&D spending (Chart 3-9), and firms with 500 to 4,999
employees accounted for an additional 16 percent, compared with 12 and
14 percent, respectively, in 1993. More than 40 percent of all privately
employed scientific researchers now work in these small firms.
The increasing importance of small-firm R&D is consistent with an
observed shift, in a number of industries, toward the distribution of innovative activity across multiple independent firms. For example, in the 1950s
and 1960s, computer firms usually sold fully integrated, proprietary systems
comprising both hardware and software. They developed and manufactured
the majority of the components for these systems inside their own company.
Today, in contrast, the most popular systems are based on modular architectures. Production of software and hardware is separated, and hardware
manufacturing typically involves components designed and developed by
dozens of different firms. Many of today’s semiconductor design companies
own no manufacturing facilities and focus exclusively on creating the intellectual property—the design itself. Still others perform contract production
for dozens of these design companies.
Important changes have also occurred in pharmaceuticals. Before the
1970s the discovery of new drugs relied on what was called the random
screening approach, which drew mainly on medicinal chemistry and pharmacology. Large, established pharmaceutical firms were the primary
112 | Economic Report of the President

innovators. Today, in the wake of the molecular biology revolution, firms use
a more profound understanding of the biological basis of disease to guide
their search for drugs. Biotechnology has also become a technology for
producing new drugs as well as discovering them, and the industry has
seen the large-scale entry of firms that do both. In today’s pharmaceutical
industry, collaboration among major pharmaceutical firms, biotechnology
firms, and academic institutions has become commonplace. The large drug
companies have recognized that it is difficult to acquire all of the capabilities
necessary to do modern pharmaceutical R&D; they must rely to some extent
on external partners. The new biotechnology firms, for their part, have
formed partnerships with the large drug companies that possess skills in
conducting clinical trials and marketing that they themselves lack. Many
biotechnology startups are closely linked to universities, and universities
now routinely enter into licensing agreements with firms to commercialize
the patents they hold.
In another departure from traditional R&D patterns, service firms also
account for a considerable share of the recent growth of private R&D. The
most recent data from the NSF show that service firms have stepped up their
performance of R&D over the past few years. R&D by engineering and
management services firms, for example, doubled between 1995 and 1998,
to $8 billion, and in the same period R&D by business services firms
increased by 69 percent, to $15 billion. Consistent with today’s more
Chapter 3

| 113

decentralized approach to R&D, these service firms provide essential software for data processing and product development for their clients in
manufacturing and other sectors of the economy.
Recent attention has focused on the management of innovation within
and between firms. The design of incentives offered to researchers is important here. Incentive schemes must be carefully designed, particularly when
multiple tasks—for instance, both basic and applied research—compete for a
researcher’s time and attention. Studies have suggested that firms seeking to
develop promising but immature technologies with the potential to challenge
their current business should establish separate, independent business units
to develop these technologies. Otherwise the incentives of researchers and
others within the organization could come in conflict.
Developments in information technology, meanwhile, have made possible
entirely new R&D processes that further challenge the traditional centralized
models. “Open-source” software design, which encourages users to modify
the source code of a program and to share these improvements with others,
has become increasingly widespread. Tens of thousands of programmers in
the United States and abroad have contributed to open-source programs
for such widely used products as Internet server software, e-mail routing
software, and even some personal computer operating systems. Widespread
Internet access has led to a dramatic acceleration in open-source activity,
despite the fact that open-source programmers typically do this work without
pay and distribute their source code for free. They may be motivated by
reputation, which can lead to better future job offers and greater respect
among peers, or by the sheer pleasure of solving the problem.
Another key feature of innovation and R&D in the New Economy is
geographic concentration. Such concentration persists even in a world where
declining telecommunications costs and improved software have made it
easier for researchers in distant parts of the globe to collaborate. Knowledge
spillovers between firms, and between firms and academic institutions, are
particularly important in the technology sector. One study that looked at
patent citations as a measure of these spillovers suggests that they are
geographically localized; this finding remains even after controlling for preexisting research activity. Spillovers involving what economists call tacit
knowledge—knowledge that is not easily codified or communicated except
through close interaction—may be even more geographically localized, since
they are likely to be mediated through social ties (for example, between an
entrepreneur and a venture capitalist) or face-to-face contact. This creates
geographic clusters of firms in a set of related industries. Many of the
Nation’s high-technology clusters benefit greatly from proximity to major
research universities; besides Silicon Valley, examples include the Research
Triangle in North Carolina, Route 128 in Massachusetts, and Austin, Texas.
114 | Economic Report of the President

Aside from the benefits from research spillovers, firms may choose to locate
in these clusters to have better access to sophisticated customers, to benefit
from the presence of supporting industries, and because startup costs—
particularly the costs of hiring employees with a specific type of
expertise—are lower. Clustering has been pronounced in industries where
university R&D, private R&D, and skilled labor are particularly important.

Government Funding for R&D
The Federal Government continues to supply over half of all basic research
funds in the United States, as it has since World War II (Box 3-1). Between
1993 and 1999, Federal funding for basic research increased at a 2 percent
annual real rate. This funding increased a further 9 percent in fiscal 2000 and
is budgeted to increase an additional 7 percent in fiscal 2001. Many New
Economy technologies, such as the web browser and the Internet, have their
origins in federally funded basic research. Other important technologies
such as bar codes, fiber optics, and data compression also benefited from
public funding in their early stages.
This Administration has increased basic research funding for many important technologies, computer science and biotechnology in particular. In
1999, 20 percent of the Federal research budget went toward health and
human services research, and 50 percent of Federal basic research funds went
toward the life sciences. Recently, Federal funding for basic research in information technology has increased. The Administration has established the
Information Technology for the 21st Century Initiative, a basic research
initiative targeted at software development, supercomputing, and networking
infrastructure and examining the societal implications of the information
technology revolution. This program had a budget of $309 million in fiscal
2000 and $704 million in fiscal 2001.
Any discussion of the Federal role in R&D requires careful consideration
of whether public R&D complements or substitutes for private R&D. Some
forms of R&D performed by the Federal Government are clearly complementary to private R&D spending. For example, providing information
about the genetic basis of disease could increase the productivity of private
R&D efforts to design new drugs. However, public R&D may at times
crowd out private R&D if firms perceive that they can free-ride on government-supported projects, particularly those that focus on developing specific
products. Time considerations may also be important. Today’s Federal
spending may support tomorrow’s private spending but reduce the incentives
for the private sector to do research today. Partly because of these considerations, the focus of Federal R&D spending has typically been on basic
research, where underinvestment by private firms is thought to be most
likely, and on R&D related to the missions of government agencies.

Chapter 3

Encouraging Private Research and Collaboration
Besides providing direct funding, government policy has created a favorable climate for private R&D through the tax code and through encouraging
collaboration among private sector firms. According to the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the tax treatment of
Box 3-1. Federal R&D and Commercial Technology:
Licensing, Cooperation, and Partnerships
A significant fraction of federally funded R&D supports the needs of
Federal agencies pursuing public purposes such as national defense.
However, the technology created by this research often has potentially
valuable private sector applications as well. A series of new laws in the
1980s encouraged the realization of this potential by making technology transfer an explicit mission of the Federal laboratories. These
laboratories were also given the authority to grant licenses on their
patents to U.S. businesses and universities, and Federal agencies were
allowed to enter into cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) with private firms to conduct research benefiting both
the government and the CRADA partner. In the 1990s these technology
transfer mechanisms took root and flowered in the Federal research
enterprise. In 1998 Federal laboratories granted licenses for nearly
twice as many inventions as in 1993, and nearly three times as many as
in 1990. Not surprisingly, income from these licenses has risen dramatically. The number of active CRADA projects has doubled since 1993,
with most such projects in the defense and energy spheres.
The missions of some Federal agencies target commercial applications specifically. The Advanced Technology Program (ATP),
administered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology,
supports research projects that focus on the long-term technology
needs of U.S. industry, by sharing the cost of peer-approved, high-risk
projects. Over 460 ATP awards—many of which have gone to cooperative ventures between firms and universities—have been made
in fields as diverse as photonics, manufacturing, materials science,
information technology, and biotechnology.
Founded in 1993, the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles
(PNGV) is another example of how Federal agencies and industry have
joined forces to pursue mutual interests. The PNGV brings together the
three major U.S. automakers, over 300 automotive suppliers and
universities, and seven Federal agencies to develop technology for
environmentally friendly vehicles. The vehicles developed under this
program promise to achieve up to triple the fuel efficiency of today’s
vehicles, and very low emissions, without sacrificing affordability,
performance, or safety.

116 | Economic Report of the President

R&D in the United States is one of the more favorable among OECD
nations. Federal policy has also encouraged the formation of strategic technology alliances, which are particularly important for new modes of R&D.
Two hundred and fifty-five domestic U.S. technology alliances were formed
in 1998, up from a mere 51 in 1980 (Chart 3-10). The number of alliances
formed between U.S. and foreign firms climbed from 88 in 1980 to 222 in
1998. This growth in new alliances was driven largely by agreements between
firms in information technology and biotechnology.
One particularly intensive type of technology alliance is the research joint
venture. Research joint ventures allow participating firms to take advantage
of their different and often complementary capabilities, to spread the risk of
a project, and to pool resources. For example, two major firms working on
computer memory technology recently announced a joint effort to develop
magnetic random access memory (MRAM). This technology promises more
efficient computing—machines using MRAM will start up instantly, for
example. One company has created the early MRAM technology itself,
whereas the other brings to the venture additional expertise in complex semiconductor memory. Combining the efforts of some 80 engineers, the firms
hope to develop commercially viable MRAM by 2004.
Research joint ventures limit wasteful duplication and are particularly
important for projects whose payoffs are likely to be years away. Most important, they allow firms to internalize some of the benefits of knowledge

Chapter 3

| 117

spillovers; the difficulty in capturing these externalities is presumably a reason
why firms are thought to underinvest in R&D in the first place.
Although technology alliances existed before the mid-1980s, U.S. antitrust
law created some confusion about the extent to which firms could cooperate
on R&D. With passage of the National Cooperative Research Act in 1984,
the treatment of research joint ventures under antitrust law was modified in
two important respects: the application of antitrust law to such ventures was
clarified, and the maximum penalty that could be assessed in a successful
private lawsuit was reduced. The 1993 National Cooperative Research and
Production Act further liberalized the environment for cooperation by
extending these provisions to include the application of technologies developed by joint efforts. Seven hundred and forty-one research joint ventures
were registered under this act through 1998, with most occurring in the
communications, electronics, and transportation equipment industries.

Intellectual Property Protection
Perhaps the chief incentive for innovation is the potential financial reward
from owning a unique resource, product, or service. Innovators often profit
simply by being first to market, but legal protection for their discoveries
provides an additional attraction. U.S. law provides particularly strong intellectual property protection. For example, it allows the patenting of most
biological material that occurs as a result of substantial human intervention,
and this protection has contributed to the rapid innovation in the U.S.
biotechnology industry. European case law for biotechnology patents is
evolving but inconsistent, and the European Union does not currently grant
patents for plant varieties. Japanese law for the patenting of living material is
similar to that in the United States, but Japan prohibits the protection of
biotechnology inventions related to the human body for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment of disease.
In addition, the United States grants clear protection to a variety of
computer-related innovations, an area that Japanese and European laws
protect more loosely. The European Patent Convention specifically notes
that computer programs as such are not to be regarded as inventions.
Although court rulings have interpreted this as requiring that software inventions make a technical contribution to be eligible for a patent, considerable
misunderstanding remains in the European Union about the extent of patent
protection for software, particularly among small and medium-size enterprises. In Japan a software patent claim can only be expressed as a claim on
the process, whereas in the United States claims can cover a product or a
process. This means that, in Japan, many more patents may be required to
fully cover a new software package; this increases the possibility of a gap in
protection that a competitor can exploit. In both the European Union and
118 | Economic Report of the President

Japan, a software patent is substantially narrower than one granted in the
United States.
As more new technologies emerge, challenges to incorporating these innovations into the intellectual property framework will continue to surface. As
it did with earlier innovations, the existing intellectual property framework is
adapting to accommodate today’s new technologies. For instance, the
increasing use of software has blurred the line between a physical transformation, which is traditionally covered by the patent system, and a concept,
which is not. Court rulings have consistently upheld the patent protection of
“business methods”—financial techniques or software programs that suffuse
technology and concept. However, the legal rulings in favor of business
methods patents have generated controversy, as illustrated by the debate
surrounding a large Internet retailer’s patenting of its website ordering
process. Critics argue that patents of business methods are of low quality and
overly broad, and that they might stifle innovation. In response, the Patent
and Trademark Office announced the Business Methods Patent Initiative in
early 2000. The initiative establishes new procedures for reviewing such
patents, including a second layer of patent review, enhanced training for
examiners, and expanded searches for prior work.
The proliferation of new technologies has also raised issues related to copyright and trademark law. “Peer-to-peer” file-sharing systems permit the easy
exchange of copyrighted media, including music, software, video, and texts.
The Administration has supported the extension of copyright protection to
the digital realm and has worked to establish an international standard of
copyright. One achievement in this area was the passage of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which implements the Copyright
Treaty and the Performances and Phonograms Treaty of the World
Intellectual Property Organization. Among other provisions, the DMCA
limits the extent to which Internet service providers can be held accountable
for copyright infringement by their users.
As biotechnology, the Internet, and other innovative technologies become
more widespread, important legal challenges will continue to emerge. For
example, e-signature legislation recently took effect, providing standards
under which legally binding signatures can be created and sent electronically.
This advance brings with it important new challenges in contracting.

A Favorable Alignment
Why, then, is the U.S. economy awash in technology? The evidence
suggests that the combination of increased, competition-driven demand for
technology, thriving financial markets, increased public and private R&D,
and legal protection have created a uniquely favorable climate for entrepreneurship in the technology sector. As this chapter has emphasized, it is not
Chapter 3

| 119

any one of these factors in isolation but rather the convergence of these
favorable conditions that has led to the recent surge in technological innovation. Technology flourishes when markets are allowed to work, and where
government policy provides essential support.

Doing Business in the New Economy
How has growth in technological innovation affected the economy as a
whole? Chapters 1 and 2 of this Report detailed the effects of information
technology on economy-wide productivity. Here the focus is on the effects of
technology, along with complementary organizational practices and
increased global competition, on the behavior of individual plants, firms, and
industries. The remarkable productivity of the information technology sector
itself over the last several decades has already been discussed. This part of the
chapter turns to other sectors of the economy, to show how the technologies
and business methods of the New Economy have spread beyond the
information technology sector.
Chapter 1 presented aggregate evidence that the New Economy has
diffused outside the information technology sector to the service-producing
industries. Between 1989 and 1999, labor productivity accelerated in retail
and wholesale trade and in finance and business services (Table 1-2). These
industries are heavy users of information technology, and this technology
may have contributed to these gains. However, the aggregate statistics do not
provide the whole picture. Productivity gains in these industries are difficult
to gauge: measuring output and prices is an imperfect exercise, and the
productivity numbers do not incorporate important changes in quality.
To understand and extend these findings, then, it is essential to look at
evidence within firms and industries. This section focuses on the underlying
mechanisms by which performance gains might arise.
These performance gains come mainly from two sources. First, the level of
investment in information technology has increased sharply, in both the
manufacturing and the services sectors. As discussed in Chapters 1 and 2,
only since 1995 has investment in information technology grown to the
point where the stock of information technology capital can itself have a
noticeable effect on aggregate productivity. However, computers are more
than just another factor of production. As this section will emphasize,
another important driver of productivity growth is the way computers and
electronic communications together enhance the efficiency of labor and
other factors, as firms adapt these technologies to their own unique business
applications. It is these increases in the productivity of all factors that explain
the economy-wide gains documented in Chapters 1 and 2.
120 | Economic Report of the President

Information technology has made inputs more productive by changing the
way firms do business. In manufacturing, increasing computing power and
decreasing cost have brought about performance gains through automation,
numeric control, computer-aided design, and other channels. Information
technology has also facilitated changes in job design, giving manufacturing
workers more decisionmaking authority on the shop floor and placing
a premium on technical skills. Firms are also relying increasingly on
performance-based pay, including profit-sharing and stock option plans.
Supplier and customer relations have also changed. Supplier contacts that
were formerly kept at arm’s length have become more closely integrated and
coordinated, thanks in part to automated procurement systems. Data that
used to be kept proprietary are now increasingly shared between business
partners. Inventories have shrunk. Firms use databases of transaction histories to target products and services to individual customers, while setting up
telephone call centers and other operations to improve service.
The structure of many markets has changed. In some sectors high fixed
costs and low marginal costs, combined with first-mover advantages and
network effects, have led to highly concentrated markets. Other sectors are
populated by smaller, newer firms. Firm boundaries are also shifting more
rapidly as firms move toward flexible, collaborative relationships such as
strategic alliances with suppliers and even potential rivals.
Finally, competition in the New Economy is more vibrant, more dynamic
than ever before. Many markets have become more “entrepreneurial” as new
business starts—and business failures—have increased. The increase in global
trade brought about by trade liberalization along with lower communications
and transportation costs has led to improved performance. This section
outlines the effect of technology, organization, and other factors on performance.

New Developments Inside Plants and Firms
Many people associate the New Economy with semiconductor plants or
biotechnology research laboratories. Those are, of course, important drivers
of recent performance improvements. However, information technology has
had significant effects on old-economy industries as well.

Applying Computing Power Outside
the Information Technology Sector
As computing power has gotten cheaper and firms have made greater
investments in information technology, they have learned to apply that
greater power to improving the performance of the firm. Manufacturing
firms have done this by investing in information technology that is
embedded in much of the new machinery they install, and by investing in
information technology in their business processes. Service firms have used
Chapter 3

| 121

the new technologies to introduce new products and processes as well.
Although the case studies presented below do not add up to an economywide measure of the impact of information technology, they do show clearly
that it is improving productivity in many sectors of the economy—even
old-economy industries such as steel, transportation, and banking.
In the manufacturing sector, computers allow the automation of many
tasks, improving the flexibility, speed, and reliability of the production
process. The machine tool industry provides an example (Box 3-2). These
improvements in the production process are also combined with the use of
new software that governs scheduling mechanisms, to reduce work in process
and shorten lead times for order fulfillment. In the services sector, the availability of information and the increased ability to process that information
have enabled retailers and service providers to respond more quickly to
changing customer demand and to provide more customized service.
The changes witnessed in the steel industry exemplify these changes in
production processes and management practices. The fundamental processes
of steelmaking remain much as they always were: melting raw material,
forming it into an intermediate product, and shaping and treating that
product into final goods. But a number of technological advances, many
incorporating information technology to measure, monitor, and control
these processes, have affected almost every step in steel production.
As recently as 10 or 15 years ago, steelmaking involved extensive manual
control and setup and relied heavily on operators’ experience, observation,
and intuition in determining how to control the process. Computer
processing of data from sensors, using innovative software, has improved the
ability to control the process, allowing faster, more efficient operation, in
addition to more uniform product quality. For example, the availability of
computing power to quickly process data has enabled steelmakers to
combine sophisticated software decisionmaking algorithms (called neural
networks) with precision sensing devices to continuously monitor and adjust
the ever-changing conditions in the electric arc furnaces widely used for
melting steel. This closer control reduces both energy consumption and wear
and tear on the equipment. The setup to cast the molten steel into an intermediate product has changed from a process in which several operators
would “walk the line,” setting the controls for every motor and pump, to one
in which a single operator uses an automatic control system that synchronizes and sets the equipment. The rolling process now incorporates sensors
that constantly inspect for deviations from the desired shape, allowing the
operators to make corrections before material is wasted. Operators can
remotely control the speed and clearance of the rolls using computercontrolled motors to correct problems as they develop.

Box 3-2. Information Technology in the Machine Tool Industry:
The New Economy Helps the Old
The machine tool industry, one of the oldest and most basic of U.S.
manufacturing industries, appears to have experienced accelerated
performance in the 1990s as a result of improvements based on information technology. Because this industry makes the machines used in
the rest of the manufacturing sector, improvements in the quality of its
products can result in productivity gains for the entire sector. The
annual productivity growth rate for this industry rose to 2.5 percent
from 1990 through 1998 after more than a decade of decline. But even
this figure underestimates the performance gains that have arisen
from improvements in such factors as reduced inventories and higher
product quality.
The use of computerized, numerically controlled machines in this
industry has had a major impact. Although developed in the 1970s,
numerically controlled machines made up only 5 percent of the
machining base by 1983. By 1997, however, this share had risen to 68
percent. These machines increase operating speed: one study found
that as of 1987 they had already reduced unit production time by
40 percent relative to manual production. They also increase output
quality and reduce setup times, so that products can be switched more
frequently and inventories can be kept smaller.
One industry that uses these production methods is valve production: valves are seen in virtually every industrial environment, where
they are used in pipelines to control the flow of liquids or gases of
various kinds. Data described below from a typical valve-making firm
document pronounced productivity gains in three primary areas of the
firm: new product design, production, and inspection. To envision
these phases, imagine that the firm is making a complicated valve part
starting with a chunk of steel, then boring a hole in the middle for
liquid flow, turning grooves on the end, and finally drilling and tapping
additional holes and turning protrusions that permit control devices
to be attached.
New Product Design
New product design is a primary element of production, because
valve production is often very specialized; small numbers of valves
must be produced that are unique to the new application for which
they are ordered. In the 1990s the computer-aided design software
used by valve-producing firms became capable of displaying threedimensional images, showing the valve as a solid model rather than
as a flat planar representation. This change speeded design time enormously. The new software also allows all the properties of the valve,
continued on next page...

Chapter 3

| 123

Box 3-2.—continued
such as stress loads and the center of gravity, to be calculated automatically, thus eliminating the need for extensive manual calculations.
It also eliminates the need for a demonstration model and significantly improves design quality. One firm estimates that the new
software has reduced design time by more than 50 percent and cut the
required number of engineers and draftsmen on a typical job by
30 percent. Thus, although at least 84 percent of all manufacturers had
introduced computer-aided design in some form by 1997, the very
recent move to three-dimensional design is likely to have a particularly
strong impact on performance.
New Production Methods
Numerically controlled machines were introduced 25 years ago, but
the recently developed computer numerical control (CNC) machines
can produce valve parts much more rapidly. These machines are run by
sophisticated software with a simple graphical user interface that
enables the operator to produce a typical complicated part in one day,
compared with the four days it would have taken previously.
Moreover, the CNC machine is much more versatile. Two CNC
machines are enough to produce a new valve that might have required
eight of the earlier-generation machines 10 years ago.
New Inspection Techniques
A complicated valve often must be machined in each dimension to a
tolerance of 1/1000th of an inch. Therefore inspection is a critical part of
the production process. For many years inspection was done with
manual measuring devices, which was very time consuming.
Inspection machines developed in the last few years instead use a
probe technology, so that the operator simply touches each surface of
the valve with a probe, which then generates a three-dimensional
image and measures all dimensions. The new device can cut
inspection time for a typical complicated valve part from 20 hours to 4.
The Importance of Information Technology
The machines that make today’s complicated valves are run by
sophisticated software programs that require high-speed computing
and extensive data storage. These new machines are now available
and affordable because the costs of computing have plummeted, and
because capital goods makers have had time to learn how to harness
cheap computing power by developing the applied software needed
to run the machines. Thus the performance improvement in valve
production has come about partly as a result of high levels of new
investment, but also because the information technology imbedded
in all new machinery enables these machines to perform at rates
previously unachievable.

124 | Economic Report of the President

The result of this integration of computers into steelmaking has been a
significant improvement in performance. Together with other technological
changes, such as larger furnaces and improvements in casting practices, and
the closing of older, inefficient plants, the new technologies have also
contributed to higher product quality and productivity. Steelmakers today
use less than 4 worker-hours to produce a ton of steel, down from about
6 worker-hours in 1990. The best-performing mills have achieved results of
less than 1 worker-hour per ton.
Service industries, too, have harnessed information technology to change
the way they do business. The trucking industry is using the new technology
to better serve its customers’ logistics needs. To be efficient, trucking firms
must satisfy customers with prompt pickup and delivery of loads while
minimizing unused capacity in the form of both idle equipment and empty
and incompletely loaded trips. By coordinating information from many
shippers and consignees in a geographical area, firms can reduce wasted
movement. To track and dispatch trucks efficiently, they use sophisticated
locating technology, such as the satellite-based global positioning system;
real-time traffic, weather, and road construction information; computers on
board the trucks themselves; complex software and algorithms; and
supporting hardware to organize customers and loads. The ability to effectively use information to manage shipments not only contributes to
efficiency but also enables other innovative processes such as automated
exchange of information.
Banks have also used new technologies to improve their processes. In the
mid-1990s retail banks introduced imaging technology to process checks
more efficiently. Digital images of checks are stored on a central computer
and scanned by software that reads the amounts on the images. Checks are
then balanced against deposit slips automatically. Introducing this
technology has freed employees from having to record check amounts manually, lowered transactions costs by eliminating the need to move checks
physically, and allowed banks to reorganize their workflow around a more
extensive division of labor.

Complementary Changes in Organizational Practices
To fully realize the performance gains from the applied use of information
technology, firms often must make complementary changes in organizational
practices. For example, the information that the new technology puts in the
hands of production line operators is valuable only if those operators have
the authority to use it to make decisions about the operation of the line. The
move to place greater decisionmaking authority in the hands of line
personnel is one key example of an organizational change that complements
the adoption of information technology and enhances its value. Another

Chapter 3

| 125

complementary change is in the incentives that operators and other
employees have to use information to make better decisions.
There is evidence that in the last 10 years more firms have placed greater
decisionmaking authority in the hands of the average employee. The growth
of processes to increase employee involvement and the delegation of decisionmaking to the shop floor, for example through off-line problem-solving
teams or self-directed work teams, indicate how line employees are
performing functions that used to be retained as management prerogatives. A
survey of manufacturing establishments found that the share of establishments adopting at least one employee involvement practice (defined as
quality circles, job rotation, teams, or total quality management) rose from
65 percent in 1992 to 85 percent in 1997. The share of establishments
reporting the use of multiple employee involvement practices rose from
37 percent to 71 percent over the same period. As employees take on more
responsibility and are involved in more complex production processes, a
greater premium is placed on skills and cognitive ability. One study showed
a rapid increase during the 1980s and 1990s in the proportion of the labor
force engaged in tasks requiring interactive or analytical skills, as opposed to
tasks based more on following prescribed rules. Thus firms have an incentive
to undertake more extensive screening of prospective employees and provide
more continuing education and training to those on the payroll. Job rotation
can serve as another way of improving employees’ understanding of the
firm’s processes, thereby enhancing their ability to solve problems and
improve productivity.
Much of this shift in decisionmaking authority to production workers
began before the recent surge of investment in information technology. In
the 1980s the high performance of Japanese manufacturing and the competitive threat it posed led many U.S. firms to experiment with or adopt
Japanese-like practices. These practices have become even more valuable
as firms have made large investments in information technology that
complement their human resource investments.
A second major complementary change is the greater use of performancebased pay. Various incentive pay schemes—from production-based pay to
profit sharing to stock option plans—have been designed to improve
employee motivation. A 1998–99 survey found that 63 percent of respondent firms used some form of variable pay for nonexecutives. Between 1987
and 1999 the use of profit sharing and other performance-based incentives at
Fortune 1000 firms increased from 26 percent to over 50 percent. These
incentives perform two functions. First, they motivate employees to improve
firm performance, because the employees share in the resulting monetary
rewards. Second, they provide a screening function, as more highly skilled
and more motivated employees are more likely to be willing to work in firms
126 | Economic Report of the President

where pay is based on performance. One study of finishing lines in the steel
industry found that lines with a set of supporting innovative work organization
and incentive practices reduced downtime by 7 percentage points.
Stock option grants are a particularly important form of incentive pay.
They have been a part of executive compensation for years, but grants for
nonexecutive personnel are a relatively new phenomenon. Although only
5 percent of all nonexecutive employees in publicly held firms received stock
option grants in 1999, the proportion rises to almost 27 percent for those
earning more than $75,000 a year. Moreover, the use of this compensation
vehicle appears to be diffusing rapidly. A 1998 survey of 415 firms found
that 34 percent had some type of stock option plan for nonexecutives.
Although this was not necessarily a representative sample of all U.S. firms,
other studies reach similar findings. This study also found that, of the
88.4 percent of firms that reported the use of any type of variable pay,
17.7 percent indicated that they had introduced a stock option plan within
the past 2 years (Chart 3-11); 8.2 percent reported introducing profit
sharing, and 13.8 percent offered bonuses. Eligibility for stock options was
also broadened more rapidly than were plans for profit sharing or bonuses.
A study of 125 firms that accounted for about 75 percent of 1997 market
capitalization of firms in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index estimated the
value of these grants at about 4 percent of total compensation in 1998.

Chapter 3

| 127

The use of stock options appears to be highly concentrated in the hightechnology sector. Stock options might be a preferred method of
compensating workers in high-technology firms because they allow firms
with low current (but high expected future) cash flows to offer higher
compensation than they otherwise could. Stock options may also elicit
greater worker effort and productivity by tying the worker’s compensation to
the firm’s long-term performance. There is little actual evidence, however, on
the performance effects of stock options. One study did find that the presence of an employee stock ownership plan or a stock option plan increases
labor productivity at the establishment level, after controlling for other
aspects of workplace practices and establishment attributes. Another study
found that, after controlling for firm size and industry classification, sales per
worker in 1997 were higher in firms that had implemented a broad-based
employee stock option plan. However, it is too early to draw firm conclusions on the net effects of options on compensation, especially because the
expansion in their use came at a time when stock prices, and hence the value
of stock options, were increasing. The effect of employee stock option plans
may be substantially different when stock prices are flat or falling.
Significant changes in human resource practices have been documented in
several other industries, including steel, automobiles, apparel, and customer
call centers. These changes have allowed firms to make better use of the new
information technology that has recently become available.

Changes in Firm Boundaries
Information technology, along with the complementary human resource
practices just described, has also had important effects on firm boundaries in
many industries. (A firm’s “boundary” is simply the line between the set of
activities a firm performs for itself and the set of activities that it pays other
firms to perform for it.) Vertical boundaries describe the firm’s relationships
with its suppliers and its customers: vertically integrated firms manage their
own supply lines and have their own marketing and distribution networks,
whereas firms that are not vertically integrated prefer to purchase supplies
from independent dealers and to contract out their marketing and distribution to retailers. Horizontal boundaries describe the firm’s relationships with
its rivals: some markets are dominated by a few large, horizontally integrated
firms, whereas in others many smaller firms compete for customers.
Information technology has frequently led to tighter, more closely integrated relationships between firms and their suppliers and between firms and
their customers, without necessarily leading to full vertical integration.
Indeed, the declining cost of exchanging information between firms has led
many firms to outsource functions previously performed in house. At the
same time, information technology has led to substantial consolidation in
128 | Economic Report of the President

industries such as telecommunications and financial services, representing an
increase in horizontal integration, although in some cases changes in regulation and competition have been more important motives for consolidating.

Supplier Relationships
Today’s consumer goods pass through complex supply chains, which the
application of information technology can make more efficient. In many
industries today, the supply chain involves a number of firms performing a
variety of distinct functions, all of which are necessary to bring a product to
market. These firms may create or extract primary materials, design and
assemble those materials into more complex components, transport intermediate and finished products, or offer them for sale to the consumer. The
efficiency of this system depends on the speed with which it delivers final
products to consumers, the amount of inventory that is locked up in the
supply chain at any given time, and, of course, the efficiency of each firm
in the chain.
Information technology, combined with changes in business practices, has
enabled firms to reduce costs and increase efficiency in their supply chains, as
is evident in retail trade. In the retail sector, sharing of point-of-sale data
between a firm and its suppliers, a practice that received considerable attention in the 1980s, has become increasingly widespread, improving the
flexibility and efficiency of distribution systems and lowering costs for
consumers. For example, over 97 percent of grocery stores now use scanners
to collect point-of-sale data. Efficient customer response (ECR) systems that
share this point-of-sale data with suppliers to improve the efficiency of the
supply chain were introduced in 1992. These systems take into account
customer demand in an individual store as well as the complete economics of
the supply chain. One recent study showed that ECR adoption was associated with higher productivity: firms that had gone further in their efforts to
adopt ECR had higher sales per labor hour and per square foot and turned
over their inventories more often than other firms. The study was not able to
establish the direction of causation, however. In many industries these
changes have redefined, or promise to redefine, the relationship between a
firm and its suppliers.
More drastic improvements in efficiency, driven by Internet technology,
are occurring in other industries. In some cases, new firms have entered the
market to simplify complex purchasing processes. For example, in the highly
specialized life science research supply business, scientists at tens of thousands
of different laboratories in hundreds of firms and universities purchase over
1 million distinct products manufactured by hundreds of firms to conduct
their experiments. For a laboratory scientist, ordering these products has
traditionally involved searching through 500-page catalogues from multiple
suppliers, filling out forms to send to the purchasing department, and faxing
Chapter 3

| 129

or phoning in an order. The typical cost of processing orders in this way,
including paperwork and employee time, has been estimated to be around
$100 per order. Using the Internet, one firm has created an on-line marketplace with over 1 million products and has streamlined the ordering process
and the interface between the purchasing department and the scientist. This
technology promises to reduce the total cost of placing an order to about $10.
On-line business-to-business (B2B) exchanges have emerged to seek even
greater efficiencies in the industrial procurement process. Some of these
exchanges are industry-specific, whereas others offer a broad range of industrial products, commodities, and services to multiple industries. B2B
exchanges offer a range of transaction tools, such as auctions, centralized
clearing for payments, credit information about trading partners, and other
custom services that allow greater efficiency in procurement. One on-line
exchange claims to have saved customers $2 billion during its 5 years in
operation. An on-line exchange for the steel industry boasts a clientele
of 220 mills, 647 service centers, 909 fabricators, 352 distributors, and
626 trading companies.
One market research firm estimates that B2B sales over the Internet rose to
$200 billion in 2000, from about $40 billion in 1998. Projections vary
widely but tend to agree that this dramatic growth will continue in the near
future. The efficiencies of B2B commerce are likely to extend the performance gains already realized in aggregate inventory statistics. Inventories in a
wide range of industries have fallen steadily over the past decade, with significant declines in apparel and department stores and among manufacturers of
industrial and electronic goods. For example, in the early to mid-1990s,
firms in the apparel industry reduced their inventories by an average of
1.2 percent per year, and their inventory-to-sales ratios by an average of
5.2 percent per year, by adopting information technology and a modular,
team-based system of production that improved flexibility.
Many firms are outsourcing, or contracting out, functions they previously
performed themselves. Indeed, outsourcing has grown rapidly. Between
January 1993 and October 2000, employment agency payrolls grew
99 percent, and management consulting services grew about 94 percent
(Chart 3-12), while economy-wide employment growth was a much smaller
20 percent. Firms routinely outsource strategic development and the
management of their information technology, human resources, and facilities
operations to firms that specialize in these functions.
Firms choose to outsource for any of several reasons. Contractors that
specialize in a particular function may have competitive advantages in
performing these functions relative to in-house staff and service groups, and
reducing operating costs is one of the most frequently cited reasons for
outsourcing. Contracting out can contribute to a firm’s productivity in other
ways. By letting others provide services that are ancillary to the company’s
130 | Economic Report of the President

primary business, outsourcing allows management to focus its effort on
doing its core business better. In addition, outsourcing provides firms with
access to expertise that would be costly and time-consuming for the firm to
recruit and bring on staff. This expertise can also bring in new ideas and
innovations learned from other firms in the industry or beyond. Finally,
firms can use outsourcing to achieve greater flexibility: they can quickly
access capabilities as needed and with less investment in physical plant and
less overhead. At the same time, however, outsourcing carries risk for firms
and for their employees. Management may lose control of key operational
functions or skills. And some temporary employees may be paid less than
regular employees and be less likely to receive benefits such as health insurance.
Firms have other choices besides outsourcing and in-house production.
They can engage in strategic alliances, which are long-term agreements
between firms to share facilities, expertise, and other resources to accomplish
joint goals. U.S. firms have been particularly active in this area, accounting
for about half of all alliances among firms based in OECD countries during
the 1990s. Strategic alliances, like other long-term contracts, allow firms to
combine some aspects of their operations without incurring the costs of full
integration. For example, an alliance with a key supplier can help stabilize the
supply chain, whereas a marketing alliance may allow firms producing
complementary products to pool their resources for greater joint gains. (A
movie studio might form an alliance with a fast-food restaurant chain to
promote a new release, for example.) Also, as discussed earlier in this chapter,
Chapter 3

| 131

firms may ally in order to develop a new technology or to exchange existing
technical capabilities.

Customer Relationships
Information technology has also enabled firms to communicate more
closely with their customers, and thus to be more responsive to customer
preferences and to produce goods and services that reflect those preferences.
Firms are using information technology in a number of ways to improve
marketing and customer service. As the costs of computing and data storage
have fallen, firms’ efforts have shifted away from mass marketing, in which
each potential consumer receives the same message, to more interactive
marketing (sometimes called micromarketing). Interactive marketing uses
information about a customer’s prior purchase behavior, credit history, location, and income to provide that customer with information about products
he or she might be likely to purchase. Database technology has made this
type of marketing feasible on a broad scale. On-line book and music retailers
now provide their customers with real-time recommendations for additional
purchases based on the customer’s purchase history, and grocery stores use
customer data to tailor the choice of cents-off coupons offered at checkout.
The same database technology, combined with reduced costs of communication, has enabled firms in a number of industries to provide customer service
at lower cost over the phone. Firms in industries from telecommunications to
financial services to consumer goods have established telephone call centers
to handle customer questions and to provide product support. Information
technology allows these centers to be based almost anywhere in the world,
and service representatives at these centers to access the entire history of a
customer’s account during the call. The ability to store and retrieve these data
quickly has made customer information a strategic asset, one that firms are
increasingly looking to take advantage of.
The Internet is radically altering how producers and sellers of consumer
goods interact with their customers. A manufacturer or retailer can now
communicate with customers anywhere in the world at relatively low cost. A
number of firms have taken advantage of this capability, offering products
and product information via the Internet. Consumers with access to the
Internet can now do comparison shopping at very low cost before leaving the
house or placing an on-line order. Internet sales to consumers reached
$17.1 billion in the first three quarters of 2000 (but still account for less than
1 percent of all retail sales). The Internet has also created whole new transaction mechanisms, such as on-line auctions. A significant fraction of all
Internet consumer auctions are for secondary goods and remainders. This
suggests that total trade in these goods may be on the rise.

Market Structure
Technology has also affected the structure of many markets, making some
more highly concentrated while leading others to become more fragmented.
Markets for many software products and information services, for example,
have been dominated by big players with large market shares. Ownership of
a particular technology standard is often an important source of competitive
advantage if that technology cannot be imitated, and this can lead to market
concentration. In the United States, information technology standards are
often established in a decentralized manner, through the free play of the
market, rather than through a centrally coordinated effort. Markets with
strong network effects are often characterized by “tipping.” When it becomes
apparent that one technology has a large enough lead, the market may “tip,”
with nearly all new consumers from that point forward adopting the dominant technology. In such winner-take-all (or winner-take-most) markets, a
firm faces crucial decisions about whether to make its product compatible
with past and future generations of products, and whether to base its product
on open or proprietary technology. Intense early competition to build a base
of loyal users may result. Firms may also use strategic product preannouncements to establish a stake in a new market and head off competition.
This propensity of markets with network effects to tip poses challenges for
regulators and antitrust authorities as one or a few firms begin to dominate.
It also encourages cooperation among competitors within an industry to
promote a standardized technology. In cases where formal alliances or joint
ventures are created, the costs of developing intellectual property are often
shared, as are marketing expenses. As the U.S. legal code and U.S. antitrust
authorities have recognized, such collaboration need not preclude vigorous
competition in the product market.
In industries such as telecommunications, energy, and financial services,
many markets have become more concentrated as firms combine their operations through mergers and acquisitions. In financial services the primary
sources of structural change have been information technology and deregulation. For instance, ever since passage of the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956, geographic restrictions on banks have been slowly lifted, enabling
them to expand gradually across State lines. Although barriers to interstate
banking were not completely removed until the enactment of the RiegleNeal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, regional and
interstate pacts enabled bank holding companies to operate across State
lines. One study estimates that, by 1994, a bank holding company in a
typical State had competitive access to nearly 70 percent of U.S. gross
domestic banking assets.

Chapter 3

| 133

As banks have expanded, they have also begun to consolidate. Over a third
of all banking organizations nationwide disappeared between 1979 and
1994, even as total banking assets continued to increase. Between 1988 and
1997 the numbers of stand-alone banks and top-level bank holding companies both fell by almost 30 percent, while the share of U.S. banking assets
held by the top eight banking organizations rose from 22.3 percent to
35.5 percent. In 1998, 4 of the top 10 U.S. “mega-mergers,” based on market
value, occurred in financial services. These changes are not confined to the
United States: two Japanese bank mergers currently pending will create the
two largest banks in the world, with about $2.5 trillion in assets between them.
Deregulation is thus an important spur to geographic diversification and
consolidation. Past geographic restrictions on competition may have allowed
inefficient banks to survive, and consequently the gradual removal of these
restrictions has transformed the structure of the industry. One study shows
that bank efficiency improved substantially as restrictions on intrastate
branching and interstate banking were removed. As a result, the share of
deposits held by subsidiaries of out-of-State bank holding companies
increased from 2 percent in 1979 to 28 percent in 1994. Meanwhile, the
Glass-Steagall prohibition on combining commercial and investment
banking in the same enterprise is slowly being lifted. In 1987 the Federal
Reserve Board began permitting bank holding companies to engage in
limited nonbank activities through so-called Section 20 affiliates. Section 20
activities were originally limited to 5 percent of a subsidiary’s total revenue,
but the limit was raised to 10 percent in 1989 and 25 percent in 1996.
In 1999 many of the Depression-era restrictions on banks were formally
removed with passage of the Financial Modernization Act (also known as the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act). This legislation lifts these regulatory barriers by
creating a uniform regulatory framework governing affiliations among
different financial services institutions, and by expanding the range of investments available to these firms. The new law allows banks, security firms, and
insurance firms to affiliate under a new rubric, that of a financial holding
company. By November 2000, 456 such companies had been formed, with
assets totaling 13 percent of all U.S. financial sector assets.
Expansion, consolidation, and diversification can bring about performance
improvements by allowing financial institutions to realize economies of scale.
These scale economies are largely driven by innovations such as new financial
instruments, new risk management techniques, automatic tellers, improved
back-office operations, phone centers, and Internet banking. Recent evidence
indicates that bank efficiency has indeed improved, particularly when new
banking organizations have been created through mergers and acquisitions.
Large banks have also made significant improvements in their abilities to
manage risk; the costs of financial distress, bankruptcy, and loss of charter
134 | Economic Report of the President

have been reduced. Moreover, despite fears that large banking organizations
would focus exclusively on large customers, bank mergers and acquisitions
have not adversely affected small business lending. The Department of
Justice’s Antitrust Division, along with the Federal Reserve Board, is careful
to consider the impact of mergers on the communities to be served before
approving any reorganization.

Explaining Changes in Firm Boundaries
As these examples have shown, firms are tightening some supplier and
customer relationships, outsourcing other aspects of their operations, and in
many cases consolidating business activities with former rivals. These and
other changes in firm boundaries are best understood within the contractual
framework associated with the Nobel Prize–winning economist Ronald
Coase. Coase was the first to explain that the boundaries of an organization
depend not only on its productive technology but also on the costs of transacting business. In the Coasian framework, the decision whether to organize
transactions within the firm or on the open market—the make-or-buy decision—depends on the relative costs of internal and external exchange. Use of
the market mechanism entails certain costs: discovering the relevant prices,
negotiating and enforcing contracts, and so on. Within the firm, entrepreneurs may be able to reduce these transactions costs by coordinating these
activities themselves. However, internalizing brings other kinds of transactions costs, namely, problems of information flow, preserving incentives,
monitoring effort, and evaluating performance. The boundary of the firm,
then, is determined by the trade-off, at the margin, between the relative
transactions costs of external and internal exchange. In this sense a firm’s
boundaries depend not only on technology but also on organizational considerations, that is, on the costs and benefits of various contracting alternatives.
The above examples suggest ways in which information technology may
alter these boundaries by influencing transactions costs. In the case of
supplier relations, communications and coordination with suppliers is facilitated by e-mail, automated information exchange, and particularly by B2B
Internet use, all of which should reduce firms’ tendency to be vertically integrated. However, at the same time, information technology also reduces the
costs of coordinating activities within the firm, so the net effect on vertical
boundaries is ambiguous. Moreover, information technology may lead to
expanded horizontal boundaries, as high-speed communications across
plants in different countries now allows firms to grow as they exploit their
comparative advantages in global markets. Perhaps for these reasons, it is
difficult to detect any economy-wide changes in vertical or horizontal
boundaries, although distinct patterns are discernible within particular
industries.

Chapter 3

| 135

Competition and Strategy
Firms face a variety of strategic decisions. So far this chapter has discussed
the decisions surrounding the adoption of information technology, reorganization of the workplace, and the fixing of the firm’s vertical and horizontal
boundaries. These and other decisions are made with the goal of outperforming rivals, that is, of achieving what the strategic management literature
calls sustained competitive advantage. An important source of sustained
competitive advantage is the possession of unique resources, such as firmspecific knowledge or capabilities, an installed base of users, valuable patents,
or a popular proprietary standard. In the new, knowledge-based economy,
such intangible resources have become increasingly important.

Intangible Capital
Success in the New Economy relies on intangible capital. In a market characterized by intensified competition (driven by globalization and
deregulation) and rapid product and service innovation, corporations must
innovate continuously—creating new products or services and producing
them with new, more efficient processes—to stay competitive. Thus, intangible assets—organizational practices, human resources, R&D capability,
and reputation—are now much more prominent features of a firm’s competitive strategy, because they are the foundation for innovations that lead to
success. New organizational practices provide the ability to respond quickly
to new opportunities. Appropriate human resource practices, such as an
emphasis on training and the design of appropriate incentives, provide firms
with employees who are able and eager to recognize, create, and develop
opportunities. An R&D program that is good at conceiving ideas and
converting them into products provides a stream of innovations. A favorable
reputation, embodied in brand names, trademarks, and customer loyalty, can
provide the trust on the part of customers that encourages their acceptance of
a firm’s latest product innovations.
One indicator of the importance of intangible capital is what economists
call Tobin’s q, which is the ratio of a firm’s market value to the cost of
replacing its underlying tangible capital. One interpretation of a high q is
that a large part of the firm’s value derives from intangible capital. As Chart
3-13 shows, Tobin’s q for publicly traded U.S. firms rose throughout the
1990s. This is consistent with an increasing importance of intangible capital.

Information Goods
It is said that information, not tangible products, is the most important
economic good in the New Economy. Of course, so-called information
goods, from books, music, and television programs to the yellow pages and
real-time stock quotes, have long been important to the U.S. economy.
136 | Economic Report of the President

During the last decade, however, innovations in duplication, storage, and
transmission have sharply reduced the cost of delivering information goods
to consumers. These falling costs have led to increased entry by firms seeking
to deliver new information products and have led incumbent firms to revisit
their strategies for maximizing the value of the information they create
and distribute.
The production of information tends to be characterized by high fixed
costs and low variable costs; computing and the Internet reduce the latter
nearly to zero. When consumers’ preferences are relatively similar, markets
for information goods may be highly concentrated. For example, few
markets are served by more than two yellow pages providers. However, when
consumers’ preferences vary widely, multiple producers may enter the market
and find it profitable to focus on small groups of consumers. For example,
although the major television networks still account for over half of viewership in prime time, hundreds of other cable television channels now cater to
specific viewer tastes.
The low cost of distributing information via the Internet has led information providers to rethink yet again their strategies for reaching consumers.
Many magazines and newspapers now offer free on-line versions of their
paper products. Some of these firms offer additional unique on-line content
for free; others offer premium services such as customized content for an
additional fee. Some information providers have integrated with distribution
channels such as cable operators and even Internet access providers, whereas
others have chosen to remain independent.
Chapter 3

| 137

Internet Retailing
For retailers and manufacturers of branded consumer goods, the Internet
has created a whole new distribution channel. This has raised significant
issues about how to compete, especially for firms with investments in physical distribution infrastructure. For manufacturers that have traditionally
sold through intermediaries such as department stores or specialty retailers,
the Internet makes direct sales to customers possible. However, for these
firms to sell directly through the Internet, they must undertake activities that
are new to them, such as retail billing, order fulfillment, delivery, and
handling of individual returns. The potential profits from additional sales at
retail prices must be measured against the cost of developing these new capabilities and against potential loss of sales through existing channels. A major
sports apparel producer now sells through four different channels: sporting
goods stores, department stores, company-owned stores, and the Internet.
For traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers, on-line sales may compete
directly with their own retail business. This has led some firms, such as one
large book retailer, to separate their on-line and bricks-and-mortar operations
in order to offer greater flexibility to both. Other retailers have chosen hybrid
strategies, allowing customers to buy on line but funneling all returns
and customer service through existing stores. Some bricks-and-mortar
retailers have forged partnerships with on-line retailers to satisfy the needs of
on-line shoppers.

Understanding Performance Gains
This chapter has documented the extensive changes in firm organization
and strategy brought about by technological change. Ultimately, however, to
explain the effects of information technology on the aggregate productivity
gains reported in Chapter 1, these technological and organizational improvements must be linked to realized performance gains. Fortunately, new studies
are beginning to document the performance effects of information technology and associated organizational changes at individual plants and firms.
This evidence strongly supports the idea that the new technology, when
combined with the appropriate organizational structures, has improved
performance, and did so especially in the 1990s.

How Do Technology and Organizational Change
Improve Performance?
As already emphasized, investments in information technology work best
when combined with complementary changes in business and production
138 | Economic Report of the President

practices. Performance improvements are most likely to be realized when
firms couple these investments with changes in basic business practices, such
as in job design, organizational structure, and interactions with customers
and suppliers, and changes in human resource practices, such as in incentives
and decisionmaking authority, that are designed to allow employees to use
the new technology most effectively. Differences in the patterns and rates at
which plants adopt these complementary practices may explain why the
productivity effects of investments in information technology did not come
immediately and still have not been realized by all firms.
The lag and variability in productivity gains after investing in information
technology may be due to the time it takes for employees to adjust to the
new technology. Implementing automated equipment initially causes disruption, as employees must learn new practices and understand that the
operating procedures and priorities in place under the old technology may
not be appropriate with the new technology. Introducing the newly needed
skills into the work force—either by retraining or by hiring new workers with
the appropriate skills—takes time, and productivity can fall during the transition. For instance, the introduction of electronic controls into automobile
engines, transmissions, and auxiliary equipment and the development of
computerized diagnostic equipment forced some mechanics to learn new
skills. Several studies note that the disruptions caused by retraining can be so
severe that firms choose to implement new technologies in greenfield sites—
newly built plants with new employees who do not have to unlearn the
old practices.
A second reason for the lag and variance is the need to match organizational structure to technological capabilities. In particular, giving employees
authority to make decisions on workflow and machine scheduling, structuring employee compensation systems to align employees’ interests with
those of the firm, and implementing teamwork structures that effectively use
employee skills all can increase the productivity of information technology.
Those plants that adopt complementary human resource practices along
with information technology tend to see greater performance improvements.
For example, precision metal-cutting plants that redesigned work responsibilities to allow the operators to perform program editing were found to be
30 percent more efficient than plants where no production workers were
given these responsibilities.
Research on information technology–related productivity at the firm level
is difficult, in part because investment in the new technology is difficult to
measure. However, a few studies have assessed the impact of such investments at the firm level. These also suggest that information technology, when
combined with complementary human resource practices, can lead to performance gains. One study of the use of information technology in a nationally
representative sample of over 1,600 firms found that increasing the share of
Chapter 3

| 139

the production work force that uses computers from 10 percent to
50 percent increased labor productivity by 4.8 percent. When increased
computer utilization was coupled with profit sharing and implementation of
employee involvement practices such as self-managed teams, labor productivity rose by another 6 percent in nonunion plants and 15 percent in union
plants. Another study, this one of service and sales teams at call centers,
found that self-managed teams improved sales productivity by 9.3 percent,
and introducing new technology improved it by 5.3 percent. But when new
technology and self-managed teams were combined, the result was an additional 17 percent rise in productivity above and beyond the individual
effects. Although these studies cannot establish definitive causal relationships,
the examples described in this chapter strongly suggest that information
technology, when combined with appropriate organizational practices, can
improve performance.

The Dynamics of Market Competition
The New Economy is characterized by both high profitability and high
risk. Over a hundred new e-commerce startups have already shut their doors.
Others, however, have made inroads against the established firms in their
industries, and some have even transformed their industries.

Competition and Creative Destruction
Market competition is a dynamic process whereby entrepreneurs
constantly launch new companies to challenge existing ones, occasionally
replacing them but just as often failing. This process—what the economist
Joseph Schumpeter called creative destruction—is apparent in the U.S.
economy today. As Chart 3-14 shows, the remarkable growth of the U.S.
economy in the 1990s brought no reduction in business failures.
Throughout the current expansion, business failures have hovered near their
post-1980 average.
As these statistics suggest, today’s firms are subject to remarkably intense
competitive pressure, from both domestic and foreign sources. Nonetheless,
corporate profits have exhibited strong growth, rising in real terms at a
5.7 percent annual rate from 1993 through mid-2000. This compares more
than favorably with the period between 1980 and 1992, when real corporate
profits rose at a 2.2 percent annual rate, and with the period between 1950
and 1992, when real corporate profits rose at a 3.2 percent annual rate
(Chart 3-15). In short, a high rate of business failure is not necessarily a sign
of economic weakness. Rather, it may simply reflect the market-driven
process of shifting resources and adjusting the structure of production to
meet consumers’ changing needs.

Chapter 3

The Impact of Globalization
Along with the technological and organizational changes that this chapter
has described, increasing global trade has made markets more competitive,
with dramatic effects on firm behavior and performance. If a firm is
exporting and competing in a variety of markets, it might be forced to
improve its performance in order to penetrate overseas markets with strong
domestic suppliers. Likewise, an increase in imports may lead domestic
industries to search out ways to be more efficient, ultimately making them
better at competing with foreign producers.
Evidence from the manufacturing sector suggests that good firms become
exporters. Less clear is the answer to the opposite question: does exporting
make a firm better? At the firm level there appears to be no significant causal
link between exports and productivity. Microeconomic evidence from the
Republic of Korea and from Taiwan reveals few industries where it can be
argued that exporting alone aids performance. However, aggregate data show
a correlation between trend productivity and export demand: an economy
that exports more will likely have higher aggregate performance than one
that exports less. This relationship appears to be stronger for high-technology
industries. Nonetheless, the effect is smaller than that found for an equivalent increase in domestic demand. It could be that firms find it difficult to
meet a wide variety of foreign regulations and satisfy a wide range of foreign
preferences while maintaining efficiency.
Increased import competition is also associated with an increase in trend
productivity. Combined with the observed link between export demand and
productivity, this suggests that the economy as a whole allocates resources
better when subjected to global competition. In part, this may be because
imports spur imitation and innovation: a new foreign good introduced into
the United States creates new demand, which challengers then seek to
capture or duplicate with products of their own. Evidence from Japan
suggests that it was import competition, not increased exports, that boosted
the Japanese economy during its high-growth period from 1964 to 1973. A
study of the aftermath of Chile’s massive trade liberalization in the 1980s
found that productivity in import-competing firms improved an average of 3
to 10 percent more than that in firms producing nontraded goods.

Conclusion
Technology has been a driving force behind the performance gains that are
associated with the New Economy. With advances in information technology,
firms have accelerated their investments in the new technology. It appears
that sustained investment in information technology began to pay off
142 | Economic Report of the President

handsomely in the 1990s, in the form of higher productivity within and
across sectors. But it takes time for firms to realize these performance gains.
They must first integrate information technology into their business or
production processes, often through the development of highly specialized
software. They also face important organizational and strategic choices about
the best uses of new technologies and the increased availability of information. At the same time, increasing global competition and deregulation have
given firms the incentives and the opportunities to seek ways of accelerating
their performance.
Not all firms will be equally successful at implementing technological and
organizational changes, and cyclical factors will diminish the gains at times.
As discussed above, new firms have been important drivers of change, particularly in the information technology sector. However, innovation is by
nature a risky endeavor, and many new ventures will fail. Equity values will
continue to fluctuate. Entrepreneurs, investors, and workers must be
prepared for the disturbances that typically accompany economic change.
Moreover, the economy as a whole will continue to experience the rise and
fall of the business cycle, making underlying productivity trends difficult
to discern.
Although the impressive performance of the New Economy is ultimately
due to the creativity and hard work of market participants, U.S. policies have
helped create an environment that encourages entrepreneurship. The United
States places relatively few restrictions on the movement of capital and labor,
so that firms and individuals can respond when profit opportunities arise.
The United States also imposes relatively low tax rates, so that individuals
can realize the rewards of their innovation and effort. Extensive and relatively
unfettered capital markets in the United States give entrepreneurs access to
the financial resources they need to innovate. The U.S. government has practiced fiscal restraint, reducing interest rates and freeing capital for private
sector use. And U.S. policies have provided direct support for R&D, along
with indirect support through tax incentives for private sector investments.
These policies have proved extremely valuable to firms and industries, and it
is essential that they be continued.

The New Economy in a Global Context

P

articipation in the global economy has made a vital contribution toward
U.S. economic performance. It is no coincidence that a New Economy has
emerged in the United States at the same time that our involvement in the
global economy has reached new heights. Indeed, globalization and the recent
advances in information technology at the core of the New Economy are inextricably linked. On the one hand, globalization has played a crucial role in
promoting the technological innovation and investment and facilitating the
organizational restructuring that built the New Economy. On the other hand,
improvements in information technology have spurred deeper integration
between the United States and the world economy.
An increasingly open global economy—which the policies of this
Administration have helped promote—boosts innovation in several ways.
First, it makes available the expanded markets that yield the scale economies
so important for activities that require large up-front research and development expenditure. Second, it gives producers access to key imported
components and machines at lower prices and in greater variety. Importing
these goods allows U.S. innovators to concentrate on activities that make the
best use of their knowledge and skills. Third, by heightening competition,
145

globalization spurs not only innovation but also the adoption of new
technologies. This in turn creates still larger markets for innovative goods and
thus greater rewards for those who innovate. In addition, the availability of
information technologies facilitates the global reorganization of production
and the continued increase in trade. It allows multinational firms to
coordinate their activities and to manage supply chains on a global scale.
It also brings increased numbers of buyers and sellers into global markets.
Globalization has also helped support the high rate of investment that
has played an important role in the current economic expansion. Increased
capital flows into the United States have made it possible to maintain
investment in excess of domestic saving.
An example of the importance of global markets can be seen in the increased
production and use of computers in the United States in recent years. Domestic purchases of computers, peripherals, and parts grew at an annual rate of more
than 12 percent from 1993 to 1999, far outstripping growth in the value of
domestic shipments of these goods, which averaged only 9 percent. Filling the
gap has been a rise in imports, which now account for more than 60 percent of
the value of new U.S. computer purchases—nearly twice the level in 1987. At
the same time, half of U.S. computer shipments are exported. The United States
gains in both directions from this two-way trade in computers and parts. U.S.
computer firms can lower their costs by obtaining components from efficient
foreign producers, and later profit from selling finished computers in the larger
global market. At the same time, lower prices for computer imports are good for
consumers and for businesses.
In an age of international economic integration, continued success in the
United States requires effective engagement with the global economy,
strengthening international connections and building larger markets overseas. At issue is not whether we should welcome the emergence of a truly
global market economy, but rather what kind of global market economy we
should work to build. To ensure that globalization proceeds in a constructive
way, the policies of the Administration have sought to make international
institutions both more effective in helping to maintain global economic
stability and more transparent in their operation.
This Administration has consistently stressed that making economic
integration work means making it work for all people—and making sure that
all voices are heard when policies are decided. Toward this end, even as it has
adopted policies that promote globalization, the Administration has sought
to address genuine and deeply felt concerns about its effects. These include
its effects on the incomes of working people, the health of the environment,
social and labor standards, and the divergence of incomes between rich and
poor countries across the globe. The goal has been to foster an interconnected
global economy that both increases prosperity and provides genuine
opportunity for people everywhere.
146 | Economic Report of the President

The Role of Trade Liberalization
in Promoting Globalization
Trade policy has been an important factor in our prosperity here at home.
The focus of this Administration has been on fostering a world of open
markets governed by the rule of law, in which lower tariff and nontariff
barriers allow all countries, including the United States, to enjoy the benefits
of increased trade and investment. The achievements of the past 8 years
include numerous international agreements—over 300 in all—that have
liberalized both trade and investment, helping to ensure that foreign markets
are open to U.S. exports. Among these are a number of especially notable
accomplishments, including passage of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), completion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral
trade negotiations, enactment of legislation to extend permanent normal
trade relations to China, a moratorium on customs duties on electronically
delivered products, and agreements to liberalize trade in such crucial
technology-related sectors as telecommunications, computer technology, and
financial services. In addition, the member countries of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have benefited from an
agreement to reduce subsidies in tied aid export credit competition. This
agreement limits the ability of countries to make the financial aid they offer
to developing countries contingent on purchases from their domestic producers, and thus helps level the playing field for U.S. exporters. A host
of other bilateral and regional initiatives have also helped create more open
markets. These include initiatives that encourage trade with developing
countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Central America, the Middle East,
and Southeast Asia. These programs not only benefit the United States
through more diverse and cheaper imports and expanded exports, but also
afford developing countries an important opportunity for growth through
increased access to the U.S. and other markets.
The trade agreements to which the United States has been a party nearly
always result in a lowering of barriers on both sides, but typically it is the
foreign barriers to American firms operating abroad, rather than barriers to
foreign firms in U.S. markets, that fall the most. This is true for the simple
reason that, in nearly all cases, the U.S. barriers were lower to begin with.
This was the case with both the Uruguay Round agreement and NAFTA,
both of which removed substantial impediments to U.S. exporters.
Similarly, the bilateral agreements concluded with Japan under the 1993
Framework Agreement and the 1997 Enhanced Initiative on Deregulation
and Competition Policy have helped eliminate obstacles to U.S. exports to
that country, in the form of border barriers and domestic regulations that
unnecessarily hindered trade and investment. Opening foreign markets can
Chapter 4

| 147

stimulate exports by providing firms with a larger arena in which to sell
their goods and services. For example, one result of China’s recent trade
liberalization was that exports of U.S. oranges to that country grew from less
than 350,000 kilograms in all of 1999 to more than 10 million kilograms in
the first 9 months of 2000.
Trade liberalization has also focused on industries of special relevance for
the improved communications and technology that are at the heart of the
New Economy. Several multilateral treaties have been negotiated under the
auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The 1996 Information
Technology Agreement eliminates tariffs on the preponderance of world
trade in semiconductors, computers, software, telecommunications equipment, and other high-technology products. The Agreement on Basic
Telecommunications Services, which came into force in February 1998, has
already made an important start toward opening world telecommunications
markets to competition. The Financial Services Agreement, which took effect
in March 1999, similarly opens markets in banking, insurance, and securities
transactions. This allows U.S. financial services companies to better serve
overseas markets through investments in foreign banking institutions,
brokerages, and insurance concerns. Work is now under way to expand these
agreements to include new products and services and achieve further
deregulation and liberalization. The United States stands to reap sizable
gains from increased exports in these industries where U.S. firms are strong
competitors. But all countries will benefit from these agreements through
lower prices and the diffusion of knowledge that goes hand in hand with
trade and investment.

Globalization and Economic Performance
Trade and investment spur innovation and competition and thus
contribute to better economic performance. This benefits society at large
through the development of new goods and technologies, through higher
productivity, and ultimately through lower costs for consumers and
entrepreneurs.

Scale and Network Effects
Openness to the global economy increases the size of markets. This is
particularly important for the development of goods and services subject to
scale and network effects, including items that are central to the New
Economy, such as technology and communications. Production of these
items is subject to economies of scale—that is, the average cost of production

148 | Economic Report of the President

declines with the quantity sold. Among these products are those characterized by learning curves: the more the firm produces, the more it learns how
to reduce production costs, so that, on average, each additional unit costs less
to produce than the one before. Scale effects are present as well for products
with high fixed costs of development; because these fixed costs do not
depend on the number of units produced, the average cost per unit falls
as the number produced rises. This kind of cost structure describes most
pharmaceuticals: developing and testing a new drug is expensive, but the cost
of producing it, once the formula is known, is typically quite small. For
goods like computer software and entertainment, development costs
are again quite high, but the products, once created, can be reproduced
relatively cheaply. Moreover, these products can be used by many consumers
simultaneously without diminishing their value. The availability of a global
marketplace gives firms a greater incentive to undertake the costly research and
development necessary to create these kinds of products.
Globalization is similarly important in industries characterized by network
effects. In most such industries, which include telecommunications, the
value of the network grows as more users are added. Indeed, this value
grows exponentially, in a phenomenon known as Metcalfe’s law. Expansion
of markets from a local or national to a global scale clearly benefits network
industries. An example is the expansion of the Internet itself, which after all
is a network of computer networks. As the number of global Internet users
grows, the Internet becomes more valuable to all, including those who were
already on line. The larger market that the growing Internet community represents
provides added incentives for innovation by entrepreneurs, thus contributing
to increased employment and wealth creation. The new products and services
thus made available entice still more users throughout the world to seek
access to the network. In this way, technology and openness combine to
encourage innovation, which in turn further enhances globalization itself.

Competition and Innovation
Firms in an open global economy can choose from a broader range of
inputs, thereby increasing efficiency and lowering production costs. Consumers are also made better off from access to a wider choice of goods and
services. Even a large economy such as the United States benefits from
greater specialization in a global economy, because it allows Americans to
pick and choose from the best ideas and the most advanced and cost-efficient
sources of goods from all over the world. These include not only consumer
goods but also capital goods and intermediate inputs, which make our own
final products more competitive.

Chapter 4

| 149

Globalization increases the number of competitors in a market, and
increased competition compels firms to continually innovate and improve
their productive efficiency. For example, in the early 1980s U.S. computer
firms and other manufacturers that used memory chips in their products are
reported to have preferred chips from Japanese rather than American
producers, because the Japanese-made chips had lower defect rates. This
led the U.S. producers to study and apply Japanese quality management
techniques, so that by the early 1990s their defect rates matched those of
their Japanese competitors.

Changes in the Global Organization of Production
Together, competition, globalization, and technological innovation induce
changes in the organization of firms and in the geographic division of production. The worldwide reach of the Internet and open access to global
transportation networks make it easier for businesses everywhere to go
global, by reducing the cost of setting up an international presence. Increased
openness and improved communications expand the scope of the firm,
allowing multinationals to apply advanced production techniques to larger
markets and thus benefit from scale economies (Box 4-1). At the same time,
the countries that host the multinationals’ expanded activities gain from the
transfer of technology and production experience that often accompanies
such activity. To help ensure that the operations of multinational enterprises
are in harmony with government policies, in June 2000 the OECD
member countries, joined by several nonmembers, adopted a set of voluntary
guidelines for multinational enterprises.
The opening of national economies and markets has given rise to global
supply chains, in which production is spread across numerous locations
worldwide, to take advantage of different countries’ relative strengths
in producing different goods and services. This again results in improved
efficiency for firms and lower prices for consumers. U.S. producers of
computer hard disks, for example, have kept most of their product development operations in the United States but have shifted production to
countries in Asia to take advantage of low costs of raw materials there. (It
turns out that this consideration is more important in this industry than low
labor costs.) But they have not gone so far as to outsource assembly to independent suppliers; it continues to be done almost entirely by the U.S. firms
themselves, through foreign subsidiaries. And these firms remain among
the world leaders in innovation. This runs counter to the argument that
manufacturing must be done at home to maintain competitiveness.
A different approach to production organization can be seen in the semiconductor industry, where the trend has been toward a split between
“fabless” firms that design chips but do not operate fabrication facilities, and
150 | Economic Report of the President

Box 4-1. A New Role for Multinational Firms
Firms become multinational corporations when they perceive advantages to establishing production and other activities in foreign
locations. Firms globalize their activities both to supply their homecountry market more cheaply and to serve foreign markets more directly.
Keeping foreign activities within the corporate structure lets firms avoid
the costs inherent in arm’s-length dealings with separate entities while
utilizing their own firm-specific knowledge such as advanced production
techniques. By internalizing what would otherwise be cross-border transactions, multinationals can bridge the information obstacles that often
hinder trade. For example, they may be able to more carefully monitor
product quality or worker conditions in factories they own than in those of
contractors, or adapt the composition of output more quickly to changes
in market conditions.
Improvements in information technology have reduced the impediments to exerting corporate control across borders. These advances have
combined in recent years with an increased openness on the part of governments to foreign multinationals, as the economic benefits of a foreign
presence to the host country have become more widely recognized.
These benefits include the increased investment and the associated jobs
and income that the multinational firm brings, as well as technological
transfer and improved productivity. The role of multinationals in spreading industry best practices is likely to be especially important in services,
many of which are not easily traded across national boundaries.
Evidence of the heightened role of multinationals can be seen in the
quickened pace of foreign direct investment (FDI) in recent years. In 1999
FDI flows both in and out of OECD countries reached record levels: over
2.5 percent of their combined GDP for inflows and 3.0 percent for outflows. Most FDI is between developed countries: since 1982, 75 percent of
FDI outflows from OECD countries have gone to other OECD members.
Multinationals are increasingly opting to acquire existing enterprises
rather than develop a foreign presence from scratch. In developed countries from 1991 to 1997 cross-border majority mergers and acquisitions
,
accounted for 62 percent of total FDI inflows in OECD countries. The
value of these mergers and acquisitions rose from $85 billion in 1991 to
$558 billion in 1998. The average size of such deals rose substantially,
from $29 million in 1990 to $157 million in 1999. Acquiring a foreign firm
offers a relatively quick route to enter a foreign market. It can also provide
intangibles in the form of country-specific knowledge, including familiarity with the host-country business culture and regulatory structure.
continued on next page...

Chapter 4

| 151

Box 4-1.—continued
The posts and telecommunications sector appears to be particularly
fertile territory for restructuring. The value of cross-border majority
mergers in this sector in the period from 1995 to 1998 was nearly 10
times that from 1991 to 1994. This reflects two factors. First, dramatic
changes in technology such as the growth of mobile telephony, the
Internet, and the rising importance of broadband capabilities require
both increased capital and first-rate technological prowess. Firms
may seek to combine in order to amass the capital and technological
capabilities needed to compete. Second, a worldwide movement
toward deregulation in the telecommunications industry, together
with policies such as auctions of cellular licenses and the liberalization
of fixed telephone networks, has allowed new entrants to compete in
this once-protected sector. Complementing this, the Agreement on
Basic Telecommunications Services, which took effect in February
1998, has made progress in opening global telecommunications markets
to competition.
In the air transportation industry the trend has been toward global
alliances rather than mergers and acquisitions. This stems from the
bilateral system of route rights established under the 1944 Chicago
Convention, and foreign ownership and control provisions established to protect those rights. Nonetheless, deregulation and the
advent of these alliances have meant that airlines are able to serve
customers through global networks. Technology has enabled these
alliances to act as multinationals in some respects, with improved
information technology helping to provide reasonably seamless
global travel (although flights may not always be on time or provide
the utmost of comfort) through the linkage of computerized reservations services. Information technology similarly allows multinational
express cargo carriers to ship, track, clear through customs, and
deliver goods to customers’ doors—whether the address is in Beijing
or New York.

“pure-play foundry firms” that produce chips from other companies’ designs.
Like that of hard disks, most semiconductor design is still done in the industrial countries—North America was the home of the majority of fabless firms
in 1998—while production takes place mainly in Asia. This division of labor
allows U.S. firms to focus on their core competencies while benefiting from
improved production techniques devised by the specialized foundries. And of
course, this arrangement is feasible only because new technology allows the
designing firms to rapidly transmit chip designs to the foundries, because
152 | Economic Report of the President

cost-effective cargo services are available to transport finished products to
markets worldwide, and because intellectual property laws are in place
to safeguard the rights of designers in the producing countries.
Older, more established industries can also benefit from the use of a
global supply chain. In the apparel industry, for example, it is typical for
high-value-added activities such as design and marketing to be performed in
the United States, with assembly carried out in locations with lower production costs. The exceptions occur mainly in niches where capital-intensive
techniques can be applied, such as the production of socks, or in specialty
items for which labor costs are relatively less important. This division generally results in lower prices for consumers. This is not to deny, however, that
there are costs to these developments, notably in the dislocation of some U.S.
workers as production has shifted overseas. The effects of this dislocation and
the Administration’s response are discussed at length later in this chapter.
Evidence of the increased globalization of inputs to production can be seen
in statistics on the activities of American multinationals. The foreign share of
inputs in production by U.S.-based parent companies more than doubled
from 1977 to 1997, although domestic content continues to account for
more than 90 percent of their total inputs (Table 4-1).

Better Technology, More Trade
Just as globalization spurs innovation, so, too, do improvements in technology contribute to increased globalization. Improved communications and
technology, in effect, make the world smaller. They bring a wider variety of the
world’s goods, services, and information to consumers everywhere, and they
lower the costs of cross-border transactions in goods, services, and financial
Chapter 4

| 153

flows. These lower transactions costs should lead to increased trade and investment, which in turn lead to higher incomes. Examples of how technology
lowers transactions costs abound. Firms can use sophisticated information technology to implement cost-reducing just-in-time inventory practices while
managing a vast flow of components from a global web of suppliers. The cost of
air freight is a fraction of what it was just 20 years ago, thanks not only to better
technology but also to deregulation of global air services and the expanded use
of open skies agreements. These agreements permit unrestricted service by the
airlines of each country to, from, and beyond the other’s territory. The United
States has entered into numerous such agreements, most recently in November
2000 with Brunei, Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore.
Novel though some of these cost-saving technologies are, they are in
one sense nothing new, but simply the continuation of a centuries-long
procession of human innovation. Declining transport costs, for example
through more efficient ship design and improved navigation techniques, have
been linked to the expansion of trade in Europe at least since
the Middle Ages. More recently, the introduction of standardized shipping containers and systems for handling them has revolutionized the international
shipping industry, yielding enormous increases in productivity. Together with
improved communications, containerization has made integrated global production and distribution networks a reality. A comprehensive list of innovations
that have improved the speed and lowered the cost of telecommunications
would include the telegraph, the telephone, radio, television, fax machines, and
most recently the Internet.
Like the other advances in telecommunications that preceded it, only more
so, the Internet transcends the barrier of physical distance and helps overcome
geographic obstacles to economic integration. Its power to transmit vast quantities of information to and from individual users gives it great promise for
lowering transactions costs and facilitating trade. Its commercial reach extends
across borders; for example, one major on-line retailer reports that consumers
from more than 160 different countries have visited its website. And the Internet allows not just information about products but some products themselves,
such as software and entertainment, to be delivered electronically at minimal
cost. This type of globalization clearly benefits consumers and entrepreneurs by
expanding the variety of products available for consumption and use and providing easier access to low-cost suppliers, wherever they are located.
The effect that the Internet is having on international trade is difficult to estimate, in part because it is hard to accurately measure Internet usage
in some countries. One analysis of trade flows found no clear effect of the Internet in 1995 or 1996, but an increasing effect in later years. This result was found
after taking into account a number of other factors that influence a country’s
trade, including the size of its economy, its distance from other countries, and
154 | Economic Report of the President

common borders, languages, and colonial heritage. Moreover, poor countries
appear to gain more from expanded Internet access than rich countries. This
suggests that access to the Internet might lessen the burden of shortcomings in
traditional infrastructure that presently hinder trade for developing countries. In
other words, bridging the international “digital divide” between rich and poor
countries can have measurable economic benefits, not just in high-technology
areas but in all sectors.
The effect of the Internet on international trade might indeed be larger than
even these encouraging results suggest, because that analysis covered only trade
in goods—it did not include services, such as education, financial, medical, and
other professional services. Yet these are likely to reap especially large benefits
from the possibilities of electronic commerce. Improved communications
allows for commerce in these services that were previously difficult to deliver
without a physical presence.

Technology and Knowledge-Based Products
in U.S. Trade and Investment Flows
The growing importance of technology in the U.S. economy is evident not
just from anecdotal examples but in the broad patterns of the Nation’s international transactions as well. The clearest sign is the rapid growth of U.S. trade in
capital goods, a category that includes items such as computers, machinery, and
telecommunications equipment (Chart 4-1). Capital goods today make up
45 percent of the value of U.S. exports, by far the single largest component
(Table 4-2). They also constitute the largest share of the value of U.S. imports.
Since 1996, increased trade in capital goods has accounted for about 70 percent
of the growth in the value of U.S. exports and nearly 30 percent of that of
imports. Strong growth in both imports and exports partly reflects roundtrip
trade, as components such as semiconductors are exported from the United
States and then return inside computers. But it also reflects the role of trade in
supporting investment through equipment imports. Within the category of
capital goods, trade in information technology products has grown especially
rapidly (Chart 4-2). Computers, semiconductors, and telecommunications goods
now account for nearly half of the value of capital goods imports and exports.
There has also been strong growth in exports of services, reflecting the
growing value of ideas and of knowledge-based activities. Income from royalty
and licensing fees grew by 8.3 percent each year on average from 1992 to 1999,
compared with 6.5 percent a year for all services exports. Business, technical,
and professional services grew at an 11 percent clip over the same period, and
financial services income grew on average by 19.4 percent a year. Sales of these
services are examples of “weightless” trade, since the value is in the idea or

service itself rather than in a material good. Although some services, such as
haircuts, are not tradable (at least under current technology), there remains substantial scope for services trade to continue to grow. In 1999 services still
accounted for less than 30 percent of the value of U.S. exports and less than
156 | Economic Report of the President

16 percent of imports, even though service-producing industries (excluding the
government sector) accounted for 65 percent of U.S. GDP in 1998, the most
recent year for which data are available. Stronger growth in our trading partners
may actually favor U.S. services exports over goods exports, since there is evidence that higher income abroad stimulates foreign demand for services more
than it does foreign demand for goods.

New Challenges
The confluence of increased globalization and improvements in
communications and technology have raised U.S. economic performance
and contributed to our prosperity. But these developments bring with them
new challenges. The rest of this chapter focuses on six such challenges:
• raising U.S. saving and thus contributing to adjustment of the current
account deficit
• increasing growth in our major trading partners
• making sure that developing countries are not left behind
• adjusting to the changes at home brought about by globalization
• safeguarding the environment and labor standards, and
• addressing the challenges that technologies pose for international legal
institutions.
Chapter 4

| 157

These challenges and the policy responses of the Administration are
discussed below.

The U.S. Trade Balance and Current Account
The recent rapid growth in investment and the resulting strong performance
of the U.S. economy have contributed to an increase in the Nation’s trade
deficit. Robust income growth and increased wealth from rising asset prices
have contributed to higher domestic consumption, and thus to rapid growth
in imports. Growth was slower in major U.S. trading partners in Europe and
Asia than in the United States in 1998 and the first part of 1999 (Chart 4-3).
This contributed to weaker import demand in those regions and slower
growth of U.S. exports. A strong dollar, reflecting in part capital inflows from
foreigners eager to participate in attractive investment opportunities in the
United States, has also contributed to the growing trade deficit by lowering
prices of foreign-made goods relative to those of U.S. products. Through the
first three quarters of 2000, the trade balance in goods and services was about
$270 billion in deficit. That would correspond to roughly $360 billion for
the whole year, or about 3.6 percent of GDP (Chart 4-4). Meanwhile the
current account (a comprehensive measure that comprises not only the trade
balance in goods and services but also net income and transfers) recorded a
deficit of roughly 4.3 percent of GDP (Chart 4-5).

158 | Economic Report of the President

Chapter 4

| 159

The current account balance equals by definition the difference between
national saving and national investment. A current account deficit reflects
an excess of investment over domestic saving, and thus an inflow of foreign
capital that makes up for the shortfall. The widened current account deficit
reflects the fact that although net saving has risen, net domestic investment
has risen even more. The share of net domestic investment in GDP
(Chart 4-5) grew by 4.6 percentage points from 1992 through the first three
quarters of 2000 (from 4.8 percent to 9.4 percent), while the share of net
national saving rose by only 2.3 percentage points (from 3.5 percent to
5.8 percent).
What explains the willingness of the rest of the world to provide the United
States with the capital inflows needed to finance its current account deficit?
The answer is simply that the attractive opportunities for investment in the
United States today exceed those in other countries. This can be seen by
comparing the deficits of today with the comparably large (as a percentage of
GDP) deficits of the 1980s. In the earlier decade, most of the inflows went to
the purchase of U.S. government debt securities. The more recent inflows, in
contrast, have mainly been invested in privately issued assets. Indeed, much
of the inflow has come in the form of foreign direct investment (equity
investment for purposes of control of the enterprise) rather than purchases of
bonds or portfolio equity participation: the value of inward direct investment
into the United States rose from $51 billion in 1993 to $271 billion in 1999.
With saving from the rest of the world continuing to flow to the United
States, the U.S. net international investment position—the value of U.S.
assets abroad less the value of foreign assets in the United States—will
continue to turn more negative. At the end of 1999 the net international
investment position was approaching a negative $1.5 trillion, or almost 16
percent of GDP that year; foreigners held more than $8.6 trillion of U.S.
assets, while Americans held foreign assets valued at more than $7.1 trillion.
Part of the income from these international investment holdings consists of
retained earnings and reinvested dividends and interest payments, which are
recorded as an outflow in the current account and an offsetting inflow in the
capital account. This would tend to raise the apparent magnitude of capital
flows. On net, however, income on investment now flows out of the United
States, as foreigners repatriate earnings on their U.S. investments by a greater
amount than Americans are bringing their earnings on foreign investments
back to the United States.
The availability of foreign saving has permitted the United States to maintain
the high rate of investment that has expanded productive capacity and raised
economic performance. This shows that foreign capital inflows are not in
themselves a bad thing: it is better to finance attractive investment opportunities using foreign capital than not to undertake them at all. But our income
would be even higher if that investment were financed instead by domestic
160 | Economic Report of the President

saving. Saving trends in the United States over the last several years present a
mixed picture. From 1992 through the third quarter of 2000, the share of net
saving by the public sector (Federal, State, and local governments) in GDP has
risen by 7.8 percentage points. But this rise has been largely offset by a decline
in the share of net private saving of 5.5 percentage points. Higher private
saving would help to ensure the continued ability of the United States to
finance domestic investment. The saving rate can be raised without threatening
continued strong growth in income if the composition of demand for U.S.
goods shifts, with external demand replacing some domestic consumption. In
the meantime, it is important to maintain public saving, through continued
fiscal discipline at all levels of government, in order to support national saving.
It is difficult to say what level of the current account balance would be most
appropriate. But if some adjustment in the current account is deemed necessary,
the way it is accomplished matters. It would be better to reduce the current
account deficit through higher domestic saving than through lower investment,
because reducing investment would mean a smaller capital stock and thus lower
national income than would otherwise be the case. In the best of all possible
world economies, increased growth in the rest of the world would lead to
increased U.S. exports, which would compensate for the reduced domestic
demand that higher domestic saving would entail, and thus maintain strong
income growth in the United States. More rapid growth abroad would cause
saving by foreigners to shift from the accumulation of U.S. assets to investment
in their own domestic economies, made newly attractive by their increased
domestic growth. The rebound in investment abroad would further spur U.S.
exports, which, as we have seen, consist largely of capital goods.
Opening foreign markets can play a role in adjustment by encouraging
U.S. exports. In contrast, efforts to narrow the trade deficit or the current
account by raising barriers to imports into the United States would likely
make the economy less efficient and thus lower national income, without
necessarily increasing national saving.

Raising Performance in Other Countries
At present, the U.S. current account deficit is supporting too large a share
of the global economic expansion. It would be desirable for other countries
to take steps to accelerate their growth and promote a smooth return to a
more balanced global distribution of growth. As this adjustment occurs, the
U.S. current account deficit should return to levels in line with the historical
U.S. saving and investment relationship. To ensure sustained, balanced
global growth, the major industrial economies need to maintain supportive
fiscal and monetary policies and push ahead with structural reforms to
remove barriers to investment opportunities (including opportunities for
new technologies).
Chapter 4

| 161

The same innovations that have raised economic performance in the
United States would likewise be expected to raise foreign productivity and
growth as those innovations are adopted abroad. The global diffusion of
innovative technology is thus one avenue through which to increase growth
in other countries. Technological development is not a race, where the first to
make a discovery is the only winner. The spread of our own technological
discoveries to other countries leads to higher productivity and economic
growth in those countries, raising their incomes and thus creating new
opportunities for innovative and competitive U.S. firms to export. And
when productivity rises in other countries, the prices of the goods they
produce fall, and to the extent that these goods are exported to the United
States, Americans benefit from lower prices and greater choice.
Throughout the 1990s, the beneficial effects of technology on productivity
and growth appear to have been enjoyed most strongly in the United States.
Although growth has rebounded in Europe and the emerging market
economies of East Asia, these events so far appear to be cyclical rather than
structural in nature. That is, recovery in these countries seems to be bringing
them back up to their economic potential, but not yet accelerating the
expansion of that potential. The situation in the United States has been
otherwise. From 1995 to 2000, according to OECD estimates, potential
output in the United States grew at an annual rate of 3.5 percent, compared
with only 2.2 percent for the countries that have adopted the euro, and only
1.4 percent for Japan (Chart 4-6). Growth in total factor productivity—the

162 | Economic Report of the President

efficiency with which capital and labor are used in combination—also lags
in most European and other industrial countries, with little sign of the
acceleration the United States has experienced over the past several years
(Chart 4-7).
The lagging pace of investment in information technology in much of
Europe compared with the United States may be one reason for the divergence in trend growth. This lag is evident even after taking into account
differences in the measurement of purchases of high-technology products
(Box 4-2). The United States also leads other industrial countries on several
measures of the usage of information technology, including numbers of
telephone lines, Internet hosts, and secure servers used in e-commerce
(Chart 4-8). Yet the United States is not ahead in every aspect of information
technology: wireless technology has taken off in Europe far more than in the
United States.
There are some signs that the use of the new technologies whose
pervasiveness has so benefited the United States is beginning to approach
critical mass in other advanced economies, including Germany, the
Netherlands, the Nordic countries, and the United Kingdom. For example,
Germany now boasts a technology-oriented stock market similar to the
Nasdaq, the Neuer Markt, and is reported to have the largest European contingent of Internet enterprises, larger even than in the United Kingdom.
Firms in Scandinavia are innovators in important areas of technology,
notably wireless communication. Perhaps not coincidentally, the Nordic

Box 4-2. Information Technology and Cross-Country Differences
in Measuring Economic Growth
The rapid rate of technological improvement in information
technology products makes it difficult to distinguish between changes
in prices and changes in quantities produced. Statisticians face the
problem that traditional price indexes fail to adequately account for
quality changes in the face of rapid technological change: a computer
that cost $2,500 in 2000 provides several times the computing power
of a $2,500 computer only a few years earlier. To account for rapid
quality upgrading in computing equipment, the United States has
adopted a hedonic price deflator for computers and hardware, which
measures computing power as a combination of characteristics such
as processor clock speed, memory capacity, and hard disk size. Using
this methodology, computer prices in the United States are estimated
to have fallen at an average rate of 17 percent per year since 1990,
and 24 percent per year since 1997. Growth in the volume of computer sales contributed nearly 1 percentage point to real GDP growth
in 1999, even though the value of computer spending in current
dollars accounted for less than 0.1 percentage point of nominal
GDP growth.
The use of this hedonic index makes international comparisons
of information technology spending difficult, since most other
countries do not use hedonic price indexes (exceptions include
Canada, France, and Japan). Using traditional measures that do not
fully adjust for quality improvements understates real computer
expenditure and thus overall real investment. This in turn lowers the
statistical measure of output and affects productivity calculations.
Compared with the United States, a country using a traditional price
deflator appears to produce less high-technology output for any
given amount of inputs such as workers and nontechnology capital.
Applying the U.S. deflator to German information technology investment, for example, results in a substantially larger measure of real
investment—as much as 170 percent larger—than with the traditional
deflator. Over the period since 1991, use of a hedonic price index
would have implied that real investment in information technology
equipment in Germany increased at a rate of 27.5 percent per year,
versus 6 percent using the traditional approach.
However, even after correcting for the different statistical methodologies, investment and GDP growth in the United States remain far
stronger than in Europe. A study that applied the U.S. deflator for
information technology investment to France found that the contribution of this investment to growth was similar for the two countries
continued on next page...

164 | Economic Report of the President

Box 4-2.—continued
from 1973 to 1990, but that investment then grew by twice as much in
the United States from 1995 to 1998. An alternative approach found
that the contribution of information technology investment to growth
in France was smaller than in the United States before 1990 as well as
in more recent years. Another study took the difference between the
price index for U.S. information technology investment and the price
index of all other investment goods and applied this to non–
information technology price indexes in other G-7 countries to derive
a new price index. The contribution of information technology equipment to GDP growth from 1990 to 1996 was found to be still nearly
twice as large in the United States as in most other G-7 countries.
Only the United Kingdom and Canada experienced contributions to
growth of even two-thirds that of the United States.
The difficulty of accurately measuring the rapid technological
change occurring in information technology makes international
growth comparisons difficult, but it does not qualitatively affect a
comparison of growth in the United States with that in many other
industrial countries. The success story of the U.S. economy is more
than a statistical artifact.

countries (excluding Denmark) benefited more from higher total factor
productivity growth in the latter half of the 1990s than did other European
countries. Meanwhile other developed countries that have lagged in productivity growth are attempting to catch up. Japan, for example, has recently
taken steps to deregulate its telecommunications industry and provide
incentives for firms to upgrade their information technology equipment and
employee skills. Burgeoning information technology sectors have also
begun to appear in some developing countries. One notable example is the
development of an Indian software programming industry. However,
additional policy steps are needed to ensure that these countries fully enjoy
the benefits of the new technologies.

The Importance of Institutions and Policy
In addition to removing barriers to international trade, improved
economic performance requires a combination of institutions that facilitate
the allocation of human and financial resources to activities with the highest
rates of return. These include flexible labor markets, efficient capital markets,
and government regulatory structures that encourage competition.

Labor Market Flexibility
Flexibility of labor markets has been an important aspect of economic
success in the United States. This flexibility encompasses both the ability
of workers with desirable skills to switch to more rewarding jobs, and the
ability of firms to adapt their work force to changing economic prospects. It
also entails a work force that can adapt to new technologies and production
techniques, businesses that effectively manage human resources, and
pro-competitive government policies, such as supportive tax regimes that
encourage investments in new skills and technologies. Among OECD
member countries from 1980 to 1997, those with relatively low tax rates on
labor income, and low costs to firms of restructuring their work force,
generally had lower rates of unemployment and higher rates of job creation
than other countries.
Labor market flexibility is particularly important in high-technology
industries, where the pace of innovation and industry evolution is especially
rapid. The important role of research and development in these industries
means that sophisticated human capital—strong education, specialized skills,
and the ability to innovate—becomes an essential input. Expanding
firms must be able to attract skilled workers, who are the main users and producers of technology; indeed, the movement of labor between technology
firms has been found to be an important channel for knowledge transfer.
This includes movement of skilled workers across borders. Immigrants,

166 | Economic Report of the President

especially from India and Taiwan, have made important contributions
to high-technology firms in the United States. Here too, U.S. policy has
supported labor market flexibility, by allowing firms to bring in highly
skilled foreign workers through the recently expanded H-1B visa program,
while providing assistance for training of U.S. workers.

Capital Market Efficiency
The efficiency of capital markets in the United States has also contributed
to the superior economic performance we have seen. The more widespread
availability in this country of equity finance, including venture capital, facilitates business creation and propels the development of new technologies.
In contrast, in Japan and some European countries, banks and other large
financial institutions provide most business financing, hold some firm
equity, and usually exert a measure of corporate control. These differences
between the two systems give rise to different incentive structures. Returns to
bank loans are limited by the interest rate; returns to equity investments
are determined by profits and capital gains. This makes bank lending better
suited to financing low-risk activities, whereas an equity-based system has the
potential to generate greater capital investment in activities where expected
returns are high but uncertain.
When most job creation and investment are undertaken by large and
established firms, these differences in the mode of financing are not likely to
be important, since such companies finance most investment out of their
own retained earnings. However, it is likely that the performance of the two
systems will diverge in high-technology sectors, for at least two reasons. In
the telecommunications sector, the large outlays required to finance the
emerging new technologies could well exceed the financing available from
retained earnings and from banks. In other areas of information technology,
banks have not been especially successful in supporting the new firms that
play an important role in generating innovation. These considerations put
the bank-centered systems of Europe and Japan at a relative disadvantage.
In contrast, economies that have liquid, efficient capital markets tend to
invest more heavily in research and development activity, and particularly in
high-technology startups. Venture capital has flourished in the equity-based
U.S. system as an important financing mode for risky new enterprises, since
the returns on venture capital can best be realized when firms can readily
issue new equity to the public. Of course, it is not impossible for information
technology startups to be financed within the framework of bank-oriented
systems, but such systems have had difficulty matching the success of the
equity finance model. In Europe and Japan, for example, venture capital is
supplied primarily through the financing arms of banks and other financial
corporations. Venture capital in these countries has thus far tended to focus
Chapter 4

| 167

on the later stages of firm development, or to finance leveraged buyouts of
existing firms rather than fund the creation of new ones. The distinctions
between the two systems may be eroding in continental Europe. For
example, the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP has been trending
upward in many of these countries since the mid-1990s, although in most of
them it remains well below the U.S. level.
The form of firm ownership and control also influences the creation and
diffusion of information technology. In the “outsider” model of corporate
governance common in the United States and the United Kingdom, management is given incentives to focus on stockholder returns, and minority
shareholders enjoy substantial protections. In contrast, the “insider” model
common in Japan and continental Europe gives more power to other stakeholders, including large ownership groups such as banks as well as employees and
management itself. The insider model may allow stakeholders to more
effectively monitor management efforts in a way that avoids a focus on shortterm financial results. But there is evidence that in recent years the outsider
model has fostered superior performance, including a more rapid pace of
research and development, investment, and technological diffusion.

The Role of the Regulatory Framework
The need for flexibility applies to the institutions of government as well.
Regulatory frameworks must be transparent and avoid raising hurdles to the
creation of new businesses. Startup firms are a vehicle for the introduction of
new products and techniques, since they face a lower opportunity cost of
switching to newer, better technologies. Moreover, the presence (or the
threat) of new entrants limits the possibility of monopolistic behavior
by incumbents. A challenge in this regard is how to distinguish regulation
that is necessary to prevent anticompetitive behavior, and thus promote
innovation, from regulation that hinders innovation. This can be a difficult
task when large, potentially monopolistic firms are also among the most
innovative.
Ensuring that domestic markets are open to competition has been found
to be particularly important in the telecommunications industry. Here as
elsewhere, competition leads to lower prices; in telecommunications it also
spurs increased investment and network size. But it is in the nature of
networks to tend toward monopoly, in part because of the scale economies
discussed above. Hence regulatory authorities must be vigilant.
Privatization of state-owned telecommunications firms has also been
found to lead to lower costs and increased usage. But for this to occur, privatization must be complemented by effective regulatory oversight so that a
dominant firm does not impede competition by new entrants, through such
means as excessive charges for connecting competitors’ calls over the “last
168 | Economic Report of the President

mile” of telephone line to homes or businesses. An inexpensive, high-quality
telecommunications network is not only a basic element of the business
infrastructure of any modern economy but also an important determinant of
the adoption of information technology, in particular the Internet.

Raising Incomes in Developing Countries
The global imperative to combat poverty and support economic development
in the poorest countries gains added urgency today, when the AIDS epidemic, international and civil conflict, and other catastrophes threaten to
reverse years of gains in many countries. The divergence in national incomes
between the developed and the developing world continues not because so
many countries are effectively integrating themselves into the global
economy, but because so many are not. Bridging this gap remains a challenge
for economic development. Meanwhile the emergence of new technologies
threatens to create an international “digital divide” parallel to, and to some
degree predicated on, that in economic development.
Economic integration holds out enormous potential for improving the
lives of the world’s people through increased access to goods, services, and
ideas. Economies that are relatively open to international trade and
investment appear to grow faster than closed economies, although it is
difficult to separate out the causal linkages between openness and growth.
The growth-enhancing effects of economic integration are especially vital for
the poorest of developing countries, because a central lesson of history has
been that rapid and sustained economic growth is essential to rapid and
long-lasting reductions in poverty. But for this to happen, globalization must
proceed in a stable global economy, so that it can be harnessed to advance a
prosperity that is shared by all.

Ensuring a Stable Global Economy
Growth in global flows of private capital has accompanied and in many
cases supported growth in trade. Access to global capital helps countries
finance their expanding trade. It is also a vehicle for the development and
transfer of new technology and a creator of new economic opportunities. But
wherever there is finance, there is the inherent risk of financial crisis. In
tandem with the global expansion of capital flows, therefore, policies and
institutions must be developed that minimize this risk while maximizing the
potential of capital flows to support rapid growth. A well-functioning system
that ensures a strong and stable flow of capital to emerging economies is a
crucial part of building a successful, truly global, economy.
The recent financial crises in Asia and elsewhere have underlined the
economic and humanitarian imperatives of a stronger international financial
architecture. The memory is still fresh of how millions of people around the
Chapter 4

| 169

world, many of them poor people going about the business of improving
their lives, instead saw their lives turned upside down when their countries’
financial systems were thrown into crisis. The international community
must work diligently to provide the greatest possible assurance that such
crises will be less frequent—and less costly—in the future.
Making crises less frequent and less costly means having a clear understanding of what has caused them in the past. There is now widespread
agreement that the financial crises of the late 1990s were caused by two
elements coming together. The first was weakness in many countries’ economic
fundamentals, including weak banking systems, questionable investments,
domestic credit bubbles (supported by large amounts of short-term external
debt), unsustainable exchange rates, and in some cases, deteriorating fiscal
positions. These weaknesses were thrown into relief when international
investors began to reassess these countries’ capacity to safely absorb large
amounts of foreign capital. The second element was an element of panic,
as the focus of domestic and foreign investors shifted from being the first to
discover the latest new opportunities in these countries, to how to avoid
being the last out the door.
This understanding of the causes of the crisis is increasingly informing the
redesign of the international financial architecture. This shows itself in three
fundamental ways:
• More effective means of preventing crises. The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has strengthened its surveillance of the global economy, with a
focus on preventing the adoption of policies that create vulnerabilities and
thus augment the risk of financial panic. Reform is proceeding on several
fronts: toward a revolution in the transparency of national macroeconomic frameworks that will make surprises less likely; toward the
development of a wide-ranging framework of international codes and
standards, to provide benchmarks for national policies in areas such
as bank supervision and securities market regulation; and toward more
systematic incorporation of indicators of liquidity and balance sheet risks
in IMF surveillance reports.
• Safer policies in the emerging market economies. Here there are already
signs of progress as a result of greater global understanding and wariness
of economic risks. For example, the ratio of short-term external debt
to foreign reserves has nearly halved since 1996 in those countries that
experienced liquidity crises in the late 1990s. In the same countries,
short-term debt fell from 34 percent of total external debt in 1996 to 21
percent in 1999. Some 14 countries have moved away from unstable
pegged exchange rate systems. But constant vigilance is needed to make
sure that problems do not reemerge.
170 | Economic Report of the President

• An IMF that is better equipped for modern crisis response. With the creation
of the Supplemental Reserve Facility and the Contingent Credit Line, and
more recently with the November 2000 decision of the IMF’s executive
board on the reform of IMF facilities, the IMF now has tools that are a
match for the kinds of crises that today threaten the global economy. The
design of these facilities seeks to avoid, as far as possible, distorting the
incentives both of private investors and of governments. IMF policy is
increasingly oriented toward providing short-term, emergency finance,
priced to discourage its casual use and to encourage rapid repayment.
These changes have been accompanied by efforts to increase the flow of
information to financial markets and to improve communication between
borrowing countries and their creditors. They also build on the experience
gained in recent cases of debt restructuring, putting in practical terms the
broad guidelines on private sector involvement in crisis resolution
outlined by the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrial countries in
July 2000.
A stable international economy is not enough to ensure rapid and
sustained growth. Governments need to put in place institutions and rules
that allow markets to function well. Governments also need to promote the
effective rule of law, through good governance, transparent decisionmaking,
and support for the emergence of a healthy civil society.

Overcoming the Global Digital Divide
In the same way that a lack of access to international trade and capital
markets hinders growth in the least developed countries, an issue now arises
with the new networks of information. The rapid pace of technological
advance threatens to create an international digital divide that leaves some
developing countries lagging ever further behind the more advanced
economies. This is a particular concern for less developed countries in SubSaharan Africa; it is less of a concern for many emerging market economies
in East Asia and Latin America, which are already experiencing rapidly
expanding use of technology and increased access to the Internet.
Some argue that acquiring advanced technology should be a relatively low
priority for countries still struggling to meet basic needs, such as clean water
and adequate health care, and to lower their poverty rates. Recent studies
suggest, however, that information technology (including telecommunications) not only can address some of these basic needs, but may also generate
higher social returns than more traditional infrastructure investment. The
effects of information technology on growth and development are difficult to
assess, but some studies have found a positive correlation between the stock
of telecommunications capital and economic growth. Evidence on the
Chapter 4

| 171

success of individual projects suggests that this association reflects more than
just rising demand for technology as a country’s income rises. Information
technology holds great potential to raise incomes and improve the quality of
education, health care, and public services. It makes it easier for individuals
to both obtain and disseminate the information they need to empower
themselves, and it promotes a more active civil society. Of course, information technology is not a panacea for the problems of development; each
country’s circumstances will ultimately govern its decision whether to invest
in technology or in other projects.
Seizing the opportunities that technology offers to developing countries
requires the right policies. Despite the potential for high returns, gaps in policies and institutions can lead to significant underinvestment in information
technology in these countries. Obstacles to the diffusion of information
technology and its applications, such as e-commerce, are in large measure the
same as the impediments to economic development more broadly. These
include a lack of well-developed credit markets to channel domestic saving
to productive investments, deficiencies in basic infrastructure, and shortcomings in education. Moreover, institutions in many developing countries
lack the capabilities to enforce property rights and provide an effective set of
commercial laws. The result is that individuals and firms hesitate to invest
in costly equipment and software even when the potential rates of return
are high.
Developing countries also face a number of underlying problems that
hinder the increased use of new technology. These include:
• High costs to users. At current prices, information technology may be prohibitively expensive for most potential users in developing countries. And
in many countries the presence of a monopoly telecommunications
provider keeps prices high and network size and usage low. However, creative financing structures and business plans can overcome this obstacle, as
exemplified by thriving Internet cafés in several developing countries.
Another example comes from Bangladesh, where individuals (often
women) use microcredit financing to purchase a single cell phone, which
they then profitably rent out to others in the community.
• Human capacity. A country’s successful assimilation of information
technology requires a generally educated populace. Developing countries
cannot make full use of information technology without the right training
and skills.
• Applications. Applications of information technology that have been
successfully marketed in developed countries may not be well suited to
conditions in developing countries. Local communities and nongovernmental organizations have demonstrated remarkable ingenuity in adapting
172 | Economic Report of the President

information technology to local uses such as micro e-commerce, distance
education, and the dissemination of public health information. However,
software companies must still be encouraged to develop applications that
do not require high bandwidth or high levels of literacy or English proficiency.
Not all the elements are yet in place for market forces to close the
international digital divide. Developing countries need help in narrowing the
parallel gaps in policy, infrastructure, and training before they can successfully harness information technology for economic development. In 1999
the United States launched the Internet for Economic Development
Initiative to provide targeted assistance in these areas to a number of developing
countries. The United States has also been active in providing direct support
for high-technology infrastructure in developing countries. The Leland
Initiative has provided African countries with financial and technical
assistance aimed at helping them benefit from increased Internet
connectivity. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation has established a
$200 million credit line for U.S. companies seeking support for projects that
will help developing countries close the digital divide. The United States has
also provided assistance with policy development; for example, the Federal
Communications Commission has helped developing countries devise
appropriate regulatory regimes. The Okinawa Charter promulgated by
the G-8 countries (the G-7 plus Russia) in July 2000 provides a framework
within which work can proceed on policy development, human capacity
building, and brokering of private-public partnerships to diffuse information. It also established the Digital Opportunity Task Force, or DOTforce, to
coordinate policy formation to implement these general principles and help
catalyze resource allocation to remedy shortcomings that the private sector
alone cannot.
Investment in information technology can contribute greatly to economic
development. Market forces will ultimately provide the dynamism to drive
information technology investment, but policymakers need to establish the
conditions in which these forces can flourish.

Adjusting to Change at Home
Globalization and the effects of technology pose challenges at home
as well. Even though the increased openness of the United States to the international economy provides substantial benefits for the Nation as a whole,
not everyone gains. The rewards of improved technology and increased
globalization are not spread equally: for some, change inevitably means
dislocation. Therefore an important complement to the Administration’s
international economic policy has been assistance to those here at home
adversely affected by changes in technology or increased globalization.
Chapter 4

| 173

A number of Federal programs help individuals obtain the tools they need
to succeed in the New Economy. The Dislocated Worker Program provides
services to workers who have lost their jobs and are unlikely to return to their
previous industry or occupation, as well as to formerly self-employed persons
and displaced homemakers no longer supported by the income of another
family member. The available benefits include assistance with job search and
placement, individual counseling and career planning, and training assistance.
Some workers also receive financial support toward transportation and child
care expenses. It is estimated that around 836,000 people participated in the
program in fiscal 2000. Workers affected by international competition
receive support from programs such as Trade Adjustment Assistance and
NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance. Benefits include training, job
search aid, and relocation allowances. An estimated 175,000 workers were
eligible for assistance in fiscal 1999; of these, nearly 40 percent were cited as
having been affected by trade with our NAFTA partners.
In addition to giving financial support to individuals, government can
serve as a catalyst in helping whole communities adjust to dislocation.
The Administration has proposed the Community Economic Adjustment
Initiative, now being implemented in a pilot program in Connecticut.
This initiative would bring together resources from across the Federal
Government to provide coordinated assistance and information on new
employment opportunities, along the lines of the successful approach taken
in response to military base closures. Assistance would be provided to
communities in two stages: first to assess their resources and needs, and then
to develop an economic response. Government agencies would also help
connect displaced workers with enterprises seeking to bolster their work
force or looking for locations in which to expand. As a further step, a
Commission on Workers, Communities, and Economic Change in the
New Economy, established by the President, will examine the effectiveness
of Federal programs that help with adjustment and identify the best practices
of employers, communities, and public-private partnerships that have
responded successfully to economic dislocations.
Dislocation is an unavoidable side effect of economic growth and
technological change. Economic progress—whether it results from changes
brought about by globalization, technology, institutions, or regulation—
affects workers in various ways, not always for the better. Wages change in
industries impacted by new competition, jobs shift from industry to industry
and from location to location, and the range of jobs available within a firm
or factory changes as well. All these factors interact: competitive pressure,
domestic or foreign, might lead a firm to adopt new technology, which in
turn might eliminate the need for some workers while creating jobs for others
to develop and manage the technology. Such changes in the skill mix have
been the predominant factor in past changes in employment: around
174 | Economic Report of the President

70 percent of changes in employment in U.S. manufacturing as a whole in
the 1980s resulted from a shift from relatively low-skilled workers to highskilled workers within the same industry. That is, jobs did not, as a rule,
move from industries that faced foreign competition to those that did not;
instead the types of jobs available changed as firms shifted their labor force
toward more highly skilled workers. This evidence suggests that worker
displacement is largely the result of changes in technology rather than the
result of import competition, since the latter would have been expected to lead
to employment declines in certain affected industries rather than changes in
the composition of employment.
A similar phenomenon can be observed in the behavior of multinational
firms. Increased production by foreign affiliates of U.S. multinational enterprises in the 1980s and early 1990s has been found to lead to increased
domestic employment—in other words, parent and foreign employment
rose together, not one at the expense of the other. But here, too, the composition of jobs changed, with domestic employment shifting to jobs requiring
higher skill, such as design and management, while production jobs often
moved overseas. A number of studies of U.S. multinationals in the 1980s
and early 1990s similarly found that the shift of production activities to
developing countries had little overall effect on wages in the parent company.
To be sure, these findings mean only that import competition and outsourcing did not have large overall effects on employment or wages. Behind
the aggregate numbers are individual people whose lives have been disrupted
by the shift toward more highly skilled workers and high-technology jobs.
The differing impact of globalization on different groups of workers is
reflected in public opinion surveys, which suggest that how one perceives the
effects of increased trade depends on one’s level of skill. Less skilled workers
are more likely to favor trade protection than are workers with relatively high
skills. This is understandable: globalization contributes, as we have seen, to
technological change, and technological change favors workers with higher
levels of skills and education. This makes globalization especially threatening
to less skilled, less educated workers. Anxiety about dislocation and job loss
will thus likely remain so long as the pace of technological change remains
rapid. This evidence further emphasizes the need for policies to ensure that
individuals adversely affected by globalization and technological change
are not left behind but instead receive help to take advantage of new
opportunities created in the dynamic U.S. economy.

Trade and the Environment and Labor Standards
This Administration has made a commitment that at the same time that
trade fosters openness and prosperity, it must also protect global natural
resources and be consonant with our national values. This means making
Chapter 4

| 175

sure that trade liberalization takes account of the environmental effects of
economic activity and complements policies that seek cleaner air, cleaner
water, and protection of our natural heritage, while still promoting growth. It
also includes making sure that trade liberalization does not hinder countries’
adherence to labor standards. Indeed, growth in trade and the economy
should be accompanied by respect for recognized core labor standards and
the elimination of practices such as exploitative child labor.
In support of the Nation’s environmental goals, the President in November
1999 issued an executive order mandating environmental review of certain
trade agreements, including multilateral and bilateral free-trade agreements
and major agreements in natural resource sectors. The recently signed freetrade agreement between the United States and Jordan includes provisions
addressing trade and the environment and, for the first time ever in the text
of a trade agreement, provisions on labor standards. (Such standards were
addressed in side letters to NAFTA but not in the agreement itself.)
Increased globalization need not conflict with improved environmental
standards and social protections. To the contrary, international trade can
contribute to a cleaner environment, by giving all countries access to technologies and production methods that help prevent pollution and conserve
natural resources. Examples include technologies that promote energy
efficiency and reduce polluting emissions from automobiles and factories.
Liberalized international investment policies can also contribute: multinational corporations that invest in new plants in developing countries can
bring with them global best practices in environmental and labor standards.

Challenges for Legal Frameworks
Technological change and globalization present a number of new challenges
for international legal frameworks.

Law Enforcement
Globalization and the possibilities created by new technology raise new
challenges for the legal system in combating cross-border criminal activities.
These activities include the unleashing of destructive computer viruses,
violations of computer security, and the use of the Internet for the sale of
illegal products, for tax evasion, and to disguise the origin of illegally generated funds. An important issue here is that of determining jurisdiction.
Using the Internet, a single person with modest resources, operating
from anywhere, can undertake criminal activity that has consequences for
the entire world. A recent example is the proliferation of the “I Love You”
computer virus, which allegedly originated in the Philippines but caused
worldwide problems with e-mail systems.

176 | Economic Report of the President

To begin to address these issues, the National Plan for Information
Systems Protection established the first national strategy for protecting
computer networks from deliberate attack, and the Partnership for Critical
Infrastructure Security was set up to maximize cooperation between
government and private sector initiatives in the area of cybersecurity. The
G-8 countries have also agreed to work together to combat the use of the
Internet for international criminal activity.
The same improvements in technology and communications that have
made global capital flows more liquid also pose new challenges for law
enforcement. A computer network that can efficiently transfer massive
amounts of capital to productive uses can with equal ease transfer funds
obtained illicitly without being detected. The challenges include both tax
evasion and the illegal practice of money laundering, in which individuals
seek to disguise the origin of funds generated through criminal activity. To
combat these activities within an international framework, the United States
has participated in the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering
(FATF), a multilateral group that develops recommendations covering
criminal justice systems, law enforcement, financial market regulation, and
international cooperation. The FATF took a major step forward in June
2000, when it identified 15 jurisdictions as noncooperative in the fight
against money laundering. That action prodded several of the listed jurisdictions to take steps to combat the practice. Meanwhile the finance ministers
of the G-7 countries announced the coordinated issuance of advisories to
their domestic financial institutions, urging them to give enhanced scrutiny
to transactions involving the identified jurisdictions.

Taxation
The growing globalization of financial transactions also raises issues for
taxation, because technological advances in this area can facilitate tax evasion
as well as tax avoidance. Tax evasion is any effort to escape the payment of
taxes actually due, and is illegal. The OECD has taken steps to combat tax
evasion in cross-border transactions, notably by promoting the exchange
of information among national tax authorities. This includes evaluating barriers to the effective exchange of information as well as examining ways in
which information technology can be used to combat the problem. Tax
inspectors from the OECD countries regularly meet to share information
about the detection of evasion and avoidance schemes in financial transactions.
Tax avoidance, in contrast, is the arrangement of one’s affairs so as not to
incur taxes on one’s economic activity in any national jurisdiction. Unlike tax
evasion, tax avoidance is not illegal per se—indeed, a major reason why it
exists is that some countries actively encourage it, by setting up preferential
tax regimes to attract multinational corporations. However, tax avoidance
Chapter 4

| 177

can distort the global allocation of capital and lead to an unequal distribution among countries of the burden of raising tax revenue. The United States
has participated in OECD initiatives to identify and limit policies that give
rise to harmful tax avoidance and erode countries’ tax bases. Such policies
include the lack of effective exchange of tax information with other countries, lack of transparency within national tax systems, and discrimination in
favor of foreign investors. OECD members have committed not to introduce new measures that strengthen such features of their tax systems, and to
remove the identified harmful features by April 2003. The initiative has also
identified 35 jurisdictions as tax havens—locations in which the tax regime
facilitates harmful tax avoidance. Six jurisdictions examined as tax havens but
not included on this list have already agreed to eliminate harmful features of
their tax regimes by the end of 2005. The 35 listed jurisdictions have been
given the opportunity to consider such cooperation in advance of a July
2001 publication of a list of uncooperative tax havens, and the adoption by
OECD members of policies aimed at directly addressing the concerns
thus raised.
Tax practices will also have to evolve to address the new possibilities
of a globalized economy. For example, a software product might be conceptualized in the United States, programmed in India, manufactured in
Singapore, and then sold all over the world. In such situations it may be
difficult to allocate the resulting income in an accounting sense for
purposes of assigning tax liability. This issue arises as well with electronic
commerce. The global nature of the Internet confounds present definitions
of geographic origin and even of what constitutes a transaction. This complicates both the identification of the jurisdiction to which taxes are due and
the collection of those taxes. Because the structure of the Internet makes
it difficult to trace the identity or even the location of those involved in a
taxable activity, national authorities are understandably concerned about the
erosion of revenue as activities shift away from “bricks and mortar” firms to
amorphous entities operating in cyberspace. Indeed, countries have already
encountered difficulties in assigning and collecting taxes on goods ordered
through the Internet but delivered in physical form.
Future trade agreements will have to address the status of cross-border
trade in electronically delivered products, many of which combine features of
both goods and services. To foster growth in electronic commerce, the
Administration led the 1998 initiative in the WTO in which members
agreed to place a temporary moratorium on duties on electronic transmissions. But electronic commerce is transforming what was formerly trade in
goods, such as software diskettes or music on compact disks, into the bits
and bytes of purely electronic transmissions. Under the 1998 moratorium
these transactions escape international duties, even though otherwise identical products delivered in physical form face the customary tariff regime.
178 | Economic Report of the President

The leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation countries, in their
November 2000 Brunei declaration, called for a WTO task force to address
the treatment of these items in international commerce.

Intellectual Property
Protection of the intellectual property generated by innovation is crucial
to preserving the incentives for the creators of knowledge to continue to
innovate. In an international context, differences in legal frameworks and
social attitudes toward property rights for these intangible goods can make
such protection difficult to establish or enforce. The Administration has been
instrumental in pushing for international standards of intellectual property
protection, notably through the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights Agreement included in the Uruguay Round agreement.
That agreement has led most U.S. trading partners to adopt modern laws to
protect intellectual property and improve enforcement. In addition, the
Administration has continued the rigorous review of our trading partners’
intellectual property protection. This includes use of the Special 301
provision of U.S. trade law, under which the United States identifies countries that do not provide adequate and effective protection of intellectual
property or that deny equitable market access to U.S. holders of intellectual
property. Enforcement has been a priority. Since 1996 the United States has
filed 14 intellectual property–related complaints with the WTO against
countries with lax intellectual property laws. These actions have paid off
in increased U.S. exports to countries that are technology imitators. The
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has also provided assistance to numerous
foreign countries seeking to improve their intellectual property systems.
The Administration has also taken steps to assist developing countries in
addressing certain critical health issues peculiar to those countries, while
encouraging the implementation of international treaty obligations concerning intellectual property rights. The United States is helping developing
countries gain access to essential medicines through the Millennium Vaccine
Initiative, which is designed to accelerate the development of vaccines
for such diseases as AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. These are diseases that
disproportionately affect poor countries and to which private firms might
not otherwise devote concentrated research efforts. The initiative includes a
proposal for sharply increased funding for disease and vaccine research, as
well as $50 million for the vaccine purchase fund of the Global Alliance for
Vaccines and Immunization, a $1 billion tax credit for sales of new vaccines,
and the securing of over $150 million in vaccine donations from U.S.
corporations. The Administration has also called on multilateral
development banks such as the World Bank to increase their concessional
lending to basic health care services by $400 million to $900 million
annually. In addition, a joint initiative of the U.S. Trade Representative and
Chapter 4

| 179

the Department of Health and Human Services is seeking ways to provide
direct and effective assistance to developing countries to help them
effectively address major health crises.

Making Globalization Work
The continuing challenge for international economic policy will be to
ensure that globalization proceeds in a way that allows the United States and
the rest of the world to enjoy its benefits, while at the same time seeing that
the gains are universally shared. Policies aimed at continued liberalization
of capital, labor, and goods markets will help speed economic growth, the
diffusion of technology, and the expansion of international trade and
investment. It is all too easy—and wrong—to frame the choice as one
between unfettered, unregulated global capitalism on the one hand, and
protectionism and self-imposed isolation on the other. The reality is more
comforting, but also more complicated. We can build a vibrant, more
inclusive global economy, but it means finding some way between these
two extremes.
Building the right kind of integrated global economy depends on the
success of the international community in developing an institutional
framework in which global integration can take place and in providing
assistance to developing countries so that they benefit from it. To help
maintain a stable international economy, the Administration has made
considerable efforts to ensure that multilateral institutions such as the IMF,
the World Bank, and the WTO foster economic growth and operate in a
transparent manner that promotes economic and social harmony (Box 4-3).

Box 4-3. Reforming International Institutions
The United States has taken the lead in efforts to make sure that
international institutions such as the IMF the World Bank, and the
,
WTO are equipped to meet the challenges presented by changes in
the global economy.
The IMF has taken several important steps, among them to:
• increase dramatically the transparency of its operations
• strengthen its surveillance of member countries’ policies, in

particular with a view to reducing vulnerability and encouraging
implementation of internationally agreed best practices in areas
such as banking supervision and data dissemination

Box 4-3.—continued
• increase the focus on poverty reduction and growth in its support

for the poorest countries, and
• streamline its financing instruments, discourage persistent reliance

on IMF lending, and encourage early repayment.
The United States has also helped promote important dialogues
on international financial issues between industrial and developing
economies through forums such as the new G-20 finance ministers
group.
In the World Bank and other multilateral development banks,
policies and practices have similarly evolved in response to the
challenges of globalization. There is now broad agreement that good
governance, participation of civil society, country responsibility for
sound development strategies, performance-based lending, and
effective coordination are key pillars of development assistance. The
United States has been a leading advocate of a greater emphasis
on the policies that most contribute to poverty reduction and is
promoting an agenda for reform that includes:
• greater selectivity in lending, across both sectors and countries
• multiyear operational frameworks that would map out commitments

to support governments in tackling social, institutional, and
economic barriers that prevent the poor from contributing to
and benefiting from growth
• expansion of the provisioning for global public goods, which tend
to be underfinanced and undersupplied, particularly in areas where
the benefits accrue predominantly to developing countries
• establishment of performance-based frameworks for the allocation
of resources to borrowers, and
• increased transparency and accountability, including a presumption
of openness in information disclosure policies and a serious set of
internal controls that ensure that policies are clearly defined and
consistently applied.
The United States is seeking to make the WTO more transparent
and thus better understood. The avenues being explored include
crafting an agreement among members to provide for more rapid
release of documents, ensuring that citizens and nongovernmental
organizations can file amicus briefs in dispute settlement proceedings, and opening these proceedings to public observers. As a first
step, the Administration has offered to open any dispute panel in
which the United States is involved, provided the partner to the
dispute also agrees.

Chapter 4

| 181

To assist the poorest countries, the Administration has also pressed international
institutions to focus on increased provision of global public goods such as environmental protection and control of infectious disease. The Administration has
also worked to offer debt relief to heavily indebted poor countries serious about
undertaking economic reform.
Successful globalization requires a parallel international process of
harmonization of national rules, including rules governing the financial
system. Such an effort has been going on largely silently for many years in the
central banking community: for example, a revision of the Basel capital accord
of 1988 is now under way. More recently, in the wake of the Mexican and Asian
financial crises of the 1990s, these efforts at harmonization have accelerated,
with a focus on the role of international standards and codes in the discussion of
reform of the international financial architecture.

Opening Markets to Trade and Investment
Continued progress in opening markets to international trade and
investment will contribute to increased growth. One possible direction is to revitalize efforts to expand on the Uruguay Round agreement through a new round
of multilateral trade liberalization. Even without a new multilateral round,
however, the challenge remains of building on the landmark trade agreements of
the past 8 years. This includes extending the Information Technology Agreement to cover a wider range of high-technology products and to begin to
address nontariff barriers, and expanding the market-opening initiatives in services trade under the Financial Services Agreement and the General Agreement
on Trade in Services. Increased market access for services is particularly important for the United States given the rising importance of services in U.S. exports.
Much work also remains to be done in liberalizing trade in agricultural products. Steps to be taken include lowering tariffs, improving U.S. access to
potential markets, and reducing trade-distorting domestic supports and export
subsidies. An important priority is to remove barriers to trade in biotechnology
products, which offer great promise to make agriculture both more productive
and friendlier to the environment (Box 4-4). Continued progress in the accession of new WTO members will also help liberalize global markets by extending
the reach of WTO disciplines.
As this chapter has argued, trade policy that leads to greater openness
helps ensure competition in domestic markets. Although this puts pressure on
certain domestic interests—notably on stakeholders in industries newly exposed
to international competition—society at large is the real winner, through
expanded choice and lower prices for goods and services. This is likely to be
particularly true in sectors such as information technology, where lower prices
182 | Economic Report of the President

Box 4-4.The Global Promise of Biotechnology
Agricultural biotechnology based on the application of cellular and
molecular biology, by dramatically improving the productivity and
environmental sustainability of global food production, has the
potential to usher in a new agricultural revolution. Biotechnological
methods can be used to increase a plant’s ability to control pests and
disease or tolerate environmental stress, or to enhance food qualities
such as flavor, texture, shelf life, and nutritional content. Biotechnology can also be used to develop diagnostic techniques for testing
food safety, to genetically incorporate specific proteins into plants for
harvesting as pharmaceuticals, and in animal husbandry to diagnose
disease, promote growth, and develop vaccines. Perhaps the greatest
gains from agricultural biotechnology are in store for developing
countries, where an estimated 840 million people, or 13 percent of
the global population, are subject to uncertain food supply, including
200 million estimated to suffer from malnutrition. Use of droughttolerant, pest-resistant, and nutrition-enhanced crops leads to
improved yields and thus enhances food security. Moreover, since
their introduction in 1996, the use of genetically modified crops has
allowed insecticide and herbicide use in those crops to be reduced in
the United States. Lower reliance on toxic insecticides has important
benefits for farm workers and wildlife and may reduce the dietary
exposure of children and adults to these chemicals.
Applications of agricultural biotechnology have not been developed
and introduced as rapidly as medical applications. In part this can be
attributed to the uncertain economics of new crops and the need to
evaluate risks to human health and the environment. The latter concerns are reflected in consumer resistance to biotechnology
products, especially in Europe. By 2000 about 70 million acres of
transgenic crops were under cultivation in the United States, out of
more than 255 million total acres planted with major crops. However,
several U.S. farm and commodity groups have alerted their members
to potential economic risks from planting biotech crops. These risks
are increasing as some food processors have banned genetically
engineered crops from their products. Increased economic risk is
also reflected in other countries’ export restrictions on certain agricultural products derived from biotechnology. For example, a lengthy
EU approval process and a virtual moratorium since 1998 on
bioengineered grain varieties were significant factors behind the 90
percent decline in the volume of corn exports to the European Union
in 1998. Restrictions on agricultural commodities and food products
derived from biotechnology in industrial countries have raised
continued on next page...

Chapter 4

Box 4-4.—continued
concerns in developing countries as well. However, wide differences
exist within the developing world, with some countries strongly
embracing the technology for reasons of food security and other
potential economic gains, while others have shown reticence.
A central goal of this Administration has been to ensure that
decisions on the use and regulation of biotechnology products are
made on the basis of scientific evaluation—a principle enshrined in
the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures concluded as
part of the Uruguay Round. The agreement requires that food, animal,
and plant health and safety regulations that affect trade flows be
based on scientific evidence. The Codex Alimentarius of the United
Nations’ Food and Agricultural Organization provides a universal
food standard that may be used as a basis for countries’ regulatory
measures. Scientific evaluation is the appropriate basis on which to
define which measures are appropriate to achieve the legitimate goal
of public health protection.
The United States continues a more than 20-year program to evaluate
the implications of scientific advances such as biotechnology on
public health. This includes assessment of the long-term impacts of
genetically modified foods on human health and the environment.
The National Academy of Sciences has undertaken a series of
projects to examine the efficiency and integrity of U.S. biotechnology
regulation. These include analyses of the assessment and monitoring
of environmental risks and a broad review of available evidence on
human health effects associated with genetically engineered foods.
The Council on Environmental Quality and the Office of Science and
Technology Policy are coordinating an interagency assessment of
Federal environmental regulations pertaining to agricultural biotechnology. As a complement to these two steps, the Administration has
also called for an expanded program of research focusing on current
and future biotechnology safety issues.

that lead to increased network usage will have positive spillovers for the entire
economy. In many developing countries, these are also sectors with dominant
local firms for which foreign entry is likely to provide the only sustainable competition. Continuing efforts to open foreign markets to U.S. exports can thus
lead to a win-win situation for the United States and its trade partners. To make
this happen, it is vital to ensure that the market-opening provisions of trade
agreements are fully implemented and U.S. trade laws vigorously enforced.
Efforts at enforcement have included recourse to the improved dispute settlement mechanism at the WTO and, at home, creation of a trade compliance
center at the Department of Commerce.
184 | Economic Report of the President

Arguments for the benefits of open markets apply with equal force here at
home. Here the task is to extend the decades-long process of reducing U.S. trade
barriers, particularly those faced by the least-developed countries, while spreading the benefits of trade liberalization as widely as possible and taking care that
the costs of adjustment are not borne solely by a few. Substantial progress has
been made in this regard, including the elimination of tariffs on some 2,000
items. Moreover, through the Generalized System of Preferences, the United
States provides duty-free access to some 4,600 items from developing countries.
This program promotes economic growth and development in these countries
by stimulating their exports. Additional liberalization has been targeted to particular regions, including Sub-Saharan Africa through the African Growth and
Opportunity Act, and the Caribbean through the Caribbean Basin Trade
Partnership Act.
One challenge for trade policy is to know when to do nothing—to resist the
inevitable domestic pressures for protection from imports while at the same time
enforcing U.S. trade laws that aim for trade to be free and fair. The political
economy of trade protection is well understood: the benefits of trade liberalization are spread over a large number of consumers, each of whom gains only a
little, whereas the beneficiaries of trade restrictions tend to be more concentrated
and thus have greater incentives to push for protection. The challenge for policymakers is to remain focused on the benefits of free trade while helping those
individuals and communities adversely affected by change.

Conclusion
Access to global trade and investment flows has played a vital role in
creating the New Economy in the United States. Openness gives us crucial
inputs of goods and capital that have lowered costs and raised efficiency. And
the availability of the larger world market allows U.S. firms to enjoy scale
economies and thus increases the rewards from innovation. The achievements of
the past 8 years have provided solid momentum toward opening markets and
expanding trade. Building on this progress is vital for both the United States and
the rest of the world. Continued globalization is central to ensuring that the diffusion of technology and knowledge to other countries leads to improved
economic performance on a global scale, mirroring what has already occurred in
the United States. Stronger world growth is in the profound national interest of
the United States. Global prosperity is not only likely to result in increased U.S.
exports and continued strong growth in domestic employment and income; it
can also be a major contributor to international harmony.

Living in the New Economy

T

his Administration came to office on a platform of “putting people first.”
The Administration has kept that pledge. Although the phrase “New
Economy” typically brings to mind technological innovation and globalization,
arguably one of the most important changes from the old economy to the new
has been an improvement in the well-being of the American people. By virtually
any measure, Americans are better off today than they were 8 years ago.
The private sector has demonstrated great entrepreneurial dynamism and
technological sophistication in bringing us the New Economy. But we need to
recognize that even in a New Economy, private markets alone, for all their
virtues, will not guarantee that all our national goals will be met. Private markets
can create wealth, but they cannot ensure that all citizens, even those able to find
jobs, will have adequate incomes. Nor will private markets ensure that all citizens have access to quality education and health care. Similarly, although private
markets can generate growth, they cannot ensure that growth will reach all communities. Nor will purely private markets necessarily deal with the side effects of
growth on both the environment and urban congestion.
Many of our most difficult national challenges will require government intervention through policies that assist individuals and communities in danger of
187

being left behind. This chapter, therefore, considers policy areas that have a
major impact on the opportunities given to all Americans to create a better life
for themselves and their children. In particular, the chapter outlines recent
reforms in the Nation’s welfare system and policies designed to improve the educational system, expand health insurance coverage, and ensure smart growth. It
also describes the considerable progress that has been made and identifies the
tasks that remain to be accomplished.
Although the New Economy may not meet these challenges on its own, the
faster growth it has generated does make meeting them considerably
easier. In addition, the innovations that have occurred in information technologies, organizational redesign, and policy provide better tools with which to meet
them. In each section of the chapter, particular attention is paid to the contributions such innovations have made and can make in improving the quality of life
for all Americans. For example, in the welfare system, new policies that make
work pay have dramatically reduced the number of families receiving cash assistance, while increasing employment. In education, educators have worked to
implement higher standards for students and teachers and have brought aspects
of the New Economy into the classroom through the increased use of computers.
In health care, innovations in medical technology and managerial practices have
increased the quality of care and helped rein in costs. Finally, across our communities, some localities are taking advantage of new techniques to combat
problems of congestion and pollution and ensure smart growth practices. This
chapter elaborates on these and similar policies that have helped grow the work
force, sustain strong economic growth, and improve the quality of life for
all Americans.

Good News from the American Economy
Record-setting gains in the stock market and growth in the net worth of
wealthy individuals have received wide media coverage. But the most noteworthy aspects of the current economic expansion are its duration and its
reach. The last few years in particular have brought tremendous gains to all
segments of our society.
Employment gains have been dramatic. Between January 1993 and
November 2000, 22.4 million new jobs were created. In 1999 the unemployment rate reached 4.2 percent—the lowest annual rate since 1969. Just
as important, unemployment has stayed low, remaining below 5 percent for
41 consecutive months through November 2000. At the same time, wages
have been increasing. After declining consistently from 1986 to 1993, real
hourly wages for private sector workers rose by 7.4 percent between 1993
and 1999. These gains in employment and wages are echoed in growth in
188 | Economic Report of the President

income and reductions in poverty. The real median household income
reached a new high of $40,816 in 1999, an increase of 2.7 percent since
1998 and a total increase of 13.3 percent from 1993. In 1999 the poverty
rate fell to 11.8 percent, its lowest level since 1979 and 3.3 percentage
points below the 1993 rate of 15.1 percent.
These gains were shared by Americans at all income levels. Between 1998
and 1999, real income grew by 4.4 percent for those at the 20th percentile
and by 3.5 percent for those at the 80th percentile. (The household at the
20th percentile has an income higher than 20 percent of all households and
lower than the other 80 percent.) From 1993 to 1999 the comparable figures
for real income growth were 15.0 percent and 14.2 percent, respectively. In
addition, the most disadvantaged groups tended to experience the greatest
improvements in financial well-being. Household incomes for African
Americans and Hispanics saw record one-year increases, rising to all-time
highs. The real median income for African-American households increased
7.7 percent between 1998 and 1999 (it is up 23.9 percent since 1993),
climbing to $27,910. The real median household income for Hispanics
rose to $30,735, an increase of 6.1 percent between 1998 and 1999 (and
16.5 percent since 1993).
In 1999, unemployment for African Americans and Hispanics fell to the
lowest rates on record. African Americans saw unemployment fall from
13.0 percent in 1993 to an average of 7.6 percent for the first 11 months of
2000, while Hispanics saw their unemployment rate drop to an 11-month
average of 5.7 percent (Chart 5-1). Male earnings have also increased,
particularly for African Americans. Between 1998 and 1999 the real median
earnings for full-time African-American male workers increased by $2,379 in
1999 dollars, or 8.6 percent—a dramatic rise for a single year. With this sharp
increase, the ratio of African-American male to white male earnings rose to
0.81, the highest level ever recorded.
Along with record increases in income have come record lows in poverty rates
(Chart 5-2). The decrease in the poverty rate for African Americans between
1998 and 1999 was the largest 1-year decline in percentage terms since
1967-68, and the poverty rate for this group in 1999 reached an all-time low
of 23.6 percent. Hispanics also experienced a record drop in poverty. At
22.8 percent, the poverty rate for this group is now at its lowest since 1979.
In the past, economic gains have often had a limited impact on households
headed by women. Since 1993, however, the strong economy and a social
welfare policy that emphasizes work have brought substantial benefits to this
group. In March 1993 just 56.8 percent of women maintaining a family on
their own were employed; this figure rose to 63.4 percent in March 1998 and
65.2 percent in March 1999. This increase in employment corresponded to an
increase in income. Between 1993 and 1999 the median income for these

Chapter 5

| 189

190 | Economic Report of the President

families increased by 18.0 percent. Between 1998 and 1999 alone, the increase
was 4.8 percent. The poverty rate for people in families headed by females also
fell, from 38.7 percent in 1993 to 33.1 percent in 1998 and 30.4 percent in
1999.
Within this group are those most likely to have been affected by welfare
reform: low-income single mothers and their children. (Low income is defined
here as an income below 200 percent of the poverty line.) An analysis of a
recently completed survey indicates that between 1997 and 1999 the proportion of low-income single mothers between 25 and 54 who were employed
increased from 59.7 percent to 65.2 percent. Children as well as their mothers
benefited from this change. Between 1998 and 1999 the poverty rate for children fell by 2 percentage points, to 16.9 percent, the lowest level since 1979
and the largest percentage-point decline since 1966. Poverty among AfricanAmerican children declined by even more in absolute terms, falling by
3.6 percentage points to 33.1 percent. Since 1993 the poverty rate for all
children has fallen by 5.8 percentage points.
Older Americans have also benefited from economic growth. In 1999 the
poverty rate among the elderly fell below 10 percent for the first time on record.
With the elimination last year of the Social Security earnings test for those aged
65 and over, older Americans will likely participate in the labor force in greater
numbers, further improving their financial status.
In the past, residents of our central cities have seen little change in their
poverty levels, yet here, too, the situation is improving. Over the last several
years, central-city residents in large metropolitan areas experienced an aboveaverage increase in median income and the largest declines in poverty of any
geographic category.
The gains experienced by Americans over the past 8 years have not been
limited to financial gains but include a long list of improvements in the
quality of life. Low interest rates and a strong economy have contributed to the
highest home ownership rate ever in America. In the third quarter of 2000,
67.7 percent of American families owned a home, up from 63.7 percent in the
first quarter of 1993 and surpassing the Administration’s goal, set in 1995, of
67.5 percent. Improvements in job opportunities, in combination with Administration initiatives to hire additional police officers, strengthen gun laws, and
increase local resources to improve public safety, have contributed to a dramatic
reduction in crime. In 1999 the overall crime rate fell to its lowest level in
26 years.
Again, some of the least well off Americans have benefited most. The
violent crime victimization rate among those with annual household incomes of
less than $7,500 fell at an average annual rate of 4.7 percent between 1993 and
1999, while victimization rates for those with incomes of $75,000 or more fell

Chapter 5

| 191

at an average annual rate of 2.8 percent. During the same period the number of
violent crimes perpetrated against African Americans declined by an average of
4.6 percent per year, while whites experienced a 3.0 percent annual decline.
Patterns by race for property crimes are similar.
The Nation’s schools today are also showing improvements on several fronts.
Between 1993 and 1998 the proportion of high-school graduates going
directly to college grew by nearly 7 percent, and college enrollment
is at an all-time high. Math SAT test scores have reached their highest level
in 30 years, and average verbal SAT scores have held steady even though
the number of nonnative English speakers taking the exam has increased.
Minorities have also made notable academic achievements. Among
high-school graduates aged 18–24, the proportions of African-American
and Hispanic students continuing their education at a 4-year college are at
record highs.
Improvements have also been made in the public health arena. The birth rate
among teenagers declined 17 percent between 1993 and 1999. Infant mortality
was down from 8.4 deaths per thousand in 1993 to 7.2 per thousand in 1998.
Between 1997 and 2000 smoking among teenagers declined after rising for
most of the decade. Over the past several years, death rates attributable to heart
disease, cancer, stroke, and AIDS are down, and life expectancy has improved.
A child born in 1998 can expect to live 76.7 years, up from 75.5 years in 1993.
Although these statistics present a glowing picture of the New Economy and
the well-being of the Nation as a whole, more work remains to be done.
Despite the recent gains, the incomes of minority groups remain significantly below those of whites, and their poverty rates significantly above. Infant
mortality rates and life expectancy also differ substantially by race and ethnicity,
as does access to a quality education. Certain areas of the country continue to
experience unemployment rates of more than 10 percent, as well as distressingly
high levels of poverty. Many Americans still lack health insurance coverage and
access to adequate medical care.
Innovative policies have helped us share many of the gains of the New
Economy, reduce the number of people on welfare, and improve employment
opportunities. But new policies may be needed to contend with future changes
in the economy. A slowing of economic growth will likely be felt most severely
by those who have only recently begun to share in its benefits. Those most
recently employed may lose their jobs and accompanying benefits such as health
insurance. Federal, State, and local governments may feel pressure to cut back
on investments in education if their revenues decline. Thus, continued improvements in the well-being of the American people likely depend on both sustained
economic growth and active public policy.

192 | Economic Report of the President

Helping Families Help Themselves
The New Economy is popularly characterized by new technologies, new
methods of communication, and new avenues of trade. But it also brings innovative ways of providing for the least well off Americans. Substantial changes
have taken place in the organization of our welfare system and in the incentives
it provides. These innovations, and in particular policies designed to increase the
benefits of work, such as child care subsidies and rules that increase the fraction
of earnings that welfare recipients can keep, have changed the tenor of American
social welfare policy. Public policy now emphasizes employment and investment
in the skills of those who are less well off. In doing so the Administration has
helped low-income families leave welfare and enter the labor market, thereby
promoting a more equitable distribution of the gains from the New Economy.

Welfare Reform
Two of the most impressive achievements of the past 8 years have been the
reduction in the number of Americans receiving welfare, and the increase in the
numbers of current and former welfare recipients who are working. The Administration has worked hard to reform welfare. It began by allowing a record
number of States to implement changes in their welfare programs on an experimental basis, through waivers from Federal welfare regulations. As of August
1996, 43 States had received waivers and set up alternative programs that
emphasized work and parental responsibility.
These changes at the State level were followed by changes at the national level,
in particular the bipartisan Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity
Reconciliation Act signed by the President in 1996. This act replaced the Aid to
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program with one that provides
needy families with temporary assistance, established time limits for receiving
welfare benefits, and shifted the emphasis from simply providing assistance to
helping families leave welfare and enter the labor market. Policies that offer tax
credits to subsidize the earnings of low-income workers, provide assistance with
child care, and expand eligibility for health insurance support the welfare-towork transition.
The new program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), differs
from the AFDC program in three fundamental ways. First, it gives States much
more discretion in using Federal funds. Under the AFDC program, States set
eligibility and benefit levels (within Federal guidelines) and received matching
funds from the Federal Government to help with the program costs. The new
program provides States with block grants that are used to finance cash benefits,
job preparation, and other worker support programs. States now have much

Chapter 5

| 193

more flexibility in spending, and they have used this flexibility to meet the
particular demands of their constituencies—for example, allocating additional
funds for child care subsidies or allowing welfare recipients to keep a greater
fraction of their earnings. States are also eligible for bonuses for helping people
get and keep jobs and decreasing out-of-wedlock births. In the future, bonuses
will be offered for increasing participation in the food stamp, Medicaid, and
children’s health insurance programs; for providing child care to a larger fraction
of eligible children; and for increasing the proportion of children living in
married-couple families.
Second, the new system imposes time limits and work requirements on
welfare recipients. In general, States can no longer use Federal funds to pay
benefits to recipients beyond a lifetime limit of 60 months. States can exempt
some recipients from this requirement, set even shorter time limits, or use their
own funds to continue support beyond the 5-year limit. In 1999, 38 States used
the 60-month time limit, and the remainder implemented other policies
(8 States had shorter time limits, 3 had no time limit, and others intended to use
longer periods). Recipients must also work in some capacity after receiving benefits for 2 years, but States have flexibility in deciding how to implement this
requirement, particularly in terms of strengthening it. In 1999, 28 States had
welfare policies that imposed immediate work requirements rather than the 2year requirement.
Finally, States can now design the parameters of their program to suit the
needs of their residents. Although even before 1996 States had the freedom to
set benefit levels, the new program allows them to set income and asset limits for
eligibility as well and to establish their own methods of calculating the income
of potentially eligible families. The majority of States have used this freedom to
decrease the implicit tax on earnings. The AFDC program reduced benefits
dollar for dollar for any earnings of more than $90 per month after 12 months
of work. This 100 percent “tax” on earnings created a strong disincentive to
work, as it was possible for a recipient to see little if any increase in income from
additional hours of work. Many States now use a more gradual benefit reduction rate to encourage greater work force participation. They are also investing
in a wide range of supports to help welfare recipients and other low-income
working families enter the work force and succeed on the job.

The Effects of Welfare-to-Work Programs
Since August 1996, welfare caseloads have fallen dramatically. Between
August 1996 and June 2000, the number of people receiving welfare declined
by half, to 5.8 million. Including reductions that have taken place since 1993,
caseloads have fallen by 8.3 million, or 59 percent. Declines in some States have
been even more dramatic. In Wisconsin, for example, the number of welfare
recipients fell by 75 percent between August 1996 and June 2000, and it has
fallen by 84 percent since 1993.
194 | Economic Report of the President

The 1996 reforms have undeniably been successful in reducing the
number of people receiving welfare. But reductions in caseloads are not the only
measure by which to judge the reforms: the well-being of the millions of former
welfare recipients is at least as important. Much of what we know about outcomes for welfare leavers comes from studies undertaken in individual States. To
date, studies monitoring the outcomes of those who have left welfare have been
conducted in over 30 states. In addition, some of the data from State waiver
experiments undertaken before the nationwide welfare reform have implications
for current programs.
Available data on the results of welfare reform often differ from State to State
and do not represent nationwide averages. This Report therefore supplements
this information with new results based on the Census Bureau’s Survey of
Income and Program Participation (SIPP), providing some of the first evidence
on the effects of welfare reform for a nationally representative sample. The
results from the SIPP are based on a sample of people who were observed for at
least 12 months after leaving the welfare rolls. These individuals were first
observed between December 1995 and March 1996 and were reinterviewed
every 4 months until the period between November 1998 and February 1999,
the exact month depending on the month of the initial interview. The new data
cover the experiences of some of those first affected by welfare reform and may
not reveal the effects of the time limits on receiving benefits or the long-term
impact on families.
One of the most important issues in evaluating welfare reform is the
incidence of recidivism, that is, the return of individuals to the welfare rolls.
Both SIPP data and a synthesis of State studies show that approximately
25 percent of those who leave welfare return within 12 months. (Most
studies of recidivism, including those cited here, do not treat transitions of less
than 2 months as true changes.) The majority of those who do return to welfare
do so quickly: the SIPP data show that 18 percent of those who exit return
within the first 6 months of leaving, and only 7 percent during the second
6-month window. Further, the probability of returning to welfare declines with
time. In Maryland 25 percent of former recipients returned to welfare within
12 months, but only 10 percent returned in the next 12 months, and
approximately 1 percent did so in the third 12-month period.

Helping Welfare Leavers Find and Keep Jobs
A key factor in success after welfare is the ability to obtain a job and remain
employed. The Administration provided a total of $3 billion in fiscal 1998 and
fiscal 1999 in the form of Welfare-to-Work grants to help States and local communities move long-term welfare recipients and noncustodial parents into jobs.
The Administration also implemented the Workforce Investment Act, which
allows States to provide job placement assistance to residents, with priority given
to low-income individuals (Box 5-1).
Chapter 5

| 195

Box 5-1.The Workforce Investment Act
The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 was the result of a bipartisan
effort by the Congress and the Administration. The law requires that
basic job and career information and assistance be available to all
Americans and creates a system developed around one-stop career
centers in order to knit together multiple programs at the local level.
The law also provides for intensive assessment, counseling, job search
assistance, and training, with priority given to people on public assistance
and to low-income individuals.
The law initiates three reforms that are designed to maximize
training choices: individual training accounts, systems for identifying
eligible training providers and their programs, and extensive information on program performance such as success in job placement, postplacement earnings, and rates of skill attainment. These reforms were
designed so that trainees will have the opportunity and the purchasing
power to enter the training program of their choice rather than be channeled into one of a handful of locally contracted programs. The reforms
provide an abundance of reliable information that will empower
trainees, allowing them to make informed choices.

Employment programs for welfare recipients generally use one of two
approaches to helping welfare leavers find jobs. The “work first” approach
aims to get people employed as quickly as possible. It is based on the belief
that work itself will give inexperienced workers the skills (human capital)
they need to remain in the labor force and move to increasingly better jobs.
This approach focuses on maintaining an attachment to the labor force
rather than on initial wages. The alternative approach relies on comparatively
extensive education and training before welfare leavers enter the labor
market. It delays their entrance into the work force in the expectation
that, once employed, they will have better jobs than they could otherwise
have obtained.
The work-first approach is the more common, and past studies of initial
outcomes have indicated that it is the more successful: gains in employment
levels and earnings for program participants were higher in areas with workfirst programs than in areas using a training-based approach. However, a new
study comparing outcomes across counties in California over a 9-year period
finds that results for the two approaches are similar in the long term.
A separate study comparing the outcomes of 11 different welfare-to-work
programs over a 2-year period finds that the most successful approach combined an emphasis on work with assistance in completing the General
Educational Development (GED) diploma.
196 | Economic Report of the President

Employment rates among former welfare recipients are high. Administrative data from studies conducted in several different States show that between
62 and 75 percent of those leaving welfare were employed at some point in
the following year, and approximately 40 percent were employed in all
four quarters. Results are similar at the national level. SIPP data show that
66 percent of welfare leavers were employed at some point in the following
12 months, and 43 percent had earnings in all four quarters. However, few
leavers were continuously employed. Only 32 percent of welfare leavers
worked 50 weeks or more during the year, and just 40 percent of this group
(12.8 percent of all leavers) worked 35 or more hours in each week. Thus,
although labor force participation has increased significantly among former
welfare recipients, there is considerable room for further gains.
Importantly, employment rates increased even among those who remained
on welfare. In fiscal 1999, 33 percent of welfare recipients were working,
compared with fewer than 7 percent in 1992. Developing an attachment to
the labor market even while on welfare is important, because it increases the
probability of success after leaving welfare.
The importance of the booming economy to these successes should not be
understated. Theories of human capital accumulation and the tenets behind
work-first programs suggest that time spent working increases productivity,
job skills, and wages. The long economic expansion and historically low
unemployment rates have given current and former welfare recipients the
chance to accumulate work experience that would be expected to serve them
well in a future downturn. The longer the expansion continues, the better
prepared they will be to weather the consequences.

Earnings
Although employment is important in and of itself, so, too, are earnings.
Welfare leavers are unlikely to thrive in the workplace if they are no better off
financially than they were before leaving the welfare rolls. Evidence from
State studies indicates that, at least initially, few leavers are significantly
better off. Median quarterly earnings for those who found employment
varied from $2,000 to $3,000, or approximately $700 to $1,000 per month.
For the majority of leavers in Wisconsin, earnings after leaving welfare were
lower than the sum of earnings and welfare benefits prior to exit.
For the sample of SIPP leavers, the median monthly household income plus
food stamps for the year following exit was $1,605, compared with $1,509 in
the 2 months preceding exit. For 44 percent of leavers, household income
plus food stamps in the year following exit was more than $50 per month
higher than in the months before; for 49 percent it was at least $50 lower.
The idea behind work-first programs is that an initial job will lead to
earnings growth over time. Because many former welfare recipients find

Chapter 5

| 197

employment in low-wage industries such as food services, their prospects for
earnings growth may not seem extremely bright. Yet 39 percent of SIPP
leavers had monthly earnings in the second 6 months after leaving welfare
that were $50 or more higher than in the first 6 months. Twenty-eight
percent saw a reduction in earnings of $50 or more over the two 6-month
periods immediately following exit. Thus at least some former welfare
recipients did have earnings growth in the year of exit through increases in
hours, wages, or both.
Income gains from the Earned Income Tax Credit (the EITC is discussed
in detail below) are not included in these calculations. Although its benefits
are not recorded in the SIPP data, the credit provides a substantial subsidy to
low-income workers, and including its effects would improve incomes and
poverty rates considerably. Although its figures do not focus specifically on
welfare leavers, the Census Bureau estimates that in 1999 the fraction of
households with after-tax incomes of less than $10,000 a year falls from
9.9 percent to 9.3 percent when the EITC is factored in. At a maximum
credit of $3,880 in 2000 for a low-income worker with two children, the
EITC could add up to $323 per month to a family’s income.

Making Work Pay
As the earnings of welfare recipients increase, they can lose not only their
cash assistance but also other benefits such as food stamps and Medicaid.
At the same time, they incur explicit payroll taxes and additional expenses
associated with work such as child care and transportation costs. In the past
these costs have been large. One study found that the implicit marginal tax
rate for AFDC recipients —the net amount paid in taxes, forgone benefits,
and work-related expenses from a $1 increase in income—could easily exceed
50 percent. In other words, earning $1 more in the labor market increased
their disposable income by less than 50 cents.
The Administration’s welfare reform proposals have attempted to reduce
these implicit taxes and increase the rewards from work, through a higher
minimum wage and an increased EITC, through increased subsidies for
child care, and through expanded health insurance coverage that includes
working families not previously eligible for public programs. The Administration has also worked to help single parents collect the child support
payments due them. These programs do more than help ease the transition
from welfare to work; they also benefit working families who may have never
received welfare. By reaching out to both groups, the Administration has
worked to ensure that no working family is left behind.

198 | Economic Report of the President

The Earned Income Tax Credit
Operating through the income tax system, the EITC provides a wage
subsidy for many low-income workers. The amount of the subsidy depends
on how much the family earns and on whether the family has zero, one, or
two or more children. By effectively increasing the wage rate, the EITC offers
those eligible an added incentive to participate in the labor force. In 2000,
families with two or more children received a subsidy of 40 cents for every
dollar of earned income up to $9,700, for a maximum credit of $3,880. This
tax credit is refundable, so that even families who pay little or no income tax
can benefit fully from the tax provision. Rather than falling to zero when
earnings surpass $9,700, the credit remains at $3,880 until earnings reach
$12,700 and then gradually declines. For two-child families it phases out
completely when earned income reaches $31,152 (Chart 5-3). The gradual
phaseout reduces the disincentive to earn income beyond the level at which
the credit peaks.
The EITC has been expanded greatly since 1990, with increases in both
benefits and scope of coverage. The 1993 expansions increased benefits for
approximately 15 million tax-filing units (assumed to be roughly equivalent

Chapter 5

| 199

in number to households), in large part by raising the subsidy for families
with two or more children. The 1993 expansion also, for the first time,
allowed workers without children to claim a tax credit. As a result of both the
1990 and the 1993 expansions, credits paid increased from $15.5 billion
in 1993 to nearly $31 billion in tax year 1999. At the same time, the
number of tax returns claiming the EITC increased by roughly 30 percent,
from 15 million to nearly 19 million. The program now pays out nearly as
much as the Federal outlays on the TANF and food stamp programs combined.
This wage subsidy has been effective in attracting more workers into the
labor market (Chart 5-4). According to one estimate, the EITC alone was
responsible for 34 percent of the increase in annual employment among
unmarried mothers between 1992 and 1996.
In addition to increasing the probability of employment for low-income
people, the EITC has done much to improve the well-being of those who
receive it. Many workers do not have jobs that pay enough to raise their
incomes above the poverty level. But when the credit is taken into account,
the earnings of these workers can rise substantially. Calculations of after-tax
income excluding and including the EITC indicate that in 1999 the credit
lifted 4.1 million individuals out of poverty. Of these, 2.3 million were children. The provision has also been effective in targeting benefits to the most
needy. Estimates based on 1997 data indicate that between 50 and 60
percent of its benefits accrue to families with incomes below the poverty line.

200 | Economic Report of the President

The Minimum Wage
The minimum wage operates in tandem with the EITC: the credit
provides an effective wage subsidy, and the minimum wage laws ensure that
the subsidy is based on an acceptable wage. The real value of the minimum
wage declined substantially from 1992 to 1995, falling to just 71 percent of
its peak value, recorded in 1968. Subsequent Administration-backed efforts
led to increases in the minimum wage in 1996 and 1997. Even with these
most recent increases, however, the minimum wage in 1999 was less than
80 percent of its 1968 level (after controlling for inflation).
However, when the minimum wage is combined with a possible
40 percent subsidy from the EITC, the true minimum wage for workers with
two or more children and earnings of less than $9,700 is $7.21 an hour
(Chart 5-5). This hourly rate is higher in real terms than the peak minimum
wage rates of the 1960s. Even so, an individual working full-time at the
minimum wage would have a yearly income of just $14,188 (including the
credit), well below the poverty line for a family of two adults and two children.

Child Care
For many parents, one of the most difficult barriers to employment is
finding affordable, good-quality child care. For low-income families and new
entrants to the labor market, the costs of child care may make working
impossible. Recognizing these costs as a barrier to work, the Administration

Chapter 5

| 201

has worked to make child care more affordable for low-income families and
to provide assistance with child care expenses to a greater number of families.
Federal funding for child care has increased substantially, and the various
existing child care programs have been combined to create the Child Care
and Development Fund. This fund provides States with block grants for the
purpose of subsidizing approved child care arrangements. States can transfer
additional funds from their TANF block grants to help finance child care
subsidies. In fiscal 1999, States spent a total of $5.2 billion in Federal dollars
on child care, including both child care allocations and TANF block grant
transfers. They also added $1.6 billion of their own funding. These resources
benefited an average of 1.8 million children per month. Despite this investment, however, many States have waiting lists for benefits, and many families
who qualify for the subsidies do not receive benefits. It is estimated that only
12 percent of eligible children were served by this program in fiscal 1999.

The Food Stamp Program
The food stamp program helps to ensure that low-income individuals
receive adequate nutrition. Benefits are available to households with incomes
up to 130 percent of the poverty line. In fiscal 1998 the vast majority of
benefits (nearly 90 percent in dollar terms) went to households with children
or elderly individuals. In 1999, 27 percent of participating households had
earned income. Enrollment in the food stamp program has fallen
dramatically since 1994, from a high of 27.5 million participants to
18.2 million in 1999, in part because of the strong economy. Of concern,
however, is the fact that the participation rate for eligible families declined
from 71 percent in September 1994 to 62 percent in September 1997. This
decline is particularly marked for families with children. In 1999 only
51 percent of children in families with incomes below the poverty line
received food stamps. Even among the very poorest children—those in
families with incomes less than 50 percent of the poverty line—data indicate
that only 58 percent received food stamps in 1999, down from 76 percent in
1993. (Not all poor families are eligible for food stamps. Limitations on the
value of assets that an eligible family may hold may exclude some families.)
Several factors could be responsible for the decline in participation. Changes
in the laws governing the program have excluded some immigrants and
restricted the eligibility of able-bodied adults without dependents, decreasing
the pool of potential participants. The strong economy and the growing
number of people with jobs may have further reduced the number of eligible
individuals. But these factors alone cannot explain all of the steep decline in participation rates, and it is likely that some eligible families are not receiving the
benefits they need (and are entitled to receive). This is especially true of families
just leaving the welfare rolls. Rules governing participation in the program are
often a factor here. States require that wage-earning food stamp recipients have
202 | Economic Report of the President

their incomes recertified at regular intervals, often every 3 months and even
more frequently in some States. For low-wage earners without much time off,
this requirement could well be a substantial deterrent to participation. A recent
study underscored this concern, attributing a large portion of nonparticipation
to the costs to recipients of regular recertification.
In response to these recent trends, the Administration has implemented a
series of changes in the regulations governing the food stamp program. These
changes substantially reduce the need for recertification for those leaving welfare
and the newly employed and give States greater flexibility in processing applications. States will soon be able to receive bonus awards under the TANF program
for increasing participation rates for low-income working households. In the
future, $20 million will be allocated for these awards. Finally, the Administration has provided funding for educational and outreach campaigns aimed at
improving nutrition for low-income families and the elderly.

Child Support
Child support payments from noncustodial parents are an important
source of income for poor children. In 1997 child support lifted an estimated
half a million children out of poverty. Child support is particularly important
for families leaving welfare. Divorced or separated women who leave
welfare and do not receive child support have a significantly greater chance
of returning within 6 months than those receiving even small amounts of
child support.
An important component of the Administration’s policies to help working
families is ensuring that single and divorced parents receive the child support
payments they are entitled to under the law. Between fiscal 1992 and fiscal
1999 the dollar value of child support collections doubled, from $8 billion to
$16 billion—an increase of more than two-thirds after adjusting for inflation. During the same period the number of child support cases involving
collections increased from 2.6 million to 6.1 million.
However, much of the money collected never reaches the custodial parent.
Many States reduce TANF benefits dollar for dollar when a noncustodial
parent provides support, lowering the incentive for noncustodial parents to
provide for their children. The President proposed legislative changes that
would make it easier for States to pass along a portion of child support
payments to custodial parents receiving assistance. This change would give
parents an incentive to cooperate with the system. Some States, such as
Wisconsin, are already experimenting with this type of policy, with some
success. Results show that noncustodial parents are more willing to pay child
support when they know that at least some of the money will go to benefit
their child. Ultimately, widespread use of this policy should increase
collections of child support payments.
Chapter 5

| 203

Access to Health Insurance
Historically, individuals and families leaving the welfare rolls have lost
their Medicaid coverage as they did so. During the 1980s a series of Medicaid expansions and the introduction of Transitional Medical Assistance began
providing health insurance benefits to former welfare recipients and lowincome families, easing the transition to work. Before the 1996 welfare
reform a Federal mandate required that States offer Medicaid coverage to
children and pregnant women in low-income families, regardless of whether
they were already receiving welfare. This group included children under the
age of 6 and pregnant women in families with incomes below 133 percent of
the poverty line, and children between the ages of 6 and 19 in families with
incomes below 100 percent of the poverty line. Many States opted for even
broader coverage, setting higher income thresholds and covering children of
all ages. Adults could obtain Medicaid for up to 12 months after leaving
welfare under the Transitional Medical Assistance program or through State
programs for the medically needy. The 1996 legislation expanded Medicaid
coverage to low-income single-parent and some two-parent families, and to
families leaving welfare. In 1997 the State Children’s Health Insurance
Program (SCHIP) was created to target children in low-income families.
SCHIP is further discussed later in the chapter.

Looking to the Future
The success thus far in helping families leave welfare is tempered by the
realization that many families still depend on public assistance. As the time
limits for TANF begin to bind, the focus must be on how to help those who
have been unable to secure employment. Furthermore, as already noted,
some who have left the welfare rolls are no better off financially than they
were while receiving benefits. Investments in job skills, a continued strong
economy, and policies that ensure a living wage can all help these people
succeed in the labor force. However, when the economy does begin to slow,
policies must be in place to help those who lose their jobs. If former welfare
recipients are among the last hired, they may be among the first laid off, and
they run the risk of returning to public assistance. These challenges are not
insurmountable, but they require the continued commitment of government
and the private sector to reach workable solutions.

Reaching out to Underserved Communities
Providing opportunity and independence for American families sometimes
requires more than a strong national economy and responsible welfare policy.
Areas where poverty has become entrenched and the local economy is weak
may need additional assistance. Some of the most intractable poverty is
204 | Economic Report of the President

found in America’s central cities and rural areas. Because these areas are home
to large numbers of Americans—in 1999, 30 percent of the population lived
in the central cities and 20 percent outside metropolitan areas—this situation
is cause for great concern.
In 1967, when statistics for these areas were first recorded separately, the
poverty rate for central cities was 15.0 percent, compared with a nationwide
rate of 14.2 percent. In contrast, poverty in nonmetropolitan areas was over
20 percent. By this measure the central cities were nearly as well off as the rest
of the country, but nonmetropolitan areas suffered from disproportionately
high poverty. Between 1967 and the early 1990s, however, the incidence of
poverty shifted: conditions in the central cities worsened, and nonmetropolitan areas saw a slight improvement. By 1993 the proportion of central-city
residents living in poverty had reached an all-time high of 21.5 percent,
and the poverty rate in nonmetropolitan areas had declined slightly, to
17.2 percent—well above the national poverty rate of 15.1 percent in both
cases. Since 1993, however, the situation has improved dramatically,
especially for central cities. In 1999 the poverty rate for central cities was
16.4 percent and that in nonmetropolitan areas stood at 14.3 percent. Yet
these rates remain well above the national average of 11.8 percent.
The strong national economy and current policies to make work pay,
discourage out-of-wedlock births, and improve schools in poor neighborhoods can be expected to provide some relief. But given the persistently high
poverty rates in these locales, additional strategies may be required. To reach
out to residents of these locales, the Administration has enacted a series of
programs that directly target communities.

Central Cities
Central cities offer some advantages for low-income workers. Central-city
residents likely have ready access to public transportation, and city governments often provide more generous support services than governments in
other locales. But cities often have one key drawback: fewer job opportunities. Recent research shows that most job creation today is taking place in the
suburbs. One study by the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) found that, from 1992 to 1997, job growth was slower in the cities
than in the suburbs and that the job mix in cities is increasingly shifting
toward high-technology industries, which provide fewer opportunities for
low-skilled workers.
Central-city residents also face other barriers to employment. Low-income
workers are unlikely to own a car and must rely on public transportation. Yet
a recent study found that nearly half of all low-skilled jobs in the suburbs are
not accessible by public transportation. Compounding this situation is the
fact that minorities still face discrimination in housing and employment

Chapter 5

| 205

markets. Studies have shown that minorities have difficulty renting and purchasing housing in the suburbs and are less likely to be hired by white-owned
or suburban firms. The cost of housing in the suburbs may also make it
difficult to move to homes near suburban jobs.
From a policy perspective, several approaches are available to address the
mismatch between where low-skilled workers live and where they can find
work. The first is to rebuild the economies of our central cities. The second
involves seeking ways to overcome the transportation hurdles that commuters from the central city face. The third approach is to help low-income
families obtain housing in areas where jobs are available. Providing training is
yet another way to address this issue, improving workers’ skills and thus their
employability at a range of jobs. The Administration has pursued policies
that incorporate all four approaches.
When this Administration took office, a number of programs already
addressed underserved communities. The long-standing problems in these
areas, however, clearly called for additional policy measures. The Administration developed a number of strategies for rebuilding the economies
of America’s central cities, including Empowerment Zones and Enterprise
Communities. The Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community initiative
aims to assist communities by encouraging investment from private businesses through tax credits, wage credits, and improved access to credit
markets. Since 1995 over $1 billion has gone to 78 designated urban areas
under these initiatives, supplemented by over $10 billion leveraged through
other public investment.
To help solve commuting problems, the Administration’s Transportation
Equity Act for the 21st Century established a new Job Access and Reverse
Commute Program designed specifically to connect low-income persons to
employment and support services. Similarly, the Bridges to Work program
provides job placement, transportation, and job retention services in a select
group of cities. In addition, the Administration has made owning a car
easier for low-income families receiving food stamps, by giving States the
flexibility to raise the limit on the value of a car counted as an asset for
eligibility purposes. HUD programs also address transportation problems by
subsidizing low-income families in both public and private sector housing.
HUD’s housing voucher and certificate programs help over 1.4 million
families pay the rent for apartments in the private market. This portable form
of assistance helps families locate near jobs.
Two Administration housing initiatives focus on improving employment
outcomes for low-income families. The Moving to Opportunity demonstration program combines counseling with voucher assistance to help families
move from high-poverty public housing projects to private housing in lowpoverty areas. The Welfare-to-Work voucher program provides housing
206 | Economic Report of the President

subsidies and services to families eligible for or recently leaving TANF to help
adults in the family obtain and keep jobs. Preliminary evidence from a
Moving to Opportunity program in Baltimore suggests that the program also
helps children by improving their educational outcomes.

Rural Communities
Like the central cities, many of America’s rural communities face high rates
of poverty and unemployment. But these communities also face a number of
unique problems. First, they tend to have smaller, less diversified economies
than do the central cities and thus can be severely affected by the closing
of only one or two industrial plants. Second, many rural communities are
geographically isolated from major markets, making it hard for residents to
find jobs and for businesses to reach their customers. Third, rural communities often offer little in the way of public transportation, so that
commuting problems are likely to be more acute than in urban areas.
Although recent advances in telecommunications promise to reduce some of
this disadvantage, rural communities also lag behind urban communities in
access to this technology. Finally, rural governments often lack the economies
of scale needed to make investments in public services economical.
A variety of agencies and programs exist to help these communities. Technical assistance, grants, and loans offered through the Rural Utilities Service
provide assistance with basic infrastructure needs such as electricity, telecommunications, and water and waste facilities. The Rural Housing Service
helps rural communities build and renovate community facilities and
housing. Its programs provide housing assistance to families with moderate
and low incomes; it also helps communities develop and improve facilities
such as fire stations, libraries, and hospitals.
The Rural Business-Cooperative Service cultivates partnerships between the
private sector and community-based organizations. It also provides technical
assistance and funding for projects that generate employment. Rural businesses
also get a boost from the Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community initiative, as many of the areas these programs target are in rural communities.
Finally, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is addressing the digital divide by
providing funds to help schools and libraries and rural medical facilities in lowincome communities develop modern communications infrastructure.
At the regional level the Administration has supported several initiatives
addressing the problems of rural development, including a Task Force on the
Economic Development of the Southwest Border, the Mississippi Delta
regional initiative, and the Denali Commission in Alaska. These initiatives
coordinate Federal, State, and local development assistance to areas with
historically high poverty rates and limited employment opportunities.

Results
These programs, coupled with the strong national economy and policies
aimed at making work pay, have led to substantial improvements in the quality
of life for those living in central cities and rural areas. The unemployment rate in
the Nation’s central cities fell from 8.2 percent in 1993 to 5.3 percent in 1999,
while unemployment in rural areas declined from 5.9 percent to 3.7 percent.
Increased employment has meant reductions in poverty and increases in median
incomes (Chart 5-6). As noted, the poverty rates in both central cities and nonmetropolitan areas fell significantly between 1993 and 1999, with the largest
drop in central-city rates (2.1 percentage points) occurring in the last year. This
change was so large and affected so many people that it accounted for
80 percent of the total reduction in poverty from 1998 to 1999. The median
household income in the central city has also increased, rising 5 percent in real
terms from 1998 to 1999—more than double the 2.1 percent increase in the
median income in metropolitan areas as a whole. The gains in income for
African Americans were particularly striking. After adjusting for inflation, the
median income for African-American households in central cities increased
by 13.9 percent between 1998 and 1999. These economic gains have been
accompanied by a decline in the number of people on welfare. Caseloads in the
largest central-city areas declined by 40.6 percent between 1994 and 1999.
Increases in the median household income in rural areas were less dramatic than
those in the cities, rising just 0.9 percent in real terms between 1998 and 1999.

208 | Economic Report of the President

Despite these clear improvements in the well-being of our poorest
communities, much remains to be done. Poverty rates and unemployment
are still too high. It is too soon to judge the effectiveness of the Administration’s community-based policies, but reaching out to these communities
demonstrates a willingness to seek creative solutions to some of the Nation’s
most pressing problems.

Education in the New Economy
What students learn in school is crucial in determining their future
options and, more broadly, in enhancing the productivity of the Nation.
Thus it is imperative that all children be given adequate opportunities to
learn. To this end the United States has invested in a quality public education
system. Unfortunately, not all communities can afford to invest equally in
the education of their children, and the Federal Government has worked to
reduce this inequality. And by promoting educational innovations such as
more challenging curricula and the increased use of technology in the classroom, the Federal Government is working to improve the quality of
schooling for all children.
Investments in human capital play an important role in the New
Economy. Last year’s Report focused on the demand for educated workers
and on postsecondary education and training. This year’s Report examines
America’s public elementary and secondary schools—institutions that are
also important to the development of our future work force. Although many
factors go into producing a quality education, and parents, families, and
communities surely rank among the most important, the discussion here
focuses on the components of the education system more directly under the
control of Federal, State, and local governments. This discussion highlights
the effects of class size, teacher quality, and school infrastructure and
equipment. Strengthening these inputs to the education process is key to
improving educational outcomes.

A Role for Federal Education Policy
To prepare America’s young people to join the New Economy, innovations
must be sought in the provision of education that will increase its quality for
all. These innovations include a committed effort to reduce class size,
investments in teachers, higher standards for schools, the widespread
adoption of computer technologies in the classroom, and new charter schools
that provide parents with a choice in their children’s education but retain
public accountability.

Chapter 5

| 209

The Federal Government has long sought to improve access to education
for the Nation’s poorest children and to help States ensure that their public
schools are of high quality. Federal funds are used primarily to help
implement needed reforms, expand new programs, provide access to new
technology, and pay part of the cost of education for students with disabilities. Many Federal education programs are targeted to schools and
school districts serving students from lower income families. By directing
funds to these important areas, the Federal investment in schooling can have
an impact greater than the expenditure itself would suggest.
In the United States, primary responsibility for elementary and secondary
education rests with the States and with local school districts. Excluding
school-based health and nutrition programs, the Federal Government
provides just a little more than 6 percent of all funding for kindergarten,
elementary, and secondary education. However, this figure belies the
disproportionately large impact that Federal dollars can have on schools.
Federal spending in the poorest schools reduces inequalities across school
districts but does not fully compensate for the overall pattern of funding
disparities created by differences in local property tax bases and State funding
levels (Chart 5-7). A study of 1994–95 data found that the Federal
Government spent more than four times as much per student in the poorest
quartile of school districts as in the wealthiest quartile, but that the wealthiest
school districts still had the highest level of expenditure per student.

210 | Economic Report of the President

The largest Federal education program for kindergarten through
12th grade (K-12) is Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act,
which provides funds to schools based on the number of poor children and
the child poverty rate in the local area. Since passage of this legislation in
1965, these funds have been targeted to schools serving the poorest children.
The ability to target funding to the most needy schools improved significantly after 1994, when the distribution of funding began to be based on
newly available biennial data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census on child
poverty in smaller geographic areas (such as counties). In the 1997–98
academic year, 96 percent of those schools with the highest poverty levels
received Title I funds, up from 79 percent in 1993–94. In 1997–98 the
highest-poverty quartile of school districts received 43 percent of all Federal
funds for K-12 education and 50 percent of Title I funds—amounts that
reflect the share of the Nation’s poor children in these districts (49 percent).
At the same time, these school districts received less than a quarter of all State
and local funds. Clearly, Federal funds in general and Title I funds in
particular are a critical resource for improving equality in education.

Reducing Class Size
For decades the merits of various educational spending programs,
including those aimed at reducing class size, have been the subject of
much debate. Are they in fact effective in improving student achievement?
Mounting evidence is showing that smaller classes are beneficial, especially
for disadvantaged students and those in the early grades.
The most compelling evidence comes from the Project STAR (StudentTeacher Achievement Ratio) experiment in Tennessee in the late 1980s. To
determine to what extent smaller classes improve academic outcomes,
Tennessee authorized and financed an experiment that randomly assigned
students and teachers in kindergarten through third grade to classes with a
standard number of students (22–25) or to smaller classes (13–17 students).
The results showed better performance for children in the smaller classes:
these children did better on standardized tests of reading and math than
students in larger classes.
A follow-up study showed that the students enrolled in smaller classes in
the early grades continued to do better on standardized tests in middle
school than other students. These students were also more likely to take
college-entrance exams in high school. The results were especially strong for
minority students. For example, white students in general are more likely to
take a college-entrance exam than African-American students. But when the
probabilities were calculated for white and African-American students who
had been placed in small classes in elementary school, this difference
narrowed substantially. Some 46 percent of white students and 40 percent of
Chapter 5

| 211

African-American students who had been in small classes took a collegeentrance exam; the corresponding figures for students in standard-size
classes were 45 percent and 32 percent, respectively.
The quality of the Tennessee experiment’s design and the outcomes it
generated persuaded many scholars that reductions in class size can improve
educational outcomes for children. Teachers in smaller classes can spend
more time on individual instruction and review, and less on student
discipline and routine administrative tasks, than teachers in larger classes.
Teachers of small classes are also more likely to get to know their students,
interact with them frequently on a one-to-one basis, and provide frequent,
in-depth feedback. Results are now emerging from programs in other States
that reinforce the conclusions of the Tennessee study.
In 1998 the Administration proposed a 7-year initiative to reduce class
sizes in grades 1–3. Its goal is an average of 18 students per class nationwide.
In its first 2 years the program enabled school districts to hire an estimated
29,000 new teachers, reducing class size for 1.7 million children. Smaller
classes are expensive, however. One study estimates that reducing class size in
grades 1–3 nationwide to an average of 18 students would cost $5 billion per
year. Despite the expense, the expected gains in students’ future earnings
appear to be large enough to make the investment worthwhile.

The Importance of Teachers
The quality of teachers may play an even more important role than class
size in improving student outcomes. Parents, students, and professional
educators agree that teacher effectiveness is an important factor in student
achievement, and several recent studies find that differences among teachers
have significant effects. Further, these analyses show that some measurable
characteristics, such as holding a master’s degree, are not necessarily
indicative of a teacher’s ability to enhance student performance. And
although a teacher’s effectiveness seems to increase with experience in the first
years of teaching, these gains to seniority are not significant beyond 3 to
5 years. These results suggest that much of the difference in teachers’
effectiveness stems from variations in attributes that are hard to measure,
such as talent and motivation.
Many schools are finding it difficult to attract and retain highly effective
teachers. Some of this difficulty likely stems from the existing pay scales in
public schools. In the last several decades, teachers’ salaries have fallen relative
to those in other occupations. A large majority of public school teachers are
women, and for women in particular the rewards of teaching have shrunk by
comparison with other opportunities. In 1940 fewer than 32 percent of

212 | Economic Report of the President

women with a college degree earned more than the average female teacher.
By 1990 this fraction had risen to 55 percent. This trend continued throughout the 1990s, with starting salaries in most occupations increasing at a
much faster rate than starting salaries in the teaching profession. One study
found that from 1994 to 1998 the average salary for persons with a master’s
degree in nonteaching fields increased by 32 percent in real terms, while the
real increase in the average salary for teachers was less than 1 percent. Other
factors that affect job quality for teachers, such as crowded classrooms, unsafe
schools, and limited opportunities for professional development and
advancement, also affect schools’ ability to attract and retain teachers.
The challenge of attracting and retaining effective teachers in sufficient
numbers will become particularly acute in coming years. Between July 2000
and July 2008, the number of children aged 5–17 will rise by nearly
1 million, significantly increasing the need for teachers nationwide. Yet in
this same period about 750,000 teachers are expected to retire, and many
others are likely to leave the field to pursue other occupations. Given these
statistics, the United States will need an estimated 2 million new teachers in
the next 8 years. The demand for teachers will be further heightened by mandates to reduce class size. Meeting the target of 18 students per class in grades
1–3 will require staffing an estimated 100,000 additional classrooms.
These increases in the demand for teachers will make it increasingly
difficult to maintain consistently high teacher quality in all classrooms. The
magnitude of the challenge is already becoming clear. In 1996 California
began a massive program designed to reduce class size in the early grades
(K–3). Expenditures for the program, which seeks a statewide class size
reduction from an average of 28 students to a maximum of 20, are running
$1.5 billion per year. The State has been largely successful in achieving its
goal: by the 1998–99 school year, more than 92 percent of California’s
students in the targeted grades were in classes of 20 or fewer students. But
the share of fully credentialed teachers instructing these classes fell from
98 percent in the 1995–96 school year to 87 percent in 1998–99. This
decline indicates that the demand for well-trained teachers is outstripping the
supply and that continued increases in this demand will likely make it more
difficult for schools to find qualified instructors. Ultimately, the benefits of
nationwide reductions in class size will depend on the ability to attract and
retain greater numbers of talented teachers (Box 5-2).
This Administration has supported investments in teachers. Its Class Size
Reduction Initiative requires that teachers hired with Federal funds available
under the program be fully certified. The initiative allows school districts to
spend up to 25 percent of their allocated funds on professional development
and testing for new teachers. Districts that have met the appropriate goals for

Box 5-2. Rewarding Effective Teachers
Traditionally, teacher salaries have been based on education levels,
experience, and responsibilities, leaving school systems little room to
reward the most effective teachers. Recently some schools and school
districts have experimented with alternative, performance-based pay
systems. These new methods may help improve the quality of instruction in several ways. First, by establishing specific criteria for
evaluation, performance-based awards can help clarify and prioritize
goals, thus providing better guidance for teachers. The awards may
also provide teachers with additional motivation to work to achieve
these goals. Tying teacher compensation to performance may also help
attract talented people to the teaching profession and retain them, if
they know that their hard work and skills will be rewarded. But
although performance-based pay systems may offer new ways to
reward exemplary teachers, they should not substitute for appropriate
baseline salaries.
To be effective, performance-based pay systems must be carefully
designed. Because student achievement depends on many factors that
teachers cannot control, such as family circumstances and previous
education, fair, performance-based systems should reward teachers
for gains in student achievement rather than for absolute levels of performance. Furthermore, because student learning involves cooperative
effort, incentives must be designed to create a cooperative, not a competitive, environment for teachers. For example, team-spiritedness
might be enhanced by basing a portion of the awards on schoolwide
rather than class-by-class achievement. Finally, the standards used to
assess performance must be carefully constructed. If student outcomes
are to be the basis of a performance-based pay system, measures such
as gains in student test scores, increases in attendance, and increases
in graduation rates should be considered—and they have been in a
few schools.
The design of these school-based performance awards systems
varies widely. In some cases the awards are given directly to individual
teachers; in others the rewards benefit all teachers in a school equally.
In the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district in North Carolina, for
example, awards were based on a broad array of student outcomes
including subject mastery, dropout rates, and absenteeism. Schools
received points for meeting annual improvement goals, and teachers
in these schools benefited directly: in the highest-performing schools
(classified as “exemplary”), each teacher received $1,000. Teachers in
“outstanding” schools (those with slightly lower gains) received $750.
In contrast to this equal division of awards, the program implemented
at the Vaughn charter school in Los Angeles offers awards that vary

Box 5-2.—continued
substantially from teacher to teacher. Teachers at Vaughn are provided
the opportunity to receive cash bonuses in each semester for effective
performance in a number of areas, including the teaching of specific
academic subjects and more general skills such as classroom management and lesson planning. Performance is assessed through
self-evaluations, peer review, and reviews by administrators. For a
veteran teacher, performance-related awards can total up to $13,100
per year.
A nationwide program that can also provide incentives to teachers
beyond the traditional pay scales has been developed by the National
Board for Professional Teaching Standards. The board has established
distinct programs of national board certification, which have drawn the
support of policymakers and educators alike. Many States and local
school districts are providing incentives to teachers to complete this certification process.To become certified, teachers must compile an extensive
portfolio of their work, including classroom videotaping, and take a fullday exam. Once certified, teachers are encouraged to act as mentors to
new teachers and to support colleagues seeking such certification.
Studies of their effects on teachers have found that many award
systems that are based on schools’ performance help improve cooperation among teachers, but that these programs vary in their
effectiveness in increasing teacher motivation. Teachers in many programs also reported that they feel increased pressure at work and
work longer hours. Systems that reward individual teachers also have
positive aspects. The system at Vaughn has helped attract new recruits,
and many current teachers were pleased with the program. However,
some problems were also encountered. One teacher complained that
the peer review process, which result in differing amounts being paid
to teachers, “pits teacher against teacher. These difficulties indicate
”
that additional research and experimentation might be useful in
arriving at the best compensation strategies.

reducing class size in the early grades have the option of using their entire
allocation for activities to improve teacher quality. The Teacher Quality
Enhancement Grant program helps States improve the quality of teaching.
To date it has helped prepare about 20,000 new teachers for high-need
school districts, and it will help prepare many thousands more in coming
years. Funding for another Federal professional development program—the
largest in the budget (and currently called the Eisenhower Professional
Development Program)—increased from $275 million in 1993 to $335
million in fiscal 2000.

The Need for Modern Schools
The physical condition of classrooms may also affect the quality of the
educational experience and, in the most severe cases, the safety of students.
Communities across the country are struggling to address the problems of
aging schools. In 1999 the average public school was 40 years old, and
schools in largely poor or minority districts were even older. Many of these
aging buildings have outdated electrical systems that must be upgraded for
computers, and asbestos in the walls of some schools increases the cost of
such upgrades. Some buildings need to be renovated extensively to accommodate disabled students. Many schools will need more classrooms as
enrollments increase and average class size is reduced, putting additional
pressure on aging facilities.
The National Center for Education Statistics estimates that getting
America’s schools into good physical condition will require an investment of
$127 billion. Some 39 percent of our public schools already have temporary
additions, about one-fifth of which are in less than adequate condition.
Schools with a relatively high proportion of poor and minority students are
more likely than other public schools to have temporary buildings, and thus
will have the most difficulty housing additional classes.

New Educational Technology and Internet Access
Today’s workers are increasingly required to be computer literate. Schools
must be able to teach students the skills they will need to work with computers and other new technologies. In addition, Internet access
is becoming an important classroom resource, helping students learn by
connecting them to libraries, museums, and educational materials around
the world. Internet access has become increasingly widespread in American
classrooms over the past 8 years, and Federal programs, especially the E-rate
program discussed below, have played a large role. The E-rate program
provides up to $2.25 billion per year to schools and libraries to offset the cost
of telecommunications services, Internet access, and internal connections.
Tremendous strides have been made in connecting public schools to the
Internet (Chart 5-8). With the help of the E-rate program, the number of
public schools with Internet access nearly tripled between 1994 and 1999,
and by 1999 some 95 percent of all public schools were on line. Increases in
Internet connectivity within classrooms were even more dramatic. In 1994
only 3 percent of public school classrooms had Internet hookups; by 1999
that figure had risen to 63 percent.
The Federal Government has helped local school districts make the transition to the digital age, committing $5.7 billion over the last 3 years through
its E-rate program to connect school and library computers to each other and
216 | Economic Report of the President

to the Internet (Box 5-3). These funds have targeted schools with a high
proportion of low-income students. Schools where 75 percent or more of
students are eligible for free school lunches receive approximately 10 times as
much funding per student from the program as schools with the smallest
percentage of such students.
Other Federal programs have also helped schools purchase new educational
technology. In addition to the E-rate program, in fiscal 2000 the Federal
Government spent $766 million on education technology programs through
Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Some $425
million of this was provided through the Technology Literacy Challenge
Fund. Schools also used portions of their Title I funding to invest in technology. A large share of these funds was used to purchase computers and
train staffing using new technology. During the 1997–98 school year, Federal
funds paid for one-fourth of all new computers in schools (Chart 5-9).
Federal funds were especially important in helping elementary schools with
large numbers of low-income students acquire technology, accounting for
nearly 60 percent of new computers in these schools.
For computers to improve the quality of instruction, teachers must know
how to use them and how to integrate them into the classroom. A recent
study found that only 53 percent of all public school teachers with computers or Internet access used these resources for classroom instruction. Teachers

Box 5-3. Reducing the Digital Divide
Since 1993, computer use in America has grown at an enormous
rate, revolutionizing the way Americans communicate, work, and do
business. Access to a computer—and knowing how to use it—are
increasingly important for success in today’s society. Currently more
than half of all U.S. households have computers, and more than
two-fifths have Internet access at home. But computer use varies
greatly with income and education. People in households earning
more than $75,000 per year are almost four times as likely to use the
Internet as those in households earning less than $15,000 per year.
Adults with college degrees are more than eight times as likely to use
the Internet as adults who have not completed high school. Race is also
a factor. African Americans and Hispanics are substantially less likely
than white and Asian Americans to use the Internet. A recent study
finds that income and education explain only around half of this
difference. Individuals from disadvantaged groups that already face
obstacles in the workplace are at risk of falling even further behind if
they lack computer know-how.
There is encouraging news, however. Notable changes are occurring
among school-age children, suggesting that the widespread availability
of computers in the classroom is playing a role. Across all income and
demographic groups, Internet usage among children aged 9–17 is
higher than the national average. And over the last few years Internet
usage has grown faster among African-American and Hispanic children
than among white children, and faster among children in households
earning less than $35,000 per year than among children from
wealthier households.

who have received more professional development in using computers and
the Internet, and teachers in schools with relatively few low-income students,
were the most likely to report using computers and the Internet.
Newer teachers were also more likely to use computers “a lot” to create
instructional materials.
Despite the growth in the number of classrooms with computers, only
one-third of teachers with access to computers and the Internet said that they
felt well or very well prepared to use them. These results clearly show that
more investment in teacher preparation is needed. The Federal Government
has addressed this issue through its Preparing Tomorrow’s Teachers to Use
Technology grant program. This program supports 352 partnerships among
colleges, educational agencies, and nonprofit organizations, providing
training for teachers in integrating technology into the classroom.
218 | Economic Report of the President

Standards and Accountability
Over the last decade, changes have taken place in America’s public schools
that go far beyond increasing the investments just described. Among
the most important changes are new ways of improving accountability for
educational outcomes.
Initiatives that establish clear performance outcomes and systematically
test student progress aim to help teachers and students focus their efforts on
those areas needing the most work. Spurred in part by legislation passed in
1994 (the Improving America’s Schools Act and the Goals 2000: Educate
America Act), State after State has implemented standards for what students
need to learn. As of October 2000, 48 States and the District of Columbia
had adopted such standards; the majority of States adopting standards have
done so since 1994.
The establishment of these standards has been followed by an increase in
standards-based assessment. Forty-eight States and the District of Columbia
now administer tests to assess student performance relative to these standards
in reading and math, and many States do so for science and social studies as
well. Thirty-six States currently publish some form of report card for each
school, measuring school performance against a number of indicators,
including student assessment test scores.
Both the standards themselves and the assessments based on them have
been controversial. Many argue that classroom instruction is now geared
Chapter 5

| 219

toward preparing students for the exams—that teachers are, in effect, “teaching to the test.” However, when implemented correctly, such assessments can
help improve the quality of the educational experience—and educational
outcomes—in several ways. First, tests that are challenging and well constructed can help raise the expectations of students, teachers, and parents.
These expectations can motivate all parties to improve their performance.
Second, by clearly outlining the material to be covered and the degree of
mastery required, these measures of accountability may help teachers focus
on what are generally agreed to be the most important topics. Finally, these
tests provide parents, teachers, and students with information that highlights
those areas in which students are less than fully prepared.
The Federal Government has played an important role in the standards
movement. Since 1994 it has devoted more than $2.6 billion to helping
agencies in every State implement school reforms through the Goals 2000
Act. Even before that legislation was passed, the government supported the
development of voluntary national standards that States could use as a basis
for their own standards. In addition, the Improving America’s Schools Act
tightened Title I accountability at the school and the district levels by requiring States to hold students in Title I schools to the same challenging
standards as other students and to assess all students in Title I schools against
these standards.
The Federal Government has also increased its efforts to track student
progress, undertaking evaluations that help in assessing State-level reforms.
In recent years the National Assessment of Educational Progress has been
expanded to track student performance in each State. Thanks to these assessments a valuable set of baseline indicators now exists for measuring student
progress that can help researchers and education professionals evaluate the
effectiveness of new policies (Box 5-4). The Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act Amendments of 1997 further require that children with
disabilities be included in State- and district-level assessment programs, so
that the performance of these children will be measured as well.

Increasing Public School Choice
A persistent thread during the last decade of educational change has been
the call for parental choice in their children’s education. Allowing parents to
choose among different public school models would likely benefit students
by allowing them to choose the method of instruction that offers the best fit
for their child’s learning skills and interests. In responding to parental
demand, educators would offer the most effective educational models
and innovations.
Many States have responded to the demand for choice by allowing parents,
teachers, and other interested parties to establish independent public schools
220 | Economic Report of the President

Box 5-4. Ensuring That Gains Are Maintained
Effective teachers, adequate facilities, and well-constructed
standards can help students learn more. However, these investments
are of little value unless students retain what they have learned.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that knowledge and skills
deteriorate while children are away from school, especially during
summer vacations. Drawing their conclusions from an analysis of
many previous studies, one group of researchers found that children
lost an average of a month’s worth of learning over summer break.
Much of the Federal Government’s role in education policy
has been aimed at helping children in low-income families receive a
quality education, thus mitigating the effect of family income on
schooling outcomes. When children are not in school, it appears that
family characteristics play an important role in determining learning.
Many studies have noted that the deterioration of skills associated with
summer vacation was greatest for children in low-income families.
These differences appear to be particularly large for reading: students
from middle-class families experienced a small gain in test scores
over the summer, whereas students from low-income families fell
behind. The result was a gap between the two groups in reading skills
equal to approximately 3 months of schooling.
These differences suggest that public schools can do even more to
help children from low-income families succeed. One possibility is to
lengthen the school year. If students attended school year-round, there
would be less opportunity for skills to deteriorate. Alternatively,
summer enrichment programs targeting low-income communities can
help poor children overcome some of the disadvantages they face at
home and in their neighborhoods. In addition to changes in the school
calendar, communities can offer after-school enrichment programs.
Both after-school and summer learning programs can also be a
boon for working parents, particularly for lower income parents who
may have difficulty arranging alternative care for their children. Not
only can such programs assure parents that their children are in a safe,
enriching environment, but they can also allow working parents
to invest in their jobs and gain important labor market skills that can
further benefit their children through increases in family income and
exits from welfare.
The Administration has worked to assist local communities develop
after-school activities through its 21st Century Community Learning
Centers Program. This program has funded more than 3,600 afterschool and summer programs. Preliminary evaluations indicate that
these programs have had beneficial impacts on the academic and
social behaviors of participating children.

chartered by State or local education agencies. These charter schools are
given autonomy over their operations and are exempted from certain State
and local regulations (although not from standards-based assessment) in
exchange for strict public accountability and results. Charter schools have
great potential as laboratories of educational innovation, allowing individual
schools to explore a variety of educational methods while remaining
publicly accountable.
The Administration has strongly supported the development of charter
schools, having overseen the creation of the Public Charter Schools Program
in 1994 and passage of the Charter School Expansion Act in 1998. In 1991
Minnesota became the first State to allow charter schools, and by the end of
1999, 36 States and the District of Columbia had made provisions allowing
for such schools. At the beginning of the 2000–01 school year, 2,069 charter
schools were operating nationwide, up from just 34 at the start of the
1993–94 school year.

Helping Students Make the Transition
from Secondary School to College
Federal programs are also helping students make the transition from
secondary school to college or work. The Gaining Early Awareness and
Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) bring middle schools
with a high proportion of poor students together with local colleges and
universities. These partnerships helped prepare more than 250,000 students
for college in fiscal 2000. The programs provide entire classes of students and
their families with academic enrichment programs as well as information
about choosing a college, applying for financial aid, and preparing for college
entry; in some cases they will also provide college scholarships. The TRIO
programs such as Upward Bound currently serve 730,000 low-income, firstgeneration college and disabled students, helping them prepare for and
succeed in college. And after 6 years of receiving seed money from the
Federal Government, all States have instituted local school-to-work
programs to benefit secondary school students as they prepare for
their working lives.
Over the past 8 years, Federal assistance to Americans investing in their
college education has also increased. Direct Pell grants have risen from a
maximum of $2,300 per student per year to $3,300. The HOPE Scholarship
and Lifetime Learning tax credits have also reduced the cost of education
for American families. Fees and interest rates on student loans have been
reduced, and restructuring the Federal student loan program has saved
billions in taxpayer dollars.

222 | Economic Report of the President

Innovation and Access in Health Care
The American health care system today reflects the successes and the
promise of the New Economy. Americans are healthier now than they were
just 10 years ago. Between 1990 and 1998 life expectancy at birth rose
approximately 1.3 years, and life expectancy at age 65 rose more than half
a year. The rate of chronic disability among the elderly declined by
14.5 percent between 1982 and 1994. Medical innovations are in part
responsible for these improvements, as are factors such as improved nutrition
and exercise. Yet health care continues to present challenges that demand an
ongoing role for the government.
A stream of technological innovations has raised the quality of care and
improved health outcomes. Innovative diagnostic tools and new treatments
have improved the medical system’s ability to treat many diseases and conditions. These innovations enable medical professionals to identify health
problems more accurately and to offer treatments that are less invasive and
promise better outcomes. One good example is the use of drug therapy to
treat some conditions that formerly required surgery.
These improvements in treatment are expensive, however, and overall
health care costs have risen as people demand more and better care. The
upward pressures on expenditures are exacerbated by traditional fee-forservice insurance, which offers weak incentives for patients or providers to
limit their health care consumption. Managed care has evolved as an organizational innovation to control rising health care expenditures. It attempts to
create incentives for both patients and providers to make efficient health care
consumption choices—to utilize treatments, especially costly technological
innovations, only when they are medically appropriate.
However, health insurance coverage remains a problem. Around
42.6 million Americans have no health insurance coverage, often because
they cannot afford it. Thus the government has a continuing role to play in
providing health insurance to those in need of assistance. The Administration
recognizes the importance of health insurance and has worked to extend
coverage to those most in need of it. The State Children’s Health Insurance
Program, for instance, has extended health insurance to an estimated
2.5 million children nationwide.

Technological Innovations
Dramatic innovations in medical care, often driven by computer technology
or research in fields such as biotechnology, have led to more accurate diagnostic techniques, better surgical procedures, and treatments for previously
untreatable conditions. Evidence indicates that technological innovations
have been beneficial as a whole. One study found that the lifetime value of
Chapter 5

| 223

improved health (including longer life) attributable to improved medical
care outweighed the significant costs. Nevertheless, examples of innovations
are particularly revealing, because aggregate studies are unable to fully
measure the impact of these innovations.
For example, by providing very high resolution anatomical and pathological images, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables much more
precise diagnosis of a number of diseases and conditions than traditional
computed tomography (CT) scanning. In the 1990s MRI technology and
computers were further combined to create “open MRI” systems, which can
be used to provide continuous pictures to guide surgeons during brain operations. Modern techniques for abdominal aneurysms illustrate how surgical
procedures have improved. The development in the 1990s of endovascular
surgery, a minimally invasive procedure that uses intraluminal stents
(scaffolding-like wire-mesh devices used to prop open artery walls), has led
to remarkable improvements over open surgery to repair abdominal
aneurysms. Experts reporting on the results of clinical trials have testified
that endovascular surgery reduces operating procedure time by 20 percent,
reduces blood loss by two-thirds, halves the number of patients requiring a
transfusion, and reduces intensive care unit time from 3.5 days to less than
1 day and the hospital length of stay from 9.3 days to 3.4 days. Mortality is
comparable to that from open surgery, but endovascular surgery produces
only half the number of severe treatment-related adverse effects.
In addition, innovative techniques and treatments now allow physicians to
treat some previously untreatable conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease,
which affects some 4 million Americans. A new drug therapy that enhances
cognitive function and delays the progress of the disease was introduced
in 1993, the result of advances in neurobiological research. New drug
treatments for other conditions have also come on the market. Facilitated by
the streamlining of the drug approval process in 1997, the number of new
drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration that are significant
improvements over existing drugs grew from an average of 12.5 per year in
1990–93 and 13.3 in 1994–96 to 14.7 in 1997–99.
Innovations that produce better care can save money by reducing the
number of medical inputs required to produce the same or a better health
outcome. The development of minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery,
made possible by advanced digital technology, has reduced the costs of
abdominal surgery. Laparoscopy has reduced the postoperative hospital stay
for gall bladder surgery by up to 6 days, and the time patients need to
take off work by a month, reducing overall costs. Drug therapies can prevent
peptic ulcers or substitute for expensive abdominal surgery for severe
ulcers, and new psychotropic drugs may keep many people who suffer
from depression out of the hospital and reduce or eliminate the need for
extensive psychotherapy.
224 | Economic Report of the President

However, many innovations actually raise the cost of health care because
they require more medical staff time and more expensive equipment than
traditional treatments in order to produce better outcomes. MRI scans, for
example, are extremely expensive, as are certain types of highly innovative
brain surgery. Intensive cardiac interventions are being offered with increasing frequency. Among Medicare patients, the use of coronary bypass surgery
tripled between 1984 and 1991. Catheterization procedures quadrupled, and
angioplasty use rose 15-fold. As a result, the cost of treating a heart attack
rose 36 percent faster than inflation between 1984 and 1991. But life
expectancy after a heart attack rose by 8 months during the same period.
Overall, innovations in acute interventions accounted for about 55 percent
of the decline in mortality from heart attacks between 1975 and 1995.
Both interventions that lower costs and interventions that increase them
can contribute to higher total expenditure. Cost-saving innovations may
lower the cost per patient of treating a condition, but if more people then use
them, or use them more often, total costs are likely to increase. Innovations
that raise per-patient costs unambiguously raise the total cost of health care,
even if the number of treatments does not rise. More frequent use of these
expensive new procedures raises costs even further. Treatments for previously
untreatable conditions also raise overall health care expenditure.

Organizational Innovations
to Control Health Care Costs
Medical innovations have been the primary reason for the rapid growth in
health care expenditure in the last two decades, accounting for more than
half of the long-term increase. These technological innovations have exacerbated the dilemma of providing high-quality care while holding costs at a
reasonable level. To balance these conflicting goals, health care decisionmakers must meet two challenges: they must determine when improved
outcomes justify the additional expense, and they must structure the health
care system so that it uses medical technology in the most cost-effective way.
Because health insurers pay for most health care, the incentives embedded
in the health insurance system strongly influence the efficiency of the entire
health care system. Before the 1990s the predominant health insurance
arrangement was that known as fee-for-service. Under this system patients
face low copayments, and providers are reimbursed on a cost-based method
after each medical encounter. The system provides those who determine a
course of medical treatment with great flexibility and satisfies health care
consumers’ desire to obtain the highest-quality care available (including
expensive technologies). From a physician’s point of view, fee-for-service
plans are desirable because they take into account the complex nature of
medical needs and the variety of appropriate responses available. However,
Chapter 5

| 225

because reimbursements are based strictly on utilization, patients and
medical personnel using these plans have few direct incentives to use the
most cost-effective technologies and practices. Physicians have incentives to
overprescribe services and procedures, and patients have incentives to let them.
To address these problems, managed care has introduced an incentive
structure that encourages providers to choose services more efficiently.
Managed care employs two mechanisms, one financial and one nonfinancial, to alter providers’ incentives and treatment choices. The first is
capitation, a method of payment that gives providers a fixed payment for
each patient in a risk pool. Under this arrangement, providers have a strong
incentive to reduce treatment costs, because they retain whatever is left
over from the payment after all medical treatment is provided. The second
mechanism is utilization management, which includes establishing treatment
guidelines, controlling access to specialists, and monitoring physicians’
performance to reduce low-valued services.
Managed care organizations can influence the expected profitability of new
technology by reducing reimbursement and restricting utilization. When
they do, hospitals and physicians are likely to acquire and use fewer new and
expensive technologies. By balancing patients’ desire for better health care
with incentives for providers to reduce costs, managed care can encourage
more cost-effective use of technology while promoting innovations that
improve health and keep costs in line.
At the same time that it seeks this balance, however, managed care creates
a different set of problems. These include incentives for health insurance
plans to select only healthy patients and to underprovide services. Managed
care organizations have a strong incentive to sign up healthy patients whose
health care costs will be low. This incentive can override the goal of improving efficiency. Furthermore, providers have an incentive to restrict even
cost-effective services because they receive no additional revenue from providing them. Because patients frequently lack information about the
effectiveness of alternative treatments and are thus unable to act as knowledgeable consumers, this problem can be severe (Box 5-5). As a result,
patients may not get expensive but medically necessary services. Thus
patients need meaningful protections against incentives that lead to too little
care being provided.
The optimal reimbursement design, in terms of offering incentives that
balance cost and access, likely lies somewhere between fee-for-service and
capitation plans. Such a plan would involve partial cost sharing by providers
and patients through copayments and coinsurance, but the ideal incentive
structure has not yet been identified. As managed care plans have evolved to
allow patients more choices, the plans’ ability to influence utilization has
diminished. Consolidation among physicians and hospitals in the 1990s
created intermediary organizations between providers and managed care
226 | Economic Report of the President

Box 5-5.The Rise of E-Health: On-Line Medical Information
The Internet is becoming an important source of medical information
for consumers, for at least two reasons. First, it empowers patients by
providing them with medical information that increases the value of
a medical appointment. Interactions with physicians are more efficient
if patients know what questions and concerns to raise beforehand.
Second, for general information the Internet offers an attractive
alternative to a costly consultation.
Tens of thousands of Internet websites provide medical and healthrelated information. About 60 million Americans searched for health
information on line in 1998, and that number was expected to increase
in 2000. An analysis of patient electronic inquiries to a university
dermatology department found that 40 percent of the inquiries could
be answered by a librarian, 28 percent could be answered by a physician
via e-mail, and only 27 percent required a visit with a physician.
Without the Internet many of these questions might not have been
asked or answered at all, and unnecessary visits might have occurred.
The Internet thus has the potential to effectively supplement the
physician’s role in providing medical information and thereby to
improve efficiency.
However, the websites currently available may present problems.
Not all on-line medical information is easily comprehensible to the lay
reader, and some sites raise conflict-of-interest issues. Although the
Internet can reduce the cost of obtaining medical information, it cannot
make information on complex medical issues understandable to all.
To the extent that it leads patients to self-diagnose and self-treat inappropriately, then, on-line information can be harmful. Furthermore, the
quality of information varies greatly, in part because commercial
interests can influence content. These problems can actually increase
the demands on physicians, who must spend time clarifying
misleading or misinterpreted information.
For these reasons the government has a role in overseeing and
regulating medical information websites. Several government agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug
Administration, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,
have taken the initiative either to provide information directly or to
provide links to reliable medical websites.

plans, so that fewer providers actually operate on a strict capitation basis.
For these reasons managed care plans at the beginning of the 21st century
differ markedly from the original managed care organizations, and the mechanisms that managed care uses to influence cost-effectiveness have been
significantly altered.
Chapter 5

| 227

Empirical evidence suggests that managed care was one of the factors
that slowed the growth in total health care expenditure in the 1990s
(Chart 5-10). Managed care slowed health care inflation not only by reducing the use of expensive procedures, but also by lowering physician and
hospital fees relative to fees under traditional insurance. However, further
reductions in utilization may not be feasible, simply because continued
reductions could prevent patients from receiving medically necessary treatment. In addition, managed care’s ability to restrict fees in the future
is uncertain, because fees cannot fall below costs. Whether reductions in
health care expenditure will continue is thus an open question, and recent
indications suggest that expenditures are again beginning to grow.
If technological progress remains the key factor behind rising health care
costs, managed care can continue to generate significant cost reductions only
by influencing the types of innovations that are used. If managed care can
increase the use of cost-saving innovations, the rate of growth may be slowed.
But if patients continue to demand access to the latest technology and are
willing to pay for any innovation regardless of its medical efficacy or costeffectiveness, managed care may be unwilling or unable to impose further
cost-saving innovations. Evidence of managed care’s impact on the types of
technology that are adopted and the rate at which innovations are introduced is mixed. Some researchers have found that increasing enrollment in
managed care organizations restricts the adoption and use of cost-increasing
technologies. One study, for example, found evidence that neonatal intensive

228 | Economic Report of the President

care units are introduced and used more cost-effectively in areas with a high
concentration of managed care organizations. However, another study found
evidence that health maintenance organizations (HMOs) slowed general
technological growth in the early and mid-1980s but had little effect on technological growth by the early 1990s. Thus managed care’s ability to influence
how innovations will affect costs remains to be seen.

Improving Health Insurance Coverage
Considering the progress that has been made in medical innovation, access
to high-quality health services is becoming increasingly valuable. Because
these services, particularly treatments for nonroutine health care, can be very
expensive, health insurance is the best means of ensuring that people receive
the care they need. The number and proportion of Americans without health
insurance decreased in 1999 for the first time since 1987, when comparable
statistics first became available. As has been noted, however, around
42.6 million Americans remained without insurance coverage. This section
discusses the current state of the health insurance system and some approaches
that have been considered for extending health insurance to more people.

The Health Insurance System
The American health insurance system relies primarily on employersponsored health plans. Employer-sponsored programs cover about
63 percent of all Americans, and 74 percent of all who are insured. One
reason for the prevalence of this type of group insurance is that the Federal
tax code favors it. The insurance premiums that firms pay on behalf of their
employees are not included in the employees’ taxable income. In addition,
certain arrangements, such as flexible spending accounts, allow employees to
make contributions toward their health care expenses with before-tax dollars.
The employer-sponsored insurance system offers several important
benefits. First, it encourages groups, especially large groups, to pool risks
effectively. In addition, firms can hire benefits administrators to evaluate
policies and ensure that quality plans are offered. Finally, insurance companies can offer large employers lower premiums, in part because economies
of scale reduce their administrative costs.
Because low-income individuals have a lower marginal tax rate and are less
likely to have insurance, the tax-preferred treatment of employer-sponsored
health insurance often does not provide them with significant benefits
(Chart 5-11). People who do not obtain health insurance through their
employer must buy insurance with after-tax dollars. This group includes not
only the unemployed but also people who work for employers that do not
offer health insurance. These groups are more likely to need a subsidy to be
able to purchase health insurance.
Chapter 5

| 229

People without employer-sponsored health insurance who do not qualify
for publicly funded programs must enter the individual insurance market in
order to obtain coverage. This market can present problems that limit affordable access. Some insurers may choose not to cover people with preexisting
health problems or may cover them but exclude the preexisting condition.
Insurers may also charge premiums based on an individual’s perceived risk.
For example, people with diabetes may have to pay significantly higher
premiums because they are more likely to experience health problems. In
some cases the premiums can become unaffordable. The fact that the cost of
administering policies is higher for individual than for group policies raises
the premiums for individuals still further.
Publicly provided health insurance programs—Medicare, Medicaid, and
SCHIP—are an important source of coverage for many people. Created in
1965, Medicare and Medicaid provide health insurance for the elderly,
people with disabilities, and low-income Americans. Over 39 million individuals received medical insurance through Medicare in 1999. Medicaid,
which offers Federal assistance to States in providing medical care to lowincome Americans, served more than 40 million people in 1998. Historically,
eligibility for Medicaid was linked to eligibility for welfare assistance—that
is, eligibility was primarily restricted to single-parent families with very low
incomes. In the late 1980s and the early and mid-1990s, Medicaid coverage
was gradually extended through a series of expansions. The 1996 Personal
230 | Economic Report of the President

Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act formally delinked
Medicaid from cash assistance eligibility and further extended it to cover
more low-income households, including two-parent families. In 1997 the
Federal Government created SCHIP to target the growing number of uninsured children in families with incomes that are too high for Medicaid but
not sufficient to cover the cost of private insurance. Through SCHIP, States
can provide eligible children with Medicaid coverage, coverage through a
separate non-Medicaid program, or a combination of both.
The likelihood that an individual will have health insurance and the source
of that insurance vary with income and other demographic characteristics
(Chart 5-12). Because Medicare covers virtually all elderly Americans, only
1.3 percent of this group were uninsured in 1999, compared with 17 percent of
the nonelderly. Among the nonelderly, those in low-income households are
more likely to be without insurance. Among nonelderly people in households
below the poverty line, 36 percent were uninsured in 1999. Medicaid was the
source of insurance for almost two-thirds of the non-elderly in this group who
had coverage, whereas 28 percent were covered by an employer’s plan. In contrast, 91 percent of nonelderly people in households with incomes above 300
percent of the poverty line were covered, and of these, 92 percent were covered
by an employer plan.
Part-time employees are less likely than full-time employees to be insured,
because employers often exclude part-time and temporary workers from

Chapter 5

| 231

their health insurance plans. Twenty-five percent of those in households with
only part-time workers were uninsured in 1999. Seventy-four percent of
adult workers employed in small businesses were insured, compared with
88 percent of those working in large firms, although some in both groups
were covered under another person’s policy. These figures reflect the fact that
small businesses are less likely to offer health benefits than large firms, possibly because small businesses have a large share of part-time workers. Health
insurance coverage also differs significantly across racial and ethnic groups.
Non-Hispanic whites are least likely to be uninsured (11 percent), compared
with African Americans (21 percent), Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders
(21 percent), and Hispanics (33 percent).
Lack of health insurance can be costly not just for individuals but for
society. The uninsured often obtain care in an emergency room rather than
in a physician’s office, and emergency room care is more expensive than
office visits. Because they often receive inadequate care, the uninsured tend
to have more severe health problems and are therefore more likely to require
more expensive care when they do seek treatment. Evidence indicates that
initiatives to expand Medicaid coverage have been associated with significant
increases in the use of primary care facilities and reductions in expensive and
avoidable hospitalizations. One recent study found that expanding Medicaid
eligibility was associated with a 22 percent decline in avoidable hospitalizations. The costs of hospital care for people who cannot pay are often
absorbed by providers, passed on to the insured through increases in the cost
of both health care and health insurance, or borne by taxpayers through tax
increases imposed to finance public hospitals and insurance programs.

Reforming Health Insurance
Proposals to expand health insurance coverage must be considered
carefully, because of the risk that unintended consequences can so severely
erode the existing system that the overall effect is to worsen coverage. Some
proposals, such as expanding tax deductions to all purchases of individual
insurance, might have such unintended consequences. To evaluate such proposals, this Report uses three measures: how much the proposal would reduce
the ranks of the uninsured, how much it would cost to insure each additional
individual, and how the prices and coverage of existing insurance plans
would be affected.
How many formerly uninsured people an initiative is able to cover
depends on how generous the subsidy is, how the subsidy is provided, and
who is eligible. For instance, a partial subsidy may fail to increase coverage,
because even modest out-of-pocket expenses can discourage participation,
especially by relatively healthy low-income families. Such families may
choose to forgo health insurance, unless it is made very inexpensive, to pay
232 | Economic Report of the President

for immediate necessities such as food and housing. Similarly, subsidies that
become available only after premiums are paid may not help people who lack
the funds to pay even these up-front costs. Further, a complex application
process may have the unintended side effect of keeping qualified individuals
from participating. Eligibility criteria must also be carefully designed, not
only to determine how many uninsured people can use the new subsidy, but
also to limit the number of people who already have insurance but are
eligible for the new subsidy.
The second measure—the subsidy’s total cost relative to the amount of
increased coverage—reflects how efficiently the proposal expands health
insurance coverage. This relative cost can be driven much higher if a new
subsidy crowds out existing insurance arrangements. This situation can occur
when people drop their current coverage in favor of a newly subsidized alternative, or when an employer, expecting its employees to use a newly offered
subsidy, stops offering insurance coverage. When crowding out occurs,
government expenditures go not just to the newly insured but also to people
who had coverage and are simply switching to the new plan to take advantage of the subsidy. If for these people the new subsidy is more generous than
their old subsidy, the cost to the government increases. If firms drop coverage
and employees do not get replacement coverage, the net increase in coverage
drops and the cost relative to increased coverage again rises.
Third, newly enacted subsidies may affect the prices and coverage of
existing insurance plans, for instance through adverse selection. Adverse
selection occurs when relatively healthy, low-risk individuals decide that the
cost of their current health insurance is greater than the benefits and therefore seek cheaper insurance or go without. As these people (whose health care
costs tend to be low) leave the original pool, the average cost of insuring each
person remaining in the pool increases. When the medical costs of treating
the remaining participants rise and premiums increase as a result, still more
people leave the pool. The result is a spiral of rising premiums and declining
enrollment, so that those who still wish to purchase health insurance sometimes find that the premiums are prohibitively high, and they may remain
(or become) uninsured.
Employer-sponsored group health insurance is a good basis for risk
pooling. Workers are attracted to a firm for many reasons, of which health
insurance is but one, and so a wide range of health risks is likely to exist
within each firm. The existing tax subsidy encourages workers to remain in
the group pool. But any subsidy that makes individual insurance more
attractive can lead to adverse selection in the group pool. Adverse selection
can also affect the market for individual insurance. Proposals to reduce
premium variability due to health risk rating in the individual insurance
market must also be careful to employ pooling mechanisms in order not to
Chapter 5

| 233

drive out healthy individuals. Increased reliance on the individual insurance
market also raises concerns about the quality of the insurance plans
purchased, because of limited regulation and consumer bargaining power.
Empirical evidence indicates that crowding out and adverse selection
do occur and thus are real concerns in proposals to expand health insurance
coverage. Studies of the expansion of Medicaid coverage to children in the
late 1980s and the first half of the 1990s found that the crowding out of
private insurance coverage was responsible for around 10–20 percent of the
increase in Medicaid coverage. Because Medicaid covers mostly low-income
people who are less likely to have private insurance, the crowding out was
particularly modest.
Studies of the choices employees make when offered a choice of several
health insurance plans found evidence of adverse selection. One study found
that premiums for plans with relatively generous benefits increased much
faster than premiums for other plans, presumably because of the poorer
health status of the people selecting the more generous plans. Another study
found that, in one firm, healthy employees were the least likely to choose the
most generous benefit plan. The premiums for that plan ultimately became
so expensive that the employer dropped it.

Types of Subsidies
In general, efforts to extend health care coverage by offering public
subsidies use one of three approaches. The first approach, tax deductions,
allows individuals who purchase health insurance in the individual insurance
market to reduce their taxes by deducting their health insurance premiums
from their taxable income. A second approach, tax credits, reduces an individual’s taxes by the full amount of the credit. A third approach extends
government-provided insurance to more people. SCHIP, for instance,
finances health insurance for children in lower income households.
These three options differ in how well they extend coverage, in their cost
relative to increased coverage, and in their effects on existing insurance plans.
Tax deductions provide only partial subsidies, and the subsidy is smaller for
those with low incomes, who are the most likely to be uninsured. These weaknesses mean that tax deductions are unlikely to effectively expand health
insurance coverage. By making individual coverage more attractive, tax deductions could also crowd out employer-sponsored plans, reducing the number of
newly insured people on a net basis. Because a tax deduction for individual
insurance would provide many who already purchase individual coverage with a
more generous benefit than they currently receive, but is not likely to significantly increase coverage, the cost relative to increased coverage is also high. By
subsidizing individual coverage, a tax deduction can also cause adverse selection
that undermines existing coverage, and it can lead to increased reliance on the
234 | Economic Report of the President

individual insurance market, with its associated concerns. Thus tax deductions
fare poorly on all three criteria.
Tax credits, if well designed, can help many people, including lower
income families and individuals, purchase insurance. To be effective, the
credits must be generous enough to make insurance affordable. Further, to
enable lower income people to afford premiums, the credits ideally would be
refundable, so that those with little or no tax liability can receive the
credit. Ideally, they would also be payable incrementally through the year, so
that those who have difficulties paying up-front costs are helped. However,
these features also make administering the credits more difficult. Because
such credits would apply to individual insurance, they have the drawbacks
discussed earlier. They can raise the cost relative to the amount of increased
coverage and reduce current risk pooling. These problems can be ameliorated
through income cutoffs that restrict eligibility to those populations least likely
to be able to afford coverage.
Government-provided insurance can fully subsidize insurance and thus
cover many of the uninsured. But if such a program provides full insurance,
some individuals who are already insured and become eligible for the
program can be expected to switch, increasing the cost relative to the amount
of increased coverage. Again, income cutoffs to restrict eligibility to uninsured populations can limit the crowding out. Because government-provided
insurance does not increase the subsidy for individual insurance, adverse
selection is much less likely to occur.

Meeting the Challenge of Covering More People
The Administration has taken a number of steps to extend coverage to
more people. As noted above, the number of uninsured nationwide declined
in 1999 for the first time in 12 years. Particularly noteworthy successes
include the creation of SCHIP, which is intended to cover up to 5 million
children when fully implemented. Other successes include extending
Medicare and Medicaid coverage to persons with disabilities who are returning to work, providing Medicaid coverage to young adults leaving foster care,
and covering low-income uninsured women diagnosed with breast and
cervical cancer. In addition, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 limits exclusions for preexisting conditions in employer
health insurance plans and plans sold to people converting from an
employer’s plan to individual insurance. In its last budget, submitted in
February 2000, the Administration proposed a health insurance initiative to
extend publicly provided health insurance to around 5 million more people.
This proposal included a FamilyCare program to extend SCHIP to the
parents of children covered by Medicaid and SCHIP; accelerated enrollment
of eligible but uninsured children in Medicaid and SCHIP; and expanded
Chapter 5

| 235

health insurance options for vulnerable populations such as legal immigrants, early retirees, and displaced workers.
Although much has been done to ensure access to health care for millions of
Americans, a number of challenges lie ahead. The benefits of innovative prescription drugs make access to these drugs more valuable, especially for the
elderly and persons with disabilities. As a result, in its last budget the Administration proposed a prescription drug benefit within the Medicare program. We
must also prepare for a growing elderly population and expected increases in
long-term care needs. Meeting this challenge requires increased investments to
ensure the solvency of the Medicare program and provide financial assistance to
the increasing number of families with members needing long-term care. To
address these needs, in its last budget the Administration proposed providing tax
credits for long-term care, and in the midsession review of that budget it proposed placing the Medicare trust funds in a lockbox. Finally, we must continue
to work toward providing access to the health care system for the millions of
Americans who remain uninsured.

Building Livable Communities
Just as the New Economy has transformed the structure of economic
activity to provide better options and opportunities for Americans, so has it
transformed the way we organize our communities and build new ones. The
economic forces stimulating today’s rapid growth do not automatically create
incentives to preserve community amenities and environmental quality. With
the support of Federal and State initiatives, regional governments are beginning to experiment with new economic and planning tools that can channel
the economic drivers of growth in ways that preserve the quality of life Americans desire. Changing the way people think about growth in their
communities will also change the kinds of public investments and policies
that shape the landscapes of the new century.
The 20th century witnessed the evolution of the American suburb,
especially in the 1990s, when suburban growth accelerated. From 1990 to
1999 the suburban population grew by nearly 19 percent, compared with
6 percent in the central cities. The New Economy has brought about a
change in the patterns of job location as well. Job creation is shifting away
from the central city. New jobs and new industries are springing up on the
fringes of cities, often in so-called technology parks and research corridors.
Between 1979 and 1999 the central cities’ share of overall metropolitan office
space fell significantly. In 1979 central cities accounted for 74 percent of
office space and suburbs for only 26 percent. By 1999 the share of the central
cities had dropped to 58 percent, and the suburban share had mushroomed
to 42 percent.
236 | Economic Report of the President

Rural areas just beyond the edge of urban settlements have experienced
particularly rapid growth. In metropolitan counties that were primarily rural
in 1990, the population rose by 20 percent between 1990 and 1999—a
much higher rate than in any other type of county. As farmland is converted
to other uses, these counties are becoming low-density urban areas.
Although many Americans still seek the high quality of life available
in America’s cities, the suburbs have a special attraction. They promise
American families the best of both worlds: the amenities and quality of life
that many prefer and the availability of jobs formerly associated primarily
with cities. But this trend has its drawbacks. Rapid growth can create
problems that affect an entire region. Local communities, especially those
experiencing rapid development, must invest in plans to channel growth in
ways that are consistent with social well-being and environmental quality.

Business and Suburbanization
Economists have noted a positive relationship between the concentration of
economic activity and productivity. In the past, access to natural resources and
effective means of transportation were often the driving force behind a region’s
economic gains. In contrast, economic growth today is often based on so-called
agglomeration economies. These develop when firms in the same industry
cluster together in a region in order to share ideas, customers, and pools of
workers with specialized skills. Agglomeration economies exist in Manhattan’s
financial industry, among Boston’s mutual fund companies, and in California’s
Silicon Valley, where many high-technology firms have gathered. Because they
are often free of the traditional resource-related needs that tied earlier industries
to specific locations, New Economy firms are able to choose from a wide array
of potential business sites. They can choose to locate in a community because of
the proximity of other firms or simply because of its cultural and recreational
amenities and general livability.
Several economic explanations have been offered for the resulting pattern
of development. First, for many firms, central cities may exhibit diseconomies that offset the benefits associated with locating there. The
building stock may be costly to upgrade, making rents in revitalized or redeveloped urban areas expensive. Similarly, the unintended consequences of
environmental clean-up laws can discourage firms from reusing contaminated or abandoned urban properties. Despite more than $2.3 billion in
leveraged economic development devoted to these “brownfields” through the
national Brownfields Initiative, hundreds of thousands of properties remain
unused because of real or perceived environmental contamination. For these
reasons it may be more cost-effective for firms to start from scratch in
outlying areas.

Chapter 5

Sprawl and Its Challenges
With growth occurring more on the outskirts of cities than in the central
cities themselves, land in many metropolitan areas is now being consumed at
a rate that exceeds population growth. An average of 2.3 million acres of land
undergoes development each year, and a significant share is used for lowdensity residential development in fringe suburbs and smaller cities. This
growing, often unplanned development is commonly known as sprawl.
Sprawl is characterized by low-density residential and commercial settlements and often forces residents to rely exclusively on automobiles for
transportation.
Sprawl often imposes significant costs on entire regions. Many suburban
communities are becoming increasingly congested and are thus in danger of
losing the very attributes that make them attractive places to live and work.
Growing populations strain public resources such as schools and parks.
Affordable housing moves farther away from jobs, increasing average commuting distances throughout metropolitan areas. Commuting is only one
factor in increasing traffic congestion. Four out of five household automobile
trips are now taken for noncommuting purposes, and distances from homes
to destinations such as stores, schools, and recreational facilities are
increasing. Limited public transportation makes congestion even worse,
increasing demand for new roads—and creating more congestion.
Unplanned growth affects the quality of the environment, including water,
air, and land resources. Increases in paved surfaces, including roads, buildings, and parking lots, can contribute to deteriorating water quality and to an
overall loss of greenspace. This leads to less effective natural drainage, diminishes water quality, and in some areas dramatically increases the potential for
flooding. For example, residents along California’s Russian River experienced four major floods in 3 consecutive years. Hydrologists attribute such
events in part to urbanization’s effects on stream flow: downstream runoff
into streams and rivers increases as the area devoted to roads, parking lots,
and other impervious surfaces that keep water from filtering into the
soil increases.
Increased traffic affects not only the daily commute but also ambient air
quality. Automobile emissions lead to hazardous air pollution by elevating
concentrations of ozone and particulate matter. Although national air quality
trends have improved over the last 20 years, in 1999 approximately
62 million people nationwide still lived in counties with pollution levels that
exceeded national standards. Pollution affects the health of residents, and
some are more vulnerable than others. Pediatric asthma, for instance, is
aggravated by particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and ozone. Between 1982
and 1996 the incidence of this disease increased by 76 percent.

238 | Economic Report of the President

Regional Coordination and Sprawl
Jurisdiction over transportation routes and systems, as well as over housing
and economic development decisions, is often fragmented among different
local and State governments, resulting in little coordination of land-use planning. Regional commissions can help to deal with the spillover effects that
community decisions have on neighboring municipalities. Sprawling
communities are often divided by great fiscal disparities and distinctly zoned
land uses. Planners with an interest in regional growth may be able to help
communities accommodate new growth collaboratively.
Regional coordination has been particularly important in transportation.
Communities are making significant investments in transportation and are
coordinating their land-use plans with these investments. Ridership on
public transportation is up nationwide. In 1999 transit riders made more
than 9 billion trips, the most in nearly 40 years. The Transportation Equity
Act for the 21st Century provided $36 billion in Federal funding for transit
for fiscal 1998–2003, around 50 percent more than during the previous
6-year period. Finally, State and local officials are increasingly choosing to tap
into financial assistance available for surface mass transit, transferring over
$1.5 billion to transit projects in fiscal 2000 alone.

Individual Decisions and Sprawl
One of the difficulties in dealing with development issues is that the costs
and the benefits of development are typically borne by different entities.
Decisions benefiting private individuals may have adverse public effects, but
private decisionmakers are unlikely to weigh these social costs. For example,
many individuals prefer homes on large private lots far from both city centers
and major highways. But these homes require new roads and the installation
of public utilities. If many people choose to live in such homes, the negative
spillovers their decisions generate—increases in traffic congestion, air pollution, impervious surfaces, and property taxes—may outweigh the benefits
they and their neighbors receive. The results of such decisions are evident in
many areas of the country and are particularly vivid in Atlanta (Box 5-6).
The true economic costs of building a new home include the costs of
associated spillovers, and these costs should be recognized, but quantifying
these social and environmental burdens is more difficult than identifying
the private costs of development. Some positive steps can be taken in this
direction, however. For instance, studies have found that the additional
tax revenue received from new development does not cover the costs of
building new roads and providing public services (including
utilities) to new residents. If developers and homeowners were required to
bear the full cost of these services, including infrastructure, the resulting
pattern of development would look much less like sprawl. Many

Box 5-6. Challenges to Smart Growth in Atlanta
Ranked by some as the U.S. city most threatened by sprawl,
Atlanta continues to expand at a phenomenal pace. From 1980 to
1998 the Atlanta area’s population grew almost 68 percent, with virtually all of this growth occurring beyond the city limits. According to
one study, the Atlanta metropolitan area loses 500 acres of greenspace, forest, and farmland each week. Water quality in the
Chattahoochee River and Lake Allatoona is deteriorating, and the
city’s air is in violation of clean air standards. The costs of traffic congestion from lost time and wasted fuel are estimated at an
overwhelming $2.3 billion a year. The average time spent per person
per day in a vehicle on Atlanta’s roads and highways has been estimated at 1 hour and 11 minutes. Motorists in Atlanta lead the Nation
in miles driven per person per day, logging a total of over 100 million
miles daily. The region’s growth has further isolated minority and lowincome communities and created tremendous geographical
imbalances in the availability of jobs and housing. Atlanta’s residents
may be enjoying the benefits of the New Economy, but they are
clearly suffering the resulting costs of sprawl.
The Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) is attempting to limit this
expansive growth and coordinate development. To help this coalition
of regional governments, in 1999 the State created the Georgia
Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA), assigning to it broad
powers to manage projects involving transportation, air quality, and
land use in heavily polluted areas, particularly the city of Atlanta
itself. Metropolitan governments are opposing a perimeter highway
proposal because it threatens investment in the center city and
encourages further sprawl. The ARC, supported by the State government, is trying hard to provide and encourage alternatives to
single-motorist auto-mobile transportation. The ARC and the GRTA
are also seeking to encourage development that incorporates
elements of smart growth by revitalizing older communities and
emerging population centers through efforts to promote livability
and increase the mix of land uses and housing types. But the sprawl
continues, and Atlanta faces a serious challenge: it must channel
future growth in order to build sustainable, attractive communities.

governments have begun to assess impact fees on new construction so that
the financial burdens of infrastructure and public service provision are
taken into account in development decisions.
Communities are beginning to use other kinds of economic incentives
to achieve outcomes more consistent with smart growth. For example,
communities such as South Bend, Washington, have imposed fees on
240 | Economic Report of the President

development that increases impervious surface area, in order to encourage
development that has fewer detrimental effects on water quality and
minimizes the potential for flooding. Other communities are using road
pricing to improve traffic patterns. In San Diego, solo drivers in the
express lanes of one major freeway pay higher prices during congested
times than during off-peak hours. Electronic transponder technology
helps identify individual motorists and assess tolls, making this system
possible without the significant slowdowns caused by toll plazas. Other
communities are using transferable development rights to provide incentives for keeping land in agriculture and other uses that maintain open
space and provide ecological benefits.

The Administration’s Response
The Administration’s 30-point Livable Communities Initiative encourages smart growth. It sets forth several principles aimed at aligning
Federal policy efforts with smart growth priorities and encouraging
planning and coordination over larger regions to resolve negative
spillovers. The Livable Communities Initiative seeks to sustain prosperity,
expand economic opportunity, enhance the quality of life, and build a
stronger sense of community. It provides funds for regional smart growth
efforts, including Better America Bonds for State, local, and tribal governments. The initiative aims to reuse brownfields and preserve
greenspaces, ease traffic congestion, restore a sense of community,
promote collaboration among neighboring municipalities through
regional governance, and enhance economic competitiveness. In addition,
its smart growth initiatives attempt to counter various socially undesirable
effects of sprawl such as racial segregation, concentrated poverty, decreased
personal interaction, and a less active civil society. Initiatives at the State
and the local level are beginning to have real impacts on communities—
for instance, in the State of Maryland and the city of Chattanooga,
Tennessee (Box 5-7).
An educated work force that views quality of life and favorable economic conditions as priorities often characterizes areas of new and rapid
growth. These communities have both the constituency needed to
demand change and the resources necessary to implement it. Business and
community leaders are already recognizing the costs and impacts of sprawl
and acting to mitigate the negative effects. In metropolitan areas such as
Chicago, Denver, Omaha, and Philadelphia, leaders are acting to improve
land use and transportation decisions and enhance environmental quality.
The success of these endeavors will depend on the ability of these
communities to make hard choices and find creative solutions to the
challenges of sprawl.
Chapter 5

Box 5-7. Examples of Smart Growth
Maryland has established several specific goals for its smart
growth program. These include preserving the State’s most valuable
remaining natural resources, supporting existing communities and
neighborhoods by targeting State resources to development in areas
where the necessary infrastructure is already in place, and saving
taxpayer dollars by avoiding the unnecessary cost of building the
infrastructure required to support sprawl. The program also stipulates that the State will regularly evaluate the program’s
effectiveness. By winning Federal grant money, reprioritizing within
the State budget, and designing financial incentives for businesses,
local governments, and home-owners, Maryland has been able to
leverage the funds necessary to emerge as a leader in the smart
growth community while preserving local decisionmaking authority.
Similarly, the success of Chattanooga, Tennessee’s, smart growth
initiative affirms the conviction that Americans can enjoy both
economic prosperity and a high quality of life. Chattanooga’s
economy was historically based on iron foundries, textile mills, and
chemical plants, but in recent decades these were not providing the
growth and employment the city required. However, through
thoughtful economic development efforts, Chattanooga has become
a model for other cities seeking environmentally sound urban
renewal. Using extensive grants from private foundations together
with Federal and local public funds, Chattanooga has built successful
public-private partnerships throughout its visionary redevelopment
process. The city now prides itself on being a laboratory for sustainable development projects involving rezoning, reclamation,
revitalization, and redevelopment. Illustrating how older cities can
thrive in the New Economy, Chattanooga boasts a 22-mile Riverwalk
with picnic areas, the world’s largest freshwater aquarium, a sculpture garden, waterfront housing developments, an electric-bus
public transit system, footbridges, and an arts district.

Conclusion
The ongoing, unprecedented economic expansion has done much to
improve the well-being of the American people. However, an important part
of the Administration’s role during the expansion has been to ensure that
no one is left behind. And indeed, government policies have helped—and
will continue to help—many of the most disadvantaged Americans.
Policies easing the transition from welfare to work, improving educational
242 | Economic Report of the President

opportunities, increasing access to health care, and improving the health of
our communities have helped distribute recent economic gains more fully.
Improving outcomes for those in danger of being left behind benefits the
Nation as well as disadvantaged populations.
This Administration has maintained policies that support strong economic growth and low inflation. Many previously unemployed Americans
have been moved from welfare to work, increasing the supply of workers at
a time when the demand for workers is high. Investments in the education
of young people help ensure that future generations will have the necessary
skills to succeed in the New Economy and increase productivity. Health care
initiatives have helped Americans maintain access to recently developed,
innovative technologies. The Administration has also worked to guarantee
that our communities enjoy the amenities that families desire: safe streets,
clean air and water, reliable transportation, and access to greenspace.
Despite this substantial progress, many challenges remain. Confronting
these challenges will require ongoing public policies that combine initiatives to support economic growth with efforts to reach out to those still in
need of assistance. The Nation has made enormous strides in helping the
least well off among us, but substantial disparities persist in income
levels, educational quality, access to health care, and quality of life. These
differences must be addressed. At the same time, we must consider how
to help those who need additional assistance even in this period of strong
economic growth: our elderly, our disabled, and our children. We are
certainly better off than we were 8 years ago, but we can do more to
ensure an even brighter future for all Americans.

Achievements and Challenges
in the New Economy

T

he past 8 years have been a period of extraordinary achievement for the
U.S. economy. With support from sound policies and strategic investments
in the future, the United States has experienced an unprecedented economic
expansion. This expansion is remarkable not only for being the longest ever
recorded but also for its breadth and inclusiveness. Its benefits have been
widely and generously shared, raising Americans’ average real income to record
highs and creating opportunities for groups that have long been left behind.
The economy this expansion has created is not just greater in sheer size but
“new” in its structure and performance. It is dramatically more information
intensive and more technology driven, more productive and more innovative.
Today’s economy utilizes new, more efficient business practices and has
redefined many traditional relationships between suppliers, manufacturers,
investors, and customers to achieve ever-greater efficiency. The cumulative
245

result of these trends and their interactions is a New Economy, one that is
currently providing Americans in all walks of life the benefits of high growth,
low inflation, high productivity, rising incomes, and low unemployment.
The New Economy did not emerge by chance. A policy strategy centered
on fiscal discipline, investment in education and technology, and opening
markets abroad has been key to its development. Prudent policy choices,
sustained over 8 years, have fostered the flourishing of innovation and entrepreneurship. The combination of private sector innovation, new
technologies, Americans’ hard work, and sound policies and investments in
the future has created vibrant economic growth. On average since 1993, the
economy has grown at a healthy 4.0 percent per year. Core inflation has
remained near its lowest rate since the 1960s. Meanwhile productivity
growth has risen rather than stagnated over the course of the expansion.
Productivity has grown 3.9 percent a year on average over the past 2 years,
and it grew a robust 4.8 percent in the 12 months ending in the third quarter
of 2000.
Importantly, the resulting prosperity has been shared in a remarkably
equitable manner compared with the previous expansion. There have been
solid, across-the-board income gains, with some of the strongest gains realized
among the least well off. Americans in the bottom 20 percent of the income
distribution have actually seen much stronger average income growth than
the average for all other income groups: a total real gain of 16.3 percent since
1993. In the last 8 years the economy has created more than 22 million jobs,
more than 80 percent of which are good jobs in industries paying wages
above the median. The median family income has increased by $6,338 since
1993, rising to $48,950 in 1999. Meanwhile 7 million Americans have been
lifted out of poverty. Home ownership reached 67.7 percent last year—the
highest percentage on record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in more
than 30 years. Unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics are
at their lowest on record.
This Report has explored the phenomena that together have come to be
known as the New Economy. It has examined the driving forces of innovation,
organizational change, and sound policy that have created that
New Economy. It has analyzed the effects those forces have had on macroeconomic performance, on business practices, and on our ability as a Nation
to address the longstanding challenges of reducing poverty, improving education, and enhancing the long-term welfare of all our citizens. Last but not
least, the Report has considered those areas where growth on its own may not
meet all the challenges, and where targeted government policies can help
widen the circle of opportunity to include as many of our fellow citizens
as possible.

246 | Economic Report of the President

The United States today stands at a unique juncture in its own history—
and indeed in world history. It enjoys unprecedented prosperity and
therefore faces a unique set of opportunities as well as challenges. Used wisely
and cautiously, our prosperity can be harnessed in ways that will further
enrich all Americans for decades to come. We can and should continue to
strengthen research and development, to drive long-term innovation and
further productivity increases. We can and should continue to invest in
education and training, to build the skills and ingenuity of our work force.
And we can and should continue to shore up Social Security and Medicare,
to improve our ability to provide for the long-term needs of our aging
population. The right path, in short, is one that continues the policies of the
last 8 years. Those policies have created a virtuous cycle in which fiscal
discipline helps keep interest rates attractive for investment, and strong,
productive investment in turn generates a healthy and growing economy,
yielding ever larger budget surpluses.
Today’s economy is strong, but it is far from invulnerable. The virtuous
cycle can all too easily be broken if fiscal discipline is abandoned and priority
is given to large tax cuts for a few rather than long-term investments for the
country as a whole. Abandoning fiscal discipline in favor of a large, permanent cut in tax rates would raise interest rates and threaten investment and
growth. Such a reversal of policy would be particularly ill advised at a time
when the country faces a significant demographic challenge: over the next
40 years the share of the U.S. population aged 65 and over will rise from
about 12.5 percent to nearly 21 percent. This demographic shift alone
implies that retirement and health programs for the elderly will take up an
increasing share of Federal outlays. But in addition, the costs per capita of
Social Security and Medicare are expected to rise in the future, implying an
even more dramatic increase in spending on the elderly. The confluence of
these two trends means that spending on Social Security and Medicare as
a share of GDP will almost double over the next 40 years, from around
6 percent today to 11.2 percent in 2040.
The emergence of the New Economy provides a precious opportunity to
continue to build for the future, educate our children, secure the well-being
of older generations now and for decades hence, and make the investments
that will fuel the engines of innovation, enterprise, and productivity in our
economy. Defining and pursuing the right priorities for continuing the
expansion will be critical to the Nation’s long-term welfare.

Technology’s Role in the New Economy
At the heart of the New Economy is a bubbling cauldron of creativity and
innovation. Advances in computing, information storage, and telecommunications have proliferated, yielding whole arrays of new products, services, and
Conclusion

| 247

industries. Discoveries in all these fields have been decades in the making,
but for most of that time they proceeded on separate tracks, with little joint
impact on productivity and output. Recently, however, the paths of
these technologies—telecommunications, computers, and the Internet—
have converged, opening the way to a whole new range of capabilities
previously unimagined.
Through the dynamic interaction of these powerful innovations, the
economy has become “lighter,” shifting toward products that embody
more knowledge capital and less physical capital. Spending on information
technology has played a leading role in the acceleration of economic growth.
Although it accounts for an estimated 8.3 percent of GDP, information
technology contributed almost a third of output growth between 1995 and
1999. Investment in information processing equipment and software now
makes up more than a third of all private nonresidential fixed investment.
Between 1990 and 1997 the number of information technology firms
increased by 120 percent.
Technological innovation has been particularly important to the New
Economy for two reasons. First, the information technology sector itself is
highly productive, and as this sector has grown, its improved productivity
performance has boosted that of the economy as a whole. Second, the
adoption of information technology by other sectors of the economy has led
to performance gains there, making other inputs—both physical and human
capital—more productive through changes in the way firms do business.
Manufacturing plants are increasingly automated. Workers are being given
more flexible job assignments and stronger incentive pay. Supplier relationships are becoming more closely integrated through the use of computer
systems that coordinate the various aspects of production and warehousing,
allowing firms to slash their inventories. Firm boundaries are also shifting
rapidly, as firms outsource noncore businesses and move toward flexible,
collaborative relationships such as strategic alliances with suppliers,
customers, and even rivals.
But technology alone is just a tool. It is only when firms use technology
wisely that it becomes a transforming agent. Performance improvements
are most likely to be realized when firms use information technology to bring
about changes in basic business practices, job design, organizational structure,
interactions with customers and suppliers, and human resource practices.
One example of how technology is inspiring changes in business practices
is the use of the Internet to reduce companies’ procurement costs. On-line
business-to-business exchanges now offer a range of transaction tools, such as
on-line auctions, billing, insurance, information, and other custom services,
that make procurement far more efficient. One on-line exchange claims to
have saved customers $2 billion during its 5 years in operation. These kinds
248 | Economic Report of the President

of improvements, in turn, help make the economy more resilient: more
efficient procurement and inventory management have greatly reduced
the tendency toward inventory overhang in the economy as a whole, thus
reducing the likelihood that a period of slowing growth will tip into a recession.

The Role of Policy in Supporting the New Economy
The surge in innovation and entrepreneurship that is driving the New
Economy has been fostered by supportive government policies. First and
foremost, policy played a critical role in boosting national saving, which
provides the fuel on which the New Economy runs. The Federal budget
deficit had ballooned to $290 billion in 1992, the largest ever, and it was
projected then to grow to more than $455 billion by fiscal 2000. These
massive deficits placed a huge drain on investment capital, and partly as a
consequence, economy-wide productivity growth had fallen to anemic levels.
However, with the program of fiscal discipline that President Clinton and
Vice President Gore put in place in 1993, the fiscal balance has improved
8 years in a row. The surplus in fiscal 2000 was $237 billion, the largest as a
share of GDP since 1948.
These mounting surpluses mean that the government, rather than
draining resources away from private investment, is now freeing them up.
And indeed, the last 8 years have seen a dramatic increase in investment.
From the first quarter of 1993 to the third quarter of 2000, investment grew
at an average rate of 13 percent per year. This long investment boom has
been key to the increasing productivity growth we have seen over the course
of the expansion, which, in turn, has enabled the economy to continue on a
path of strong yet noninflationary growth.
The ascent of the New Economy was also helped along by strong,
pro-competitive policies that allowed innovation to flourish. The
Telecommunications Act of 1996, for example, opened up competition
among local telephone companies, long distance providers, and cable companies. That competition, in turn, helped spur innovation not only within
telecommunications but also in computer technology and related sectors that
have been key drivers of the New Economy. The act also provided guidelines
to ensure that the benefits of increased competition would be harnessed so as
to increase the circle of opportunity. It established the E-rate program,
through which schools and libraries gained access to discounted telecommunications and Internet connections. Today 95 percent of public schools are
connected to the Internet. This program, paired with a massive increase in
Federal funding for education technology (to $872 million in fiscal 2001, up
from just $23 million in fiscal 1994) constitutes a long-term investment in
the technologically skilled work force needed to sustain economic growth.

Conclusion

| 249

Globalization and the New Economy
Globalization has also played a crucial role in promoting the technological
innovation and organizational changes that have yielded a New Economy.
Globalization turns national markets with few competitors into worldwide
markets with many competitors. The resulting, more intense competition
induces firms to innovate. That innovation contributes to increased productivity and economic growth. Globalization, by expanding markets, also gives
producers greater scope to specialize in what they do best. And with open
markets, they are able to use the best and most cost-effective inputs from
sources around the world to lower their costs.
Improvements in information technology have spurred deeper integration
between the United States and the world economy. Indeed, it is no coincidence that the New Economy emerged in the United States at the same time
that U.S. participation in the global economy has reached new heights,
because globalization and the recent advances in information technology are
integrally linked.
Over the past 8 years, fostering globalization and its benefits has been
a high policy priority. The United States has been a partner to more than
300 trade agreements, including the North America Free Trade Agreement,
the Uruguay Round multilateral trade agreements, the accord establishing
permanent normal trade relations with China, the international moratorium
on tariffs on e-commerce, and multilateral agreements in telecommunications, information technology equipment, and financial services. At the same
time, U.S. trade policy has taken pains to ensure that these agreements safeguard global natural resources and respect our values, including our
commitment to core labor standards.
The effects of globalization and improved communications and technology are evident in the record of U.S. international transactions. Trade
in capital goods has soared since 1996, with particularly strong growth in
products that are central to the New Economy, such as computers, semiconductors, and telecommunications equipment. Exports of services have
also grown, in particular in those service industries where valuable
innovation has taken place, such as professional, business, technical, and
financial services.

Harnessing the New Economy
For all the power and promise of the New Economy, we cannot take
for granted that its benefits will flow spontaneously to all. That is where
policymakers have played a critical role in harnessing the dynamism of
today’s New Economy to benefit all Americans, including groups that have
too long been left behind.
250 | Economic Report of the President

A robust economy that creates 22 million new jobs certainly provides
broad-reaching benefits. Unemployment rates for African Americans and
Hispanics, for example, have hit record lows during this expansion. But
rather than rely on the pure market effects of an economy running on all
cylinders, this Administration has enlisted additional means to empower and
assist struggling families. Among the accomplishments thus far have been
two hikes in the minimum wage, an expansion of the Earned Income Tax
Credit, a more than doubling of funding for child care for working parents,
and the extension of health insurance coverage to a greater number of lowincome children and working families. Together with the effects of the strong
economy, these measures have helped 7 million people move out of poverty
since 1993.
Over the past 8 years, the welfare rolls dropped by more than 8 million, or
nearly 60 percent, to their lowest level in 32 years. Recent data submitted by
States competing for high-performance bonuses available under welfare
reform show that 1.2 million welfare recipients nationwide went to work in
fiscal 1999 alone. Seventy-seven percent of those who got jobs were still
working in the next quarter, and average quarterly earnings were up
31 percent from the first to the third quarter of employment: from $2,027 to
$2,647. And as more people move off of welfare, into the job market, and
out of poverty, their greater economic participation has a positive feedback
effect on the economy as a whole, lessening the burden on the budget and on
taxpayers and increasing the productive force in the economy.
Here, too, technology can make important contributions, by improving
the delivery of many social services. In health care, such innovations are
yielding new treatment methods that can directly improve the quality of life
for many. In education, new Federal programs are bringing computers and
the Internet into the classroom, narrowing the digital divide, helping
improve teacher effectiveness, and reducing class size.
Despite vast improvements in the quality of life experienced by many
Americans, challenges remain. There are still substantial disparities in
economic well-being across regions. Minority groups and residents of central
cities and rural areas suffer disproportionately high rates of poverty and
unemployment.
Our health care system also presents challenges. We need to control health
expenditures and ensure that care is affordable to all. Issues related to
managed care and the appropriate way to align incentives must be resolved so
that health care is neither overly restricted nor overly prescribed. Even after
these problems are brought under control, many Americans may continue to
lack health insurance. If this is allowed to happen, they will be unable to take
advantage of the quality care available to the majority.

Conclusion

| 251

Finally, one side effect of the New Economy is that certain parts of the
country, especially the perimeters of some of our large cities, have experienced
enormous growth in jobs and population. Such growth, when left
unchecked, has led to sprawl and serious environmental consequences.
Even at this moment of great prosperity, then, great challenges remain to
be confronted. We have a unique opportunity today to harness the power of
the high-technology, high-productivity, high-growth New Economy in a
way that sustains the current prosperity and uses it to improve the lives of all
Americans. The challenges of the future—from saving Social Security, to
improving education, to expanding health care coverage, to paying down the
national debt—are significant and will require concerted effort. The tools
and capabilities of the New Economy, combined with the right, targeted
policies, can provide a powerful solution toward addressing these challenges
as a Nation.

Report to the President on the
Activities of the Council of Economic
Advisers During 2000
The Council of Economic Advisers was established by the Employment Act
of 1946 to provide the President with objective economic analysis and advice
on the development and implementation of a wide range of domestic and
international economic policy issues.

The Chairman of the Council
Martin N. Baily continued to chair the Council during 2000. Before
joining the Council, Dr. Baily was a Principal at McKinsey & Company,
Inc., at the McKinsey Global Institute in Washington.
Dr. Baily is responsible for communicating the Council’s views on
economic matters directly to the President through personal discussions and
written reports. He also represents the Council at Cabinet meetings, meetings of the National Economic Council (NEC), daily White House senior
staff meetings, budget team meetings with the President, and other formal
and informal meetings with the President, senior White House staff, and
other senior government officials. Dr. Baily is the Council’s chief public
spokesperson. He directs the work of the Council and exercises ultimate
responsibility for the work of the professional staff.

The Members of the Council
Robert Z. Lawrence is a Member of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Dr. Lawrence is on leave from the John F. Kennedy School of Government
at Harvard University, where he is the Albert L. Williams Professor of International Trade and Investment at the Center for Business and Government.
Kathryn L. Shaw is also a Member of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Dr. Shaw is on leave from Carnegie Mellon University, where she is Professor
of Economics in the Graduate School of Industrial Administration.

Appendix A

| 257

The Chairman and the Members work as a team on most economic policy
issues. Dr. Lawrence was primarily responsible for the Administration’s
economic forecast, macroeconomic analysis, international economic issues,
and certain microeconomic issues, including those relating to natural
resources, the environment, and industrial organization. Dr. Shaw was
primarily responsible for policy analysis relating to the budget and taxation,
labor, retirement security, health care, welfare reform, and child and family
issues. The Chairman and the Members participate in the deliberations of
the NEC, and Dr. Baily is a member of the NEC Principals Committee.

Weekly Economic Briefings
Dr. Baily and the Members continued to prepare the Weekly Economic
Briefing of the President of the United States for the President, the Vice President,
and the President’s other senior economic and policy advisers. The Council,
in cooperation with the Office of the Vice President, prepares a written
briefing, which provides analysis of current economic developments, more
extended discussions of a wide range of economic issues and problems, and
summaries of economic developments in different regions and sectors of
the economy.

Macroeconomic Policies
A primary function of the Council is to advise the President on all major
macroeconomic issues and developments. The Council prepares for the
President, the Vice President, and the White House senior staff almost daily
memoranda that report key economic data and analyze current economic events.
The Council, the Department of the Treasury, and the Office of Management
and Budget—the Administration’s economic “troika”—are responsible for
producing the economic forecasts that underlie the Administration’s budget
proposals. The Council, under the leadership of the Chairman and the
Members, initiates the forecasting process twice each year. In preparing these
forecasts, the Council consults with a variety of outside sources, including
leading private sector forecasters.
In 2000 the Council took part in discussions on a range of macroeconomic issues, with particular focus on the markets for energy and capital.
The Council engaged in discussions with other agencies concerning
pressures in the market for oil and quantifying possible effects on the U.S.
economy. The Council continued to participate in the President’s Working
Group on Financial Markets, an interagency group that monitors developments related to financial markets and the banking sector. In 2000 this

258 | Economic Report of the President

group emphasized continuing deregulation of capital markets, increasing
international harmonization across markets, and regulation of new financial
instruments. The Council continued to study a range of budget and tax
issues, including the positive effects of continued fiscal discipline for the
economy. The Council works closely with the Office of Management
and Budget, the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the NEC, as well as other
government agencies, in providing analyses to the Administration on these
topics of concern.
The Council continued its efforts to improve the public’s understanding
of economic issues and of the Administration’s economic agenda through
regular briefings with the economic and financial press, frequent discussions
with outside economists, and presentations to outside organizations. The
Chairman and the Members also regularly exchanged views on the macroeconomy with the Chairman and Members of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System.

International Economic Policies
The Council continued its role as an active participant in international
economic policymaking during 2000, providing both analytical support and
policy guidance. The Council played an important role in evaluating and
explaining the case for trade liberalization and increased U.S. participation in
the multilateral trading system. Its involvement included active participation
in the Administration’s successful efforts to grant permanent normal trade
relations (PNTR) to China. For example, the Council contributed to
Administration discussions of the benefits to the United States of PNTR and
of China’s accession to the World Trade Organization.
The Council was also involved in a range of other international trade
issues, including evaluation of trade disputes, the state of the steel industry,
and the negotiation of free-trade agreements with Singapore and Chile.
The Council is a leading participant in the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), the principal forum for economic
cooperation among the high-income industrial countries. The Chairman
heads the U.S. delegation to the semiannual meetings of the OECD’s
Economic Policy Committee (EPC) and serves as the EPC Chairman. Dr.
Shaw led the U.S. delegation to the OECD’s Working Party 1, which
focused on economic growth, structural adjustment, sustainable growth,
and climate change issues. In 2000 Dr. Lawrence participated in the OECD’s
Working Party 3 meeting on macroeconomic policy and coordination. He
also participated in a meeting of subcabinet officials from the United States
and Japan.

Appendix A

| 259

Council members regularly met with representatives of the Council’s
counterpart agencies in foreign countries, as well as with foreign trade
ministers, other government officials, and members of the private sector.
During the year the Council continued its dialogue with the State Development Planning Commission—the Council’s counterpart in China—and
initiated a new dialogue with economic officials in Ukraine. The Council
also continued its annual meetings with the Economic Planning Agency of
Japan. The Council represented the United States at other international
forums as well, including meetings of the Economic Committee of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
Council members were active in helping to formulate Administration
policymaking on international climate change. Robert Lawrence participated
in the OECD’s High Level Working Group on Sustainable Development
and was a member of the U.S. delegation to the Convention of the Parties
(COP6) negotiations under the Kyoto Protocol, which were held in The
Hague in November 2000.

Microeconomic Policies
During 2000 the Council was an active participant in policy discussions
on an extensive range of microeconomic issues, including Medicare, the
minimum wage, financial privacy, reform of the Federal Aviation
Administration, energy supply, the digital divide, and the digital economy.
In addition to providing economic policy guidance on these issues, the
Council released several research papers on policy issues in the forefront of
current affairs.
The Uses of Census Data: An Analytical Review, released in April, provided
an overview of the myriad uses of census data by the different segments of
society. It stressed the importance of accurate census data in light of its use
by government at the Federal, State, and local level as well as by the business
and academic communities.
Teenagers and Their Parents in the 21st Century: An Examination of Trends
in Teen Behavior and the Role of Parental Involvement was released by the
President in May. The report outlined several positive trends among today’s
teenagers, including increases in student achievement, college access, and
participation in community service. It also emphasized the important role
played by parents in helping teens confront the many challenges they face on
a daily basis.

260 | Economic Report of the President

Opportunities and Gender Pay Equity in New Economy Occupations was also
released by the President in May. It reports on women’s progress in the New
Economy, focusing on information technology fields and the challenges
remaining for women to share fully in the benefits of jobs in that sector.
Educational Attainment and Success in the New Economy: An Analysis of
Challenges for Improving Hispanic Students’ Achievement was released by the
President in June. The study focuses on the progress being made by, and the
remaining challenges for, Hispanic students in the United States. It looks
primarily at the progress of Hispanics in the information technology
sector, as a good example of a rapidly expanding, high-paying sector of the
economy, and it emphasizes the role of education in achieving success.
Reaching the Uninsured: Alternative Approaches to Expanding Health Insurance Access was released by the President in September. The report
studies the lack of health insurance for tens of millions of Americans as a
serious policy issue with adverse health and economic consequences. It
also evaluates major policy options designed to make health insurance
more affordable.
The Economic Impact of Third-Generation Wireless Technology was also
released in September. This report documented the expected benefits of a
new generation of wireless technologies that provide high-speed mobile
access to the Internet and other communications networks, and explained
why adequate spectrum is needed to provide these services efficiently. The
report was released in conjunction with a Presidential Memorandum
directing Federal agencies to work together with the private sector to identify
suitable spectrum for these new services.
Philanthropy in the American Economy was released by the President in his
weekly radio address on November 25. The report discusses trends in giving
over the past several decades and highlights the economic explanations
behind the observed increase in donations. The report also discusses possible
future directions for philanthropy and how even greater giving might be
encouraged.
The Council has also participated actively in interagency discussions on
regulation, privatization, and competition policy. Domestically, the Council
has been involved in discussions related to mergers, telecommunications
policy, air traffic control, airline reservation systems, and the effects of
government ownership on competition. The Council has also continued to
participate in the Digital Economy Working Group, which discusses such
issues as business-to-business electronic commerce and the role of venture
capital in fostering innovation.

General Notes
Detail in these tables may not add to totals because of rounding.
Because of the formula used for calculating real gross domestic product (GDP),
the chained (1996) dollar estimates for the detailed components do not add to the
chained-dollar value of GDP or to any intermediate aggregates. The Department
of Commerce (Bureau of Economic Analysis) no longer publishes chained-dollar
estimates prior to 1987, except for selected series.
Unless otherwise noted, all dollar figures are in current dollars.
Symbols used:
p Preliminary.
...Not available (also, not applicable).
Data in these tables reflect revisions made by the source agencies from late January 2000 through December 21, 2000. In particular, tables containing national income and product accounts (NIPA) estimates reflect revisions released by the Department of Commerce in April and July 2000.

1 Inventories at end of quarter. Quarter-to-quarter change calculated from this table is not the current-dollar change in private inventories
component of GDP. The former is the difference between two inventory stocks, each valued at their respective end-of-quarter prices. The latter is the change in the physical volume of inventories valued at average prices of the quarter. In addition, changes calculated from this
table are at quarterly rates, whereas change in private inventories is stated at annual rates.
2 Inventories of construction establishments are included in ‘‘other’’ nonfarm inventories.
3 Quarterly totals at monthly rates. Final sales of domestic business equals final sales of domestic product less gross product of households and institutions and of general government and includes a small amount of final sales by farms.
Note.—The industry classification of inventories is on an establishment basis. Estimates for nonfarm industries other than manufacturing
and trade for 1986 and earlier periods are based on the 1972 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). Manufacturing estimates for 1981 and
earlier periods and trade estimates for 1966 and earlier periods are based on the 1972 SIC; later estimates for these industries are based on
the 1987 SIC. The resulting discontinuities are small.

1 Inventories at end of quarter. Quarter-to-quarter changes calculated from this table are at quarterly rates, whereas the change in private
inventories component of GDP is stated at annual rates.
2 Inventories of construction establishments are included in ‘‘other’’ nonfarm inventories.
3 Quarterly totals at monthly rates. Final sales of domestic business equals final sales of domestic product less gross product of households and institutions and of general government and includes a small amount of final sales by farms.
Note.—The industry classification of inventories is on an establishment basis. Estimates for nonfarm industries other than manufacturing
and trade for 1986 and earlier periods are based on the 1972 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). Manufacturing estimates for 1981 and
earlier periods and trade estimates for 1966 and earlier periods are based on the 1972 SIC; later estimates for these industries are based on
the 1987 SIC. The resulting discontinuities are small.
See Survey of Current Business, Table 5.13, for detailed information on calculation of the chained (1996) dollar inventory series.

5 Not strictly comparable with earlier data due to population adjustments as follows: Beginning 1953, introduction of 1950 census data
added about 600,000 to population and 350,000 to labor force, total employment, and agricultural employment. Beginning 1960, inclusion of
Alaska and Hawaii added about 500,000 to population, 300,000 to labor force, and 240,000 to nonagricultural employment. Beginning 1962,
introduction of 1960 census data reduced population by about 50,000 and labor force and employment by 200,000. Beginning 1972, introduction of 1970 census data added about 800,000 to civilian noninstitutional population and 333,000 to labor force and employment. A subsequent adjustment based on 1970 census in March 1973 added 60,000 to labor force and to employment. Beginning 1978, changes in sampling and estimation procedures introduced into the household survey added about 250,000 to labor force and to employment. Unemployment
levels and rates were not significantly affected. Beginning 1986, the introduction of revised population controls added about 400,000 to the
civilian population and labor force and 350,000 to civilian employment. Unemployment levels and rates were not significantly affected.
Beginning 1990, the introduction of 1990 census-based population controls, adjusted for the estimated undercount, added about 1.1 million to the civilian population and labor force, 880,000 to civilian employment, and 175,000 to unemployment. The overall unemployment rate
rose by about 0.1 percentage point.
Beginning 1994, data are not strictly comparable with earlier data because of the introduction of a major redesign of the Current Population Survey and collection methodology.
Beginning 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000 data are not strictly comparable due to the introduction of revised population controls. See February issues Employment and Earnings for details on the effects. Also, for 1998, data reflect the introduction of a new composite estimation
procedure for the Current Population Survey.

Note.—Labor force data in Tables B-35 through B-44 are based on household interviews and relate to the calendar week including the
12th of the month. For definitions of terms, area samples used, historical comparability of the data, comparability with other series, etc., see
‘‘Employment and Earnings.’’

trade are not comparable with earlier periods.
3 Inventory/sales ratio. Annual data are: beginning 1982, averages of monthly ratios; for 1958-81, ratio of December inventories to monthly
average sales for the year; and for earlier years, weighted averages. Monthly data are ratio of inventories at end of month to sales for
month.
Note.—Earlier data are not strictly comparable with data beginning 1958 for manufacturing and beginning 1967 for wholesale and retail
trade.

1 CPI-U-X1 is a rental equivalence approach to homeowners’ costs for the consumer price index for years prior to 1983, the first year for
which the official index (CPI-U) incorporates such a measure. CPI-U-X1 is rebased to the December 1982 value of the CPI-U (1982-84=100);
thus it is identical with CPI-U data for December 1982 and all subsequent periods. Data prior to 1967 estimated by moving the series at
the same rate as the CPI-U for each year.
2 CPI research series using current methods (CPI-U-RS) introduced in June 1999. Data for 2000 are preliminary.

6 Since July 19, 1975, the daily effective rate is an average of the rates on a given day weighted by the volume of transactions at these
rates. Prior to that date, the daily effective rate was the rate considered most representative of the day’s transactions, usually the one at
which most transactions occurred.
7 From October 30, 1942, to April 24, 1946, a preferential rate of 0.50 percent was in effect for advances secured by Government securities maturing in 1 year or less.

1 In the old series, ‘‘income taxes’’ refers to Federal income taxes only, as State and local income taxes had already been deducted. In the
new series, no income taxes have been deducted.
2 Annual data are average equity for the year (using four end-of-quarter figures).
3 Beginning 1988, profits before and after income taxes reflect inclusion of minority stockholders’ interest in net income before and after
income taxes.
4 Data for 1992 (most significantly 1992:I) reflect the early adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 106 (Employer’s
Accounting for Post-Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions) by a large number of companies during the fourth quarter of 1992. Data for
1993:I also reflect adoption of Statement 106. Corporations must show the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first
quarter of the year in which the change is adopted.
Note.—Data are not necessarily comparable from one period to another due to changes in accounting principles, industry classifications,
sampling procedures, etc. For explanatory notes concerning compilation of the series, see ‘‘Quarterly Financial Report for Manufacturing,
Mining, and Trade Corporations,’’ Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census.

Total

1 Farm population as defined by Department of Agriculture and Department of Commerce, i.e., civilian population living on farms in rural
areas, regardless of occupation. See also footnote 8. Series discontinued in 1992.
2 Total population of United States including Armed Forces overseas, as of July 1.
3 Includes persons doing farmwork on all farms. These data, published by the Department of Agriculture, differ from those on agricultural
employment by the Department of Labor (see Table B-35) because of differences in the method of approach, in concepts of employment, and
in time of month for which the data are collected.
4 Prior to 1982 this category was termed ‘‘family workers’’ and did not include nonfamily unpaid workers.
5 Acreage harvested plus acreages in fruits, tree nuts, and vegetables and minor crops.
6 Fertilizer, lime, and pesticides.
7 Includes purchases of broiler- and egg-type chicks and turkey poults and livestock imports for purposes other than immediate slaughter.
8 Based on new definition of a farm. Under old definition of a farm, farm population (in thousands and as percent of total population) for
1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1983 is 7,806 and 3.6; 8,005 and 3.6; 7,553 and 3.4; 7,241 and 3.2; 7,014 and 3.1; 6,880 and 3.0;
7,029 and 3.0, respectively.
9 Basis for farm employment series was discontinued for 1981 through 1984. Employment is estimated for these years.

Note.—Population includes Alaska and Hawaii beginning 1960.
Sources: Department of Agriculture (Economic Research Service) and Department of Commerce (Bureau of the Census).

1 End-use

categories beginning 1978 are not strictly comparable with data for earlier periods. See Survey of Current Business, June 1988.

Note.—Data are on an international transactions basis and exclude military.
In June 1990, end-use categories for goods exports were redefined to include reexports; beginning with data for 1978, reexports (exports of
foreign goods) are assigned to detailed end-use categories in the same manner as exports of domestic goods.

1 Department of Defense shipments of grant-aid military supplies and equipment under the Military Assistance Program are excluded from
total exports through 1985 and included beginning 1986.
2 F.a.s. (free alongside ship) value basis at U.S. port of exportation for exports and at foreign port of exportation for imports.
3 Beginning 1989, exports have been adjusted for undocumented exports to Canada and are included in the appropriate end-use categories.
For prior years, only total exports include this adjustment.
4 Total includes ‘‘other’’ exports or imports, not shown separately.
5 Total arrivals of imported goods other than intransit shipments.
6 Total includes revisions not reflected in detail.
7 Total exports are on a revised statistical month basis; end-use categories are on a statistical month basis.
Note.—Goods on a Census basis are adjusted to a BOP basis by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, in line with concepts and definitions
used to prepare international and national accounts. The adjustments are necessary to supplement coverage of Census data, to eliminate
duplication of transactions recorded elsewhere in international accounts, and to value transactions according to a standard definition.
Data include trade of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Foreign Trade Zones.

1 Prior

to 1991 data are for West Germany only.
2 Civilian unemployment rates, approximating U.S. concepts. Quarterly data for France and Germany should be viewed as less precise indicators of unemployment under U.S. concepts than the annual data.
3 There are breaks in the series for Canada (1976), Germany (1983 and 1991), France (1992), Italy (1986, 1991, and 1993), and United
States (1990 and 1994). Also, for Italy, data reflect new estimation procedures and updated population data introduced in July 1999. For details on break in series in 1990 and 1994 for United States, see footnote 5, Table B-35. For details on break in series for other countries, see
Comparative Civilian Labor Force Statistics, Ten Countries, U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, December 2000.
4 Hourly compensation in manufacturing, U.S. dollar basis. Data relate to all employed persons (wage and salary earners and the selfemployed) in the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, and United Kingdom, and to all employees (wage and salary earners) in
Italy. For Canada, France and United Kingdom, compensation adjusted to include changes in employment taxes that are not compensation to
employees, but are labor costs to employers.
