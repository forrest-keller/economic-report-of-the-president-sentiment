ECONOMIC REPORT

ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT
To the Congress of the United States:

Over the next few years our country faces several economic challenges that will test the will of our people and the capability of our
government. We must find ways to bring down a stubborn inflation
without choking off economic growth; we must channel a much
larger share of our national output to investment and reverse a
decade-long decline in productivity growth; and we must continue to
reduce the Nation's dangerous vulnerability to disruptive changes in
the world supply and price of oil.
In this Economic Report I set forth my views on how we can best
meet those problems. The following Annual Report of the Council of
Economic Advisers discusses the challenges and the policy responses in
greater detail. It is useful to start by recognizing that in many respects we approach these challenges from a position of strength, with
a record of significant economic progress, and the knowledge that
over the past 4 years our people and our government have successfully resolved a number of difficult and potentially divisive economic
issues. While it would be folly to close our minds to the stubbornness of the problems we face, it would serve the Nation equally ill to
underrate our strengths and our proven ability to handle difficult
issues.
Strengths and Accomplishments

During the economic turmoil that characterized the decade of the
1970s, and especially during the past 4 years, the American economy
succeeded in providing additional jobs for its people on a scale unsurpassed in our history. Employment grew by almost 25 percent
over the decade, and by more than 11 percent in the past 4 years
alone. Not only were jobs provided for a sharply rising population
reaching working age, but job opportunities were opened up by the
millions for new second earners, principally women. Neither Europe
nor Japan came even close to the job performance of the American
economy.
Along with employment, real per capita incomes grew during the
past 4 years, despite the losses forced on the Nation by the huge increases in world oil prices and the effects of a slowing growth in productivity. As the year 1980 ended, per capita income, after taxes and
adjusted for inflation, was some 8 percent higher than it was in 1976.




We have heard much about American industry losing its competitive edge in international markets and about the "deindustrialization"
of America. In fact, during the 3 years prior to the onset of the 1980
recessionâ€”and the effects of that recession will be transient-^the
growth of industrial production in the United States was larger than
it was in Germany, France, or the United Kingdom. The volume of
American nonfarm exports rose by 35 percent between 1977 and the
middle of 1980, and the share of U.S. exports among the total exports of the industrial countries rose by about 1 Vi percentage points,
reversing a declining trend that had been underway since the 1950s.
America's balance of payments is strong in large part because of its
superior export performance. Despite a massive $40-billion annual
drain of funds to pay for the oil-price increases of 1979 and 1980, our
exports of goods and services now exceed our imports. Unlike the
situation in most other oil-importing nations, our country's external
balance is in surplus.
The dollar is also strong. After a period of weakness in its value
abroad, we took decisive action 2 years ago to stabilize the dollar.
Since then, in a world of sharply changing circumstances and disruptions of oil supply, the dollar has remained strong, and has risen in
value compared to most major currencies.
While it is imperative that our country increase the share of its national output devoted to investment, the reason is not that investment has been weak in recent years. Between 1976 and 1980, real
business investment grew almost 6 percent a year, substantially faster
than GNP as a whole. Because of that rapid growth the share of business investment in GNP during the past 3 years exceeded that of any
other 3-year period in the last three decades.
There are other areas where the Nation has made more progress
than we sometimes realize. While we are properly concerned to limit
the growth in Federal spending and voice our impatience with the
waste and inefficiency that often exist in government programs, we
should not forget the good that has been accomplished with these
programs. Examples abound. In the early 1960s, for instance, infant
mortality in the United States was scandalously high compared to
other countries, and most of that high mortality was concentrated
among the poor. Due in large part to programs like Medicaid, infant
mortality has fallen sharply. More generally, we have dramatically improved access to medical care for the poor and the aged. Through
Federal grants we have strengthened the mass transit systems of our
major cities and helped our municipalities install critically needed
waste treatment plants. We have helped millions of young people,
who could not otherwise have afforded it, get a college education.




and we have provided job training for workers who needed new
skills.
Much attention is now focused on how to reduce the costs and
ease the burden of Federal regulation to protect the environment,
health, and safety. Concern about excessive regulatory costs is surely
warranted, and my Administration has taken a number of specific
steps to deal with the problem. In focusing attention on the burden
of regulation, however, we should not lose sight of the substantial
progress that has been made in enriching our lives, improving our
health, and beautifying our country.
Tackling Difficult Issues

During the past 4 years the Nation has taken a series of important
and in some cases painful steps to deal with its energy problems.
Starting almost 2 years ago, we began to phase out controls on domestic oil and natural gas prices. We thus moved to end the dangerous practice of holding U.S. energy prices below the world market
price, a practice which tended to subsidize wasteful consumption and
perpetuate our excessive dependence on oil imports.
Working with the Congress we also put in place the other principal
elements of a comprehensive program to increase energy production
and conserve energy use. We levied a windfall profits tax to divert the
inevitable windfalls from oil decontrol to pay for the National Energy
Program initiatives and to reduce the impact of decontrol on the poor.
Partly as a result of these policies we have begun to see dramatic
results in both the supply and conservation of energy. There are now
70 percent more drilling rigs in operation than when my Administration took office, and the number of oil and gas wells being drilled
has reached a new record. By late 1980 the United States was importing almost 30 percent less oil than it did 2 years ago and our gasoline use had dropped by more than 10 percent over the same period.
While some of the reduction in energy use was due to the recession,
most of it reflects real energy conservation.
What has happened in energy policy over the past 4 years augurs
well for our country's future. Decontrolling domestic oil and gas was
painful. It pushed up the prices each of us pay for driving and for
heating our homes and added to our immediate inflation difficulties.
But we showed that we were willing to take such painful steps when
they were necessary in our Nation's longer-run interest. Because we
are large-scale producers as well as consumers of energy, the energy
problem was potentially a highly divisive issue in our country, involving the redistribution of hundreds of billions of dollars, pitting producer against consumer and one region of the Nation against another. But after prolonged and sometimes heated debate, we arrived




at an approach that took account of the legitimate concerns of all
groups and at the same time furthered the national interest. Dealing
with the Nation's remaining economic problems will also require
painful measures and the reconciliation of a number of different interests. Our handling of the energy problem should raise our confidence that we can be successful elsewhere.
We have also had major successes in other fields. After decades of
inaction, the past 4 years have seen the elimination of price-propping
and competition-deadening regulations in a number of American industries. In these 4 years we witnessed more progress in economic
deregulation than at any other time in the century. In the face of
great skepticism and initial opposition, the executive branch, the
Congress, and some of the independent regulatory agencies have
deregulated or drastically reduced regulation in the airline, trucking,
and railroad industries, and in banking and other financial institutions. We have also made a promising start in the communications
industry. The transportation, communications, and finance industries
comprise a triad that links the various strands of our economy together. Better performance in these industries should have effects far
beyond their own boundaries.
The gains from deregulation will be substantial. For example, productivity and efficiency will be directly increased as transportation
load factors are improved and empty backhauls reduced. One survey
of studies estimates that reform in the trucking industry alone will
lead to $5 billion in annual cost reductions. Even more important
will be the longer-run spur to innovation and the increased flexibility
that comes from opening up these industries to the fresh winds of
competition.
Population trends will be working to help the country deal with
some of its economic problems in the 1980s, whereas in the late
1960s and 1970s these trends required some difficult adjustments.
The generation of the postwar baby boom began entering the labor
market in the 1960s and the influx of new workers continued during
the 1970s. The percentage of the population aged 16 to 24 rose
sharply. And as birth rates slowed, women entered the labor force in
ever increasing numbers. On average, the labor force became less experienced, and average productivity per worker suffered. The increased proportion of women and young people in the labor force
also contributed to an increase in the average unemployment rate because the transition from school or home to job takes time and because these new workers sometimes had periods of unemployment as
they explored different career possibilities.
Because of the slowdown in birth rates in the past 15 years, the
1980s will see about half as fast a growth in the labor force as in the




1970s. The proportion of experienced workers will rise, contributing
to an increase in productivity, while the proportion of young people
will fall, leading to a drop in unemployment.
There are a number of reasons, therefore, to confront with hope
the economic challenges that face us. We have a solid record of
achievement. In the fields of energy and deregulation we have already laid the foundations on which the future can build. And there
are some favorable trends underway that should help raise productivity and reduce unemployment in the years ahead.
Unresolved Problems

Despite much progress in recent years, we are faced with some serious problems. An inflation that was already bad became worse after
the 1979 oil-price increase. Productivity growth, which had been declining sporadically for a decade, virtually ceased in the last several
years. And although we have made substantial progress in adapting
our economy to a world of higher oil prices, we remain dangerously
vulnerable to serious supply disruptions originating abroad.
These problems are closely related to each other. Our inflation
stems in part from our oil vulnerability and our slowing productivity
growth. High and rising inflation, in turn, tends to cause economic
reactions that depress productivity. As we make progress in one of
these areas, we will also make progress in the others.
None of the problems is so intractable that we cannot overcome it.
But all are so deep-seated that progress will come slowly, only with
persistence, and at the cost of some sacrifice on the part of us all.
Inflation

In the first half of the 1960s inflation averaged about 1 percent a
year, so low as to be virtually unnoticeable. In the past 15 years,
however, the underlying rate of inflation has risen sporadically but
inexorably and it is now running at about 10 percent a year.
During those 15 years there have been three major episodes in
which the rate of inflation surged upward. The first came in the late
1960s, when the Vietnam war and the Great Society programs were
financed for a number of years without a tax increase. The consequent high budget deficits during a period of economic prosperity
generated strong inflationary pressures as total spending became excessive relative to the Nation's productive capacity. The second inflationary surge, which came in the early 1970s, was associated with the
first massive oil-price increase, a worldwide crop shortage which
drove up food prices, and an economy which again became somewhat overheated in 1972 and 1973. The third inflationary episode
came in 1979 and 1980. It was principally triggered by another massive oil-price increase, but part of the rise in inflation may also have




been due to overall demand in the economy pressing on available
supply. Throughout the past decade, the slowing growth in productivity has pushed up the increase in business costs, adding its bit to the
rise of inflation.
Late in each of the three inflationary episodes monetary and fiscal
restraints were applied, and at the end of each a recession took place,
with rising unemployment and idle capacity. Inflation did fall back
somewhat, but at the end of each recession it had not declined to the
level from which it started. And so the inflationary process has been
characterized by ratchet-like behavior. A set of inflationary causes
raises the rate of inflation; when the initiating factors disappear, inflation does not recede to its starting position despite the occurrence
of recession; the wage-price spiral then tends to perpetuate itself at a
new and higher level. Instead of an occasional 3 percentage point
rise in inflation, which disappeared when the initial causes of the inflation were gone, our basic inflation rate rose first from 1 to 4 percent, then from 4 to 7 percent, and in this latest episode from 7 to
10 percent. It is this downward insensitivity of inflation in the face of
economic slack that has given the last 15 years their inflationary bias.
A number of facts that are important for economic policy can be
drawn from this history. First, excessive demand in the economy, fed
by an overly large Federal budget deficit or excess growth in the
money supply, was the major factor in one of the three inflationary
episodes and played a subsidiary role in the other two. Second, twice
in the last decade the tendency for government to stimulate the
economy somewhat too freely during the recovery from recession
probably played a role in retarding the decline of inflation or renewing its acceleration. That is why I was so insistent that a tax cut designed for quick economic stimulus not be enacted last year. Third,
because the rate of increase in wages and prices did not decline very
readily in response to the discipline of budgetary and monetary restraint, that restraint resulted only partly in reduced inflation; it also
tended to retard the growth of output and employment. Finally, massive increases in world oil prices have twice in the past 7 years helped
trigger a major inflationary episode. While we cannot eliminate Our
vulnerability to such shocks, a reduction in that vulnerability will improve our chances of avoiding new inflation in the future.
These realities dictate the broad tasks that economic policy must
accomplish over the years ahead:
Our monetary and fiscal policies must apply steady anti-inflationary restraint

to the economy. The restraint must be strong and persistent enough to
convince those who set wages and prices that the government means
to stand by its guns in the anti-inflation fight. But it must not be so
severe or so restrictive as to prohibit even moderate economic




growth and recovery, and thus collapse under its own political
unreality.
We must seek means to reduce inflation at a lower cost in lost output and

employment These include measures to increase investment, the
reform of regulation, and incomes policies. An increase in investment
raises productivity growth which, in turn, tends to slow the rise in
business costs and prices. Demand restraint will then produce more
reduction of inflation and less reduction in output. Measures to lower
regulatory costs and increase competition and flexibility in our economy will also directly lower inflationary pressures and let us have
more economic growth without sacrificing our inflation goals. An improved set of voluntary incomes policies can directly influence wages
and prices in the direction of moderation, and thereby bring inflation
down faster and at lower costs.
Finally, we must build upon the foundations already laid and hasten our
progress toward energy conservation and increased domestic energy supplies. W e

must also work to improve our capability of weathering a severe disruption in foreign oil supplies, since even a highly successful energy
program will still leave our economy vulnerable to such disruptions
over the coming decade.
Last August I outlined an Economic Revitalization Program that
would accomplish the tasks set forth above. The specific economic
policies I am recommending to the Congress in my 1982 Budget Message and in this Economic Report incorporate the elements of that revitalization program.
Budget and Tax Policies

It is now estimated that the Federal budget for the current fiscal
year 1981 will be in deficit by $55 billion, substantially more than I
had hoped or planned. In part the size of that deficit reflects the loss
of revenues induced by the recession from which our economy is
now beginning to recover. Had the unemployment rate remained at
the 6 percent level where it stood when I first submitted the 1981
budget last year, the deficit would now be less than $20 billion.
The size of the 1981 deficit also reflects three major factors which
have driven up the estimates of Federal spending in the past 12
months. First, higher interest rates since the budget was originally
submitted have added about $9 billion. Second, payments under many
Federal programs, such as social security, are indexed to the consumer price index, which has proven in recent years to overstate significantly the actual rise in the cost of living because of the way it treats
housing and mortgage interest costs. And third, defense spending was
increased above original estimates.
As part of a program of anti-inflationary fiscal restraint I am recommending a number of steps that will help to cut the deficit in half,




to $27.5 billion in the new budget for fiscal year 1982, and reduce it
still further to $8 billion in 1983, despite the substantial increases in
defense spending which I find it necessary to recommend for those
years:
â€¢ Beyond exerting strict control over requests for new appropriations for ongoing programs, my 1982 budget sets forth a detailed list of requests to the Congress for the legislation needed
to pare some $9 billion in spending in both fiscal 1982 and fiscal
1983. If enacted, these savings would help make possible a reduction in the share of GNP taken by Federal spending from
23.3 percent in 1981 to 23.0 percent in 1982 and 22.6 percent in
1983.
â€¢ The personal tax reductions which I am proposing should take
effect on January 1, 1982, rather than at some earlier date in
1981.
â€¢ I am renewing my request to the Congress for a modest increase
in the tax on gasoline; there is no better way to provide additional revenues for reducing the budget deficit than a measure
which simultaneously reduces our imports of foreign oil.
â€¢ I still strongly support the national health insurance proposal that I
earlier submitted to the Congress, but the need for budgetary
restraint to control inflation requires that its introduction be
delayed until more budgetary room is available and adequate cost
containment is in place.
In order to avoid repetition of the recent situation in which many
Federal payments rose too rapidly because they are tied to an index
which does not accurately reflect changes in the cost of living, I am
recommending that the Congress authorize use of a more representative index. I am informed by the Commissioner that the Bureau of
Labor Statistics is now producing an index of this type and that it can
quickly be made available on a timely basis.
Although my 1982 budget emphasizes the need for fiscal restraint,
and for reduction of the deficit, it also takes the first major step in a
long-term program of tax reductions aimed at increasing capital formation.
The causes of the longer-term slowdown in productivity growth are
manyâ€”and some of them are still unknown. But a major depressing
factor has been the failure of the Nation's capital stock to increase
relative to its rapidly growing labor force in the past 5 or 6 years.
Unlike earlier periods, American workers have not been working with
increasing amounts of capital. Improving the trend of productivity
growth will require restoring the growth of capital per worker.
Higher investment will also be critically required throughout
America's energy-using industries to speed up the replacement of




10

older energy-inefficient plant and machinery with newer energysaving capital. In addition, a large expansion of energy-producing industriesâ€”both conventional and nonconventionalâ€”will add further
to investment needs.
According to estimates made by my Council of Economic Advisers,
the combined tasks of restoring the earlier growth of capital per
worker and meeting the Nation's energy needs call for an increase in
the share of investment in GNP from its recent IOV2 percent to 12V2
or 13 percent during the 1980s. This would require an expansion in
investment by about one-fifth above the level that might normally be
expected. It will not occur without the introduction of policies to
make it happen.
To begin this task, my 1982 budget incorporates the two major
changes in tax laws that I outlined last August in my Economic Revitalization Program to improve incentives and provide increased
sources of financing for business investment. The first and most important proposal is a major liberalization of tax allowances for depreciation. Because tax depreciation is now based on the historic cost of
an asset, inflation reduces allowable tax deductions relative to the
cost of replacing an asset and thus lowers the profitability of investment. Inflation also distorts the tax treatment of assets with different
useful lives. I am proposing a new approach to depreciation worked
out "by the Department of the Treasury which substantially simplifies
depreciation accounting and increases the allowable rates of depreciation by about 40 percent. This approach, unlike sorjne other depreciation liberalization proposals that have been introduced in the Congress, tends to avoid major distortions of economic incentives since it
provides approximately equal percentage increases in allowable depreciation rates for each industry.
I also propose that the Congress expand investment incentives by
improving the investment tax credit. That credit is now only partially
available for short-lived assets; it should be made fully available.
Even more importantly, part of the investment tax credit should be
made refundable. Firms should be able to claim 30 percent of the
value of the credit even if they had no tax liabilities for the year. In
this way firms with substantial investment needs but with no current
earnings can be supported in their efforts to rejuvenate and expand
capital assets. Among these are younger and smaller firms that are
just beginning to grow, and larger industries undergoing transition,
such as autos and steel. The latter may temporarily be experiencing
depressed profitability but still have major investment needs for retooling or for new industrial facilities.
These two proposals would reduce business tax liabilities by $9 billion in calendar year 1981, $15 billion in 1982, and by 1985 the re-




11

ductions would amount to over $27 billion. We estimate that with enactment of these new incentives business investment should increase
5-10 percent above its normally expected level in 1982, with additional gains thereafter.
While providing additional incentives for business investment, we
can also move on a carefully phased basis to reduce other taxes in a
way that improves both economic efficiency and tax equity. The Congress should enact an income tax credit for both employers and employees that would approximately offset the scheduled rise in social
security payroll taxes that occurred in January of this year. To make
the benefits available to lower-income workers who have no tax liability, I also propose an increase in the earned income tax credit. But,
as I pointed out earlier in this Report, the critical importance of reducing the budget deficit as part of the fight against inflation has led
me to recommend that this reduction take effect at the beginning of
1982, by which time the growth of revenues will make such a reduction consistent with overall budgetary objectives.
At the present time one of the major inequities in our tax system is
the so-called marriage penalty. Under a wide range of circumstances
a husband and wife, each working, will together pay a higher tax than
if they were not married. I propose that this penalty be eased by
making a tax credit available to the lesser-earning spouse. The credit
should be introduced in two steps, half in 1982 and the other half in
1983.
I also propose that the Congress enact several important tax reforms: income from interest and dividends should be put on an equal
footing with wages and other incomes by withholding taxes at the
source; the excessive issuance of several types of tax-exempt bonds
should be curtailed; and the use of certain commodity futures transactions as a tax avoidance scheme should be prohibited.
The central feature of the tax policies I am proposing is their emphasis on increasing investment. By 1985, an unusually high 45 percent of the tax reductions will be directed toward spurring investment. But even this will not itself be sufficient to raise investment to
the levels our country will need in the decade ahead in order to improve its productivity growth and deal with its energy problems.
Careful control of Federal spending, however, will create the leeway
for additional investment-oriented tax reductions in later years,
within the framework of the overall budgetary restraint required to
fight inflation. I do not believe that we should now commit budgetary resources to large-scale personal tax cuts which will stimulate
consumption far more than investment and thereby foreclose the
possibility of meeting the Nation's critical investment requirements.

Monetary Policy

Monetary policy is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve
System, which is independent of the Executive. I respect that
independence. But there are several broad aspects of monetary policy
having to do with public perceptions that do fall within the purview
of the President in his role as national leader.
Sustained restraint in monetary policy is a prerequisite to lowering
inflation. The Federal Reserve exercises this restraint principally by
keeping a strict limit on the growth of the Nation's money supply. In
October 1979 the Federal Reserve modified its earlier policies and operating procedures to increase sharply the emphasis it gives to controlling the money supply. The Federal Reserve each year sets targets for monetary growth and seeks to hold the growth of the money
supply within the targets. Increasingly the public in general and the
financial community in particular have come to associate the credibility of the Federal Reserve and its determination to fight inflation with
its success in keeping money growth continuously within the preannounced targets. It is very important, however, that public opinion
not hold the Federal Reserve to such a rigid form of monetary targeting as to deprive it of the flexibility it needs to conduct a responsible monetary policy.
Temporary fluctuations in monetary conditions can sometimes
cause the money supply to overrun or underrun the targets for a
short period of time without any damage to anti-inflation objectives.
Furthermore, economic developments occasionally occur that may
make it appropriate for the Federal Reserve to modify the targets it
had originally set, or to deviate from its announced aim of lowering
the targets each year. If the public interprets occasional necessary
changes in the longer-run monetary target ranges or short-run deviations of actual money growth from those targets as evidence that the
Federal Reserve has lessened its determination to fight inflation and
as a reason to expect higher inflation in the future, the Federal Reserve is confronted with an untenable situation. If it fails to make the
adjustment in the monetary targets that is called for by a major
change in economic circumstances, monetary policy may produce unwanted results. But if the Federal Reserve does change the targets in
the face of public misunderstanding, it risks an impairment of its
credibility. The same dilemma exists with respect to allowing shortrun deviations in money growth from the target ranges.
Only if the public understands the realities, and the complexities,
of carrying out an anti-inflationary monetary policy can the Federal
Reserve successfully apply the measured restraint necessary to wring
out inflation at minimum cost in production and jobs. On the one
hand, the country must face the fact that in a world with a stubborn

10 percent inflation rate, keeping a tight rein on the growth of the
money supply inevitably leads to interest rates that average significantly higher than those we were accustomed to in earlier periods of
lower inflation. On the other hand, the public and the financial community must not become so obsessed with the mechanics of monetary targeting that any change in targets or any short-run deviation of
money growth from those targets is taken as a sign that monetary restraint has been weakened.
Without reasoned and persistent monetary restraint, inflation
cannot be licked. Perhaps more than in any other area of economic
policy, however, achieving success in monetary policy depends on an
informed public opinion.
Incomes Policies

For the past 2 years my Administration has urged business and
labor to comply with a set of voluntary pay and price standards. Even
though it was introduced at a very difficult timeâ€”just before the oilprice explosion of 1979â€”this voluntary program of wage and price
restraint did moderate the pace of inflation. It significantly reducedâ€”
although it could not eliminateâ€”the effect of the oil-price rise on the
underlying inflation rate.
After 2 years of operation there is general agreement that the current pay and price standards would not continue to be effective in
their present form and without additional support. For this reason we
have carefully examined the possibility of strengthening a voluntary
incomes policy by using the tax system to provide incentives to firms
and workers to slow the rate of inflation. This approach has been labeled a tax-based incomes policy (TIP). The detailed results of our
review are contained in the accompanying Annual Report of the Council
of Economic Advisers.

Broadly, we have concluded that an approach which provided a tax
reduction to workers in firms whose average pay increase did not
exceed some standard, set as part of a voluntary incomes policy,
would be feasible and effective in helping to lower inflation. Two
major conditions apply, however. First, such a policy must be a supplement to, not a substitute for, fiscal and monetary restraint. Without such restraint an incomes policy will produce only fleeting reductions in inflation or none at all. Second, a TIP program is likely to be
desirable only on a temporary basis. After several years, such a program might cease to be effective and could induce significant distortions into wage relationships throughout the economy. But as an interim device to hasten the reduction in inflation and so shorten the
period of reduced output and employment growth, a TIP program
could serve the Nation well.




14

If the growth of Federal spending is restrained, periodic tax reductions will be both feasible and necessary in the years ahead as inflation and economic growth push taxpayers into higher brackets and
raise average effective tax rates. Tax-based incomes policies are
novel, and most people are unfamiliar with either the opportunities
they present or the difficulties they pose. It is therefore highly unlikely that a TIP program could take effect in 1981. But it would be useful
for the public in general, and the Congress in particular, to begin now
to evaluate the pros and cons of TIP programs so that when the time
comes for the next round of Federal tax cuts a TIP program will be
seriously considered.
Energy

I am once again proposing that the Congress increase the Federal
excise tax on gasoline by 10 cents per gallon as an additional incentive to cut petroleum consumption. The need for this tax is, if anything, even greater than it was 7 months ago when the Congress
overturned my action to impose a gasoline conservation fee administratively.
We have once more seen a tightening of world oil supplies. The
massive inventories built up in late 1979 and early 1980 have been
drawn upon to make up for the loss of exports from Iran and Iraq. If
that conflict should continue or if exports do not return to normal,
the buffer which those record high inventories provided will be exhausted. Even in the last 2 months, we have seen significant escalation in prices charged by some OPEC members. National security requires us to put additional downward pressure on consumption of
gasoline and other petroleum products. If we do not, OPEC may do
it for us.
Paradoxically, one of the reasons given earlier for rejecting my
proposed tax was that it was too smallâ€”some would have preferred a
tax of 50 cents or even a dollar per gallon. Whether, over time, this
Nation should move toward gasoline taxes that are comparable with
those of our Western European allies is not a question that has to be
answered now. In any event, to do so overnight would shock the
economy excessively. At current gasoline consumption levels, a 50cent per gallon tax would draw approximately $50 billion per year
out of consumers' pockets and require excessive adjustments by consumers and industry. It is much more sensible to start with the level I
have proposed.
There is other important unfinished business to attend to in
energy. The Congress failed to complete work on my proposed
Energy Mobilization Board, but events since August of 1979 have
only made the case for the Board's creation more persuasive. It is
equally important that we move ahead with the production of substi-




15

tutes for petroleum. The Synthetic Fuels Corporation is established
and operating. Its missionâ€”to encourage commercial-scale production of synthetic fuels through risk-sharing with American industryâ€”
is vital.
My program of phased decontrol of domestic crude oil, along with
the revamping of natural gas pricing policy contained in the Natural
Gas Policy Act, is paying rich dividends. Drilling and seismic exploration have reached near-record levels. The Natural Gas Policy Act
should be reviewed, however, to ensure that progress toward decontrol of new natural gas is not jeopardized by the increasing gap between oil prices and their natural gas equivalent, since world oil
prices are now about twice those assumed in the act.
Our contingency planning to deal with a severe oil-supply disruption needs to be improved, since the authorities upon which many of
the existing plans are based will expire at the end of September of
this year. We have had underway for some time an examination of
which, if any, of these authorities should be extended and what additional authorities might be required. This work should be completed
as soon as possible.
Filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve must continue. The rate
of fill should be at least the 100,000 barrels per day required by the
Energy Security Act, and should, beyond that, be as high as can be
accommodated without disrupting world oil markets.
Increasing the Flexibility of Our Economy

Energy is not the only area where we must take additional steps to
improve the ability of the economy to adjust to the changes that will
be demanded of it in the years ahead. To the extent that we can
reduce barriers to the flow of labor, capital, and other resources from
inefficient to efficient uses, we can reduce inflationary pressures that
arise from bottlenecks and economic rigidities and simultaneously
speed up the pace of productivity growth.
We should not lose the momentum that has developed over the
past 4 years in reducing obsolete and costly economic regulations.
The Congress should complete its deliberations and pass legislation
similar to that which I suggested last year to complete the task of
modernizing our system of telecommunications regulation.
In the broad area of environmental, health and safety regulation,
where deregulation is not an appropriate solution, we must expand
on the successful beginning that has been made in providing greater
flexibility and incentives for firms to meet environmental requirements in more cost-effective ways.
We must also continue our efforts to assure that the Nation's regulatory priorities are sensible. Our Nation can afford a cleaner environment, safer products, and healthier workplaces, but it does not




16

have unlimited resources. Other national goals cry out for attention,
and we cannot afford waste in attempting to achieve any of them.
During the coming years, when many of our most important industries will be facing difficult adjustment pressures, we must avoid
taking shortsighted actions which block rather than promote this adjustment. Federal policies should indeed cushion the blow when
sharp external shocks force an industry, its workers, and the communities within which it is located to undergo massive change in a short
period of time. The programs of economic development and trade
assistance which exist to meet these needs should be humanely and
effectively administered. But such aid must be aimed at facilitating
adjustment to change, not preventing it. While we can and should
demand that all nations abide by internationally agreed-upon rules of
trade, we must avoid the temptation to use the discretion open to us
to prop up weak industries.
Summing Up: The Need for Balance

In the years immediately ahead, our country will be wrestling with
two central domestic issues. The first is economic in nature: How can
we reduce inflation while maintaining the economic growth that
keeps our people employed? The second is even broader: What is
the proper role of government in our society as spender of tax revenues and regulator of industry?
I am confident we can successfully come to grips with both of
these issues. We would make a costly mistake, however, if we approached these problems with the view that there is some single
answer to the economic problem and a single criterion for determining the role of government. The resolution of both of these great
issues demands a balancing of many approaches and many considerations. Indeed, the only helpful simple proposition is the one which
states that any simple and quick answer is automatically the wrong
one.
The approach I have set forth in this Report will successfully meet
the economic challenge. But it relies on not one but a number of essential elements. To reduce inflation we must be prepared for a
period of sustained budgetary and monetary restraint. But since we
know that this also tends to depress the growth of output and employment, we must not conclude that the greater the restraint the
better. We want a degree of restraint that takes into account society's
interest in employment and production as well as its concern to
lower inflation. We can improve our prospects significantly by introducing investment-oriented tax cuts that increase supply and productivity. But the supply response will not be so quick or so great as to
constitute an answer in and of itself. And, in particular, it would be
very dangerous to make budgetary policy in the belief that the supply




17

response can be so large as to wipe out the need for fiscal prudence
and budgetary restraint. We can improve our prospects still further
by the use of voluntary incomes policies, strengthened when budgetary resources become available by tax incentives for wage moderation. But, again, incomes policies alone will not do the job. If we try
to rely on them excessively, we will do more harm than good. Only
with a balance among the various elements, and only with persistence
in the realization that sure progress will come gradually, can we have
both lower inflation and better growth.
Sorting out the proper role of government also requires us to
strike a balance. At times Federal spending has grown too rapidly.
But in recent years its growth did not result from the introduction of
a host of new government programs by spendthrift politicians or a
surge of profligacy by wasteful bureaucrats. It stemmed mainly from
two sources: first, increased military spending to meet national security goals that are overwhelmingly supported by the American
people; and second, the growth of long established and broadly accepted social security and social insurance programs that are directly
or indirectly indexed against inflation or automatically responsive to
an increase in unemployment.
There is some waste. There is some abuse. I have instituted a
number of reforms to cut it back. I am sure my successors will continue this important effort. But waste and abuse are not the fundamental issues. The essence of the challenge that faces us is how to
balance the various benefits that government programs confer on us
against their costs in terms of higher taxes, higher deficits* and sometimes higher inflation.
It is my view that we must strike the balance so as to restrict for
some time the overall growth of Federal spending to less than the
growth of our economy, despite the faster increase of the military
component of the budget. As a consequence, in my 1982 budget I
have proposed a series of program reductions. I have suggested a
delay in the effective date of new programs I believe important. I
have recommended improvements in the index we use to adjust Federal programs for inflation.
I think we will do a better job in striking the right balance over the
years ahead if we keep two principles in mind: The first is to recognize reality. The choices are in fact difficult, and we should not pretend that all we have to do is find wasteful programs with zero benefits. The second is to act with compassion. Some government programs
provide special benefits for the poor and the disadvantaged; while
these programs must not be immune from review and reform, they
should not bear the brunt of the reductions.




18

The same general viewpoint is appropriate when we approach the
problem of government as regulator, especially in protecting the environment, health, and safety. When we first awoke to the fact of
generations of environmental neglect, we rushed to compensate for
our mistake and paid too little attention to problems of cost and effectiveness. Sometimes the laws we passed and the deadlines we set
took too little account of their economic impact. For 4 years my Administration has been engaged in a major program of finding ways to
make regulations more cost-effective and to strike a reasonable balance between environmental concerns and economic costs. A strong
foundation has been laid. Much remains to be done. But lasting
progress will not come unless we realize that there is a balance to be
struck. Those who believe that virtually all regulation is bad and that
the best regulation is a dead regulation will come to grips with the
real problem no more successfully than the enthusiasts who believe
that concern with regulatory costs is synonymous with lack of concern for the environment.
I believe that the government has indeed overregulated and that
regulatory reform must continue to be a major objective of the Federal Government, as it has been during my Administration. But I also
believe that true reform involves finding better ways to identify and
to give proper consideration to gains as well as costs.
My reading of the distant and the nearby past gives me confidence
that the American people can meet the challenges ahead. There are
no simple formulas. There will be no quick victories. But an understanding of the diverse concerns we have, a pragmatic willingness to
bring to bear a varied array of weapons, arid persistence in the effort
will bring success.

CHAPTER 1

Inflation and Growth in the 1980s
IN THE 1980s THE UNITED STATES will confront a variety of
stubborn problems that have developed during the past 15 years.
Chief among these problems is one that is shared by most other industrial countriesâ€”the persistence of large wage and price increases,
even in the face of high unemployment and slack production. This
problem poses the single most important challenge to U.S. economic
policyâ€”reducing inflation while maintaining a reasonably prosperous
and growing economy.
Many other problems are themselves closely related to inflation,
either as cause or as consequence. Our Nation's productivity growth
has virtually halted in recent years. The era of cheap energy has
ended, the world has grown vulnerable to supply disruptions, and the
course of domestic inflation and unemployment has become closely
dependent on economic and political developments in the oil-rich
but politically unstable Middle East. Meanwhile, the struggle to find a
proper balance between a clean, healthy, and safe environment, on
the one hand, and satisfactory economic growth with lower inflation,
on the other, will continue. All of these developments, together with
the growing interdependence of the world economy, have set in
motion major changes in economic structure, occupational skill requirements, and industrial location that will continue to pose sizable
adjustment problems to many industries, communities, and workers.
While the magnitude of these economic challenges is cause for serious concern, it does not warrant pessimism. During the 1970s the
U.S. economy performed quite well in many important respects. Over
that decade our country outperformed most other major countries in
providing jobs for its people (Table 1). Employment grew almost 25
percent as the American economy created jobs not only for millions
of youths entering the labor market for the first time but also for millions of women, who found job opportunities in growing numbers.
This performance continued through the last years of the decade at
an increased pace. While the growth in the number of employed persons was temporarily interrupted by the recession of 1980, the basic
performance was virtually unparalleled.

Some of the rapid job creation was associated with the low rate of
productivity growth, but production also increased rapidly. As shown
in Table 2, the growth of industrial production in the United States,
both during the decade as a whole and in the last years of the
decade, compared favorably with that of other large industrial countries.

Whatever the problems of the American economy, they do not
arise from an inability to generate large increases in jobs and production. But if the challenges raised by chronic high inflation, energy
and environmental problems, ebbing productivity growth, and structural readjustment are not faced, the potential for further growth will
not be realized.
In recent years the United States has successfully begun to tackle
some of its most difficult problems. After years of inaction followed
by several years of vigorous debate, and with some painful sacrifices,
we have put into place the major elements of an energy program
which is already paying dividends in the form of greater energy conservation and improved supply prospects. After decades in which the
documented evidence about the greater productivity and efficiency to
be gained from economic deregulation had been ignored, this Nation
finally acted during the past 4 years to deregulate its airline, trucking,
and railroad industries, and major elements of its financial industry.
And during the 1980 recession the executive branch and the Congress showed their willingness to maintain the restraint and discipline




30

needed to control inflation by resisting strong pressures for a hasty
and potentially inflationary fiscal stimulus.
As this Report will have several occasions to point out, there are no
simple and clear-cut answers to the complex economic problems confronting our country. Many of them will yield only gradually to persistent efforts pursued on many fronts. In some cases where our
knowledge is particularly uncertain, we may have to try several approaches before finding an effective solution. Nevertheless, the willingness to tackle difficult problems which this country has shown in
the last several years provides a reason to temper concern about the
seriousness of our economic problems with a belief that they can be
met successfully.
The first two chapters of this Report examine the major economic
challenges identified above and discuss appropriate policies to deal
with them. In most instances the Administration has already made
specific policy recommendations, and these are reflected here. But in
some cases the chapters identify and evaluate additional policy options on which decisions would have been made had this Administration continued in office. The third chapter of this Report examines the
Nation's general economic performance in 1980 and the outlook for
1981 and 1982, while the fourth chapter turns to issues pertaining to
the international economy.
Chapter 1 addresses the broad problem of reducing inflation while
achieving satisfactory growth in employment, output, and productivity. It considers selected aspects of both demand-side and supply-side
measures. After discussing the history and causes of inflation, the
chapter outlines the role and the limitations of demand management
policies, examines the special problems of setting and carrying out
anti-inflationary monetary policies in a world of high inflation and
frequent economic disturbances, and evaluates the potential usefulness of a tax-based incomes policy as a method for reducing inflation. The remainder of the chapter is devoted to supply-side policies
and pays particular attention to two subjects: first, the importance of
increasing the share of the Nation's output devoted to capital formation and the macroeconomic policies necessary to achieve that goal;
and second, the integration of supply-oriented tax reductions with
overall policies of demand restraint.
Chapter 2 deals with major problems in particular sectors or markets. Specifically, it covers six major topics: energy, regulation, banking, agriculture, the labor market, and the generic problems of structural adjustment among industries confronting economic change.
Broadly speaking, the policy measures discussed in Chapter 2 are
aimed at increasing supply and productivity by improving the efficiency with which particular markets work and adjust to change. Like




31

the macroeconomic policies examined in Chapter 1, these too are a
means of reducing inflation and speeding economic growth.
INFLATION
The Nation has for some time now experienced inflation that
would have been unimaginable in earlier days. Although people's
lives and the course of business may not, at first glance, appear radically different from what they were in 1960 before the recent inflation began, inflation has taken a very real toll. The uncertainty it has
brought with it cannot be measured, but the consequent anxiety has
torn at the fabric of our society. People feel less able to mark their
progress and fear that the next round of inflation will leave them
poorer. In a number of waysâ€”such as introducing cost-of-living adjustments into wage contracts and indexing the benefits of social welfare programsâ€”institutions have evolved to compensate for some of
the uncertainty. But these institutions may sometimes only heighten
the arbitrary redistribution of income brought on by inflationâ€”redistribution that society often finds undesirable and unfair. In addition
to these painful effects, moreover, inflation reduces the Nation's
prospects for growth. The reduction may not appear dramatic, but it
impairs the efficiency of the free-enterprise system and discourages
capital investment, innovation, and risk-taking.
Rising prices, it should be remembered, are not in the aggregate
synonymous with a reduction in real income. When prices rise, someone receives the additional revenues. And for the economy as a
whole, rising prices have gone together with rising money incomes.
But a wage or salary increase comes infrequently and in a large lump,
while prices tend to increase all the time. Furthermore, a pay increase may be viewed as uncertain and as a reward for effort, but
price increases seem entirely beyond a consumer's control. As a
result, a recent wage increase may be forgotten when the grocery bill
rises. Thus rising prices are often treated as something that directly
lower real incomes, even when in fact for the Nation as a whole they
do not. Of course, the resulting anxiety is no less real.
But when the country pays sharply higher prices to foreign oil producers, that does indeed lower its real income. We are poorer because we receive less oil than we did previously for the same amount
of money. That would be true whether or not general inflation followed increases in the price of oil. The induced inflation, in the form
of generally higher wages, salaries, and prices, is not the cause of the
real income declineâ€”the Nation's higher oil bill is.
A similar phenomenon occurs when growth in productivity slows.
Slower productivity growth leads to a slower rise in real incomes. A




32

decline in productivity growth may be accompanied by an unchanged
pace of wage and salary increases, in which case inflation will rise.
But a slackening of productivity growth may also result in lower wage
increases and an unchanged inflation rate. In either case the same
slowdown in the growth of real income would have occurred. It was
not caused by inflation.
Although some of the simpler notions that associate inflation with
real income loss are wrong, high and rising rates of inflation do
indeed weaken the Nation's macroeconomic performance. Inflation
can contribute to slower growth in productivity by discouraging investment in two ways. First, some evidence suggests that when inflation increases, not only do people's expectations of future inflation
rise, but their expectations tend to become much more uncertain. In
this climate, expectations depend less on fact and more on opinion,
rumor, and subjective perceptions. Innovative investments and other
higher-risk economic activities, the seedbeds of future productivity
growth, seem even riskier and are less likely to be undertaken. Meanwhile, businesses and households devote increasing effort to shielding themselves from the effects of inflation, often by speculating in
nonproductive assets. Second, as discussed later in this chapter, the
interaction between inflation and the tax system can indirectly discourage business investment and also affect the types of assets
chosen, thereby distorting investment decisions and resulting in a
less productive capital stock.
In a market economy the structure of relative prices and costs, and
the yardstick of business profits, provide signals to businesses about
what to produce, what inputs to buy, and when to buy them. The
system responds to changes in those signalsâ€”changes in the price of
aluminum relative to copper, of glass relative to tin, and in wages relative to prices. But in a period of high inflation, with a consequent
increase in uncertainty, it is much more difficult to distinguish signals
from random events. It is hard to know to what extent particular
wage and price increases simply represent general inflation or are
conveying a "real" message. As a consequence, it is easier to make
wrong decisions. Inefficiencies grow, and productivity falls.
The uncertainty created by inflation also obstructs the conduct of
economic policy. To the extent that high and rising inflation unhinges expectations from reality, the connection between economic
policies and their results is attenuated, and the difficulties of policymaking are increased. Inflation itself is then more difficult to control.
There is a temptation for macroeconomic policy to make announcements and take measures to impress the markets, but the intangible
gains so purchased tend to evaporate rapidly.




Uncertainty is in large part to blame for the damage done by inflation. In addition to causing serious worry among individuals planning
their economic futures, uncertainty interferes with the efficient operation of markets and thereby lowers the productive potential of the
economy. Although measures to cure inflation may themselves be
painful, over the longer term a reduction in inflation will yield rewards in terms of increased productivity growth and real income.
UNDERSTANDING INFLATION

To understand our persistent inflation, it is necessary to look
beyond the commonly cited price statistics. Such statistics as the consumer price index (CPI), the various producer price indexes, and the
national income account deflators are specialized measures of inflation, each with its own idiosyncrasies. They may be sharply influenced by fluctuations in food and energy prices or in mortgage interest rates and therefore sometimes exaggerate and sometimes understate the fundamental trend of inflation. As an example, in July 1980
the consumer price index showed inflation at zero while the producer
price index (PPI) for finished goods showed inflation at an annual
rate of almost 20 percent. It is therefore useful to construct measures
which better reveal the true course of inflation.
Charts 1 and 2 present two different statistical series which together approximate the basic trend, or "underlying rate," of inflation.
The underlying rate is the rate of inflation which today's economy
would tend to perpetuate if supply and demand remained roughly in
balance and no special factors came into play, such as a large rise in
oil or food prices.
Since payments to labor are estimated to account for almost twothirds of total production costs, prices over the longer term tend to
move in conjunction with changes in unit labor costs. Chart 1 shows
a special measure of that changeâ€”the rate at which wages and fringe
benefits are increasing minus the trend of growth in productivity.
Chart 2 is a version of the price index for personal consumption expenditures calculated by the Department of Commerce. It excludes
the volatile components of food and energy. Each series tells basically the same story.

Over the past 15 years the underlying rate of inflation has risen
from about 1 percent in the first half of the 1960s to 9 or 10 percent
now. The increase has not been steady. Instead, there have been
three major episodes. Each period began with a sharp increase in the
underlying rate and ended with the rate falling only part way to its
original level. Thus, each new inflationary period has started from a
higher underlying level than its predecessor.
The first jump in the underlying inflation rate came during the
Vietnam war, when a large rise in both military expenditures and
outlays for Great Society programs was financed for several years
without a tax increase. This led to a very large Federal budget deficit
superimposed on an economy already operating at a high level. The
result was a classic example of an excess of demand over supply. The
underlying inflation rate rose from about 1 percent in the 1961-65
period to 4 or 5 percent by 1969. By the end of the decade the
forces pushing up the inflation rate receded as taxes were belatedly
raised and Vietnam war outlays declined. Although the economy entered a recession in 1970, the underlying rate of inflation continued
at about 4 to 5 percent until wage and price controls were introduced in August 1971. For a short period the controls held down inflation in prices but did not reduce the growth in costs.
Another inflationary episode began in late 1973 as the result of
two major developments. A poor crop year worldwide caused a sharp
surge in food prices, and the Arab oil embargo at the end of 1973
was followed by a threefold increase in world oil prices. Although the
full impact of the increase in world oil prices was muted in the
United States by price controls on domestically produced oil, energy
prices and the prices of energy-using products increased sharply. Aggregate demand grew sharply in 1972 and early in 1973. A worldwide boom led to a major inventory buildup and a widely based acceleration of raw materials prices in 1973-74. Finally, the distortions
and inequities brought on by wage and price controls created irresistible pressures for easing the controls in 1973 and eliminating them
in 1974. When this occurred, there was a burst of price and wage
increases.
When this burst receded, the U.S. economy entered its worst recession in 40 years. While the underlying rate of inflation fell back from
its late 1974 peak, it did not fall to its starting point. Aside from brief
fluctuations, it settled down in the 6 to 7 percent range from 1976
through 1978.
The most recent inflationary episode was triggered when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) raised oil prices
in 1979 and early 1980. Relative to the size of the U.S. economy, the
recent price increase was larger than the 1973-74 increase. By the




36

end of 1974 the world price of oil had tripled from about $4 to
about $12 per barrel, thereby adding about $18 billion to our bill for
imported oil, or roughly 1.4 percent of gross national product
(GNP). Since the price of domestically produced petroleum (which at
that time accounted for about two-thirds of the petroleum used in
the United States) was restrained by controls, the average U.S. price
remained lower than prices throughout the rest of the world. Still,
domestic oil prices almost doubled, so that the total increase in consumer costs was almost 3 percent of GNP.
During the most recent shock the price of imported oil rose from
about $15 per barrel at the end of 1978 to $35 at the close of 1980.
This added about $50 billion to the cost of the oil we now import
into the United States, or about 2 percent of GNP. Since domestic
crude oil prices were in the process of being decontrolled during this
period, the price of domestic oil increased by about $15 per barrel,
adding another $60 billion to the oil costs paid by consumers.
The forces of inflation during this period were also strengthened
to some extent by the behavior of aggregate demand. There was
some acceleration of wages in 1978 as unemployment fell sharply.
And for a time in late 1978 and early 1979, there appeared to be some
excess demand in product markets.
Spurred by these developments, inflation surged in 1979 and early
1980. As measured by the CPIâ€”which was also heavily influenced by
sharp increases in mortgage interest ratesâ€”inflation reached annual
rates of 15 to 20 percent in the first quarter of 1980. By the spring of
1980 the forces that had given rise to this inflationary episode subsided, and the economy entered a brief recession. The measured inflation rate receded from its peak, but the underlying rate appears to
have leveled off in the 9 to 10 percent range, up several notches
from the 6 to 7 percent level at which the period had started.
THE SOURCES OF INFLATION

The chief problem with respect to inflation is not the sporadic developments that generate inflationary impulses. Instead, it is the
ratchet-like nature of the inflationary process which makes it resistant
to downward pressures. Chart 3, which shows year-to-year changes in
the consumer price index since 1913, captures the essence of the inflation problem of the past two decades. The size of the inflationary
bursts of recent years has not been out of line with those which occurred earlier in the century, but recent inflation has had an upward
bias and has fluctuated around a rising trend line. An understanding
of the "causes" of inflation must therefore encompass not only the
various factors that give rise to particular inflationary episodes but
also the reasons why inflation has developed a ratchet-like character.

The Role of Aggregate Demand in Creating Inflation

The inflation rate which occurs in any given year is a composite of
the individual wage and price decisions made by millions of businesses, unions, and workers. Those decisions are influenced by the
strength of demand relative to supply. As demand (or spending)â€”on
the part of consumers, business, and governmentâ€”declines relative
to supply, there is pressure on workers to moderate their wage demands lest employment fall, and on producers to restrain prices for
fear of losing sales. The converse also holds true: the smaller the
number of unemployed people and the lower the amount of unused
industrial capacity, the greater the upward pressure on wages and
prices. Some evidence also suggests that a rapid rise in demand can
generate upward pressure on both wages and prices, even if the level
of demand is not excessive. In general, if demand is in rough balance
with supply, the underlying rate of inflation for the economy as a
whole will remain basically unchanged, even though prices and wages
in individual sectors may fluctuate in response to conditions in particular markets. If excess demand exists, or if the rate of increase in
demand is very large, the underlying rate of inflation will tend to
rise. If aggregate demand falls below supply, some downward pressure will be exerted on inflation.
Expectations about the future state of aggregate demand are also
an important determinant of inflation. Wage decisions and many




38

price decisions cannot easily be reversed. Wages are often set for at
least a year, and under most major union contracts they are set for 3
years. There are also many advantages to both buyers and sellers in
avoiding frequent product price changes. As a consequence, decisionmakers have to think not only about market conditions at present but
also about what they are likely to be in the future. Thus, both current
and expected,aggregate demand influence the rate of inflation. Moreover, a firm's decisions today about what wages to offer or what
prices to set for any future period will be conditioned by its expectations about the wages its competitors will pay and the prices its competitors will charge, and by the incomes that will be earned by its
customers. In short, today's inflation rate is strongly influenced by
what people expect it to be tomorrow.
It was excess aggregate demand during the Vietnam war that drove
up the underlying rate of inflation from 1 percent to 4 or 5 percent
by the end of the 1960s. Although increases in oil and food prices
were the principal causes of the next two inflationary surges, pressures from aggregate demand again played an identifiable role. The
most troublesome feature of the inflation of the past 15 years, however, has been the fact that after each of the three inflationary episodes the underlying rate of inflation did not fall back to its earlier
level. To what extent was this outcome a demand-related phenomenon?

At the end of each inflationary episode the economy entered a recessionâ€”in 1970-71, in 1974-75, and in 1980. Unemployment rose
steeply, and substantial amounts of idle capacity appeared (Table 3).
The failure of inflation to fall back to earlier levels is therefore not
attributable to excess demand. On the other hand, there clearly
would have been some level of demand low enough to have caused
business and labor to moderate the increase in wages and prices substantially so as to return to the earlier level of inflation. But for reasons discussed later, the rate of wage and price increase has become
relatively insensitive to a moderate degree of economic slack. As a
consequence, the cost of the necessary restraintâ€”in terms of additional unemployment, idle capacity, and lost income, production, and
investmentâ€”would have been extremely high.
Federal Budget Deficits as a Cause of Inflation

The Federal budget balance at any given time is an important
factor in determining the level of current aggregate demand in the
economy. If the Federal budget is in deficit, total spendingâ€”private
and publicâ€”will be higher than it would be if taxes had been raised
or spending had been cut to produce a balanced Federal budget. Any
tax or spending measure that turned a budget deficit into a balanced
budget would tend to reduce demand relative to supply and put
downward pressure on the inflation rate. Furthermore, since businesses make wage and price decisions at least partly in the light of
what they expect market conditions to be, announcements of future
budget policies have a strong effect on current economic conditions
and on the rate of inflation. Thus budget deficits can contribute to
inflation both by being a part of current aggregate demand and by
Contributing to expectations about future aggregate demand.
The existence of important relationships between Federal budget
policy and aggregate demand that in turn affect inflation does not,
however, support the simple view that budget deficits cause inflation
and that inflation could be eliminated if Federal deficits were eliminated. Federal deficits are not the soleâ€”or even the primaryâ€”determinant of aggregate demand. The Federal deficit is likely to be largest when private demand is weak, incomes are low, and inflationary
pressures from the private demand side are absent. That is the situation in a recession. In the second column in Table 4, which shows
the Federal budget deficit as a percentage of GNP, the effects of recession in 1958, 1970-71, 1974-75, and 1980 show up as large increases in the deficit in the fiscal years during and immediately after
the recession. Conversely, a truly inflationary budget may exhibit a
small deficit, or even a surplus, as a result of an inflation-caused increase in Federal revenues. In 1969, as inflation was surging, the




40

Federal budget achieved a surplus. In 1974, when another inflationary surge occurred, the deficit was quite small.

If government budget deficits are the cause of inflation, it should
make no difference whether the deficit occurs at the Federal, State,
or local level. For example, the Federal revenue-sharing program,
which grants Federal tax revenues to State and local governments,
has the effect of reducing State and local deficits (or increasing their
surpluses) by increasing the Federal deficit. If the program were
eliminated, but both levels of government continued to tax the same
amount and maintain the same level of services, the Federal deficit
would be reducedâ€”but the total deficit, and its inflationary consequences, would be unchanged. In fact, principally because the State
and local governments accumulate funds to pay employee pension
costs, their budgets usually show a surplus. As the figures in the final
column in Table 4 show, the combined budgets of Federal, State,
and local governments have either showed a surplus or a very small
deficit during the past two decades, except during recessions and for
2 years when Federal spending on the Vietnam war was at its peak.




41

The notion that budget deficits are the chief cause of inflation also
founders on a comparison of budget deficits and inflation among different countries. Japan and Germany in recent years have had much
better success in combating inflation than the United States. Yet their
budget deficits, especially those of Japan, have been much higher relative to the size of their economies than has been the case in the
United States (Table 5).

Stating that deficits are not the sole cause of inflation does not, of
course, imply the opposite propositionâ€”that the size of the budget
deficit is unimportant to the control of inflation. Subsequent sections
of this chapter emphasize the importance of fiscal restraint in a longterm program to reduce inflation.
Supply Shocks as a Source of Inflation

Sharply higher prices in one sector of the economy can lead to
surges in inflation even when excess aggregate demand is absent.
These sudden and massive changes generally spring from conditions
that cannot be controlled. The most important of these have been increases in food prices resulting from shortages and increases in oil
prices mandated by OPEC. These events are no different from such
common supply disruptions as strikes, accidents, and natural disasters, but they are much larger, and it is their size which makes their
effects exceptional.
Price shocks have both direct and indirect effects. Consumers feel
the price increases directly, and these direct effects may be magnified
by the brevity of the time in which they occur, resulting in extraordinary jumps in reported inflation rates. In addition, price increases in
agricultural or energy raw materials translate indirectly into price increases in the final products that utilize those materials, although the
degree and timing of the pass-through depend on market conditions.
This secondary impact is quite important in the case of petroleum,
half of which is used by businesses in production and transportation.




42

As an abrupt increase in the price of an important commodity
translates into an increase in the cost of living, pressure builds for
wage gains to match the new inflation. Some gains take place automatically where wages are linked to prices through cost-of-living
clauses in union contracts. Additional acceleration occurs as new contracts are negotiated. As businesses observe the rising wage-price
spiral, they are likely to expect a higher future level of inflation. They
are then somewhat more likely to grant larger wage increases, both
in the belief that rising inflation will make it possible to pass through
increases in higher prices and in order to avoid losing workers.
Through this process, a sharp increase in food or oil prices can lead
to a rise in the underlying inflation rate.
The magnitude of the inflationary process set in motion by an oilprice increase or some other supply shock depends on the state of
the economy. The more prosperous the economy and the lower the
unemployment level, the more likely it is that the initial increase in
prices will lead to higher wage increases and a higher underlying inflation rate.
In addition to their inflationary consequences, supply shocks also
create recessionary forces. The very large increases in oil prices in
1974 and 1979 not only spurred inflation but simultaneously depressed aggregate demand. They were therefore largely responsible
for the recessions of 1974-75 and 1980. After paying sharply higher
prices for petroleum products, consumers had less to spend on other
goods and services. But those who received the revenues from higher
oil pricesâ€”foreign and domestic oil producersâ€”increased their demands for U.S. exports and investment goods only gradually. On balance, therefore, aggregate demand and spending fell, leading to
lower output and reduced employment.
Such a simultaneous increase in inflation and unemployment
brought on by supply shocks creates a dilemma for economic policy.
If monetary and fiscal policies produce additional aggregate demand
to "compensate" for the recessionary forces set in motion by a
supply shock, there is likely to be a large induced rise in inflation. If,
on the other hand, no effort is made to compensate, aggregate
demand will fall. But given the relative insensitivity of wage and price
decisions to moderate slack in the economy, some increase in the underlying inflation rate is nonetheless likely. Only sharply restrictive
monetary and fiscal policies, which strengthen the forces leading to
recession, can prevent an increase in the underlying inflation rate.
While recessionary forces came into play in 1974 and 1980, the slackening of aggregate demand was not sufficient to avoid another
upward ratcheting of the inflation rate.




43

The Role of Declining Productivity Growth

Over the past decadeâ€”and perhaps since the mid-1960sâ€”the rate
of productivity growth in the United States has slackened. (A later
section of this chapter examines this trend in more detail.) This
slackening has been an unwelcome development, since productivity
growth can offset the effects of rising wages on business costs and
prices. When productivity growth slows but increases in wages continue, the rate of increase in costs and prices rises. While short-term
variations in productivity growth may not be recognized in setting
prices, a longer-lasting slowdown in productivity will be reflected in
higher prices. Once prices begin to rise in response to this pressure,
another round of wage demands is stimulated as workers try to offset
the increased cost of living. This raises the underlying inflation rate
yet again.
The Downward Insensitivity of Wages and Prices

If wages and prices were sensitive to a moderate degree of slack in
the economy, careful control of aggregate demand through monetary
and fiscal policy could bring rising inflation to a halt quickly and at a
modest cost. True, mistakes in policy might occur from time to time,
and supply shocks over which the government has no control would
still take place. But inflation could be brought down relatively quickly
and easily if it did not haveâ€”as it has nowâ€”a large degree of inertia.
Before World War II, and perhaps in the immediate postwar years,
wages and prices were more sensitive in a downward direction. (See
Chart 3, for example.) Several careful economic studies show that in
that earlier period a moderate or short-lived slackening of aggregate
demand tended to reduce the rate of inflation significantly. Those
who have compared that earlier era with more recent times differ in
their views as to precisely why things have changed, but the basic
causes are clear.
During the past several decades the vast majority of firms, labor
unions, and workers have come to expect that expansionary government policies will be applied sooner or later to reverse recessionary
tendencies in the economy. Since current wage and price decisions
are strongly influenced by what workers and firms think the future
will hold, the expectation of stimulus removes much of the motivation for moderating wage and price behavior. Businesses and unions
have also developed a growing tendency to turn to government for
relief, often with some success, when their high prices and wages
lead them into competitive difficulties. All of these factors have weakened the incentive for businesses and workers to restrain their wage
and price demands, even in the face of softening markets. These actions do not depend on specific knowledge about future government




44

policies but are based on the widespread view that "the government
won't allow things to get too bad."
Prior to World War II, however, popular expectations were different. The Federal Government had historically played little role in
smoothing the economic cycles, and substantial depressions as well
as mild recessions occurred periodically. Up until the 1930s there
was no unemployment insurance, social security, or deposit insurance
to ameliorate the consequences of economic downturns. When markets started to weaken, there was no reason to believe that any supportâ€”in the aggregate or for individualsâ€”woul<j be forthcoming
from the government. As a consequence, wages and prices quickly
subsided as businesses and workers scrambled to survive. The cycle,
furthermore, was self-reinforcing. Because inflation often led to a
slump, followed by a speedy reduction in inflation, businessmen and
others came to expect that inflation would not last long; this expectation itself moderated their behavior with respect to wages and prices.
After World War II, however, the United States and other industrial countries decided that the costs of this kind of painful adjustment
were too high. Thus, countercyclical policy was founded. The success
of that policy, and the existence of various programs of income support to protect individuals in case of unemployment, have changed
the character of expectations. In the new environment the appearance of slack markets, idle capacity, and higher unemployment leads
to far less moderation in wage and price increases. Downward flexibility has not disappeared, but it has diminished.
Current wage and price behavior has deep-seated structural origins
and is not based solely on current expectations about governmental
behavior. Since most large wage contracts run for 2 or 3 years, the
rate of wage increase in any particular year will have been determined in part by negotiations in earlier years under different conditions. In addition, the expiration dates of multiyear wage contracts
for different industries are staggered, and the wage increases negotiated in any industry will be influenced to some extent by the size of
earlier increases won by unions in other industries. Moreover, the
prospect of further inflation over the life of these contracts has led to
the inclusion of cost-of-living clauses, which provide wage increases
even when markets are slack. Although union contracts cover less
than one-quarter of the civilian labor force, the partial insulation of
these contracts from current economic events has some effect on the
wages that nonunion firms must pay.
Quite apart from the existence of written contracts, there are
mutual advantages to both firms and workers from wage-setting practices that are relatively insensitive to economic slack. In complicated
modern societies the costs of acquiring information about alternative

 0 - 81 - 4 : QL 3
333-5U0


45

job opportunities are very high for workers, and the costs of training
a skilled work force are very large for businesses. Both workers and
firms see benefits in establishing long-term relationships. One way
for a firm to attract and hold a skilled work force is an implicit agreement not to engage in extensive wage-cutting during periods of weak
markets. As a consequence, many firms are unwilling to take a chance
of losing out in the labor market by being among the first to reduce
wage increases.
Other institutions besides those of wage-contracting contribute to
the downward insensitivities of prices and wages. In the case of
prices, the downward pressure that would normally be exerted by
competitive forces in slack markets is significantly muted in large oligopolistic industries by market strategy considerations and various
forms of administered prices. Finally, government intervention in individual markets through regulation, which may fix wages, the price
or quality of the product, or the conditions under which production
takes place, adds further rigidity.
Some of the economic institutions and practices that contribute to
wage and price rigidity themselves evolved in response to expectations that government economic policy would continue to be supportive. Although the persistent application of demand restraint is
likely to reduce them, they should not be expected to disappear
easily or quickly.
Downward wage and price rigidity makes the costs of reducing inflation through monetary and fiscal restraint quite large. It is difficult
to estimate the costs with precision, but representative econometric
studies suggest that reducing inflation by 1 percentage point would
require a sacrifice of $100 billion in lost output (in 1980 pYices) and
a one-half percentage point rise in the unemployment rate over a
period of about 3 years. Most of the costs would be incurred in the
first half of the period. These statistical estimates, however, are based
on historical relationships. There has never been a period of sustained
economic restraint in recent times from which direct evidence of
the costs could be drawn. The possibility that they would grow
significantly smaller if restraint persisted is discussed later in this
chapter.
In sum, it is the costs imposed on society when demand restraint
clashes with the downward insensitivity of wages and prices that
makes it so difficult to reduce inflation by applying monetary and
fiscal restraint. Viewed in this perspective, the central problem of
economic policy is not how to reduce inflation. If that were the only
objective, a sufficiently draconian level of demand restraint could be
found to do the job. The real issue is twofold: How large are the
costs society is willing to bear to realize the benefits of lower infla-




46

tion, and can policies be designed to lower those costs so that inflation can be reduced faster with smaller losses in output and employment?
MANAGING AGGREGATE DEMAND
Monetary and fiscal policy must be designed to prevent aggregate
spending that is so high or growing so fast relative to the Nation's
productive capacity that it encourages a speedup in the rate at which
wages and prices are risingâ€”i.e., an increase in inflation. To play a
role in lowering the underlying inflation rate, growth in aggregate
demand must be further restrained to a point where firms and workers reduce the rate at which they raise wages and prices.
This section starts by specifying a policy of demand management
that aims at a gradual reduction of inflation in a world where the inflation rate is highly resistant to downward pressures. Particular attention is paid to the problem of establishing the credibility of antiinflation policies so as to influence popular expectations in a favorable way. The section then considers some of the special problems of
managing monetary policy in a period of high inflation and frequent
economic disturbances.
BROAD PRINCIPLES

Three broad principles, discussed at length in last year's Report,
can guide monetary and fiscal policy as it seeks to reduce inflation
while providing for reasonable growth:
First, monetary and fiscal policy should aim for a long-term reduction in the growth of nominal GNP (aggregate spending). That reduction should not be abrupt, or it will produce large decreases in
employment and production while reducing inflation only modestly.
But the restraint must be maintained, since wages and prices tend to
resist the downward pressure.
Second, the pace of nominal GNP growth will undoubtedly need to
fluctuate along a declining trend. Realistically, even if there is a decrease in the inflation rate in 1981, for example, some rise in nominal GNP growth will be required to accommodate a modest recovery
from the 1980 recession. A policy of fiscal and monetary restraint to
produce a long-term reduction in the growth rate of nominal GNP
may thus need to be adjusted from time to time to take account of
short-term changes in economic conditions. But several cautions are
required. Unless clearly warranted and carefully explained, shorterterm adjustments to economic policy can threaten the credibility of
longer-term restraint. Moreover, because an increase in inflation
once underway is so very hard to eliminate, an inflationary mistake
takes much longer to reverse than its opposite. The risks that policy-




47

makers face are not symmetrical and, as a consequence, uncertainty
must be resolved in favor of caution.
Third, no matter how well designed, monetary and fiscal policies
cannot prevent large outside shocks to the economy from imposing
some damage on employment, price stability, or growth. A practical
approach would be to "accommodate" the direct inflationary effect
of external price shocks but restrain aggregate demand sufficiently to
minimize the indirect inflationary effects that would result if individuals attempted to raise wages and other incomes to "catch up" with
higher prices. Without huge costs in terms of lost production, however, it would probably be impossible to restrain demand sufficiently to
eliminate all induced increases in inflation. In these circumstances a
voluntary incomes policy may be able to make a significant contribution. This seems to have occurred in 1979, when the response of
wages to the large rise in inflation was substantially muted.
Because the rate of increase in wages and prices tends to resist
downward pressures, a policy of continued restraint on the growth of
aggregate demand sufficient to induce a decline in inflation will mean
sustained slack in the economy and will result in a period of relatively slow growth in production and employment. This outlook could be
improved if it were possible to change the behavior of wages and
prices so that they responded to demand restraint more rapidly and
by larger amounts.
THE ROLE OF EXPECTATIONS AND THE CREDIBILITY OF DEMAND
RESTRAINT

Earlier in this chapter the downward resistance of wage and price
inflation was attributed in part to a widespread expectation that expansionary government policies will rather quickly be applied to reverse recessionary tendencies. If firms and workers became convinced that the government meant business, that the markets for
their products would not be supported by easier money or fiscal
stimulus, and that they could continue raising wages and prices only
at their own peril, their decisions about wage demands and pricing
policies would undoubtedly be affected. The downward "stickiness"
of wage and price inflation would be eased.
Does the government need to put the economy through one or
more prolonged periods of economic slack in order to demonstrate
the firmness of its anti-inflation commitment? Or can it avoid that
necessity by somehow convincing the Nation in advance of its determination? Some observers have suggested, for example, that the government could show its resolve by announcing a target path for
nominal GNP or for money supply growth (or both) and by committing itself to pursuing those targets whatever the consequences for
unemployment and production. The target path would permit pro-




48

duction and employment to grow only if they were accompanied by
significant reductions in wage and price inflation. But simply announcing a set of targets does not guarantee that they will steadfastly
be pursued in the face of mounting losses in employment, profits,
and sales. Indeed, the tougher the targets and the greater the
demand restraint they seem to require, the less likely they are to be
credible, for their success will rely on an uncharacteristic willingness
on the part of the Administration, the Congress, and the public to
accept large reductions in employment and production rather than
abandon the targets.
The mere announcement of government intentions is, therefore,
unlikely to produce a significant change in wage and price behavior.
The actual experience of persistent demand restraint, followed by a
substantial number of individual firms and unions pricing themselves
out of the market, would almost certainly be necessary before the
credibility of the policy was established. In addition, the government would have to refuse pleas for trade restrictions, subsidies, or
other relief for those who failed to moderate their wage and price
increases.
Even if firms and workers became convinced that the government
was determined to persist in its demand restraint regardless of the
consequences, to what extent would they respond with a greater willingness to cut wage and price increases, especially if the demand restraint were moderate instead of very severe? The answer would
depend in part on whether they expected inflation or production to
fall first. If individual firms believed that demand restraint was synonymous with lower inflation, they would undoubtedly restrain their
own wage and price increases, since they would be reluctant to get
far out of line with the wages and prices of other firms and industries. But given the downward insensitivity of wages and prices experienced over the past several decades, demand restraint might at the
present time lead instead to expectations of lower output. It is not at
all clear, therefore, how sharply wages and prices would respond to a
moderate decline in demand even if it was expected to last for a long
while.
Equally important, strong structural components of wage and price
stickiness discussed earlier in this chapter would remain. These structural factors are, in the near term, independent of expectations. As a
consequence, other measures would also have to be pursued as a
means of speeding a reduction in inflation and raising the growth of
production and employment in thÂ£ face of continued demand restraint.
The foregoing discussion suggests that one of the most critical
questions in designing anti-inflation policies is determining the




49

extent to which the downward stickiness of wage and price inflation
has been due to popular expectations rather than to structural factors. While there is no clear-cut answer to this question at the
moment, it is surely true that expectations about the persistence of
government policies of demand restraint affect the responsiveness of
wages and prices. To the extent that the credibility of government
policies can be strengthened, the reduction in inflation will come
more quickly and the social costs will be reduced. The fact of persistence in an anti-inflation policyâ€”as happened in 1980, when no fiscal
stimulus was offered and a restrictive monetary policy was maintained in the face of a weakening economyâ€”should gradually help to
modify business and worker behavior. But it would be imprudent to
expect entrenched expectations to be changed quickly.
MONETARY POLICY

The Federal Reserve bears a substantial share of the responsibility
for carrying out aggregate demand management. As discussed above,
the monetary authorities must first confront the question of the appropriate degree of economic restraint. The problem is to achieve
the proper balance in order to reduce inflationary pressures at a
minimum cost in lost jobs and production. Formulating and implementing policies to achieve this balance in a period characterized by
wide fluctuations in economic and financial conditions confronts the
monetary authorities with a number of serious additional challenges.
While these problems are generally technical in nature, the manner
in which they are resolved can have a significant impact on the
degree of monetary restraint.
Monetary policy can exert no direct control over aggregate
demand. It must exert its influence indirectly, that is, by affecting
actual and expected conditions in the money and credit markets. The
linkages between what it can control (the cost and availability of bank
reserves), its intermediate indicators of conditions in the money and
credit markets (the monetary aggregates and interest rates), and its
ultimate goals (the impact on real growth and prices) are imperfect
and often are not directly observable, even after the fact. In evaluating these linkages, the monetary authorities must rely on predicted
relationships based on economic theory and historical experience,
and there is plenty of room for slippage. These technical problems
create considerable uncertainty for the makers of monetary policy.
A related issue is that the effectiveness of the monetary authorities
in bringing down inflation depends on how firms and individuals perceive monetary policy. Private sector expectations of the likely success of monetary policy influence its actual success. Consequently, it
is important that the monetary authorities demonstrate that they have
chosen a strategy that will achieve their anti-inflation objectives.




50

Moreover, their actions must indicate that they have the technical capability to meet these objectives while responding forcefully to new
situations and to any divergence between desired and actual developments.
In recent years the debate on these issues has focused on the Federal Reserve's target growth ranges for monetary aggregates and on
the process of setting and implementing these targets. The targets
are defined in terms of the narrow measures of the money stock
(formerly M-l and now M-1A and M-1B, which include currency and
various types of checkable deposits), the broader measures of the
money stock (M2 and M3, which include currency and checkable deposits as well as time and savings deposits and other deposit-like instruments), and bank credit. The Federal Reserve has used monetary
growth targets internally since the early 1970s, and since 1975 it has
announced them publicly in testimony before the Congress.
In October 1979 the Federal Reserve modified its procedures for
implementing monetary policy in order to give greater emphasis to
keeping the growth of the aggregates within the target ranges, even if
that meant more variation in interest rates. By this change, the Federal Reserve was widely perceived as having established the realization of its targets as a benchmark for measuring the performance of
monetary policy.
While the notion of monetary targeting may appear quite straightforward, in practice there are a number of questions that must be resolved in carrying out a targeting strategy. Among these, three in
particular deserve attention here:
â€¢ How should the Federal Reserve set its monetary growth targets,
both in terms of choosing particular measures of money and
choosing numerical targets?
â€¢ What is the appropriate monetary policy response when the relationships among economic variables, on which the initial targets
were set, appear to shift?
â€¢ How rigidly should the Federal Reserve adhere to its longer-run
growth ranges over the short run?
Choosing the Appropriate Measure of Money

Debate over selection of the appropriate measure by which to
guide monetary policy must take into account the tradeoff between
the ability of the Federal Reserve to control any monetary aggregate
and the influence of that aggregate on overall demand. For example,
the monetary base, composed of currency held by the public plus
bank reserves, is probably the easiest for the Federal Reserve to control. But studies have shown that the relationship between the monetary base and aggregate demand is not very close. The narrow meas-




51

ures of the money stock (M-1A and M-1B) are somewhat harder to
control but in general have been more closely tied to aggregate
demand. Some economists argue that a broader measure of the
money stock, such as M-2, has the most stable relationship with aggregate demand, but the very breadth of this measureâ€”including as
it does a mixture of the liabilities of several types of financial institutionsâ€”makes it rather difficult to control.
A related issue is how the various measures of the money stock
should be defined. The rapid evolution of the financial markets in
recent years (see the discussion in Chapter 2) has blurred the historical distinctions between the types of financial instruments and
rendered somewhat ambiguous what should be treated as "money."
These developments have been partly responsible for the recent instabilities in the relationship among the narrow monetary measures,
economic activity, and interest ratesâ€”instabilities commonly referred
to as shifts in money demand.
In light of these considerations, the Federal Reserve has chosen to
consider a family of monetary aggregates to impart a needed degree
of flexibility. Thus, while a narrow aggregate like M-1B has been accorded primary emphasis, there may be periods when it provides an
uncertain guide for monetary policy. At such times the Federal Reserve may put more emphasis on the broader measures of the money
stock, such as M-2.
Setting Numerical Targets

Once the Federal Reserve determines which monetary aggregates
to target, numerical target ranges must be set to achieve the appropriate degree of aggregate demand restraint. The targeting procedure could, for example, begin by determining the appropriate path
for nominal GNP that would be consistent with a gradual decline in
inflation. Abstracting from cyclical variations in real economic expansion, a steady reduction of inflation would imply a gradual decline in
nominal GNP growth.
Given this objective, the monetary authorities would need to estimate growth rates for the monetary aggregates that would satisfy the
needs of an economy moving along the presumed declining path of
nominal GNP. These would then become the basis for choosing the
target growth ranges. Over the past two decades a given growth rate
of the narrow measures of money has, on average, financed a 2 to 3
percentage point faster rate of expansion of nominal GNP, although
the pattern has varied from year to year. This relationship suggests
that the goal of a gradual decline in the growth of nominal GNP would
be consistent with a gradual lowering in the target ranges, although
not necessarily every year.




52

Starting with its 1975 targets as a base, the Federal Reserve has, in
fact, adhered to a policy of lowering the target ranges by a small
amount in each year (Table 6). What has been the result? In some
years (1977, 1978, and 1980) the targets were exceeded. In the
others there were apparent shifts in money demand such that actual
money growth was much lower than would be predicted on the basis
of historical relationships.
Predicted M-l growth for the last 5 years is shown in the third
column of Table 6, and the difference between predicted and actual
money growth is in the last column. As the figures indicate, those
years when actual money growth was in the target ranges (1976 and
1979) were periods in which there were the largest downward shifts
in money demand. In effect, actual money growth during these periods supported a greater-than-expected growth of nominal GNP. In
the remaining years money growth was nearer the rate expected from
historical money-demand relationships, but that growth was above
the target range. These two factorsâ€”money demand shifts and missing the targetsâ€”help to explain how such low values for the monetary growth targets could have persisted in a period of high nominal
GNP growth. Over the entire period more nominal growth was accommodated than is implied by the monetary targets and the historical relationships.

Although the continuing application of monetary restraint could
call for reductions of the monetary growth ranges over time, there
are a number of problems which have to be faced. In particular, the
question arises about the extent to which adjustments in monetary
targets ought to be made when structural changes occur in the economy.
In the last decade there have been several abrupt shifts in the relationships among important economic factorsâ€”disruptions related to




53

jumps in oil and food prices as well as to shifts in money demand.
The problem for the Federal Reserve is how, if at all, to adjust monetary growth targets in response to these changes. This requires an
evaluation of the likely direct impact of monetary and credit conditions on economic activity, as well as an assessment of how altering
the monetary targets would affect wages and prices.
Response to Supply-Side Shocks

When the economy experiences a supply shock such as the recent
surge in oil prices, the initial results are likely to be a reduction in
aggregate demand and a rise in unemployment and inflation. As discussed earlier, the Federal Reserve can respond in several ways. At
one extreme, the response would aim at accommodating the shock
completely, thus restoring real aggregate demand to its level before
the shock and avoiding any rise in unemployment. At the other extreme, the response would attempt to offset fully both the direct and
indirect inflationary effects. The intermediate position suggested earlier would be to accommodate the direct effects of the price shock
but seek to minimize indirect effects.
If the latter strategy were adopted, the monetary targets necessary
to pursue it would be identical to those prevailing before the shock
only by pure chance. Some adjustment would almost invariably be required, but whether the appropriate response entailed greater or less
monetary growth than the original target ranges would depend on
conditions prevailing in the economy at the time as well as on the
complex dynamic responses of wages and prices after the shock.
Moreover, the monetary authorities must remember that their credibility may be damaged if this strategy were to entail an upward adjustment in targets. Such a consideration may lead to a less accommodative position than analysis based strictly on aggregate demand
conditions would warrant.
Changes in Money Demand

Shifts in money demand confront the monetary authorities with a
different set of problems. Here the appropriate policy response is
clear in theory. For example, money-demand shifts have at times in
recent years resulted in sudden reductions in the amount of money
necessary to support a given amount of economic activity. Holding to
predetermined monetary targets in the face of such shifts would
mean a more accommodative policy than previously intended. Alternatively, by reducing monetary growth targets commensurate with the
demand shift, an unchanged degree of monetary restraint would be
maintained.
Although the response is clear in theory, in practice there are
many problems. It is difficult for the Federal Reserve to know until




54

well after the fact whether the money-demand relationship has
changed permanently. If one could observe money, interest rates,
and nominal GNP contemporaneously, one could judge whether
these developments were roughly in line with historical patterns. If
they appeared to be out of line, a shift in demand might be suspected. Two problems in ascertaining a shift are the long delay before
data on GNP are available, and the frequent revisions subsequently
undergone by both GNP and money data. Another problem is that
the "normal" demand for money cannot be estimated precisely, so
that even with timely data it may take several quarters before the
shift becomes evident.
Suppose that a money-demand shift is suspected of having occurred, but its magnitude is uncertain. How should the monetary authorities adjust the targets in a way that maintains a steady degree of
monetary restraint? First, the targets for the narrow aggregates might
be adjusted by shifting the midpoints of the longer-run target ranges
according to the "best guess" of how the structural shift will affect
the growth rate. Second, if the impact of the structural change is uncertain, the upper and lower bounds of the growth range may have
to be widened to reflect that uncertainty. Third, ifâ€”as in the pastâ€”
the broader money measures do not appear to be affected as much
by the structural changes, more emphasis could then be put on the
broader aggregates in guiding monetary actions. At such times the
relatively greater stability of the relationship of the broader aggregates to income and interest rates may give the monetary authorities
a somewhat better measure of monetary stringency. The risk in
making these adjustments is that the public may lose sight of why
such changes are being madeâ€”interpreting them as mere tinkering
or as devices aimed at loosening monetary restraint. Thus, the monetary authorities stand to lose credibility unless they can convince the
public of the need for such adjustments when they are appropriate.
Problems of Short-Run Variability

Once the annual numerical targets have been set, and adjusted for
major supply shocks or shifts in money demand if necessary, the next
question is how rigidly the targets should be followed during the
year. It is important to recognize that random and temporary fluctuations will inevitably occur, affecting both the demand and supply
sides of the financial markets. Empirical evidence suggests, however,
that deviations from a desired money growth path lasting as long as a
quarter do not destabilize aggregate demand if they are subsequently
corrected. Hence, rigid adherence to a longer-run target over periods
as short as a month or a quarter would require wide fluctuations in
interest rates, which could disrupt the economy unnecessarily. In
view of the importance of preserving Federal Reserve credibility, it is




55

essential for the public to understand that such short-run deviations
are not nearly as consequential as they are sometimes made out to
be.
The problem for the Federal Reserve is to distinguish these temporary disturbances from more permanent shifts in economic relationships for which some response may be necessary. Since the monetary
authorities cannot determine until well after the fact whether a divergence in money growth is permanent or self-correcting, they must establish short-run procedures that partially accommodate temporary
disturbances but respond with increasing intensity to systematic
trends. The current procedures for implementing the longer-run
growth target ranges include setting short-run money targets periodically during the year and managing reserves on a day-to-day basis to
meet those targets. These procedures are designed to achieve a
proper balance between avoiding unnecessary disturbances in the
money markets and responding in a timely fashion to sustained
movements of actual money growth away from the desired path.
In practice, this process is subject to a number of slippages, both
in the relationship between reserves and money and in the actual
control of reserves. Because different components of the money
stock are subject to different reserve requirement ratiosâ€”and some
are subject to no reserve requirements-r-the ratio of reserves to
money can vary unpredictably when funds are shifted among types of
deposits and among institutions. This hinders short-run monetary
control. Changes in reserve requirements and reserve coverage associated with the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary
Control Act of 1980, discussed in Chapter 2, should reduce the variation in the money-reserve ratio, but only gradually. Until this transition period is completed, the variation in this crucial ratio will continue.
Even if the linkage between money and reserves were perfectly
stable and predictable, the Federal Reserve would still need to be
able to control total reserves. Current problems in forecasting the
various uncontrollable factors affecting reserves, in reserve accounting procedures, and in the management of the discount window
make it difficult to achieve the target for total reserves. The Federal
Reserve is working to improve its forecasting techniques and is considering other reforms that would increase its control over reserves.
Thus, one should not expect the Federal Reserve to adhere rigidly
to its annual monetary targets in every period during the year. Temporary and largely self-correcting disturbances will inevitably lead to
short-run deviations, but these deviations should have few permanent
economic consequences. The current targeting process of the Federal




56

Reserve provides some flexibility in the face of such temporary disturbances, even with unchanged annual monetary targets.
Conclusions

One of the major lessons that emerges repeatedly in the preceding
discussion is the need for understanding, by the public generally and
the financial community in particular, of the complexities of monetary policy. Monetary targeting provides an invaluable tool to increase monetary discipline, to communicate Federal Reserve intentions, and to evaluate performance. But the advantages of a semiautomatic rule to guide the monetary authorities are not absolute. In
a world where economic and financial markets are subject to major
and unpredictable changes, deviations from the Federal Reserve's announced intention to reduce steadily the annual target ranges may
sometimes be necessary. Targets, once set, may occasionally have to
be modified. And allowing short-run deviations of actual from targeted money growth may be called for if care is taken not to let them
persist. But if the public interprets occasional necessary changes in
the longer-run monetary target ranges, or short-run deviations of
actual money growth from those targets, as evidence that the Federal
Reserve has lessened its determination to fight inflation, the monetary authorities will be put in an untenable position. If they fail to
make the adjustment in the monetary targets that is called for by a
major change in economic circumstances, or if they attempt to avoid
all short-run deviations of actual from targeted money growth, monetary policy may produce unwanted results. If, on the other hand, they
do change the targets or allow temporary deviations, their actions may
be misunderstood by the public and their credibility consequently
impaired. The monetary authorities will face this problem once again
in 1981, as is discussed in Chapter 3.
INCOMES POLICIES
Even if they are followed with persistence and acquire a credibility
that favorably affects expectations, monetary and fiscal restraints are
likely to reduce inflation only slowly and at significant cost in lost
output and employment. Incomes policies attempt to lower these
costs. By directly influencing the setting of wages and prices, incomes
policies seek to decrease the inflation and increase the growth of
output and employment that result from any given degree of demand
restraint. A tight monetary target, for example, is compatible either
with a small reduction in inflation and zero economic growth or a
larger reduction in inflation and positive economic growth. By persuading workers and employers to accept lower pay and price in-




57

creases, an incomes policy tries to make the second combination possible.
Incomes policies range from the informal pressure on a few large
corporations and unions exerted by the Kennedy Administration to
the formal review of price and wage increases by the Council on
Wage and Price Stability (CWPS) to even more formal schemes based
on the tax system, examined in detail below. While mandatory wage
and price controls are the extreme form of an incomes policy, the
discussion in this chapter is confined to voluntary forms, that is,
forms which do not involve legal prohibition of excessive wage and
price increases.
An effective incomes policy encourages various groups in society to
accept lower wages and prices for the goods and services they supply
in the expectation that the wages and prices they pay will also be
lower. An incomes policy that gains widespread support can meet
these expectations. Workers agree to lower their wage demands, and
thus unit labor costs rise more slowly. Firms moderate their price increases, and therefore workers* costs of living rise more slowly. The
implicit agreement made among government, workers, and firms to
take simultaneous actions to slow the wage-price spiral through the
mechanism of the incomes policy is thus successful principally to the
extent that people believe it will be successful.
To have a lasting influence on inflation, an incomes policy must do
more than lower the current rate of increase in wages and prices. It
must also lower expectations about the future rate of inflation. Workers must believe that they can achieve their real wage demands with
lower nominal wage gains, and firms must believe that large nominal
wage gains or other cost increases will be hard to pass on into prices.
While our knowledge about the formation of expectations leaves
much to be desired, it does suggest that a short-lived reduction in
inflation may be insufficient to change expectations sharply. To be
successful in lowering inflationary expectations, therefore, an incomes policy probably has to be in effect for more than a single year.
Even more important, an incomes policy will have no hope of a
lasting effect unless it is accompanied by monetary and fiscal restraint. If there is excess demand in labor and product markets, or if
monetary and fiscal policies create expectations of excess demand,
the basic tenet of an incomes policy is destroyed. Individual employers or groups of workers cannot then assume that their own moderation will be matched by moderation from others.
Although incomes policies can help to reduce inflation, they also
tend to create losses of economic efficiency. Ideally, economic policy
seeks to lower the average rate of wage and price increase while leaving individual wages and prices to adjust freely around that average




58

in response to circumstances in particular markets. In reality, of
course, an incomes policy cannot operate on a statistical average but
must deal with the wages and prices of individual firms. Therefore,
incomes policies inevitably discourage to some extent movements in
prices and wages relative to each other. Over time, the failure of relative prices to adjust in response to changing conditions leads to
mounting losses of economic efficiency. The more rigid and mandatory in character the incomes policy, and the longer it is kept in
place, the greater will be the efficiency costs.
This Administration has judged the benefits of a relatively flexible
and voluntary incomes policy to be significantly greater than its costs.
In late 1978 the Administration set forth voluntary standards for pay
and price increases as the centerpiece of an incomes policy. This section of Chapter 1 briefly reviews that program, and then evaluates a
wide range of measures known as tax-based incomes policies (TIPs)
under which tax penalties or rewards are employed as a means of inducing moderation in wage and price increases.
THE PAY AND PRICE STANDARDS

For the past 2 years the Administration's incomes policy has centered on the voluntary pay and price standards. Administered by
CWPS, this program applied to firms of all sizes, but only large firms
were asked to submit data on pay and either prices or margins. The
standards set by CWPS were designed to reflect the structures of different industries. Compliance was encouraged by appealing to firms
and workers to restrain price and pay increases in the public interest.
CWPS also used public opinion and the threatened loss of government contracts to encourage compliance.
Although the standards were voluntary and were in place during
the difficult period of the 1979 OPEC oil price explosion, they
appear to have played a role in moderating inflation. Studies by
CWPS and the Council of Economic Advisers have estimated that
annual wage increases were 1 to IV2 percentage points lower during
1979 than they would have been without the standards. The consequent reductions in labor costs also appear to have been passed on
to consumers through lower price increases. A more recent evaluation of the pay and price standards by CWPS suggests that the program continued to have a moderating effect in the second year.
After 2 years of operation there seems to be general agreement
that the current pay and price standards could not continue to be effective if simply extended in their present form. Workers and firms
no longer appear to be willing to moderate wage and price rises in
the expectation that the standards will restrain inflation.




59

TAX-BASED INCOMES POLICIES

One way of strengthening a voluntary standards program would be
to supplement it with a tax-based incomes policy, or a TIP. Such a
policy would use the tax system to provide tangible incentives to
firms and workers to slow the rate of inflation.
As the discussion in this section later concludes, the most effective
kind of TIP would be one that rewarded employees of firms whose
rate of wage increase was below the standard. Such a program would
significantly reinforce the spirit of cooperation used in other voluntary forms of incomes policies without creating as many distortions as
a mandatory program. Firms and workers that agreed to moderate
their price and wage increases would be making less of a sacrifice
under a TIP than under other voluntary programs. And in sectors of
the economy in which relative prices and wages were too low, a TIP
would allow adjustments. The most serious distortions in relative
prices and wages that develop under mandatory controls would be
avoided under a TIP.
Several years ago the Carter Administration proposed to the Congress one particular version of a TIPâ€”the "real wage insurance*'
programâ€”but the proposal was not acted upon by the Congress, and
in fact was not subjected to widespread public discussion and debate.
TIPs continue to represent an important untried innovation in the
area of anti-inflation policy. While TIPs may impose administrative
and efficiency costs, those costs appear to be far less than would be
incurred by reducing inflation solely through restraining aggregate
demand.
Various kinds of TIPs have been suggested. Under a pay TIP, for
example, the government would set a standard for pay increases over
the coming year. Groups of workers whose average pay increase did
not exceed the standard would be in compliance. In one version of
the pay TIP, firms whose wage increases exceeded the standard
would be assessed a tax penalty. In another version, all workers in a
complying group would receive a tax credit, including individuals
within the group whose pay raises were above the standard. Similarly,
a price TIP would provide penalties or rewards to firms on the basis
of their average price increases relative to a set of standards.
In virtually all versions of the TIP it is the average rate of wage or
price increase within the firm that is compared with the standard for
purposes of determining tax penalties or rewards. With this approach, firms are able to change the relative pay and prices of subgroups of workers and products. Merit pay plans and promotions
that give individual pay raises in excess of the standard can still be
used to encourage productivity.




60

Although the flexibility of TIPs makes them attractive, using the
tax system to reduce inflation poses serious administrative problems.
These problems present the major obstacles to designing an effective
TIP program. The following sections discuss issues of design in some
detail, and a Technical Appendix to this chapter examines other
problems in measuring average pay increases.
Several choices must be made in designing a TIP. First, should it
dispense rewards or levy penalties? Second, should receiving the
penalty or reward depend only on being above or below the standard
(a "hurdle" TIP), or should the size of the penalty or reward be
graduated in accordance with the difference between the standard
and the actual pay or price increase (a "continuous" TIP)? Third,
should the TIP be a permanent or a temporary program? Finally,
should the TIP apply to pay, to prices, or to both? These choices require striking a balance among equity, efficiency, administrative ease,
and effectiveness in reducing inflation. The next section discusses the
first three choices in the context of a pay TIP, and presents estimates
of the cost and effect of a specific pay TIP. Another section discusses
price TIPs.
Varieties of Pay TIPs

For several reasons, a reward pay TIP is probably preferable to a
penalty pay TIP. A reward TIP encourages workers to cooperate with
a voluntary incomes policy by compensating them for accepting
lower nominal pay increases than they would otherwise receive. A
penalty TIP, whether levied on firms or on individuals, will tend to
undercut the spirit of cooperation necessary for a successful incomes
policy. This is especially true because incomes policies are often
thought to be more effective in restraining pay increases than in
limiting price or profit increases. In addition, although lower rates of
increase in wage rates and unit labor costs eventually result in lower
price increases, the effect is not immediate. In the short run, wages
may increase more slowly but prices might not. Workers would therefore be more willing to cooperate with an incomes policy that partially compensated them for accepting, at least in the short run, lower
real incomes than they would have earned in the absence of a TIP.
Since a reward TIP provides such compensation, at least in part if
not in full, it would be both more equitable and more acceptable to
workers than a penalty TIP.
Furthermore, a penalty TIP has other drawbacks. If levied against
firms, it might increase the rate of inflation. Some of these firms
would be able to pass on the cost of the TIP penalty to consumers,
especially if the above-standard increase were industry-wide. Some
prices therefore would rise as a result of the TIP. Levying the penalty
on individuals rather than firms raises different objections. Such a

333-5H0 0 - 81 - 5 : QL 3




61

penalty TIP would occasionally penalize employees who received
little or no pay increase but who worked for firms with large average
pay raises. For such individuals, a penalty TIP would add injury to
insult and would be perceived as very unfair.
A penalty TIP would raise government revenues, which could be
returned to the private sector through offsetting tax cuts. By contrast, a reward TIP would cost the Federal Government a substantial
amount in forgone tax revenues. In practice, this means that a
reward TIP would only be feasible when tax cuts were being considered. Since inflation and economic growth tend to drive up average
effective tax rates, however, periodic tax reductions will be feasible
if the share of Federal spending in GNP is kept from rising.
Therefore, the key budgeting issue posed by a reward TIP is its effectiveness, compared to other forms of tax reduction, in meeting
economic goals.
One difficult problem that must be addressed in designing a TIP is
the administrative burden it would impose on private firms and on
the government. A TIP limited to a few thousand large firms with
computerized personnel records would have much smaller public and
private administrative costs than a TIP that included millions of small
firms.
But limiting a pay TIP to large firms seems very unlikely to secure
the kind of support needed to enact and operate a successful incomes policy. A limited reward TIP would be vigorously opposed by
workers in small firms, who would argue, rightly, that they were
being deprived of a potential tax cut. But a limited penalty TIP
would tend to reduce the real income of workers in large firms and
would be vigorously opposed by large firms and large unions.
A second issue in the design of a pay TIP is whether the penalty or
reward should be a single amount based only on the wage increase
being above or below the standard (hurdle TIP), or whether it should
be graduated according to the difference between the standard and
the actual increase (continuous TIP). A hurdle TIP only encourages
firms and workers to have pay raises below the standard. It provides
no direct incentive to lower pay raises that were already below the
standard or, realistically, to reduce pay raises that were far above the
standard. In contrast, a continuous TIP whose penalty or reward depended on the difference between the standard and the actual pay
raise would provide an incentive to lower all pay increases. Lowering
a pay raise that was above the standard would result in a smaller penalty. Lowering a pay raise that was already below the standard would
mean a larger reward.
The main advantage of a hurdle TIP is administrative. Under a
hurdle TIP, firms that expected to grant pay raises above the stand-




62

ard or that thought the administrative costs of compliance were too
high would not be required to keep records. In contrast, under a
continuous TIP that penalized firms or workers above the standard
as well as rewarded those below, all firms would have to keep detailed records and would have to file additional schedules with their
tax returns.
A reward-only continuous TIP would eliminate record-keeping requirements for noncomplying firms, and, as emphasized above, it
would also be more equitable than a continuous TIP that included
penalties. Such a TIP could offer tax credits, for instance, of 3, 2, or
1 percent of earnings, to employees of firms with average pay raises
that did not exceed 50 percent, 75 percent, or 100 percent of the
standard. However, even this simple continuous TIP would probably
generate more disputes than a hurdle TIP, since firms would have incentives to understate their pay increases to appear to be in a lower
bracket. Under a hurdle TIP, only firms near the standard would face
such incentives.
The final major issue in designing a TIP is whether it should be
permanent or temporary. The answer seems to be that a permanent
TIP would not be feasible because of the distortions it would create
by discouraging changes in relative wages. A TIP might introduce
further distortions as people changed their behavior to circumvent
the intent of the policy while remaining technically in compliance
with the standard. For a while the distortions created by a carefully
designed TIP would probably be small. But as relative prices and
wages wandered farther from equilibrium levels, the distortions
would become larger and the effects on inflation smaller. The economic costs from the distortions of an effective temporary TIP would
be acceptable when balanced against the larger costs of relying solely
on demand restraint to lower inflation. Because the distortions would
build up over time, however, the costs of a permanent TIP would
eventually exceed benefits.
On balance, given all the foregoing economic and administrative
considerations, a temporary hurdle TIPâ€”a tax credit to groups of
workers whose average pay increase does not exceed a specified
standardâ€”seems superior to the other variants. Because keeping records and complying with the standard would be voluntary in this type
of TIP, firms that found the administrative costs too high could
choose not to participate. As with all forms of TIPs, relative wage
changes could still occur in response to economic and other developments, although increases in excess of the standard would "cost"
workers the TIP tax credit. The efficiency costs would be small at
first, but over time the distortions of the TIP would rise and its effectiveness would fall.




63

Together with a "jawboning" campaign aimed at producing widespread compliance with the standard by lowering expectations of inflation, such a TIP could lower the rate of inflation. Without jawboning, the cost of inducing compliance among workers with anticipated
pay raises far above the standard would be prohibitive. Even workers
who expected pay raises near the standard might be reluctant to sacrifice part of a pay raise that might be built into future wages in exchange for a small tax credit that only lasted for 1 or 2 years. The
major appeal of wage moderation is that if everyone cooperates by
accepting a smaller wage increase, the lower nominal wage gains will
be matched by lower price increases. Real wages will not fall, but inflation will. A TIP alone cannot provide sufficient economic incentives to make a low wage increase more attractive than a large one.
However, with public appeals to moderation and clear evidence of
fiscal and monetary restraint, a TIP can contribute to slowing the inflationary spiral.
Costs and Effects of a Reward Pay TIP

The preceding discussion concluded that the most desirable type
of pay TIP would be a temporary hurdle type that provided a reward
for keeping pay raises below the standard. To examine the possible
usefulness of such a TIP in dampening inflation, the Council of Economic Advisers attempted to estimate the costs and effects of a
reward TIP open to all employees, public and private. The reward
was assumed to be a fixed percentage of wage income, up to the
maximum social security wage base of $29,700. It was also assumed
to be taxable and to be refundable to workers whose income tax liability was less than the reward. The average rate of wage increase in
the absence of a TIP was assumed to be 9.7 percent.
The probability that a group of workers would accept a wage increase at or below the standard was assumed to depend upon the
size of the reward and the relationship of the group's potential wage
increase to the standard. The smaller the potential wage increase relative to the standard and the greater the reward, the higher the probability of compliance. The results of this estimating procedure obviously depend very heavily on the specific relationships used to calculate the probabilities of compliance for various groups of workers.
Since there is no historical experience on which to base these relationships, the estimates presented below are simply examples based
upon a considered judgment of the issues.
The costs, effects, and compliance rates that would result from various combinations of standards and rewards were estimated under
the assumptions mentioned above. Illustrative combinations of standards and rewards at two levels of cost to the Federal budget are presented in Table 7. These estimates suggest three things. First, for a




64

given standard, as the reward and the cost rise, so does the reduction
of wage inflation. Second, there is some tradeoff between standard
and reward. That is, a program with a high standard and a low
reward may cost the same as a program with a lower standard and
higher reward. Third, for a given budgetary cost, a low-standard, highreward combination tends to be more effective in reducing wage
inflation than a high-standard, low-reward combination. The selection
of that combination may create a problem of credibility. A TIP that is
relatively effective in restraining pay increases for a given cost will
tend to have lower compliance rates than a program with a higher
standard and lower reward but which has less of the desired effect on
compensation. This happens because higher standards put more
people in compliance who do not have to modify their wage behavior.

A TIP should be judged not only on its initial impact, but on its
full effect over a 2- or 3-year period. A TIP continued for 2 years
with a reduced pay standard in the second year could make a significant contribution to lowering inflation.
PRICE TIPS

Experience with incomes policies here and abroad, including the
pay and price standards, suggests that a pay TIP is easier to administer and likely to cause fewer distortions than a price TIP. Nevertheless, a price TIP may be a necessary complement to a pay TIP because restraints on pay alone, even with a reward TIP, might appear
inequitable. Furthermore, a price TIP could speed up the effect of a
pay TIP by shortening the lag between the lowering of pay increases
and their effect on price increases.
It would be unrealistic to set a single price standard for all firms.
Productivity growth among industries varies substantially, as do
changes in the prices of raw materials and other costs of production.




65

Recognizing this, CWPS in 1978 established a price deceleration
standard which called for all firms to reduce the rate of their average
price increases in the program year by one-half percentage point
below their increases in a base period. Systematically different movements in productivity and other cost elements among firms and industries should be at least roughly reflected in their base year experience. CWPS found, however, that it had to permit firms to devise
various ways of adjusting for uncontrollable cost increases and had to
provide separate standards for certain industries, like retailing and
food processing.
For several reasons, prices are more difficult to measure than pay.
In some industries, such as wholesale and retail trade, prices for the
same item vary from week to week. Some firms also give quantity discounts, so that prices for the same item vary from customer to customer. Even if the price of each item did not fluctuate, a small store
with only a few employees may sell thousands of different products.
Such a firm might have little trouble with the paperwork necessary
for a pay TIP, but a price TIP would probably be beyond its administrative capabilities.
Furthermore, a price TIP would face problems posed by new products and quality change in old products. Since new products do not
have old prices, no price increase can be calculated for them. Instead, a price standard might have to be based on the firm's average
markup over input costs or on the prices of similar products sold by
the same firm or other firms. A related issue is the treatment of quality changes. Disregarding these changes might be the best solution
for a temporary price TIP, even though doing so would tend to discourage innovation. Alternatively, a program that exempted goods
whose quality had changed, and therefore allowed price increases
above the standard, would encourage minor product changes that did
not really increase quality. Finally, products whose quality improved
could be treated like new products, with price increases based on
average markup or on the price changes of similar goods.
A price TIP would have to allow firms to pass through to consumers certain increases in the cost of their inputs. For instance,
a utility company could not be expected to keep price increases
below a TIP standard for long if the price of the oil it used to generate electricity suddenly doubled. To treat the utility fairly, a price
TIP would have to allow the firm to raise electricity prices to cover
the increased cost of oil. The problem in designing a price TIP is to
decide which costs should be granted exemptions, while still encouraging firms to substitute cheaper inputs for more expensive ones.
Given the greater complexity of devising a workable price standard, a price TIP should probably levy penalties and be confined to




66

large firms. Even among large firms it may be desirable to exempt
industries like retailing, in which competition is likely to keep average
prices in reasonable relationship to costs. Market forces also make it
unlikely that exempting small firms and competitive industries would
lead to substantial inequities or to a failure to pass on to consumers
the benefits of wage moderation.
CONCLUSIONS

There are no costless ways to reduce inflation. Using demand restraint alone imposes very large costs of forgone output and unemployment for modest reductions in inflation. A successful TIP can
shift more of the effect of demand restraint from output to prices
and thus can cut substantially the costs of reducing inflation. Although a TIP would itself impose administrative and efficiency costs
on the economy, the costs for a short period of time would be small.
They would surely be outweighed by the benefits in reduced inflation
and lower unemployment that a TIP would bring.
It is useful to distinguish between two broad types of TIP, each of
which would have quite different economic objectives. The first would
be a continuous TIP that would be made a permanent part of the tax
code and that would set graduated rewards and penalties according
to the size of a firm's wage (and possibly price) increases. Such a TIP
would be an attempt to make a major and permanent change in the
market system so as to encourage less inflationary wage and price behavior on the part of individual firms. This chapter has suggested
that the administrative problems and the distortions introduced into
the wage structure would tend to grow over time, while the effect on
inflation would decline. Thus, the costs of a permanent wage TIP
would soon exceed its anti-inflationary benefits.
A second form would be a temporary hurdle TIP based on rewards
for wage moderation and would be part of a broad public campaign
for voluntary restraint in wage and price increases. The objective of
such a TIP, perhaps applied for 2 successive years, would be to provide several downward shocks to the inflationary process, in effect reversing some of the upward shocks which contributed to today's inflation rate. Although such a TIP would also involve administrative
costs and distortions in labor-market behavior, these costs would initially be far less than the benefits of the TIP in shortening the period
of restraint and slow growth needed to reduce inflation.
As emphasized earlier, a TIP cannot substitute for demand restraint. The latter must also be present; otherwise, any gains produced by a TIP are likely to vanish quickly under the pressure of
excess demand. Since a reward TIP would reduce budget revenues
like any other tax cut, it must fit into a budget plan that makes tax
cuts possible. But if the growth of Federal spending is restrained, pe-




67

riodic tax reductions will be both feasible and necessary in the years
ahead as inflation and economic growth push taxpayers into higher
brackets and raise average effective tax rates.
TIPs are novel, and most people are unfamiliar with either the opportunities they present or the difficulties they pose. It is therefore
highly unlikely that a TIP could take effect in 1981. But it
would be useful for the public in general, and the Congress in particular, to begin evaluating the pros and cons of TIPs so that when the
time comes for the next round of Federal tax cuts a TIP program will
be seriously considered.
INCREASING INVESTMENT, SUPPLY, AND PRODUCTIVITY
Economic policy must place greater emphasis on supply-oriented
measures during the decade of the 1980s for a number of reasons.
First, an increase in the growth of aggregate supply, and especially in
the growth of productivity, can raise the growth of output and employment that is consistent with a steady reduction in inflation.
Second, reducing this country's vulnerability to higher oil import
bills will require a substantially increased investment in alternative
energy sources over the next 10 years. Finally, even if inflation
were not a problem, a speedup in the lagging rate of productivity
growth would be essential to maintain the historic advance in our
standard of living.
The remainder of the chapter summarizes what has been happening to productivity in the United States and briefly examines some of
the reasons why the rate of productivity growth has declined. It also
examines the need to increase the share of national resources allocated to capital formation and the Administration's response to that
need. Finally, it discusses the relationship between demand- and
supply-side policies, and suggests how they must be integrated.
PRODUCTIVITY

Advances in productivity are the foundation of advances in our
standard of living. Increases in output per worker lead to increases in
real income. Healthy increases in productivity can free the funds
needed to improve the conditions of disadvantaged groups while
lessening the need for sacrifice elsewhere. Thus, when productivity
growth declines, these other advances also are delayed. But expectations of a rising living standard persist. They perpetuate demands for
real income gains which can no longer be met and which lead to inflationary increases in wages and to growth in government spending.
Since the mid-1960s, the growth rate of labor productivity has
been declining from its postwar highs. In recent years the decline has
been so marked as to pose a major challenge to public policy. Be-




68

cause declining productivity growth brings with it prospects for
slower improvement in our standard of living and contributes to inflation, a program to stimulate productivity growth must be a keystone of economic policy.
Table 8 summarizes the postwar history of growth in productivity. The data show a gradual worsening of the productivity decline as
time has passed, with the last few years showing sharp declines. While
just completed revisions of the data may change the magnitude and
timing of the slowdown, its existence and its costliness are unarguable.

Some of the decline in productivity results from the way we measure it. In particular, productivity measurement counts as an input the
costs of governmental and private actions to ensure a cleaner environment, a healthier workplace, and safer consumer products, but it
does not count the benefits of these actions as forms of output.
It is difficult to interpret measures of productivity such as those in
Table 8 without first distinguishing between changes caused by the
business cycle and changes caused by longer-term factors. Because it
is costly to hire or to fire, businesses typically do not reduce their
work force proportionally when demand slackens or increase it proportionally when demand is expanding. Chart 4 presents the recent
history of productivity growth after correction for these cyclical influences. As the chart vividly shows, productivity grew very slowly
during most of the years since 1973, and on several occasions actually declined.
It would not be surprising to discover that the slowdown has many
causes. Measured productivity growth is a distillation of a number of
changes and influences. Many researchers have been in agreement
that a number of factors have contributed in roughly equal magnitude to the slowdown. These factors have been discussed in past Reports. In addition to increased governmental regulation, particular attention has focused on increases in energy prices, declines in the rate
of growth of capital relative to labor, and decreases in spending on

research and development. But there has also been widespread
agreement that a large portion of the slowdown has not yet been explained.
INVESTMENT NEEDS

One of the causes of the decline in productivity growth has been
the decline in growth of the capital stock relative to the labor force.
Because a rising'share of capital formation has been devoted to adjustments to cope with higher energy prices and to complying with
environmental and safety regulations, a diminishing fraction of investment has been available to effect gains in productivity. Although
these developments may not have been the primary causes of the
productivity slowdown, increasing capital formation would nevertheless be an effective way of reversing the slowdown. Many of the factors affecting productivity cannot be directly or immediately influenced by the government, but economic policyâ€”especially tax
policyâ€”can influence the pace of capital formation.
As a general rule, an increase in the amount of capital invested per
worker is associated with an increase in output per workerâ€”i.e., in
increased productivity. There are two reasons for this. First, processes that generate more output per worker usually require more capital
per worker, and second, increasing the ratio involves putting newer
capital into place. The newer capital is likely to* embody more ad-




70

vanced technology and will therefore increase the efficiency of the
capital stock.
During the decade of the 1960s the capital-labor ratio grew at an
average rate of about 3 percent per year; over the last 5 years, however, the ratio has remained roughly constant. This development has
been due to both the slower growth in the capital stock and to the
more rapid growth in employment and hours worked (Table 9). The
1974-79 deceleration in the growth of capital is somewhat at odds
with the rough stability in the investment share of GNP over the
same period and requires some explanation. A greater share of investment is now being spent on relatively short-lived assets. The
ratio of investment in equipment to investment in nonresidential
structures has increased in recent years. The result is that each dollar
of gross investment now yields less net investment because the capital
stock is depreciating more rapidly.

To restore the growth of the capital stock per worker to that of the
1960s would require that the share of investment in GNP rise by at
least 1 percentage point from its recent average of about 10 Vz percent. Such a development should, at a minimum, restore the productivity growth lost from this source. Further improvement would require yet more investment.
Apart from the necessity of improving the productivity growth rate,
there are other reasons why future economic policy should encourage increased investment. Last year's Report discussed these needs in
detail. The average age of the capital stock at the end of 1979 was
7.1 years. This suggests that much of our plant and equipment was
put in place when oil prices were much lower than they are now.
Higher energy prices have shortened the service life of older and less
energy-efficient capital and made it in the national interest to speed
up its replacement. The magnitude of these investments is difficult to




71

estimate, but it could represent perhaps another 1 percent of GNP
per year.
Additional investment requirements arise from the need to continue domestic production of oil, coal, and natural gas at sharply higher
investment costs per unit of energy produced, and to expand the investment devoted to alternative energy sources. Conservatively estimated, they amount to about another one-half percent of GNP.
During the late 1960s and early 1970s, before the first surge in oil
prices, real business fixed investment averaged about lOVfe percent of
GNP. In 1978-79, the investment share averaged slightly higher,
around 10% percent, probably reflecting additional investment in the
energy industries. On the basis of a rough judgment, continuation of
investment in the neighborhood of 10y2 percent of GNP would meet
the "normal" requirements of a moderately growing economy and
hold the capital stock per worker approximately constant, as it has
been in the past 5 years. But it would not provide for an expansion
of capital per worker or for the Nation's increased needs for energy
investment.
Meeting these objectives will require substantial additional investment. Since the growth of aggregate demand and total GNP will be
constrained in the years immediately ahead by the need to reduce inflation, the extra investment cannot come from additional GNP
growth but will have to displace consumption or government spending, the other major components of GNP. According to the estimates
presented earlier, the share that investment takes in total output will
have to rise substantially from a normally expected lOVa percent or
so to 12V2 to 13 percent, and the combined share of consumption
and government spending will have to fall by a corresponding
amount.
It is virtually certain that such a large increase in the investment
share will not be forthcoming without deliberate government policies. The major elements of such a policy lie in a combination of
Federal tax measures and expenditure control. In the future, Federal
personal tax receipts will take a steadily increasing share of personal
income as inflation pushes taxpayers into higher brackets. As oil
prices are decontrolled, revenues will be transferred from purchasersâ€”who will pay the higher pricesâ€”to the Federal Government
through the windfall profits tax. For both of these reasons the ratio
of taxes to GNP will tend to rise and the growth of consumption will
be depressed. If Federal expenditures are controlled so that their
share of GNP does not rise, periodic tax reductions will be possible.
Indeed, they will be necessary to prevent even moderate economic
growth from being choked off. If a sizable fraction of those tax reductions are of a kind which concentrate on encouraging investment




72

rather than restoring the growth of consumption, the share of investment in GNP can be raised. Of course, if the share of Federal expenditures in GNP is not merely stabilized but reduced, the room for
increasing the investment share of GNP through investment-oriented
tax cuts will be even larger.
Within this framework, tax reductions designed to increase the
share of investment in GNP must meet two requirements: They must
increase the demand for investment goods, and simultaneously they
must increase savingâ€”i.e., they should not increase consumption.
These two requirements are closely related, but they are not the
same. There are a number of measures that might seek to increase
saving but have little if any effect on the volume of business investment. Forgoing tax cuts, letting effective tax rates increase, and creating a large Federal budget surplus, for example, would appear to
be one way of increasing national saving. Although such a policy
would make possible a decline in interest rates, it would also create a
substantial fiscal drag, reduce economic growth and private saving,
and probably yield no increase in business investment spending.
Conversely, measures that increase investment demand without
making room for it with an increase in saving will yield an excessive
growth in total demand and renewed inflationary pressure. Both aspects of the problem are important. Given the determinants of investment, what tax policies can best increase the demand for investment goods? What form of tax reductions are most likely to be channeled into saving rather than consumption?
INVESTMENT DETERMINANTS AND INFLATION

Expectations about future growth are critical in determining the
volume of investment demand for the economy as a whole. But the
essence of the earlier discussion was that investment needs to increase by more than the amount that would be associated simply with
a normal expansion of output. A number of factors influence the
amount of capital that firms want to use to produce a given amount
of output. Chief among them are the attractiveness of the return on
capital investment as compared with other uses of investors' funds,
the perceived riskiness of corporate investment, and the cost and
availability of capital.
One lesson that has been learned in recent years is the deleterious
effect of inflation on investment. High inflation rates increase the
perceived riskiness of investment, and this increased uncertainty
makes planning for future capital needs more difficult. The information about relative demand that is contained in price changes becomes clouded when inflation is high. In addition, increasing rates of
inflation are ordinarily accompanied by the expectation of sharply




73

higher interest rates and monetary stringency. The expected slowing
of growth in demand reduces the incentive to add capacity.
But by far the most important effect of inflation on investment is
its impact on tax accounting provisions and depreciation allowances.
Depreciation is a cost of earning income from fixed capital assets.
This cost is the reduced value of the asset due to use, aging, and obsolescence. The depreciation allowed for tax purposes is based on
the historical cost of an asset. When inflation occurs, allowable depreciation is reduced relative to the cost of replacing the asset at
today's price. Inflation therefore raises the tax on capital and reduces
the rate of return on investment, and this problem worsens as the
rate of inflation increases.
The inflation-induced increase in the tax on income from business
plant and equipment is partly offset by the inflation-induced reduction in the tax burden of borrowers. Firms are allowed to charge the
full value of their interest payments against income, even though a
portion of these higher interest payments amounts to the repayment
of real capital to lenders. The effect on the return to investment of
this "excess" deduction varies with the proportion of investment that
is debt-financed. It also varies with the extent to which inflation is
reflected in interest rates. Since an important part of investment is
not debt-financed, it is clear that inflation's tax-increasing impact on
the value of depreciation allowances outweighs the tax-decreasing
impact of excess deductions on the return to business investment.
Some have suggested that the inflation-induced distortion of tax
depreciation could be corrected by indexing the value of existing
business assets to allow replacementâ€”rather than historicalâ€”cost depreciation. But indexing the value of assets would ignore the interest
rate offset described in the prior paragraph. Moreover, as with all indexing schemes its administrative and accounting problems would be
quite severe, and almost any simple index imaginable would introduce distortions of its own. For these and other reasons, indexing is
not an attractive means of correcting the inflation-induced distortion
in depreciation allowances.
TAX MEASURES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT

Policymakers have three principal measures to influence investment
through the tax system: changes in depreciation allowances, changes
in the investment tax credit, and changes in the corporate income tax
rate.
Since the effect of inflation in depressing the value of depreciation
is such an obvious factor in the recent decline in after-tax rates of
return on capital assets, the liberalization of depreciation allowances
is an attractive way to enhance investment. It not only provides an
overall incentive for investment but, if carefully designed, it can also




74

correct some of the distortions in investment that accompany inflation. Under proposals for accelerated depreciation, the allowable depreciation on capital assets would be increased. This would permit
firms to write off their capital purchases faster. The changes would
affect two determinants of business investment. First, they would increase the after-tax yield of capital investment, and thus its attractiveness. Second, they would increase business cash flow and thereby
supply a portion of the funds needed to finance additional investment.
Increases in the investment tax credit would have a similar impact
on investment incentives. The investment tax credit reduces the purchase price of eligible equipment. It thus provides a direct incentive
by raising net return and by increasing after-tax cash flow.
A reduction in corporate income tax rates, on the other hand, influences investment by increasing after-tax profits. This tends to be a
less effective stimulus to investment than either accelerated depreciation or increases in the investment tax credit because it has a smaller impact on the net return from new purchases of capital assets. In
addition, depreciation liberalization or an increased investment tax
credit are only available to a firm to the extent it invests, but a corporate tax reduction would be available whether investment is undertaken or not.
The President's Economic Revitalization Program contains several
elements that would significantly improve the outlook for business
investment by offering direct incentives to invest in new plant and
equipment as well as support for business cash flow. The two major
investment incentives in the program are expansion in the coverage
of the investment tax credit and a simplified and liberalized form of
depreciation allowances.
The proposed changes in the investment tax credit would allow
firms to claim full credit for all equipment purchases, even shortlived assets that currently are allowed only a portion of the tax credit.
In addition, the investment tax credit would be made partially
refundable. Under the current law, the credit can be used to offset
the first $25,000 of tax liabilities plus up to 70 percent (rising to 90
percent by 1982) of liabilities in excess of $25,000. But the proposed
change would allow firms to claim 30 percent of the value of the
credit even if they had no tax liabilities for the year. In this way,
firms with substantial investment needs but with little or no current
earnings would be supported in their efforts to rejuvenate and
expand their capital assets. Among these are both younger and smaller firms that are just beginning to grow and larger industries undergoing transition, such as autos and steel.




75

The proposal for tax depreciationâ€”the Constant Rate Depreciation
(CRD) proposalâ€”would allow firms to accelerate depreciation on
new equipment and new structures. Under this proposal, the rate of
depreciation allowable over the life of the typical capital asset would
be roughly 40 percent larger. In addition, the CRD proposal would
greatly simplify depreciation accounting.
The President's proposed depreciation reforms share certain
common features with two recent tax proposals: the bill reported by
the Senate Finance Committee last fall, and the so-called "10-5-3"
proposal. Both proposals would liberalize depreciation allowances by
shortening the tax life of capital investments. Both would also simplify business accounting by significantly reducing the number of
asset categories that firms would have to keep track of. There are important differences, however. In the President's proposal the reductions in tax life have been designed so that there would be, on average, a similar increase in depreciation allowances across all kinds of
assets. The "10-5-3" proposal provides very large increases in the
allowed depreciation for longer-lived assets but little or no change in
the depreciation allowed for many shorter-lived assets. The tax life
for structures would be reduced from an average 30-35 years to just
10 years, but, for example, automobile purchases would be allowed a
lifetime of 3 years, exactly the same as under current tax laws. Because the "10-5-3" proposal would grant uneven benefits across
asset types, the demand for investment goods would be significantly
skewed from what would be dictated by economic considerations
alone. In addition, the "10-5-3" proposal includes a complex phasein schedule that may have the perverse effect of delaying capital investment.
Late in the last session of the Congress, the Senate Finance Committee reported a tax bill which also included a depreciation proposal. The Committee's bill would have established a limited number of
asset classes with shorter tax lives than under current law. While the
Committee's proposal differed from the open-end accounting of depreciation embodied in the President's proposal, its impact on the
value of depreciation and on investment incentives would have been
closer to that of the President's approach than is the "10-5-3" proposal.
THE IMPACT OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S INVESTMENT INCENTIVES

The investment tax credit and depreciation proposals in the Economic Revitalization Program would reduce the cost of capital to
firms by roughly 5 percent and increase corporate cash flow by $9
billion during 1981 through reduced tax liabilities. By 1985 the increases in cash flow would total nearly $30 billion annually. It is anticipated that business fixed investment will be 5 to 10 percent




76

higher than it would otherwise be by the end of 1982, with smaller
additional gains thereafter.
These estimates are derived from statistical relationships which link
business investment demand not only with investment incentives,
such as accelerated depreciation or increases in the investment tax
credit, but also with expected capacity needs and demands for
output. According to the historical experience which underlies these
estimates, increases in investment demand can be affected by accelerated depreciation even when capacity utilization is relatively lowâ€”as
it is forecast to be over the near term (Chapter 3). Indeed, the recent
historical evidence offers additional support for the view that investment spending could proceed at a rapid pace without extraordinary
tightness in industrial capacity. During 1976, the first full year of
growth following the 1974-75 recession, real business fixed investment grew 5.3 percent despite the relatively low (79.5 percent) rate
of manufacturing capacity utilization during that year. In the following year, growth in real business fixed investment was 11.9 percent,
while the utilization rate rose to only 81.9 percent.
SAVING

Any increase in the investment share of GNP must be accompanied
by a corresponding increase in the saving share of GNP. Total national saving comes from three sources: individuals save out of their
personal income; businesses retain, and thereby save, some of their
profit income; and governments save when they run a budget surplus, or dissave when they run a budget deficit. It is total national
saving that supports total investment. A portion of saving flows into
residential investment, investment in inventories, and net foreign investment. The remainder is available to finance business purchases of
plant and equipment.
The Federal Government has numerous policy options for changing the level of national saving and thereby supporting a higher level
of aggregate investment. But it is important to realize that no one
sector works in isolation. A given sector's increase in saving may be
partially or fully offset by another sector's dissaving.
Personal tax cuts designed to increase specific types of saving, such
as an increase in the amount of tax-free interest from passbook savings accounts, are likely to be the least effective ways to increase total
saving. They will increase the flow of saving into those instruments
whose after-tax returns have been raised, but they will do so primarily at the expense of those forms of household saving whose after-tax
returns have not been raised. They will reshuffle personal saving but
increase its amount very little.
General reductions in personal tax rates would increase personal
income, which would itself lead to higher saving. In addition, the

333-540

:




QL

77

higher after-tax return on saving may induce still further increases in
saving. This is more likely to occur if the personal tax cuts are directed at higher-income individuals who tend to save relatively more of
their additional after-tax income. But there is substantial evidence
that, in any case, the personal saving rate responds very little to
changes in rates of return or in the tax structure. A large part of the
personal tax reduction would therefore go toward increasing consumption.
The most effective avenue at the disposal of the Federal Government to increase the volume of saving is to reduce taxes on business
income. Cuts in business taxes would lower government saving, but a
large part of the tax cut would flow into business saving. Business
after-tax cash flow would be increased. In time, part of the increased
cash flow would lead to higher corporate dividends. A very large
part, however, would be allocated to an increase in retained earningsâ€”i.e., saving. Evidence suggests, for example, that corporations
save more than 50 cents from every additional dollar of after-tax
income. Furthermore, some portion of any dividend increase would
find its way into personal saving. By contrast, giving the tax cut directly to households would have a smaller effect on saving because
households are likely to save a much smaller fraction of every dollar of
additional disposable income.
It seems wise, then, to focus government efforts on the sector most
likely to allocate a large part of any tax relief to savingâ€”business. A
business tax cut would result in relatively large saving, and incentives
to expand investment demand would simultaneously be improved. It
is this approach that lies at the heart of the President's Economic Revitalization Program.
THE INTEGRATION OF DEMAND-SIDE AND SUPPLY-SIDE
POLICIES
Tax reductions which induce additional saving and investment will
contribute to faster productivity growth, and this in turn will help
reduce inflation. A number of critical questions arise, however, in determining the appropriate type, magnitude, and timing of any tax reductions. First, what kind of an increase in productivity might reasonably be expected from investment-oriented tax cuts of various sizes,
and what would be the associated reduction in inflation? Second, to
what extent would the improvements in productivity and other
supply-creating aspects of a tax reduction offset the increase in aggregate demand they would cause? More generally, how would tax
cuts aimed at increasing supply fit into the framework of fiscal restraint that is required to reduce inflation?




78

EXPECTED PRODUCTIVITY GAINS

Although the effect on investment from a given loss of tax revenues would vary with the form of the reduction (accelerated depreciation, larger investment tax credit, or lower corporate income tax
rates), the evidence suggests that each dollar of reduction in annual
business taxes might, at the outside and after several years, generate
slightly more than a dollar in business fixed investment. To increase
investment by 10 percent, a business tax reduction of at least $30 billionâ€”or about 1 percent of GNPâ€”would be necessary. This larger
volume of investment, maintained from 1981 through 1985, would
increase the capital stock by about 5 percent after allowing for depreciation. On the basis of the historical relationships between output
and capital, such an addition to the capital stock might generate a
total increase in the level of productivity of at most 1.5 percent by
1985, or about 0.3 percent per year. In view of the declining rate of
productivity growth which the Nation has experienced in recent
years, however, this small improvement would be significant.
Such a rise in the productivity growth rate would not be likely to
induce a faster rise in money wage demands. Therefore, since the
growth of unit labor costs is equal to the increase in compensation
per hour minus the rate of growth in productivity, the faster productivity growth rate should lead to a slower rise in costs and prices. In
turn, a slower rise in prices would help to reduce the growth of
wages, leading to a still further slowdown of inflation. All told, an investment-oriented tax cut amounting to about 1 percent of GNP
might produce a 0.3 percentage point rise in productivity growth that
would translate, after several years, to just over one-half percentage
point reduction in the inflation rate.
DEMAND VERSUS SUPPLY RESPONSES TO TAX CUTS

Tax reductions have two principal effects. On the one hand, individuals and firms will buy more goods and services. As a tax cut is
spent and respent throughout the economy, the resulting increase in
nominal GNP will exceed the original tax cut. As a result of this multiplier process, aggregate demand will rise by more than the tax cut.
But tax cuts also increase the supply of goods and services. Since
lower tax rates allow individuals and firms to keep a larger fraction of
their income after taxes, the lower rates affect incentives to work, to
save, and to invest the savings, increasing potential GNP.
Although the magnitude of the multiplier varies according to the
nature of the tax cut, aggregate demand typically rises by about twice
the size of a reduction in taxes. Thus, a tax cut equal to 1 percent of
GNP will increase aggregate demand by about 2 percent. To match
the increase in demand, a 2 percent increase in supply would also be




79

required. To the extent that its supply response is less than the additional demand it creates, any tax reduction adds to the pressures of
demand on the rate of inflation.
But there are two ways in which such tax cuts can be made while
still restraining demand. First, tax reductions may offset increases in
other taxes. As discussed earlier, inflation pushes taxpayers into
higher tax brackets, so that the average effective tax rateâ€”the ratio
of tax revenues to GNPâ€”rises. Consumption is depressed and economic growth reduced. In the years ahead, periodic tax reductions
will therefore be both possible and necessary to keep aggregate
demand from falling. Second, a tax reduction accompanied by Federal spending reductions of roughly the same magnitude will not
change aggregate demand; hence, even if the supply response to a
tax cut is smaller than the demand response, inflationary pressures
will not be generated.
Thus, it is clear that the design and timing of supply-oriented tax
cuts depend importantly on the specific relationship between the
demand-side and supply-side responses. If such tax reductions fail to
generate enough supply to offset the additional demand they
createâ€”and the evidence discussed below suggests this to be the
case, particularly for personal tax reductionsâ€”they must then be integrated like any tax cut into policies of demand management.
THE SUPPLY-SIDE RESPONSE TO PERSONAL TAX CUTS

A 10 percent reduction in marginal tax rates on individuals (approximately a $30-billion personal tax cut in 1981) would increase
the total demand for goods and services by $60 billion, or 2 percent
of GNP. It could also lead to increases in individual work and saving
in response to the lower tax rates and thereby increase potential
GNP. How much of the increase in demand would be matched by
such increases in supply?
The Supply of Labor

The additional production that results from lowering taxes on
labor income depends both on changes in the quantity of labor supplied (i.e., the total number of hours worked) and on changes in the
average productivity of labor.
Higher after-tax wages make work more attractive. This encourages
new entrants to join the labor force and those already employed to
work longer hours. Since after-tax incomes have risen, however,
people can also afford to work lessâ€”to take longer vacations or to
shorten their workweeks. Whether the former effect would or would
not exceed the latter effect is hard to predict. A preponderance of
the evidence suggests that for adult men the two effects approximately offset each other; that is, a cut in income taxes increases the




80

supply of adult men in the work force only slightly, if at all. Women,
on the other hand, and particularly married women, respond much
more strongly to higher wages. In the past, the number of adult
women in the work force may have increased by as much as 1 percent for every 1 percent increase in take-home pay. Although women
are more responsive to changes in their wages than are men, men
still outnumber women in the labor force and on average earn substantially more. Therefore, a reduction in personal income tax rates
would increase the total supply of labor only slightly.
Whether an increase in the labor supply would be accompanied by
an increase in productivity is uncertain. While most business investment enhances productivity, an increase in the labor supply would
not improve productivity unless it increased the average quality of
work performed or the intensity of effort. Productivity might actually
fall as the supply of labor increased if the additional labor supply
consisted, on balance, of less skilled or less experienced workers.
Alternatively, some have argued that the increased supply of labor
from high-income, high-productivity workers would outweigh the increased supply from other workers, so that the average productivity
of the labor force would rise. This could happen if high-productivity
workers were more sensitive to a given percentage change in aftertax earnings, or if the tax reduction represented a larger percentage
change in their take-home pay. Since high-income workers are a
small fraction of the labor force, these influences would have to be
large to alter total productivity significantly. Studies of high-income
workers generally do not find them much more responsive to equal
percentage increases in after-tax income. However, a 10 percent
across-the-board reduction in tax rates would also mean a larger percentage increase in the after-tax earnings for these workers because
their households are in high marginal tax brackets. A 10 percent tax
cut is, therefore, likely to produce a somewhat larger change in the
supply of high-income workers. Still, even in high-income households
it is in fact second-income earnersâ€”generally those who have lower
productivityâ€”who are apt to be the most responsive to lower tax
rates.
Balancing the two opposing forcesâ€”the lack of experience of new
workers and the possibility of a greater-than-average influx of higherincome workersâ€”it seems unwise to assume that the average productivity of the labor force will be improved by a personal tax cut.
Taking all the relevant factors into account, the limited response of
the supply of labor and of productivity to a 10 percent reduction in
personal income tax rates is likely to produce an increase in potential
GNP of perhaps 0.2 percent to at most 0.6 percent. This result follows in part from evidence suggesting that such a tax cut would




81

induce an increase in labor supply between 0.3 and 1.0 percent. According to past relationships between labor and production, such an
increase in labor supply would lead to the modest increase in potential GNP mentioned above.
The Supply of Saving

A reduction in personal income tax rates increases both the income
out of which an individual worker can save and the after-tax return
to saving. It would also tend to discourage borrowing by reducing
the value of the income tax deduction for interest payments. If the
increases in personal saving find their way into additional business
investment, productivity will rise.
Most empirical studies have concluded that changes in personal
income tax rates would have only a small effect on personal saving.
At best, a 10 percent reduction in tax rates would increase personal
saving less than 3 percent. This means that the saving rateâ€”the average share of personal saving in disposable income, which over the
last 5 years has averaged 5.7 percentâ€”would rise by no more than
0.2 percentage point. The additional saving would at most be equivalent to only about 0.2 percent of GNP.
Even if every dollar of personal saving that resulted from a 10 percent tax cut were invested in business plant and equipmentâ€”and
some, in fact, would flow into housingâ€”the effects on output and on
productivity would be small. If the tax cut and the higher saving continued for 5 years, the additional saving and investment would increase potential GNP by less than 0.3 percent and lead to a negligible increase in the annual rate of productivity growth.
This examination of likely responses thus suggests that even under
the most optimistic circumstances, a 10 percent reduction in tax rates
would not induce enough additional work, saving, or investment to
offset more than a fraction of the 2 percent increase in aggregate
demand that would accompany the tax cut.
BUSINESS TAX CUTS

It was pointed out earlier that a tax cut that liberalized the business depreciation allowance or increased the investment tax credit
could, after a time, have a fairly substantial effect on the Nation's
productive potential. Such a tax cut, amounting to 1 percent of GNP,
could raise potential output by perhaps \xk percent over a 5-year
period.
This would still be less than the 2 percent rise in aggregate
demand that would also be generated, however. More important, the
increase in demand would come relatively quickly, most of it within
lVa to 2 years. The increase in supply, on the other hand, would
occur very gradually. As a consequence, the tax cut would tend to




82

increase demand pressures, especially in the years immediately following it. While tax reductions that are effective in raising investment
are essential in a long-term strategy to promote economic growth,
business tax cuts, like personal tax cuts, must be designed to fit into
an overall framework of fiscal restraint.
CONCLUSIONS

This analysis of the macroeconomic effects of Federal tax reductions suggests several conclusions for the development of fiscal
policy:
First, specific investment-oriented tax reductions for business are
likely to increase saving, investment, and productivity by a much
more significant degree than cuts in personal income taxes.
Second, productivity-oriented tax reductions will yield improvements
in the inflation rate that are helpful and significant, but still relatively
modest in the context of a 10 percent underlying inflation rate.
Third, the supply response, while a critically important feature of
any tax reduction, will be substantially less than the demand response, particularly in the short run.
Fourth, since reductions in both business and personal taxes will increase demand faster than supply, they must be designed and carried
out in ways that are consistent with the demand restraint needed to
reduce inflation.
It is sometimes alleged that the potentially inflationary effects of a
large tax cut can be avoided if the Federal Reserve steadfastly pursues its goal of keeping the growth of the monetary aggregates
within tight targets. But if taxes are reduced while the Federal Reserve pursues an unchanged monetary policy, aggregate demand will
nevertheless increase, especially in the short run. The increase in
demand would lead to a rise in interest rates that would dampen the
increase in aggregate demand but not eliminate it. Additional inflationary pressure would then result.
A very large tax cut unaccompanied by the necessary spending cuts
would lead to both an increase in inflation and a sharp rise in interest rates. Some, and perhaps all, of the stimulus to investment from
tax reductions would be undone by the higher interest rates and the
greater uncertainty engendered by a new round of inflation.
Monetary restraint is an absolutely essential element of inflation
control and reduction. Tax measures focused on increasing supply
can make a significant contribution. But there will be a continuing
need for careful and prudent fiscal policies to restrain demand. In
recent years the Nation has come to appreciate the potential value of
supply-oriented tax policies. In the process of learning some needed
lessons about supply-side economics, however, the Nation cannot




83

afford to forget its hard-learned lessons about the need for demandside restraint.
The three central elements of a macroeconomic policy to reduce
inflation and advance the Nation's prospects for healthy economic
growth have been set forth in this chapter: maintaining a persistent
and prudent course of demand restraint; putting in place an improved incomes policy using tax incentives to induce wage moderation; and increasing the share of the Nation's output going to investment. The next chapter deals with the challenge of inflation and
growth at the level of individual markets and sectors. It concentrates
on measures to increase the economy's flexibility and capacity for adjusting to change.
Carrying out these policies will require patience and, in the interim, some sacrifice. But if they are followed with persistence they
promise a substantial payoff in improved economic performance.
TECHNICAL APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 1

MEASURING PAY INCREASES UNDER A TIP
Once the basic features of a pay TIP have been chosen, several
problems in the measurement of average pay increases must be
solved. These problems arise from changes in the composition of a
firm's work force, from fringe benefits, and from multiyear union
contracts with cost-of-living adjustments. Resolving these problems
requires striking a balance among administrative convenience, equity,
efficiency, and the effect on inflation.
COMPOSITION OF THE WORK FORCE

Like any well-designed tax, a successful TIP must use a measure of
average pay increase that is unambiguous, that alters behavior in undesirable ways as little as possible, and that is fair in its treatment of
different types of firms and workers. The simplest indicator of average payâ€”total wages received by a group of workers divided by the
total number of hours they workâ€”is a poor measure because it
changes both with hourly wage rates and with the number of overtime hours. Even if wage rates increased by less than the TIP standard, an increase in the average amount of overtime, paid at a premium, could put the group out of compliance. Using this measure
would therefore discourage overtime work, an undesirable distortion.
A better measure would use straight-time wages divided by straighttime hours, with adjustments to reflect changes in the length of the
standard workweek or the size of the overtime premium.
Because of possible changes in the composition of the group, however, a simple measure of straight-time wages divided by straight-




84

time hours also has drawbacks. For example, during a recession a
firm may grant a pay raise far below the TIP standard and also lay
off large numbers of low-seniority workers. Because low-seniority
workers tend to have below-average wages, the remaining workers
will have higher wages than the original group. Consequently, this
measure of wage change may well show that the increase in average
pay exceeded the standard even if no individual worker received such
a large raise. Conversely, when firms hire additional low-seniority,
low-wage workers during expansion, the group may appear to be in
compliance even if all continuing workers receive pay raises above
the standard.
This measure is also affected by changes in the skill-mix of the
work force. If a firm increases the proportion of low-wage, less
skilled workers in its work force, the measure will show a calculated
wage increase less than the "true" wage increase. A decrease in the
proportion of less skilled workers will show just the opposite. Because of these features, the measure also discriminates in favor of
growing firms and against declining firms, since new workers are, on
average, likely to be paid less than those already on the payroll.
More important, this measure introduces an element of uncertainty. A firm could agree with its workers to grant pay increases that
met the standardâ€”citing the TIP reward as an offsetting factorâ€”and
then unexpectedly discover at the end of the year that small changes
in the composition of the work force had put the group out of compliance. Firms and workers who had negotiated small pay raises in
anticipation of receiving a TIP reward or avoiding a penalty might
find themselves above the standard, while others who had ignored
the standards could be surprised to find themselves in compliance.
An unpredictable measure is not only unfair; it also will have less
effect, since firms and workers will tend to ignore the standard if
they cannot be sure that small pay raises will result in compliance.
Data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics from a large
sample of establishments suggest that significant changes in the composition of a firm's work force are common. As Table 10 shows, 22
percent of the workers in the motor vehicle industry were in establishments that experienced an increase in their calculated straighttime hourly earnings of more than 13 percent between December
1978 and December 1979. During this period the United Auto Workers' contract, which covered a majority of the workers in these establishments, provided for an increase of about 11 percent, including
cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). Therefore, most of the establishments with increases in calculated average hourly earnings larger
than this must have experienced a change in the composition of their
work force.

Additional evidence suggesting large shifts in the composition of
the work force is provided by the percentage of workers in establishments who experienced actual declines in their average nominal
wage. For all manufacturing, 5.1 percent of workers were in establishments that reported declining money wage rates, and 8.5 percent
of those in food processing were in establishments that reported
nominal wage declines. It is hard to believe that such a large percentage of workers were in establishments that actually cut the average
nominal wage for their entire work force during a period in which
the CPI rose by 13.3 percent.
Clearly, a satisfactory measure of wage changes will be one that is
not affected by systematic changes in work force composition. The
problem can be solved either by a wage index or by a measure that
counts only the hours and payroll for those workers who were with
the firm throughout the year. A wage index, like a price index, combines the wage rates for specific types of jobs into one measure. The
weights used reflect the percentage of a firm's workers in each skill
or seniority level. A wage index reflects the "true" average pay increase for all employees and is not affected by changes in composition or seniority. Such an index would be relatively easy to construct
for many firms. Union contracts already set wage rates for specific
jobs. Some large nonunion firms and many States and local governments also have pay scales that list the salary levels of workers in
each job category and seniority step.
These union and nonunion pay scales could be used with the base
period percentages of workers in each job category to calculate a
firm's average pay raise, just as a price index is used along with a
base period market basket of goods to measure price increases. To
ensure that the firms did not give raises above the standard by promoting workers, rates of promotion above past experience would be
included in the calculation of pay raises. Doing so, of course, may




86

reintroduce the problem of changing skill mix if the additional promotions reflect an upgrading of skills.
Nonunion firms that do not have pay scales could calculate their
average pay raise from the wages and hours of those workers who
continued to work for the firm throughout the year. Such a measure
would not be affected by changes in the composition of the work
force, since the wage rates of former or new employees would not
enter into the calculation. Because firms generally hire new workers
at the bottom and retire or lose workers from the top, the average
pay raise for continuing workers will exceed the average pay raise for
all workers in a firm with stable composition but high turnover.
Therefore, measures for continuing workers must be adjusted to
allow for promotions.
MEASURING FRINGE BENEFITS

A critical element in the measurement of pay increases is the treatment of fringe benefits. The cost of a given package of fringe benefits can increase for either of two reasons: because the package has
become more generous (the employer is buying more services for the
employees) or because the price of a given set of services has risen.
For example, an employer who adds dental benefits onto the health
insurance provided for employees would increase the cost of health
insurance by improving the package of benefits. Health insurance
premiums might also rise for a given set of benefits simply because
medical care in general becomes more expensive.
Which increases in the costs of fringe benefits should the TIP include as increases in compensation? One approach is to include all
increases in the cost of fringe benefits, both those that reflect higher
prices for a fixed package as well as those that reflect improvements
in the package. This would treat each dollar paid in fringe benefits
exactly like a dollar paid in cash wages. Such an approach, however,
would require extensive work to evaluate the cost of all benefits. Although determining the cost of fringe benefits purchased from other
organizations, such as medical insurance, would be simple, determining the cost of other fringes, like unfunded pension benefits, would
be more difficult. Another drawback is that firms and workers might
object to being ruled out of compliance for cost changes they could
not control, such as the cost of employer health plans.
An alternative treatment would be to exclude fringe benefits completely from the calculation of a group's average pay raise. This
would involve the fewest administrative problems. It would, however,
provide a strong incentive for firms to give all increases above the
standard in the form of fringes rather than cash, since the group
would be in compliance as long as cash remuneration did not increase by more than the standard. This would defeat the purpose of




87

the TIP and would also distort the structure of labor compensation
for a long period.
A compromise solution would be to include only the cost of improvements in benefit packages. For example, the cost of new medical benefits would be charged against the standard but increases in
the cost of existing benefits would not. This would reduce the difficulty of estimating the costs of some types of fringes without creating
an incentive to divert all pay increases above the standard into benefit improvements. Although fringes would still be treated more generously than cash wages, this compromise would eliminate a certain
amount of paperwork.
MULTIYEAR CONTRACTS

A third problem in measuring wage increases is the evaluation of
new multiyear union contracts. A TIP will have its greatest effect on
the wage settlement if the firm and union know when they are bargaining whether the contract's provisions are in compliance with the
standard. For this reason, and to prevent firms and unions from postponing large wage increases to the later years of a contract in order
to be in compliance during the first year, the entire contract would
have to be evaluated in advance. Since most major union contracts
include COLAs, evaluating wage increases in new multiyear contracts
requires predicting future price inflation. (A TIP can have no direct
effect on pay increases in existing multiyear union contracts. Therefore, they can be evaluated at year-end like the pay increases of nonunion workers.)
Because the number chosen will affect expectations and thus will
affect the success of the TIP, there may could be a temptation to use
an overly optimistic prediction of future price increases. If this occurred, union workers with COLAs would often be judged to be in
compliance but then receive wage increases above the standard because the actual price increase exceeded the prediction used to evaluate the COLA. This would seem unfair to firms and workers who do
not have COLAs and, if substantial, would set in motion catch up
pressures on the part of nonunion workers that could increase inflation in subsequent years. To some extent, these considerations are
counterbalanced by the fact that union workers would have to restrain their wage increases for a 2- or 3-year contract period in order
to be in compliance with a TIP that may only last 1 year.

CHAPTER 2

Improving the Adaptability of the
Economy
THE PAST DECADE witnessed a substantial expansion of Federal
involvement in many sectors of the economy. During this period
many economists devoted a good deal of attention to ascertaining the
benefits and costs of that involvement. Much less attention was paid
to the loss of flexibility that accompanied greater government influence over private economic decisionmaking. But as new government
programs increased the number of objectives to be satisfied in the
making of economic decisions, the net result was to restrict the Nation's ability to respond quickly to economic and technological
change.
Limitations on flexibility are sometimes desirable. Federal requirements for the safe disposal of toxic wastes, for example, are undoubtedly a legitimate way to reduce the flexibility of chemical manufacturers and users. But programs that are excessively complex or overly
stringent reduce flexibility unnecessarily. Efficiency suffers, productivity declines, and the economy becomes even less responsive to
change.
As government involvement in the economy has grown, so have
the overtly political aspects of economic decisions. Representative
government is quite responsive to claims from individuals, groups, or
regions that proposed policies will benefit them or do them harm.
Since all interventions, no matter how small, have the effect of harming some and benefiting others, there has been growing pressure to
"manage" these gains and losses to produce "fairness" rather than
economic efficiency. Many of the recent arguments over deregulation, for example, have tended to focus less on the benefits of deregulated markets than on the income losses of the persons or industries that have been protected in the past by Federal economic regulation. Similarly, discussions of the problems of declining industries
have concentrated on the immediate fate confronting the companies
and workers in those industries rather than on the more diffuse
benefits associated with greater national economic efficiency.
Compassion for the human problems that accompany rapid economic adjustment may often be a valid argument for policies which




89

slow the pace of adaptation. But excessive concern over who gets
what can add rigidities to the economy and lead to the result that
almost everyone gets less.
The shocks to the world economy that occurred in the 1970sâ€”
huge and abrupt increases in energy prices, unprecedented strains on
the financial markets, major fluctuations in agricultureâ€”would have
tested even the most flexible and adaptable of economies. Since the
adaptability of our economy was already less than ideal, these shocks
hurt us more than they might have in other circumstances. Similar
shocks are likely to occur in the next decade or two. The Nation
therefore must prepare itself to deal with these shocks by increasing
the adaptability of its economic institutions.
This will pay important dividends in the Nation's fight against inflation. As pointed out in Chapter 1, rigid economic institutions
sharply limit the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies. They can
turn what otherwise would be transitory pressures for higher prices
into permanent price increases. Public and private barriers that prevent resources from flowing out of inefficient sectors to more efficient ones help create bottlenecks that impede efforts to promote
economic growth.
The need, therefore, is for greater flexibility, not merely to permit
individual sectors to respond more effectively to rapid economic
change, but also to permit the economy as a whole to withstand such
change without continual increases in the rate of inflation.
Because energy markets are such an important example of an area
in need of added flexibility, this chapter first addresses energy problems. The second section addresses two major types of regulatory
reform: eliminating obsolete regulatory structures and improving the
functioning of necessary regulation. Both kinds of reform serve to
eliminate unnecessary costs and reduce unjustified rigidities. The
third section describes some of the far-reaching changes taking place
in the financial markets and the strains these changes are creating.
The fourth section describes the changed role of the agricultural
sector and the corresponding need for more flexible instruments of
agricultural policy. The fifth section addresses the problems of structural adjustment that are being created by changing demographic
and industrial conditions, while a final section discusses the growing
pressures on government to identify and aid promising industries
and sectors.
ADAPTING TO ENERGY UNCERTAINTY
No sector of the economy better illustrates the increasing need for
flexibility and adaptability than energy. The challenge is not only to




90

use less and produce more energy in the face of higher energy
prices, but also to deal with the uncertainties of supply and price.
ADJUSTING TO HIGHER ENERGY PRICES

Available evidence suggests that the adjustment to higher energy
prices is well underway. Between 1973 and the third quarter of 1980,
real energy prices increased by 59 percent and the energy input per
dollar of real gross national product (GNP) dropped by 19 percent.
As energy prices rose, conservation of energy resources became increasingly attractive in economic terms. Shortages and uncertainty of
supply also induced conservation, sometimes very rapidly.
While many uses of energy can be adapted relatively quickly to
higher prices, others require more time. Consider the time required,
for example, for the economy to feel the full effect of a 10 percent
increase in the real price of gasoline. Studies suggest that the initial
adjustment of consumers to such a higher priceâ€”perhaps by carpooling or taking shorter recreational tripsâ€”would reduce gasoline use
by only 2 percent. But over a longer period, as consumers are able to
buy more fuel-efficient vehicles, change residential locations, and the
like, the fall in gasoline use may amount to perhaps 8 percent. Thus,
a major portion of the savings in energy use compelled by the substantial 1979-80 increases in oil prices is still before us.
Rising prices also encourage suppliers to develop new energy
sources. In the first 6 months of 1980, domestic oil producers drilled
19 percent more wells in the United States than they did during a
comparable period in 1979 and opened 15 percent more oil and gas
wells than they did in the entire year of 1973. For the first time in
years, additions to proven natural gas reserves may have exceeded
withdrawals. The development of nonconventional fuel sourcesâ€”gasohol, solar energy, and so onâ€”has also been occurring at a steppedup pace.
ADJUSTING TO PRICE AND SUPPLY UNCERTAINTY

Perhaps the biggest challenge in energy today is to minimize the
economy's vulnerability to disruptions in the supply of oil. Disruptions can vary both in size and duration. The ones experienced so
far, though painful to the world's economies, have been relatively
small. But much larger ones are conceivable. There is little doubt
that a prolonged reduction in Middle Eastern oil supplies could severely damage the U.S. economy. A recent simulation study by the
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicated that a yearlong cutoff
of oil supplies from the Persian Gulf might reduce oil supplies available to the United States by about one-third, and output by nearly 10
percentâ€”almost $3,000 per household. Although estimates of this
sort are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty, the con-




91

sequences of such an interruption on employment, wages, and prices
clearly would be massive. Moreover, the threat of disruption, small or
large, hangs like a cloud over the economy and thus affects consumer
and investor expectations. It is therefore imperative that the Nation
have policies to reduce its vulnerability to oil supply disruptions and
to deal effectively with the consequences of any vulnerability that remains.
One simple and often-used measure of vulnerability is the level of
the Nation's dependence on imported oil. In 1977 the United States
imported a record average of 8.8 million barrels of crude oil and petroleum products per day. By late 1980, however, imports had fallen
to about 6.5 million barrels per day. Although some of this drop was
due to the recession and high inventory levels, a larger part of the
decline can only be accounted for by conservation and additional domestic production.
Dependence on imported oil, however, is not equivalent to vulnerability. If imported oil came from many small geographically dispersed producers, each unlikely to cease production suddenly, even a
high level of oil imports would mean little vulnerability to interruption. At the other extreme, even a zero level of oil imports would not
totally protect the U.S. economy in the event of extreme instability in
the world oil market. The United States could not stand by and
watch the rest of the world's economies collapse without suffering irreparable economic harm itself, and would not do so, even if it were
possible to isolate itself from such damage.
Thus, vulnerability is not easily measured. It is related in part to
the ability of the Nation's capital stock to adjust rapidly enough to
changes in the world price of oil, and in part to the fact that an oil
supply interruption would result in large domestic and international
transfers of wealth, large losses in output, losses of consumer and investor confidence, and a sharp surge in inflation.
The experience of past episodes of supply disruption has taught
policymakers to appreciate the limited ability of governments to allocate scarce petroleum supplies and the long-run problems that result
from attempts to shield consumers from the consequences of higher
prices. These same episodes have also shown that such disruptions
are accompanied by other impacts that private markets cannot be expected to take into account. For example, private economic decisionmakersâ€”consumers and business firmsâ€”are unlikely or unable to
factor the substantial macroeconomic effects of an oil supply disruption into their individual responses. Therefore, they will tend to take
fewer preventive measures than is socially desirable. Moreover, the
expectation of government intervention is also likely to affect private
behavior. The experience of past disruptions may have created the




92

expectation of price controls or fuel allocation in the event of another disruption and thus further reduced the incentive for individual
consumers or business firms to take steps to protect themselves.
Large disruptions would not only intensify these effects but pose
the added risk that energy markets would be overwhelmedâ€”at least
for a whileâ€”by rapidly changing information, bottlenecks in distribution to industry, supply uncertainty, and the potentially destabilizing
influence of hoarding. Thus, the proper mix of public and private responses to an oil supply disruption will depend upon a number of
factors, including the magnitude and expected duration of the disruption and the steps taken in advance to reduce its impact.
Improving Adaptability

One way to reduce the economy's vulnerability to disruptions of
foreign oil supplies would be to increase the short-run responsiveness of domestic production and consumption to short-term changes
in price and supply. If domestic producers could easily expand
supply and users could easily reduce demand, large transfers of
income would not be generated by the price movements needed to
balance supply and demand. Thus, the more elastic the demand and
supply of energy are in the short run, the less vulnerable the economy
will be to a disruption in foreign oil supplies.
Flexibility in fuel use is one way to increase short-run elasticity in
demand. Today, for example, U.S. industrial facilities that burn over
one million barrels of oil per day have the technical capability to substitute domestic natural gas on very short notice. The potential flexibility of the country's industrial users of energy is apparently several
times this level, however. According to one source, it is possible to
develop the capability to substitute coal and natural gas for an additional four million barrels per dayâ€”for a total in excess of one-fourth
of present U.S. oil consumption.
Just what degree of fuel-switching capability is economically attractive is another matter. Building fuel-use adaptability into industrial
facilities is costly; it requires additional capital investment and may
increase operating expenses. Further, to utilize such flexibility, there
must exist both sufficient supplies of other fuels and the ability to
deliver them where needed.
The general dilemma is that the Nation's capital stock must be
sharply modified in the face of higher energy prices, but it also must
be enabled to function despite uncertainty of energy supply. As a
result, the energy-using capital stock of the future will embody a
compromise between greater productivity and fuel-use flexibility.
Actions can also be taken to increase the short-run elasticity of
energy supply. Sizable fuel inventories, in particular, would provide a
substantial degree of flexibility. At the outset of the Iran-Iraq war in




93

September 1980, world oil stocks were at record levels. U.S. domestic stocks, including oil not yet ashore, were some 300-400 million
barrels above the minimum operating needs. In contrast, world reserves were quite low when the supply of Iranian oil was disrupted in
late 1978. The shortfall associated with the 1980 interruption was
comparable in size to the shortfall of 1978-79. Yet the earlier disruption resulted in a sudden and rapid escalation of world oil prices,
while no such shock occurred after the 1980 disruption. The substantial size of world and domestic oil reserves played an important role
in preventing panic and maintaining relative price stability.
Thus, private contingency stocks and public stocks such as the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve can provide an important buffer to
future disruptions. The strategic reserve is far less than adequate,
however, and an increase in its size is essential to reducing our vulnerability to foreign supply disruptions. But care must be taken to
assure that such a buildup, by its effect on the world oil market, not
be destabilizing. Furthermore, the reserve program should not
merely substitute a stockpile created at government expense for an
increase in private precautionary inventories. This could be partially
avoided by announcing a plan that would use the strategic reserve
only in the event of a relatively large disruption and allow market
forces to come into play during smaller ones.
To date, attention has focused on oil stockpiles. But the installation
of additional industrial facilities with the flexibility to use more than
one type of fuel would make stockpiles of other fuels equally useful
in reducing upward pressure on world oil prices.
Flexibility in fuel use would not reduce our vulnerability, however,
if constraints in the distribution network impeded the use of available
alternative fuels. Propane, for example, is a frequently used alternative to natural gas, but distribution problems limited its use during
natural gas curtailments in 1976 and 1977. One solution would be to
maintain supplemental distribution capacity: additional handling or
line-haul facilities in the case of coal, additional pipeline or surge
pumping capacity in the case of natural gas, and additional wheeling
and coal generating capacity in the case of electricity. Certain of
these strategies, particularly the wheeling of electricity, have been
utilized in the past to reduce the effects of temporary fuel curtailments.
Dealing with a Disruption

Increasing private and public stocks of the different types of fuels
and improving fuel-use flexibility cannot completely eliminate the
Nation's vulnerability to a major interruption in oil supply. Both international obligations and the high cost of any actions to reduce our




94

dependence on foreign oil mean that some degree of U.S. vulnerability to oil supply disruptions will persist for a long time to come.
Even as a theoretical question, it is hard to know the level of oil
reserves that would be needed to totally insulate the United States
from a supply disruption. Present plans call for a Strategic Petroleum
Reserve of approximately one billion barrels, which is the equivalent
of about 150 days of imports at current import levels. But the reserve
is only intended to reduce our vulnerability, not to eliminate it. Let
us suppose that a publicly owned stockpile of oil equivalent to a
year's imports (about two billion barrels) would provide close to absolute protection from a disruption of Middle Eastern supplies. And
suppose further that the acquisition of such a stockpile would not
raise the world price of oil, although there can be no doubt that it
would. Such a stockpile would then cost approximately $70 billion to
acquire at the current price of about $35 per barrel. It would also
require the expenditure of about $9 billion per year in storage and
carrying costs. This is expensive insurance. Moreover, it would take
several years of uninterrupted accumulation to acquire such a stockpile.
Since it is impractical to eliminate our vulnerability, it is essential
to develop policies and programs that would assure fair and efficient
distribution of fuel supplies during a period of substantial disruption
and minimize the negative impact of such a disruption on the economy.
The Nation's current emergency plan, the authority for which expires on September 30, 1981, has two steps: a program of oil product allocation during the early stages of a major disruption, supplemented by a program of gasoline rationing if the disruption is large
enough and continues long enough. The operation of this plan requires either standby price control authority or the ability to grant
and implement this authority on extremely short notice.
The current plan is designed to reduce the large transfers of
income from domestic energy users to domestic energy producers
that would otherwise occur during a major disruption. The plan is
thus especially responsive to the goal of equity. By reducing transfers
of income the plan is also intended to meet the macroeconomic goals
of reducing the economic drag caused by increases in oil prices and
preventing temporary energy price surges from becoming permanent
through formal and informal wage and price indexing.
But the plan has many deficiencies, only some of which are administrative. Although the allocation part of the program would use an
existing bureaucratic structureâ€”albeit one scheduled to expire in
September 1981â€”the rationing part of the plan would require the
creation of an untested bureaucracy that would use the postal system




95

to distribute rationing coupons and the banking system to account
for them.
An even more important drawback is the plan's adverse impact on
efficiency. Its allocation and price control aspects may already have
had the effect of discouraging private parties from taking self-protective measures, since they would deny those who invest in emergency
fuel stocks or fuel flexibility the benefits of that investment. The
plan's intended reliance on historic patterns of fuel use in making allocations would reduce flexibility by preventing users from switching
to more abundant fuels because they had not previously used those
fuels in substantial quantities.
Finally, the plan emphasizes a reduction in gasoline use in the
event of a disruption. Gasoline alone, however, could not absorb the
brunt of a major emergency. If a complete cutoff of oil supplies from
the Persian Gulf were handled by reducing the amount of oil refined
into gasoline, the availability of gasoline in the United States would
be reduced by over 75 percent.
Thus, the present strategy for dealing with a major disruption is a
three-way compromise between the administrative problems of implementing an emergency plan, the allocation deficiencies of such a
plan, and the need to deal effectively with the severe macroeconomic
consequences of a major disruption.
One alternative plan would be to let uncontrolled market prices
apportion available supplies. Such a plan would eliminate the problems of bureaucratic administration, but it would expose the economy to the consequences which might result from the building of fuel
inventories at peak prices when the Nation's interests would be
served by drawing inventories down. Such hoarding, as well as other
complications, might occur because the problems of rapidly communicating market information during uncertain supply conditions
would make it difficult for the market to cope with a large disruption.
Furthermore, public declarations that the market would be permitted to operate without constraint during a large disruption would be
likely to lack credibility, since the market has not been permitted to
act freely during previous relatively small disruptions. Private parties
are likely to assume that the government will also intervene during a
major disruption, and they may modify their own actions accordingly.
For example, given their political visibility and small numbers, the
Nation's oil producers and distributors might pass up the opportunity to maximize short-run profit and engage instead in their own form
of product allocation. Thus, the choice might not be between a
market solution and government allocation, but between public and
private allocation plans.




96

While the market solution might promise the greatest degree of allocative efficiency, it would not respond to the problems associated
with the transfer of tens of billions of dollars from domestic consumers to overseas producers. More importantly, a "business as usual"
strategy would fail to address any of the macroeconomic consequences associated with the large and sudden transfers of income
among sectors of the domestic economyâ€”possibly amounting to
hundreds of billions of dollarsâ€”that would occur when business was
quite decidedly not "as usual/'
Another proposalâ€”one that attempts to deal with the macroeconomic effectsâ€”would allow the market to allocate oil supplies during a
major disruption but tax the resulting windfalls reaped by domestic
suppliers and rebate these new tax revenues in a way that would address the income distribution and macroeconomic problems accompanying the disruption. Although attractive in theory, such a plan
would present many practical difficulties. For one thing, as already
noted, the magnitude of the fiscal drag that would occur from allowing the free play of the market to determine prices might be immense, and the amount of administrative effort that would be required to capture the windfall profits on such huge sums and recycle
them efficiently would be substantial. This administrative burden
might even rival that of the present rationing plan.
Neither the present plan nor the tax rebate alternative would limit
the large international transfers of wealth that would accompany a
severe oil-supply disruption. Some economists have recommended
the imposition of an import fee during a disruption to capture these
windfalls. The ability of such a plan to achieve this goal is uncertain,
however, since its success would depend a great deal both on precise
timing and on the response of the oil-supplying nations: major overseas suppliers, having political as well as economic goals, might
simply respond to such a fee by raising their prices and reducing
quantities in an attempt to maintain a constant net revenue. While
the success of an import tax or fee is not certain, it nonetheless
merits further exploration because it is presently the only proposed
method of responding directly to a,transfer of income from domestic
consumers to foreign producers.
Toward a Policy to Deal with Vulnerability

Developing an appropriate set of policies to deal with vulnerability
to energy price and supply shocks is an immense challenge. The dilemma facing the policymaker is when to rely on private market responses and when to take the risks that accompany government-operated price control, allocation, and taxation schemes. The answer
would appear to have three parts. First, use the superior allocative
abilities of private markets whenever possible. The markets appear




97

capable of handling small- and medium-sized disruptions, such as
those experienced to date. Second, take technological and stockpiling
initiatives to increase short-run flexibility in energy use and supply.
This will increase the size of disruptions where a market response remains appropriate. To achieve such increased energy-use flexibility, it
would be beneficial to develop strategic stockpiles of fuels in addition
to oil. The use of these fuels during emergencies would require investments in supplementary distribution capacity. Finally, since measures to reduce vulnerability will take time to put into place, and since
the Nation will never be totally invulnerable, contingency plans must
be developed to deal with disruptions so large that they might overwhelm the private market.
For both political and economic reasons, a program of allocation
by price alone is unlikely to be adequate during a very large
disruption. Too many problems would flow from any policy that
placed a short-term "tax" amounting to as much as several thousand
dollars per year on each U.S. household. Although any nonmarket
mechanism would be administratively cumbersome and lack the allocative efficiencies of a pure market response, proper design could
materially reduce these administrative and allocative problems. The
present rationing scheme has much more precisely targeted distributional goals than most of the proposed programs of general tax rebates. Thus, differences in the value placed on achieving equity explain much of the difference in administrative complexity. A rationing plan that gave primary weight to minimizing the macroeconomic
consequences of a disruption, however, would have far fewer administrative complexities. Such a plan might forgo the establishment of
the hundreds of local boards that would otherwise be needed to adjudicate individual inequities.
Responding to the challenge of energy vulnerability will not be
made easier by ignoring the limits and complexities of alternative
policies. Thus, while the benefits of a large and well-managed Strategic Petroleum Reserve are very substantial, it is also true that a preoccupation with the reserve's potential may divert attention from the
fact that the acquisition of reserves takes time, and that even substantial reserves will not eliminate vulnerability. Similarly, the allocative
efficiency of the market would be superior to any government-run
price control and allocation scheme, yet the market alone would not
be able to cope with all of the problems associated with a major interruption. There is no doubt that the present contingency plan for
gasoline rationing has major shortcomings, but it is also true that
new and untested schemes for taxing and rebating windfall profits
could mirror in their complexity the rationing they seek to avoid.




98

High energy prices and excessive dependence on imported oil supplies are two major dimensions of the energy problem. However, the
uncertain timing of increases in energy prices and the uncertainty of
supply are two other dimensions which must command the attention
of policymakers. Higher prices aloneâ€”if known in advance with a fair
degree of certaintyâ€”would pose a costly but otherwise straightforward problem of economic adjustment. Supply uncertainty, however,
adds a potentially dangerous complication. The Nation's capital stock
must be made more energy efficient, and the Nation must change its
energy-using habits, but both of these changes must be accomplished
in ways that assure the flexibility to respond to sporadic episodes of
price escalation and shortage. The challenge to policymakers is to
adopt energy policies which effectively respond to legitimate concerns about equity and macroeconomic problems but neither penalize private efforts to respond to energy uncertainty nor unduly rigidify economic decisionmaking.
IMPROVING REGULATORY PRACTICES
Over the past decade there has been a growing awareness that
Federal regulatory activities exert substantial influence on the economy. In trying to measure this influence, some have focused on the
amount of capital required to comply with Federal regulations, some
have focused on the rate and direction of technological change, and
still others have focused on the regulatory burden facing small business. None of these measures fully captures one of regulation's most
important consequencesâ€”its tendency to reduce the ability of the
economy to adjust efficiently and swiftly to change.
Regulation's tendency to produce rigidity has sometimes been directly observable. In the past, for example, the Interstate Commerce
Commission severely restricted common carrier trucking firms trying
to choose the most efficient routes for their trucks. The fuel-adjustment charges still permitted by State regulatory agencies have reduced the interest of electric utilities in making fuel-saving investments, while the Federal regulations that rigidly segmented both the
telecommunications and financial industries helped thwart innovations that would have improved productivity.
In other situations, however, the way in which regulation reduces
flexibility is less obvious but nonetheless real. Some legislation, for
example, prevents regulators from consideringâ€”much less balancingâ€”competing national goals in establishing regulatory priorities.
There are Federal statutes that prescribe the specific dates at which
compliance with regulations must be achieved, and some statutes
even specify compliance methods. Furthermore, the compartmentaliz-




99

ing of regulatory functions often prevents the different agencies responsible for regulating different aspects of a given industry's performance from developing mutually consistent regulatory strategies.
Once regulations are issued, they are seldom given a fresh look to
see if they should be altered in the light of new knowledge or new
conditions. Each of these facets of regulation has made our economic
system less flexible. During the coming decade, however, the need to
increase the economy's adaptability and flexibility will grow. Regulatory reform must play an important role in meeting this need.
THE ROLE OF "DEREGULATION"

In several industriesâ€”railroads, trucking, airlines, energy, telecommunications, bankingâ€”where the existing regulatory structures have
largely outlived their usefulness, this Administration has achieved significant reform. Regulatory bodies like the Interstate Commerce
Commission (ICC), the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), have acted administratively
to reduce the burden of regulation where their statutes allowed them
to do so, and new legislation has carried the process even further.
Since the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, Congress
has also substantially deregulated common carrier trucking, interstate
movers of household goods, railroads, and financial institutions.
Meanwhile, the phased decontrol of natural gas and domestic crude
oil prices continued to provide a powerful spur to energy conservation and to the exploration and development of new domestic
sources of oil and natural gas. By the last quarter of 1980 an estimated 62 percent of all domestically produced crude oil was free of controls.
Transitions to Deregulation

As regulatory structures have been dismantled, the importance of
properly designing the regulatory transitionâ€”the period during
which an industry moves toward deregulationâ€”has become more evident. Changing the "rules of the game" can cause serious dislocations in a previously regulated industry, and these dislocations must
be taken into account. Users of the industry's services have made investments on the basis of the prices regulation has produced. Even if
these price signals were in some sense "wrong," these investments
cannot easily be undone. Similarly, workers and stockholders in the
industry adapted their behavior to the realities of a regulated environment long ago, and changes in the industry's regulatory structure
will affect their earnings.
Legislative debates have been dominated by the desire to cushion
those with a stake in the existing systemâ€”customers, workers, and
shareholders alikeâ€”from the shock of deregulation. For the most




100

part, the interests of these parties have been protected. Requirements for substitute service, provisions for notice of intention to suspend service, and provisions to protect the economic position of
workers have generally been written into deregulation legislation.
Unfortunately, much less care has been taken to make the course of
deregulation sufficiently flexible to withstand the shock of sharp
changes in the external environment.
The best example of this is the deregulation strategy chosen for
natural gas. The decontrol schedule adopted in the Natural Gas
Policy Act of 1978 will allow the price of "new" natural gas to gradually move up to the equivalent of $15 for a barrel of oil (in 1978 dollars) by 1985, a level thought at the time to be more than adequate
to permit a smooth transition to uncontrolled prices. By the end of
1980, however, the world price of oil (in 1978 dollars) had already
reached $28.50 per barrel. By 1985, oil prices will probably be more
than double the level anticipated when the natural gas decontrol legislation was enacted. Thus, there will still be a large gap between the
controlled price of "new" gas and the price of "decontrolled" gas.
There will then be an obvious temptation to delay complete decontrol in the hope of minimizing the shock that would occur if this
price gap was closed in one step. But delay would be unwise. A
better solution would be to reconsider the decontrol schedule soon
for the purpose of making the necessary alterations in the decontrol
path. The previous strategy of preventing windfall profits by ensuring
a slow transition to decontrol will probably have to be abandoned in
favor of a strategy which deals directly with the windfall issue.
The sharp increase in world energy prices has also placed strains
on the transition toward deregulation in other industries, particularly
airlines and railroads. The increase in energy prices has created the
inaccurate perception that the principal promise of deregulation of
the airlinesâ€”lower faresâ€”was illusory. As discussed in last year's
Report, however, only the productivity improvements permitted by deregulation prevented the sharp rise in energy prices from resulting in
even larger increases in unit costs and thus in still higher air fares.
Higher energy prices have also made service to smaller communities by large aircraft an even less attractive financial proposition than
it was earlier. However, the increased flexibility permitted by deregulation has helped to preserve air service to smaller communities by
making it easier to substitute commuter carriers. Had this flexibility
been unavailable, the short-run consequences would have been an
enormous increase in Federal subsidies to the airlines, followed by
the termination of service to many smaller communities.
With the increased fare and route flexibility permitted by deregulation, the airline industry has been weathering the most recent reces-




101

sion relatively well. Although substantial losses are being experienced
by many carriers, most analysts consider the general condition of the
industry to be sound. Most importantly, substantial investment in
more fuel-efficient aircraft is continuing.
Rising energy prices have caused a different problem for railroad
deregulation. Federal legislation enacted in 1976 provided the railroads with increased rate flexibility, but this initial dose of "deregulation" proved inadequate. In the meantime, the booming demand for
coal prompted the railroads to raise coal-hauling rates sharply. These
higher rates reflect the need to generate sufficient revenues to finance large investments in additional coal-hauling capacity, but they
may also reflect some exercise of monopoly power. In any case, the
rapid increase in coal-hauling rates, and the fear of even more rapid
increases if the ICC controls were lifted, caused opponents of further
deregulation to press for continuing ICC surveillance of coal-hauling
and other bulk commodity rates. A compromise was reached that
permitted a relaxation of the ICC's rate-approval authority on a prearranged schedule. The railroads have been given significant freedom to alter rates to meet shifting market conditions, while rail users
have been given some protection against abuse of this freedom. The
result should be better service and the substitution of coal for oil
where lower total coal costs (including the cost of transportation)
warrant.
Unexpectedly sharp increases in energy prices are not the only
factor that has complicated regulatory transitions. Any unforeseen alteration in economic conditions can produce tensions. For example,
the unprecedented swings in interest rates that occurred in 1980
placed additional strains on the .already complex deregulation process of eliminating statutory differences between the various types of
financial institutions.
This discussion leads to one conclusion. Inflexible transition paths
are likely to encounter problems, particularly if the period preceding
deregulation is stretched out to protect the economic positions of
workers, shareholders, or consumers. Flexible transition paths, on
the other hand, can allow industries to weather even large unanticipated shocks by permitting innovation. Transition paths should
therefore be made as flexible as possible. Although the political difficulties of doing so should not.be underestimated, it seems preferable
to dismantle the regulatory barriers to efficient pricing relatively
quickly and to take separate action to provide compensation for capital losses or to prevent windfall gains, if necessary.
EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS OF SOCIAL REGULATION

While much of the economic regulation placed on the statute
books over the years has been eliminated or substantially reduced,




102

Federal regulations designed to protect the natural environment and
the health and safety of both workers and consumers are necessary,
and will remain so. The unaided market has not produced socially acceptable levels of pollution or worker exposure to hazardous conditions, and there is little evidence that it will.
But Federal regulation designed to protect the environment and
the health and safety of both workers and consumers has not always
produced the hoped-for results. The challenge to those who would
reform these regulations is to design regulatory systems which intrude only to the extent required to achieve their goals and which
use enforcement techniques that are appropriate, flexible, and efficient. Means must also be found to assure that the regulatory goals
themselves reflect a proper balancing of national priorities. This may
require new oversight methods or new regulatory tools.
Oversight Activities and Institutions

This Administration has utilized a number of methods to supervise
the regulatory process. By Executive order, any executive agency proposing a major new regulation must develop an analysis of the expected economic consequences of its preferred alternative and of
other possible approaches. Although this requirement only applies to
a relatively small number of the regulations issued by the Federal
Government each year, it has helped to upgrade the entire structure
of regulatory decisionmaking. Many agencies now estimate the costs
and benefits of all proposed regulations, even though these estimates
are not always made public.
The regulatory analyses prepared by the agencies are subjected to
independent review and comment by two institutions: the Regulatory
Analysis Review Group (RARG) and the Council on Wage and Price
Stability (CWPS). The RARG, an interagency body chaired by the
Council of Economic Advisers, is composed principally of representatives from the executive branch agencies with regulatory responsibilities. It reviews approximately 10 regulations per year, concentrating
on those that may impose especially large costs or that promise to be
precedent setting. CWPS reviews approximately 50 regulations per
year and is the only Executive Office unit having explicit statutory
authority to review and comment on the proposed regulations of the
independent regulatory agencies. This ability to provide credible estimates of the costs and benefits of proposed regulations, to suggest
alternatives that might not ordinarily be suggested during the course
of a rulemaking, and to serve as a source of quality control over
agency analytical activities has proved crucial to effective regulatory
oversight.
Whenever a RARG report has been filed, and in a small number of
additional executive branch rulemakings, the Council of Economic




103

Advisers and other Presidential advisers have discussed the regulation with the agency prior to its issuance but after the period for
public comment has ended. The purpose has been to assure the
President that the agency head, in making the final decision, has considered the full range of alternatives allowed by statute and has taken
cost-effectiveness criteria into account.
The task of following the development of important regulations
has been made far easier by another innovation, the Regulatory Calendar. This list of important forthcoming regulations has become indispensable to understanding the cumulative impact of regulation on
the economy. The Regulatory Council, which publishes the Calendar,
has increased the amount of crosscutting analysis in it and is also developing industry-specific calendars. The first of these will catalog all
Federal activities intended to affect the manufacture, sale, or use of
automobiles. Through the use of the Calendar, the Council also seeks
to identify overlapping regulations and tries to improve coordination
between agencies where overlap is inevitable.
In addition to these regulatory oversight activities, there have been
special reviews of all of the significant regulations affecting a few
major industries. The most widely publicized of these were studies of
the steel and auto industries conducted, respectively, by the Environmental Subcommittee of the Steel Tripartite Committee and by an
interagency committee under the leadership of the Secretary of
Transportation. Another is the review of important regulations affecting the nonferrous metals industry, announced by the Regulatory
Council in October. Special reviews of this kind are likely to become
more common in the years ahead.
Further Improvements in Regulatory Oversight Activities

The oversight practices described above have been central to this
Administration's effort to develop new techniques in an area where
the proper relationship between centralized oversight and agency
decisionmaking is unclear and where analytical techniques require
further improvement. Both the relationship and the analytical tools
will be refined in the future.
Formal consideration of the anticipated costs of any regulation is
an obvious necessity. Our national resources are not infinite. There
must be some determination of whether the anticipated costs are
within our means and our willingness to pay. Moreover, it is clearly
desirable to maximize the benefits of any given level of regulation.
Although the preceding statements may seem elementary, consideration of the anticipated costs of a regulation is sometimes prohibited by statute. The Clean Air Act, for example, has recently been interpreted in court as prohibiting the Environmental Protection




104

Agency (EPA) from considering prospective costs in setting ambient
air quality standards.
Even when consideration of costs is permitted or required by statute, agencies and courts must still decide whether this has been done
in an appropriate manner. Agency procedures and court opinions on
this subject vary. There is no universal test of economic feasibility
and no agreed-upon "best" relationship between the economic costs
of a proposed regulation and its expected benefits.
For these reasons, any sustained effort to ensure formal consideration of costs in regulatory decisions must involve the Congress, the
courts, the White House, and the agencies charged with implementing regulatory statutes. Without such broad involvement, the matter
will only be resolved on a case-by-case basis over many years. That
slow process would provide no guarantee of uniformity, but it might
well produce a regulatory paralysis arising from delay and uncertainty.
One suggested device for reconciling regulatory priorities within
and between programs is the "regulatory budget." Most of its proponents envision this device as analogous to the Federal fiscal budget,
with specific amounts of "permissible regulatory expenditures" assigned to each program and each agency. Some even envision a process of formal congressional authorization.
Although economists have made considerable progress in estimating the direct costs of complying with regulation, it is not likely that
the techniques for a full-scale regulatory budget will exist soon. But
it is feasibleâ€”and necessaryâ€”to incorporate budgetary principles, especially the establishment of priorities, into regulatory programs.
This has been the aim of the Administration's regulatory oversight
activities.
EFFORTS AT "SMARTER" REGULATION

With the direct encouragement of the President and the Regulatory Council, regulatory agencies have been experimenting with different ways to reduce the cost burden of regulation.
A good example is EPA's "bubble concept." This concept is based
on the fact that it is often possible to reduce emissions of a given
pollutant from one source far less expensively than from another
source. Thus, instead of compelling each source to meet a standard,
EPA figuratively places a "bubble" over an area (a large industrial
plant, or, in some cases, an even larger geographic area) and lets private decisionmakers decide how to meet the standard for the area at
the lowest cost. EPA initially intended to apply the concept quite narrowly, but during 1980 it gradually found ways to broaden its application. Means were found to eliminate many time-consuming procedures. The ability to develop acceptable "bubbles" for sulfur oxides




105

and particulates was demonstrated. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, a solution to a problem once thought to be insurmountableâ€”
namely, how to permit the concept to be applied in areas of the
country not already meeting ambient air quality standardsâ€”appeared
to be in sight. As the year came to an end, numerous "bubbles" were
in the final stages of design and approval.
In some situations where the bubble concept is applied the cost
savings will approach 60 percent. Furthermore, the concept so increases engineering flexibility that it offers the prospect of sharply
reduced emissions in some cases.
Experimentation with a second regulatory innovationâ€”the use of
marketable permitsâ€”is just beginning. EPA recently suggested an
overall limit on fluorocarbon production (and, hence, fluorocarbon
emissions), combined with the creation of a market for buying and
selling emission rights. While this approach promises substantial savings in the cost of reducing emissions, it transfers income from fluorocarbon users and producers to the government. If ways can be
found to deal with the income transfer issues, and certain other technical difficulties overcome, the use of such a strategy would permit
the continued use of fluorocarbons in those products that consumers
value most while eliminating the need for administrative agency determinations of "essential" and "nonessential" uses. It will also stimulate the development of products that make more efficient use of these
chemicals.
A third kind of effort at "smarter" regulation is the attempt to
tailor regulations to the organization being regulated. The burden of
compliance (especially the paperwork burden) often falls disproportionately on small businesses, some local governments, and certain
nonprofit organizations. While a blanket exemption of small entities
from regulation would not be feasible, it is often possible to reduce
their regulatory burden. This approach was incorporated into statute
by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, which requires the Federal
Government to estimate the costs of new regulations for small organizations and to review its existing regulations to see whether the
burden could be reduced.
Another way of improving the regulatory process is to examine existing regulations in a systematic way and eliminate those that are
outmoded or unnecessary. On the basis of such a review, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has eliminated
nearly one thousand regulations during the past 4 years. And in September the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
proposed to eliminate significant portions of its Minimum Property
Standards, a large body of regulations going back almost 40 years.
These regulations had been originally designed to ensure, among




106

other things, that federally assisted housing is safe and sanitary, and
that federally guaranteed mortgages are marketable. HUD's review of
the entire set of regulations was prompted by its belief that the private market now adequately performs some of these functions.
Still other alternatives to "command-and-control" regulation are
possible. In choosing among alternatives, policymakers should seek
the least intrusive ways of achieving regulatory goals. As a matter of
course, regulators should look for techniques closely matched to the
marketplace failure which was the original justification for regulatory
intervention. Resort to a command-and-control solution should be
the last step considered, not the first or second.
FINANCIAL MARKETS ADAPTING TO CHANGE
The financial markets have proved remarkably adaptable to changing economic conditions over the past two decades. In general, the
markets' adaptations have occurred despite a slow response on the
part of legislators and regulatory agencies.
In the mid-1960s there were many restrictions on depository institutions, including the following:
â€¢ limitation of the right to offer checking accounts to commercial
banks;
â€¢ prohibition of interest payments on checking account balances;
â€¢ interest rate ceilings on savings accounts and other deposits in
commercial banks and thrift institutions, with thrifts permitted to
pay a differential of as much as three-fourths of 1 percent more
on accounts of similar maturity;
â€¢ ceilings on the maximum interest rate that could be charged for
loans;
â€¢ limitations on the types of assets that could be held; and
â€¢ geographic limitations on the establishment of branch offices
and on the acquisition of other institutions.
These restrictionsâ€”motivated by such concerns as maintaining a
sound financial system and a sufficient flow of funds for home mortgagesâ€”helped sustain the compartmentalization of depository institutions, both by function and by geographic area. Commercial banks
provided "full service" banking to households and businesses, while
thrift institutions were the principal repository for household savings
and the dominant source of funds for residential mortgages.
This rigidly segmented system worked tolerably well from the
1940s through the mid-1960s. Market interest rates generally did not
rise much above the regulatory ceilings on interest rates on deposits,




107

and most depository institutions were able to maintain a general
degree of customer loyalty while still competing for deposit and loan
business.
ADAPTING TO RISING INTEREST RATES

Since the mid-1960s, however, sharp swings in market interest
rates and a general upward ratcheting of the interest rate cycle due
to inflation have induced sweeping changes in the financial markets.
Ceilings on deposit interest rates lagged behind rising market interest rates, creating gaps between the yields from deposits with regulated interest rates and the yields available on instruments with unregulated interest rates. Depository institutions then found it difficult
to attract enough funds in regulated deposit markets to sustain their
dominance in the lending markets. Moreover, member banks of the
Federal Reserve System were further disadvantaged because they had
to maintain a portion of their deposits as reserves in noninterest
bearing balances, and the burden of these reserve requirements grew
as interest rates rose.
Throughout the late 1960s and the 1970s, banks and thrifts sought
to hold their competitive position by finding ways to attract funds
less restricted by government regulations. For example, they developed a mechanism to sell U.S. Government securities to large corporate customers, agreeing to repurchase them later. Because this instrument (called a "repurchase agreement") was not subject to interest rate ceilingsâ€”and, for member banks, bore no reserve requirementâ€”an institution could offer its corporate customers a competitive rate on short-term balances. By 1980, repurchase agreements
outstanding at commercial banks had grown in value to roughly $30
billion. In the early 1970s some State-chartered thrift institutions in
Massachusetts and New Hampshire found that they could legally
offer Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) accounts, which are
similar to demand deposit (checking) accounts. With NOWs, which
also can earn interest, the thrifts began to compete with commercial
banks for transactions balances. Meanwhile, many commercial banks
gave up their membership in the Federal Reserve in order to avoid
the burden of its reserve requirements.
Despite these actions, banks and thrifts still were unable to provide
a fully competitive range of financial services. Nondepository institutions, less burdened by regulation, found the banking market profitable as they began issuing deposit-like instruments and offering
bank-like services. Money-market mutual funds, for example, were
able to offer small savers substantial liquidity while offering a yield
competitive with market interest rates. Many of these funds allow
"deposits" (uninsured equity interests, called shares) to be maintained in almost any amount, and most of them offer limited check-




108

ing services. Money-market mutual funds did not exist until 1971,
but by August 1980 they had grown in value to over $80 billion.
Corporate borrowers found it cheaper to bypass their traditional
lending relationships with commercial banks and increased their reliance on nonbank sources of funds like the commercial paper market,
where corporations sell direct short-term liabilities. The issuance of
commercial paper by nonfinancial firms grew from 4 percent of the
total short-term debt of business firms in 1972 to 7 percent in 1979.
Meanwhile, foreign banks, which were not burdened by Federal Reserve requirements and which had well-developed foreign sources of
funds, also began moving into U.S. markets, especially business lending. By capitalizing on the expansion of international trade and by
pricing their loans aggressively, they increased their share of U.S.
business loans from 4 percent in 1972 to 9 percent in 1979.
U.S. banks have tried to keep their share of business loans by reducing
their interest rates on loans to corporations with access to such alternative sources of funds. While the so-called prime rate is still the
lowest rate offered to good customers lacking these alternatives,
loans made at rates less than the prime rate are now commonplace.
Nevertheless, the share of total short-term business debt held by domestic commercial banks shrank from 86 percent in 1972 to 60 percent in 1979.
Even as they sought innovative ways to bypass the regulatory structure and to maintain their markets, some depository institutions
urged regulatory agencies to loosen their restrictions. The call for
deregulation was less than unanimous, however, since many institutions believed that the regulatory structure still protected their profitable markets from encroachment by competitors. Nevertheless, experiments in deregulation were conducted by both Federal and State
financial regulators in the 1970s (Table 11). In the early 1970s, for
example, interest rate ceilings on large time deposits ($100,000 or
more) were removed, in part to permit banks to meet the strong
demand for bank credit that developed when the failure of the Penn
Central temporarily destabilized the commercial paper market. This
action provided banks and thrift institutions with new access to the
open market, and by the end of 1980 they held more than $250 billion in such deposits. More recent regulatory changes have allowed
banks and thrifts to compete for the funds of smaller savers by issuing 6-month money-market certificates (MMCs) and 2V2-year small
saver certificates (SSCs). These instruments, whose interest rate ceilings are adjusted frequently to keep pace with market interest rates,
had attracted roughly $475 billion to banks and thrift institutions by
the end of 1980.

ADAPTING TO GREATER RATE VARIABILITY

While the depository institutions were adapting to greater competition and the high interest rate environment, they also faced the problem of growing interest rate risk. Increased rate variability and the
upward ratcheting of interest rates have been especially troublesome
to these institutions because their liabilities have traditionally matured more quickly than their assets. Moreover, while the new types
of variable-rate instruments have allowed them to keep many of their
depositors, these instruments have facilitated a shift of funds from
stable, low-interest savings accounts to more variable and higher interest liabilities. Consequently, as market interest rates rise, so do the
rates they must pay on their liabilities. When this happens, banks and
thrifts lose income because the yield on their longer-term assets does
not rise commensurately.
Depository institutions have responded to this problem by shortening the maturities of their loans and by offering loans whose interest
rates are frequently adjusted over the course of the loan to prevailing
market rates. In 1980, for example, almost 70 percent of term business loans extended by commercial banks had floating interest rates.
Similarly, banks and thrift institutions have introduced new mortgage
instrumentsâ€”including the variable-rate mortgage and the rolloverrate mortgageâ€”whose rates are adjusted every year or soâ€”in stark
contrast to the traditional 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage. The thrift institutions also sought to remove the legislative restrictions on their




110

holdings of consumer and business loans, which have shorter maturities than mortgages.
PRESSURES FOR COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATION

In the late 1970s there was a growing realization throughout the
financial community that despite piecemeal modernization, regulations affecting depository institutions needed more sweeping reform.
The regulatory structure no longer was satisfying its original objectives. Instead, it was creating inefficiencies and inequities. It even diminished the effectiveness of monetary policy as banks left the Federal Reserve System. Pressures from various sources finally resulted in
a compromise bank reform bill, the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980.
Under this law, interest rate ceilings on time savings deposits will
be phased out over 6 years. Moreover, beginning December 31,
1980, all depository institutions were allowed to issue NOW accounts
to individuals and nonprofit organizations. In addition, uniform
reserve requirements will apply to all depository institutions
by the end of an 8-year transition period. As a result, the burden of
reserve requirements will be spread more equitably among all institutions, and the Federal Reserve's control over the deposit base will be
improved. The law also expands the asset flexibility of savings and
loan associations, which will now be allowed to place up to 20 percent of their assets in consumer loans, while mutual savings banks
will be allowed to invest up to 5 percent of their assets in business
loans. Finally, the act repealed State usury ceilings on mortgage interest rates and relaxed State usury ceilings on consumer and business loan interest rates. These ceilings had seriously depressed such
lending in certain States at various times during the past decade.
THE FINANCIAL STRUCTURE OF THE 1980s: BENEFITS, RISKS, AND PUBLIC
POLICY

Today's financial environment is very different from the placid
conditions of two decades ago, and it is likely never to revert
to that earlier state. Changes in the financial markets have had significant impacts on the behavior of depositors, borrowers, and depository institutions whoâ€”along with the financial regulatory agenciesâ€”will face further challenges in coming years.
Depositors

Higher and more volatile interest rates have increased depositor
awareness of the importance of actively managing their financial
assets. Moreover, the proliferation of savings alternatives has provided depositors with access to new markets where they can receive a
higher average return on their savings than previously. Even if inter-




111

est rates return to lower levels, it is likely that the market for deposits
will remain more competitive and that savers will continue to be
more interest-sensitive. This should work to encourage greater saving at a time when an increase in the Nation's rate of saving and
investment would be welcome.
While savers as a whole benefit from these reforms, however, not
all individual savers will achieve a higher overall rate of return. In
many cases the depository institutions have offset part of the increase
in interest which they must pay for deposit funds by raising the
prices of their checking and other financial services. Depositors who
maintain high balances but use relatively few services will benefit
considerably, while depositors who maintain relatively low balances
and who benefited in earlier years from free or low-cost services may
find these new practices to their disadvantage.
Borrowers

Many of the innovations adopted by depository institutions to
make loan rates vary in accordance with changes in market rates have
shifted the risk of interest rate variation to borrowers. As finance
costs have risen and become more variable, financial management
has assumed more prominence as a corporate management function.
In the past decade, corporations have significantly improved their
cash management and have increased their use of alternative sources
of funding, such as commercial paper. Meanwhile, corporations have
relied much more heavily on short-term debt to finance their activities and have shortened the maturities of their bond issues. Some observers have expressed concern that this tendency toward shorter maturities of liabilities could lead corporations to reduce their commitments to long-lived capital investments in plant and equipment,
which would limit the Nation's ability to improve productivity. It
should be recognized, however, that corporations are at least partially protected against inflation-induced changes in interest costs if borrowed funds are invested in real capital. That is, if changes in the
expected rate of inflation account for fluctuations in interest rates,
the expected nominal revenue from capital investment is likely to
shift in the same direction as nominal borrowing costs.
If corporations want further protection from changes in interest
rates, they can pay to get it. They might, for example, make use of
the financial futures markets which have developed quite rapidly in
recent years. The total volume of 3-month Treasury bill contracts on
the financial futures markets rose from $100 billion in 1976 to over
$2.7 trillion in the first 10 months of 1980.
One specific borrowing sector that has lost much of its protected
status as a result of the new competitive environment is housing. The
thrift institutions no longer enjoy many of the special advantages




112

they once had and thus cannot continue to channel funds to housing
at artificially low interest rates. Although changing competitive conditions may mean a somewhat higher and more variable cost of funds
for thrifts, the new regulatory environment should help to stabilize
their deposit flows and hence the supply of mortgage funds. Furthermore, the Federal Government has supported the expansion of secondary mortgage markets to attract additional capital into housing.
The secondary market institutionsâ€”the Federal National Mortgage
Association (FNMA), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
(FHLMC), and the Government National Mortgage Association
(GNMA)â€”have expanded the scope and volume of their activities.
Market acceptance of new financial instruments like the mortgagebacked securities issued by these institutions has grown, thus cementing more firmly the link between capital markets and mortgage
credit. GNMA securities alone have increased to more than $90 billion in the past 3 years. While these developments in financial markets should tend to increase the variability of mortgage interest rates,
they should also tend to reduce the cyclical swings in mortgage
money availability. It is too early to tell whether these changes will
mean more or less cyclical variation in home sales and residential
construction.
Depository Institutions

Banks and thrift institutions now operate in a much more competitive environment, and the risks associated with interest rate swings
are much greater. Partially offsetting these developments are the
broader range of financial instruments they can offer and their expanded lending powers.
But legal and regulatory limitations still exist that, if liberalized,
would allow further adjustment to new financial conditions. Current
law, for example, restricts banks and thrifts from expanding into natural market areas. A recent Administration study concluded that a
liberalization of Federal restrictions on geographic expansion by
commercial banks would increase banking competition in local markets and result in more and lower priced services. Some tentative
steps toward the removal of the barriers to geographic expansion
likely will occur in coming years. There may also be a further loosening of the asset restrictions on thrifts and commercial banksâ€”for instance, allowing thrift institutions more leeway to make business
loans or allowing both types of depository institutions broader
powers to hold financial futures contracts and stocks, and to underwrite bond issues and insurance.
Even with changes like these, however, some institutions will find it
difficult to adjust. Since the government shaped the financial world
that existed when these institutions were founded, it now faces the




113

task of helping them evolve in an orderly manner. Success will
depend in part on general economic conditions, and as these conditions change, the regulators must be prepared to react.
A case in point is the gradual removal in the last few years of ceilings on deposit interest rates. It was initially anticipated that relaxation of the ceilings, combined with an eventual liberalization of the
types of assets that could be held, would allow thrift institutions to
gradually correct imbalances in their portfolio maturities and thus
limit their exposure to rising interest rates. But quick acceptance of
floating-rate certificates by small savers at a time of rapidly rising interest rates has raised the interest expense of these institutions much
faster than they have been able to increase the revenues on their
loans. While most of the thrifts will achieve a better asset/liability
balance in the long run, the current squeeze on profits resulting from
rapidly rising market interest rates threatens some of them with serious financial difficulties.
One way to deal with this problem would be to subsidize endangered institutions, perhaps by buying their low-yield, long-maturity
assets (mortgages) at above-market prices. This would involve a substantial budgetary outlay, however. Another option would be to
permit the troubled institutions to fail outright, but this approach
would risk destabilizing the financial markets arid could result in significant losses to uninsured depositors and the Federal insurance organizations.
Neither of these approaches responds directly to the inefficiencies
created by remaining regulatory practices which continue to compartmentalize depository institutions. Thus, a third and preferred alternative would be to remove restrictions that now prevent efficient consolidation among financial firms. This would require further deregulation to allow mergers across State lines and between different types
of institutions, since these restrictions remain a major obstacle to the
efficient reorganization of financial institutions. As a result of these
changes, the weakest institutions would find more opportunities for
mergers. While this would not solve the problems of all endangered
institutions, it would allow a more stable reordering of the financial
sector where appropriate while minimizing the budgetary cost and
sharply reducing the risk to financial markets of policies aimed at the
remaining problem.
Conclusions

During the last two decades the pace of innovation in the financial
markets has been quite rapid as depositors, borrowers, and financial
institutions have sought new ways to adapt to high and variable interest rates. Unfortunately, a lag in both legislation and financial regulation meant that a considerable amount of innovation was applied to




114

finding ways around outdated regulatory barriers. But changes in the
regulatory structure in the seventies, culminating with the Depository
Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, have
aided greatly in making regulation compatible with the new financial
environment. The challenge for financial regulatory policy during the
1980s will be to rationalize regulation even further to achieve the appropriate balance between unnecessary restraints on the market and
the regulatory goals of preserving the safety and soundness of the financial system and providing the tools for an effective monetary
policy.

THE ALTERED ROLE OF AGRICULTURE
For decades, U.S. agriculture was a sector with chronic excess capacity and low returns. Productivity increases that exceeded growth
in demand resulted in declining real food prices for more than a
quarter of a century.
The decade of the seventies saw virtually all of these circumstances
change. Farm and food prices increased and became more volatile
(Charts 5 and 6). A modest shortfall in the world crop and major
trade policy changes in the United States and the Soviet Union contributed to the initial price shock in 1972, and the growing worldwide
demand for food helped sustain demand pressures from 1973 on.
The large surpluses of grain purchased by the Federal Government
in earlier years to increase farm income had been sold by 1973 and,
by 1974, for the first time in more than two decades, the cropland
base was nearly fully employed. It has remained that way since then.
To produce more from the available land, the use of industrial inputs
increased. Chemical use, for example, increased nearly 37 percent
from 1970 to 1980.
The cash receipts of farmers increased dramatically after 1972, but
production cost increases eroded much of the apparent gain in
purchasing power. Prices paid for production inputs in 1980 were
more than 2V2 times their 1970 levels. The price of agricultural real estate increased an average of 13 percent per year,
nearly twice the average annual inflation rate for the decade. Still,
the average per capita disposable income of all farmers during the
1970s from both farm and nonfarm sources was nearly 90 percent of
that earned by the nonfarm population, up sharply from the 65 percent average figure of the 1960s.
Meanwhile, the rapid exodus of labor from agriculture virtually
stopped as the farm labor force stabilized at about four million persons. Not only was there a substantially smaller and more stable farm
population, but there were substantially fewer farms, and a smaller

EXPANDING AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS

Perhaps the most significant change in American agriculture during
the seventies, however, was the huge expansion in exports. Grain exports tripled in volume, while the dollar value of all agricultural exports increased nearly sixfold. But this growth in value and volume
came with increased volatility in prices and production.
The present competitive advantage of U.S. agriculture is impressive. In the 1960s, exports represented 14 percent of total farm cash
receipts; in 1980, cash receipts from exports represented nearly 30
percent of the total (Table 12). To accommodate the increase in
export volume, the amount of land devoted to the production of
crops for export nearly doubled. Transport systems and storage facilities have been pushed to their limits at times. Nonetheless, agricultural exports have not increased their share of total U.S. exports.
Since the end of World War II, agriculture's share of total exports
has remained at approximately 20 percent.

The increased importance of exports, coupled with the disappearance of surplus grain stocks and nearly full use of the cropland base,
has exposed U.S. farmers and consumers to an unaccustomed degree
of instability in commodity prices. Part of this instability comes about
because of unpredictable world weather, but much of it has been the
result of our own policies and those of our trading partners.




117

Many nations have policies to shelter their economies from extreme fluctuations in commodity prices. The European Community,
for example, maintains higher farm prices in member countries by
varying duties on farm commodity imports and the subsidies on exports. These practices tend to make world commodity prices more
variable by increasing the variability of European Community export
and import levels. European food prices are therefore more stable
than ours but are generally higher, with a resulting reduction in the
European standard of living.
Centralized trading decisions by other grain exporters and by most
of the grain-importing countries have also tended to increase the
volatility of world grain prices. Canada and Australia, for example,
routinely impose quantitative restrictions on grain exports when domestic price stability is threatened. Furthermore, an increasing proportion of exported grain is going to countries that do not allow the
free movement of prices to allocate resources internally. The centrally planned and certain developing countries, for example, rely on the
United States and other major exporters for marginal supplies,
making "needed" purchases without much apparent regard for price.
Taken together, the efforts by other countries to stabilize their domestic food prices and supplies have shifted the costs of increased
price variability onto farmers and consumers in the United States.
Prices and income may vary at times as a result of international political considerations. The January 1980 ban on the sale of certain agricultural products to the Soviet Union originated from considerations other than the typical tug-of-war between consumer prices and
farm income, namely, foreign policy considerations following the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The Administration was obviously
aware of the potentially adverse economic effects of that sales suspension and took significant steps to minimize them.
Unpredictable actions of other countries can also impose price
shocks on the United States. A unilateral reversal in agricultural
policy by the Soviet Union or China or a deterioration in East/West
relations would have major implications for the U.S. farm sector.
Thus, the fact that our growing food trade is now affected by international political affairs is a source of added risk to private investors in
the agricultural sector.
The need for stabilization mechanisms in this environment should
be evident. Agricultural demand and supply are both quite inelastic
in the short run. Small changes in either can lead to large changes in
price. While such price movements serve the important economic
purpose of allocating available supplies, they can also have disruptive
consequences. Rising corn prices, for example, set in motion adjustments in the livestock sector that have implications for domestic meat




118

prices for years in the future, regardless of the size of succeeding
corn harvests. The domestic livestock sector, in fact, is still making
adjustments stemming from the very high grain prices of 1972-74.
Grain Reserves

Reserve stocks stand as the only real source of protection against
inflationary rises in the price of food in market economies during periods of short supply. They also cushion farmers against declines in
the prices of agricultural commodities during temporary periods of
overproduction. If the flow of information and the credit markets
were perfect, private agricultural stocks might be expected to provide
the needed price stabilization. But the flow of information and the
credit markets are not perfect. Moreover, private holders of agricultural commodities are unlikely or unable to take account of macroeconomic effects when they make decisions on whether or not to
store commodities.
The program of farmer-owned grain reserves implemented by the
Administration in 1977 (discussed in the 1980 Report) has proved to
be a popular, flexible, and efficient mechanism to cushion price
shocks. The Administration's initial stock objective was achieved by
early 1979, when more than 11 million tons of wheat and 20 million
tons of feed grains had been placed in reserve. When prices then increased because of reports of a smaller-than-expected Soviet harvest,
the stocks were released. By mid-October 1979 farmers had withdrawn over 40 percent of the wheat and sorghum and more than 25
percent of the corn in the reserve. When sales to the Soviet Union
were halted in early 1980, stocks flowed back into the reserve and
helped keep farm prices from falling as much as they would have
without it. Those stocks are now available to help offset the adverse
effects of the 1980 summer drought.
Clearly, grain prices and farm income over the past 4 years would
have been more volatile without such a compensating mechanism. It
is also probable that export earnings were increased because more
grain was available for export during periods of high prices. In any
case, the availability of large reserves allowed us to retain our export
markets and enhance our reputation as a reliable supplier even in periods of short world supply and high prices. Moreover, the only nonrecoverable taxpayer costs of this program have been payments for
storage and interest costs on the Commodity Credit Corporation
(CCC) loans extended to farmers when grain was placed in the reserve.
The Reduced Need for Subsidies

The improving economic health of the Nation's farmers suggests
that subsidizing farm income is less essential today than it was in the




119

past. The growing importance of exports makes it more likely that
the benefits of U.S. grain reserves will accrue disproportionately to
foreign customers. Together, these observations suggest two things:
first, that grain sold from the reserve should be priced high enough
to cover not only the cost of grain production but, if possible, program costs as well; and second, that the incentives to place grain in
reserve should be no greater than necessary to meet our objective of
price stabilization. Present policy, including administrative procedures and legal authority, does not serve either of these objectives as
well as it might.
Current law, for example, requires waiver of the interest that
would normally be paid by farmers on CCC loans and taxpayer payment of the storage costs. Thus, if the grain is sold at a lower price
than would be required to cover these carrying costs, export customers benefit because American taxpayers subsidize the storage of
grain. But if grain from the reserve is sold at prices high enough to
cover these costs, farmers receive a windfall profit that may be unnecessary to assure the accumulation of reserves that will accomplish
the price stabilization objective.
By requiring farmers to pay the storage costs and the interest on
the loans, the beneficiaries of the reserve (both U.S. and foreign customers) would be paying for the system's operation. Requiring farmers to pay such costs would, however, probably result in reserves too
small to accomplish the price stabilization objective. To attract the
desired stocks, farmers might be offered higher loans for grain entering the reserve. The most efficient way to acquire a reserve of a
given size would be to require farmers to bid for the right to place
grain into the reserve. Under such a plan, farmers offering to place
grain in reserve at the lowest loan rates would be authorized entry.
The flexibility granted by the Agricultural Act of 1980, which authorizes higher-than-normal loan rates for grain entering the reserve,
might be used to implement such a plan. Legislative changes would,
however, be required to allow the farmer to pay storage and interest
costs.
In addition to subsidizing the grain reserve, the Federal Government has subsidized the use of key agricultural inputs. Programs
under which the Federal Government has shared with farmers the
costs of soil conservation, land development, pest control, and the
like, have been commonplace. As farm exports grow, so will the
extent to which such subsidies transfer national wealth to export customers. To avoid unintended transfers, the resources committed to
agriculture must be properly priced. This means, for example, that
the price of exported grain should reflect the full costs of transporting it. Similarly, the Nation's limited natural resources, such as un-




120

derground water resources once thought virtually unlimited, should
now be priced to more appropriately reflect their limited availability.
FUTURE CAUSES OF RISING FOOD PRICES

When food prices soared upward in 1973, many economists saw it
as a temporary deviation from the longer-term trend, and the apparent return of surplus production in 1976-77 helped support this
notion. But food prices did not fall to their earlier trend line (Chart
6). While exhibiting the same increase in variability as commodity
prices, food prices remained high relative to other prices throughout
the 1970s, and additional price increases are likely for at least the
first half of the 1980s.
The Rising Demand for Output

Projected increases in exports and in the use of grain domestically
for animal feed indicate sustained upward pressure on commodity
prices for the next several years. Other economic forces will place
still more pressure on agricultural resources, particularly cropland.
Rising energy prices, for example, are increasing the demand for natural fibers, primarily cotton. High sugar prices and the expanding
use of sugarcane for ethanol production in Latin America are expected to double the demand in the United States for corn as a sweetener by 1985.
But perhaps most important is current energy policy which encourages the production of alcohol fuels from corn. This policy implies the need for an additional 370 million bushels of corn and a 5
percent increase in corn cropland by the end of 1982. The ethanol
produced from the corn would replace about 60,000 barrels of oil
per dayâ€”about 1 percent of U.S. oil imports. Other things being
equal, such an increase in demand would increase the season average
price of corn about 10 percent. The high cost of producing ethanol
and the higher corn price, even when offset by the value of the ethanol by-products and an increase in export earnings, would mean
that the Nation was paying nearly twice the present world price for
each barrel of foreign oil displaced. The benefits of the gasohol program may be substantial and difficult to quantify, but its costs are
large and its pressures on cropland significant. Furthermore, given
the incentives already authorized, the amount of corn required for
gasohol could more than double by 1985.
Pressures on Farm Input Use

By itself, a growing demand for agricultural products would not
necessarily mean rising real prices. Advances in crop yield and other
productivity gains throughout much of the postwar period made it
possible to increase production in line with steadily growing demand
without bringing high-cost, marginal resources into use. But this is




121

unlikely to happen in the future in part because of energy. In 1975,
when data first became available, energy-intensive inputs (excluding
fertilizer) accounted for 23 percent of the variable cost of producing
an acre of corn. Those same inputs accounted for 31 percent of the
variable cost in 1980. Higher real prices for these inputs will be a
disincentive to their use and intensify the pressure to use additional
land and water resources. These resources are also more limited. In
1972, for example, more than 16 percent of the cropland base was
being withheld from production by government policies. None is
being withheld today. To raise production further, land will have to
be diverted from other uses and developed for crop production. The
cost of doing so will be reflected in higher agricultural prices.
Changes in policy, however, could help to ameliorate future increases in food prices. Certain land-use patterns remain fixed by
acreage allotments. Fruit and vegetable growers sometimes restrict
output or otherwise control marketing to enhance prices and then
seek restrictive trade policies to protect those higher prices. Certain
regulatory procedures now impose economic penalties on the use of
technologies that would raise productivity in the food system. Such
policies deny both producers and consumers the benefits of technological change. Finally, certain price support decisions continue to be
statutorily dependent on movements in an outdated parity index that
has little relation to product-specific costs of production. The dairy
price support program is perhaps the best known example here. Such
policies enhance the economic position of some farmers, while they
perpetuate existingâ€”but not necessarily efficientâ€”patterns of resource use. Such inefficiency is particularly costly in a period of relative resource scarcity and limits agriculture's potential contribution to
economic growth.
POLICY DIRECTIONS FOR THE 1980s

Significant progress has been made over the past 30 years in adjusting U.S. agricultural policies to a changing world. More importance has been placed on the allocative function that can be performed by prices, and there is significantly less direct government interference with producer decisionmaking.
This Administration's farm policies have contributed to the evolutionary process. The implementation of a farmer-owned grain reserve
program stands out because of its flexibility and its success in moderating price fluctuations stemming from changes in production and
consumption levels. Additionally, the recent formation of a government-owned food reserve increases the likelihood that food will be
available to foreign nations during emergency situations, even when
world prices are high and commercial supplies are limited. The 1980
passage of a statute permitting the creation of a partially subsidized,




122

comprehensive, actuarial crop insurance program means that there
will be a more equitable sharing of natural disaster risk between
farmers and taxpayers. Eventually this new programâ€”which expands
the private sector's role in insuring farmers against such risksâ€”will
replace the more limited free insurance that is now provided for certain farmers through the fully subsidized disaster payments program.
Future changes in agricultural policy must build on this foundation. In particular, attention must be given to the use of natural resources. Past agricultural policies have treated land and water as gifts
of nature. The need for pricing them in ways that more appropriately
reflect their true social value will intensify. Specific programs must be
developed for this purpose; conservation of soil and pricing of other
natural resources can no longer simply be by-products of programs
to enhance farm income.
Taken together, these policy issues point to a broader reliance on
market forces, but the critical importance of food to national security
will dictate a continued role for government in determining agricultural policy. Finding new and more flexible ways to use resources
more efficiently while guarding against price volatility will be the
principal farm policy challenge of the 1980s.
TRENDS IN INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR MARKETS
The preceding sections described developments in energy, regulation, the financial markets, and agriculture that have put severe pressure on the economy's adaptive capabilities. Each case illustrated the
need for policies that facilitate adaptation to future as well as current
developments. These four areas are not unique, however. Throughout the economy, deep-seated trends are increasing the need for
greater adaptability.
INDUSTRIAL CHANGE

One such trend is the elimination of previous competitive advantages in some sectors and the creation of new ones in others. In the
case of automobiles, for example, competition on the basis of technological advances and fuel economy is replacing competition based on
style and performance. Vehicles manufactured in large volume according to stringent quality standards and utilizing the latest technology are replacing vehicles whose style changed annually but whose
technology evolved more slowly. The emergence of the so-called
"world car," with its international sources of key components, is evidence that this remarkable change has not been limited to the United
States.
Nor are these kinds of competitive pressures new. Similar pressures over the years have occurred in textiles, apparel, and footwear.




123

In each of these industries today, the profitable U.S. producers compete in ways very different from their predecessors, whether by manufacturing specialty fabrics, blue jeans, or canvas shoes.
What is new, however, are the widespread pressures for substantial
adaptation due to recent changes in energy and capital markets.
These pressures are also occurring at a time when the economy is
growing slowly. In the past, growth has often served as a "shock absorber" to cushion change, but the slow pace of growth has made the
problems of readjustment more painful. Furthermore, some of the
industries experiencing intense change are large and highly visible
regional employers. There is simply no easy way to absorb the closing of an integrated steel facility or an automobile plant that dominates its local labor market. Lastly, these pressures for job protection
are occurring at a time when the changing composition of the labor
force may be tending to reduce mobility.
CHANGING LABOR FORCE COMPOSITION

During the past decade, the number of people with jobs grew at
record rates, and the average age and experience of workers fell.
During the coming decade, the growth of the labor force will slow
considerably, and the average worker will be older and more experienced.
Both of these changes result from two related demographic phenomena: the maturing of the baby-boom generation and the rise in
female labor force participation rates. From the end of World War II
until the beginning of the 1960s, the Nation experienced a sharp rise
in the number of births which temporarily reversed the long-term decline in birth rates. This generation began entering the labor market
in the 1960s and the influx of new workers continued during the
1970s. The percentage of the population aged 16 to 24 rose from
12.1 percent in 1960 to 15.8 percent in 1970 and 17.0 percent in
1979.
Female participation rates increased gradually during the babyboom years. An even greater increase in the number of women workers has occurred in more recent years. The rate of participation in
the labor force increased from 34 percent to 39 percent between
1950 and 1965; by 1980, more than 51 percent of the country's adult
women were in the labor market.
The maturing of the baby-boom generation and the sharp rise in
the number of working women meant that U.S. labor markets had to
absorb record numbers of new and inexperienced workers. During
the 1970s the civilian labor force increased at an average annual rate
of 2.5 percent, compared to 1.1 percent during the 1950s and 1.7
percent during the 1960s. The influx of young workers, combined
with an increase in the number of older workers retiring early, pro-




124

duced a decline in the median age of the labor force from 39 years in
1965 to 34 years in 1980.
As discussed in Chapter 1, the economy did remarkably well in
providing jobs for these new workers. In fact, the unemployment
rates for white youths and adult women have not increased relative
to those of prime-age men. Unfortunately this success was not evenly
spread across demographic groups. The high unemployment rate for
young blacks, which has deteriorated considerably and is currently
well above 30 percent, indicates serious shortcomings in labor markets or other social institutions. This unemployment problem has
persisted in spite of substantial Federal efforts to improve the quality
of primary and secondary education for minorities, to expand postsecondary training programs, and to provide on-the-job training in
public sector jobs.
During the next decade the number of people reaching adulthood
will continue to be larger than the number reaching retirement age,
but the generation entering the work force will be considerably
smaller than the cohort which began work in the 1960s and 1970s.
Even if female labor force participation rates continue their rapid
rise, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that labor force
growth will average only 1.3 percent per year during the 1980s.
The decrease in entrants into the labor force during the next
decade should have several effects. First, the increasing average age
of the labor force will tend to lower the aggregate unemployment
rate. The rate was higher during the 1970s at least in part because
the transition from school or home to a job takes time; young people
and women entering the labor market may be counted as unemployed during that search period. In addition, as they try out different career possibilities, new workers tend to change jobs more often
than experienced workers, often with spells of unemployment between jobs.
The transition to an older labor force will probably lead to some
increase in productivity as the average level of experience rises. One
estimate suggests that shifts in the age-sex composition toward
groups with below-average experience reduced productivity growth
by 0.4 percentage point per year between 1966 and 1973. Since then,
the reduction has been about 0.2 percentage point per year. During
the 1980s, changes in the age-sex ratio should raise productivity by
0.1 percentage point annually.
Demographic changes will also tend to raise productivity by
making it easier to increase the capital-labor ratio. Even if the capital
stock only grows at past rates during the 1980s, the amount of capital per worker will grow as the rate of growth in the number of workers falls. Moreover, the relative growth in the number of middle-aged




125

members of the population, who typically have higher rates of saving
than either the young or the elderly, should increase the Nation's
saving rate and facilitate growth in the capital stock.
But a third effect of the rising average age and experience of the
labor force will be a decrease in flexibility. Shifts in the demand for
labor by region, industry, and occupation are most easily met when
young workers just entering adulthood are available to move to areas
where the growing sectors of the economy are located. These younger workers are not tied to the skills gained from long experience in
one job, they generally do not own homes, and their ties to communities are weaker. Further, young workers normally have more years
over which to recoup the costs of acquiring new skills or moving to a
new community.
Older experienced workers and individuals in two-earner families
are often much less flexible in changing jobs, industries, occupations,
or communities. If there is a decline in the demand for the type of
labor they supply, they are less able and willing than younger workers to move or to abandon old skills or to learn new ones. Firms are
less interested in absorbing the costs of training older workers for
new careers. Therefore, although older workers are less likely to lose
their jobs, if their jobs do disappear they are likely to have a harder
time than young workers in finding a new job and are likely to be
unemployed for a longer time. Thus, although total unemployment
rates will tend to fall as the labor force ages, the percentage of workers unemployed for extended periods may rise.
Although U.S. labor markets may become less flexible in the
future, we currently appear to be able to find new jobs for displaced
workers more rapidly than several major European economies. The
more rapid the adjustment to employment shocks, the lower will be
the percentage of workers unemployed for extended^ periods. Table
13 presents the long-term unemployed as a percentage of the total
labor force for the United States, Germany, France, and the United
Kingdom. Although these percentages undoubtedly reflect international differences in definitions of employment and in stages of the
business cycle, they do suggest that American workers suffer less
long-term unemployment than their European counterparts.
However, the adjustment to new patterns of labor demand -in the
economy of the 1980s may be more difficult than it has been in the
past, and government assistance may be necessary to soften the
shocks of structural change while promoting flexibility. Such programs can be designed to move workers to jobs or jobs to workers.
The former include retraining programs for the unemployed as well
as relocation subsidies to encourage them to move from depressed
areas to communities with excess demand for labor. The latter in-




126

elude government investments in local infrastructure and investment
subsidies to encourage expanding firms to replace contracting ones.
Whatever combination of policies is chosen, efforts to cushion the
shocks of adjustment should not themselves discourage adaptation.

THE DILEMMA OF INDUSTRIAL POLICY
Chapter 1 of this Report and the preceding sections of this chapter
describe an economy facing increased pressure to adjust to changing
economic circumstances in a period of restrained growth. The increase in Federal involvement in areas previously considered to be
the domain of private decisionmakers has also been detailed. The
recognition that increased adjustment is needed and that the resources to smooth the path of this adjustment are limited, has led
some to propose an explicit "industrial policy" to guide the broad
collection of Federal activities affecting individual industries and sectors. These proposals, and the conflicting pressures they have created, illustrate the dilemma stated at the beginning of this chapter:
Increased Federal involvement in the economy carries with it both
the potential to improve and the threat of reducing the economy's
efficiency and adaptability.
The steel industry, for example, faces a major financial burden in
complying with clean air and water mandates. It is also beset with
major problems of economic adjustment because of vigorous foreign
competition, technological evolution, changes in labor and raw material costs, and geographic and compositional shifts in the demand for
steel. Similarly complex circumstances have been developing in the
auto sector for several years. In 1980 the combination of recession
and sharply higher gasoline prices focused public attention on the
domestic industry's longer term problems of coping with foreign
competition, improving productivity, and retooling to meet the




127

changed needs of customers. Rubber is a third large U.S. industry
that has been confronted by intense structural problems.
The realization that many of the dislocations brought about by new
conditions have been disproportionately concentrated in certain regions of the country, and growing recognition of the scale of investment in our industrial infrastructure necessary to meet all our social
and economic goals, led to a broad-scale Federal review of policies
for promoting and channeling investment, encouraging innovation,
and dealing with labor-market disruptions. The President's Economic
Revitalization Program, described in Chapter 3 of this Report,
emerged from this review.
Two central issues arose in these discussions: first, the extent to
which the Federal Government ought to be involved in determining
the pace of growth and decline in individual industries and regionsâ€”
in other words, the extent to which the government ought to be involved in "picking winners" or supporting older industries that are
faced with major adjustments; second, the extent to which the government ought to supplant the private sector in allocating capital if
that is required by the objectives of industrial policy.
The review concluded that either type of Federal intervention
would go beyond the legitimate needs for balance, consistency, and
flexibility in Federal actions affecting individual industrial sectors.
For one thing, it is presumptuous to assume that successful identification of winning and losing industrial sectors is possible. Moreover, even within so-called "losing" sectors, individual firms often
outperform many of the firms in "winning" sectors. As an example,
one need only compare the outstanding performance of many "minimill" operators in the beleaguered steel industry to that of many less
profitable firms in the highly touted semiconductor industry.
Attempts to pick winners or reinvigorate declining industries introduce considerations into strategic industrial decisions that, while not
now absent, are certainly less directly felt. Greater government involvement in the detailed workings of the economy has already increased the political aspect of economic decisionmaking and led to
constant pressures for the Federal Government to aid firms, regions,
and industries. Establishment of an explicit industrial policy, together
with the authorities for implementing it, would intensify these trends.
The consequences to the economy of reductions in efficiency and
flexibility that often accompany government intervention have already been detailed in this chapter. But at least three special dangers
would be associated with the development of an overt government
role in picking winners:
First, a successful policy of identifying and supporting promising
sectors implies a willingness on the part of the government to let




128

some of the firms in the chosen sectors fail. A portfolio of venture
capital investments designed to pick only winners typically ends up
with a few large winners and many losers. However, the government's necessary sensitivity to income losses, intensified by the fact
that it would bear a special responsibility for a chosen sector, makes
it difficult, if not impossible, to tolerate such a portfolio. The more
likely outcomeâ€”one frequently observed in other countriesâ€”would
be a reluctance to abandon individual firms that fail. This could more
than offset any gains achieved by the successful few among the
chosen firms.
Second, there could be a tendency to implement a strategy of picking winners by excessive reliance upon policies where the government has broader discretion (e.g., trade policies) rather than designing policies specific to the problem at hand. The resulting use of
easily available, but not necessarily efficient, policy instruments
would create an unbalanced response and introduce additional distortions and rigidities into the economy. Adding to this tendency
would be the policymaker's inevitable recognition that a policy tool
designed for one purpose can often be used for another. For example, the economic prospects of an industry could be indirectly manipulated by changes in the stringency of government regulation. Such
changes, however, when motivated by objectives of industrial policy,
might be counterproductive to achieving the purpose for which the
regulation was intended.
Third, to avoid "wasteful duplication," the government would be
likely to centralize the process of picking winners. Such centralization
would forgo the advantages of risk-diversification that come from decentralized decisionmaking and would further heighten the pressures
to protect losers among the chosen sectors.
Similar arguments would apply to policies aimed at manipulating
the normal workings of capital markets. While prudence argues
strongly for policies which remove impediments to the efficient allocation of capital, prudence also suggests that a centralization of explicit allocation authority would run counter to the overriding need
for flexibility in the present economic environment.
PREFERRED POLICY APPROACHES

While it is inappropriate for the government to utilize its policy instruments to support winners and discourage losers or to centralize
the allocation of capital resources, government policies can be used
in appropriate ways to make a difference in the economy at large and
in individual industries. Tax policies, for example, can influence the
level of investment and risk-taking in the economy as a whole without
excessive intrusion into the affairs of individual firms or industries.
Although regulatory policies, by their very nature, constitute greater




129

involvement in the operation of individual firms or individual sectors,
they too can be designed to attain their goals with minimal intrusion
and can take into account the circumstances of individual industries.
Trade policies also shape decisions in individual markets. Without
choosing winners and losers, it is still possible for the government to
reduce constraints to free international transactions, to police these
transactions for violations of national law and international trade
agreements, and to screen individual cases carefully to afford relief
from unfair import competition.
Agricultural policy decisions can be designed to reduce instability
in that sector and to ensure that those receiving the benefits of such
policies also pay for the burden such policies impose. Similarly, the
continued deregulation of financial institutions can assure the aggressive pursuit of efficiency and innovation in that sector. Labor market
policies can try to help workers in declining regions or industries
adapt more rapidly and with less human suffering to changing conditions.
In sum, recognition that the numerous policies of the Federal Government exert a substantial influence on individual sectors of the
economy leads logically to a search for coherence in policy. The pursuit of such coherence is both justified and desirable when it involves
the thoughtful coordination of policies in areas where government
intervention is necessary. The danger lies in the unwise manipulation
of policy variables designed for one set of purposes to attain goals
which can be better achieved by the private market.

CHAPTER 3

The Economy: Review and Prospects
THE U.S. ECONOMY IN 1980 felt the effects of the huge 1979
oil-price shock. The 5-year recovery and expansion that followed the
1974-75 downturn came to an end with a sharp but brief recession
and the underlying rate of inflation moved up to the 9- to 10-percent
range. The most striking feature of the year, however, was the volatility of economic developments. Real gross national product (GNP) declined at a record rate in the second quarter but advanced thereafter,
producing the briefest recession on record. Interest rates surged to
record heights, plunged downward, and then rose to new peaks and
declined again, all within the space of 9 months. Overall, these developments made for a historically unprecedented year.
While the outlook is for only a modest pace of recovery in 1981,
the persistence of unacceptably high inflation and the Nation's vulnerability to energy shocks call for continued restraint in both monetary and fiscal policy. A modest-sized tax cut combined with restraint
in Federal spending, however, would be compatible with this prudence. And if, as the Administration has proposed, a substantial part
of the tax cut is oriented toward business investment, we can help
support the recovery in a way that comes to grips with the country's
longer-run needs.
A REVIEW OF 1980
The resilience that had characterized the economy during 1979 ultimately gave way to pressures from sharply higher energy prices and
policy measures undertaken in the fight to cool inflation. Over the 4
quarters of 1980 real GNP fell 0.3 percent, but the pattern during
the year was quite uneven. The first quarter's 3.1 percent annual rate
of growth in real GNP was followed by a record 9.9 percent rate of
decline in the second. After midyear, much to the surprise of most
economic forecasters, the economy rebounded; real GNP grew at a
3.1 percent rate during the second half of the year. (All national
income and product account data for the fourth quarter of 1980 are
based on highly preliminary estimates.)
The weakness of the economy during the first half of 1980 led to
significant deterioration in labor markets. The unemployment rate




131

rose from 6.0 percent in December 1979 to 6.3 percent in March and
then spurted to a peak of 7.6 percent in May. The rate remained between 7.4 and 7.6 percent for the rest of the year. During the first
half of the year, employment declined by 1.0 percent, a decline of 1
million jobs. From June to December, employment grew 0.5 million,
thus reversing a substantial portion of the first-half loss. The labor
force grew 1.3 percent over the 4 quarters of the year.
The rate of inflation increased in 1980. The implicit price deflator
for GNP rose 10.0 percent over the 4 quarters of 1980, a 1.9 percentage point increase over the 1979 rate. For the 12 months ending
November 1980 the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban consumers rose 12.6 percentâ€”the same rate of increase as in the 12
months ending in November 1979. Due to the special circumstances
created by increases in the prices of food and energy, and the
treatment of home purchase and finance in the CPI, this latter comparison understates the rise in inflation in 1980. Excluding these
factors, the CPI rose 9.9 percent as compared with 7.2 percent in 1979.
Wage rates, which had shown moderation during 1979 despite the
rise in inflation, accelerated in 1980. Average hourly earnings grew
9.3 percent, up 1 percentage point from the 1979 rate. For the year
ending with the third quarter of 1980 productivity was virtually unchanged, although this was an improvement as compared with the
1-percent decline recorded in 1979.
The year saw continued improvement in the U.S. international position. After absorbing the huge 1979 increases in our foreign oil bill,
the U.S. balance of payments moved sharply into surplus in the
second half of the year. All other major oil-importing countries, by
contrast, are experiencing substantial current-account deficits. The
U.S. dollar remained strong in relationship to other currencies
throughout much of the year. At year-end, on an average weighted
basis, its value was 6 percent higher than at the beginning of the year.
The United States reduced its total energy use in 1980. In addition,
as compared with 1979, oil imports declined by 20 percent to about
6x/2 million barrels per day at year-end. In 1980 we imported less oil
than in any year since 1975. While a portion of this reduction can be
traced to weakness in economic activity, much was due to intensified
conservation efforts that have followed the recent rapid increases in
energy prices.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR

The slowing in the growth of the economy that occurred in 1980
was largely the consequence of events that began in 1979.
The first of these was the significant disruption in the world oil
market triggered by lost Iranian oil production. Extensive efforts to




132

build up oil inventories and maintain adequate supplies boosted the
price of imported oil purchased by U.S. refiners by 94 percent during
1979. This, together with the phased decontrol of the prices of domestically produced oil, resulted in the average refiners* acquisition
price for all oil in the United States rising from $13 per barrel in January 1979 to $24 per barrel in December 1979. This huge increase
added to inflationary pressures and reduced purchasing power. The
Council of Economic Advisers has calculated that the drag on purchasing power due to these higher oil prices reached 2 percent of
GNP during 1979.
A second restraining force evident at the end of 1979 was the
stance of monetary and fiscal policy. A major goal of macroeconomic
policy since early 1979 has been to minimize the inflationary consequences of the oil-price shock by avoiding the spillover of accelerating consumer prices into wage demands, then higher business costs,
and eventually higher long-term inflation. The Federal high-employment budget surplus (discussed in more detail later in this chapter),
which had increased by $7V2 billion in 1978, tightened an additional
$13Y2 billion in 1979. Efforts to restrain growth in money and credit
resulted in rising short-term interest rates during 1979, especially in
the second half. From July to December 1979 the 91-day Treasury
bill rate rose from 9.3 to 12.1 percent, while the prime rate increased
from 11.5 to 15.5 percent.
A third source of potential demand restraint, which became evident
at year-end 1979, stemmed from imbalances in the spending behavior of households. In the last half of 1979 real disposable income
rose 1 percent, while real consumption spending advanced 2 percent.
As a consequence, the personal saving rate fell 0.9 percentage point
during the last half of 1979 to a 28-year low of 4.7 percent in the
fourth quarter. At the same time, consumer debt burdens remained
high and delinquency rates on consumer loans continued to rise. It
seemed clear that some significant retrenchment by the consumer
was likely, even in the absence of further oil drag and continued
policy restraint.
In light of these developments, it was expected that 1980 would be
a year of declining economic activity. Indeed, 1 year ago this Report
stated: "The expected recession is likely to be mild and brief. Declines in real gross national product (GNP) should not extend much
past midyear, and economic growth will resume later this year, albeit
slowly at first. Over the 4 quarters of 1980 real GNP is forecast to
decline by 1 percent . . . the unemployment rate is likely to rise . . .
to 7V2 percent in the fourth quarter . . . " Despite the general accuracy of last year's forecast, views about the likely course of the economy went through several rapid changes as the year unfolded.




133

Early in 1980 there were few signs of recession. If anything, activity seemed to be picking up. The evidence available at the time hinted
that households, far from retrenching, were on a buy-in-advance
spending spree. Retail sales, which had risen at an annual rate of 13
percent from October 1979 to December 1979, accelerated to an
annual rate of nearly 43 percent in January 1980. Auto sales, which
had been running at an annual rate of 9.4 million units in October
1979, spurted to 10.3 million units in December 1979 and to 11.9
million units in January 1980.
International events contributed to the sense that demand could be
stronger than anticipated. Continued Mideast instability, the unresolved issue of the American hostages in Iran, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan all raised the possibility of greatly expanded defense spending, perhaps enough to sustain economic growth despite
a predicted slowing in private demand.
The inflation data also seemed to reflect an apparent acceleration
in economic activity. The CPI, which had increased at an annual rate
of between 13 and 14 percent during the last 3 months of 1979, rose
at a rate of 18 percent in January and February. Although a large
part of this speedup was due to higher oil prices, other prices also
accelerated. For the 3 months ending in February, the CPI excluding
energy prices rose at an annual rate of 12.9 percent, in contrast to
the 12.2 percent rate during the 3 months ending in November 1979.
The producer price index (PPI) for finished goods other than energy
rose at an annual rate of 16% percent in January 1980. More ominously, wage rate increases, which had remained moderate throughout most of the year, accelerated in late 1979 and early 1980.
Meanwhile, business demand for credit accelerated, with business
loans growing at a rapid 24 percent annual rate from December 1979
to February 1980. Speculative activity in commodity and financial futures markets intensified, and interest rates continued their rapid
climb (Chart 7). In early March the 91-day Treasury bill rate rose to
15.7 percent while the prime rate hit 17.75 percent. Several forces
were apparently at work. Each new increase in short-term interest
rates brought fears of higher rates, and thus further pressures to
borrow immediately. In addition, hints of credit controls apparently
motivated firms to borrow in advance of actual need.

135

By early March there was fear that inflationary pressures and inflationary expectations were mounting despite the restraining influences
of fiscal and monetary policy, and that without some additional
action these would validate and further accelerate wage demands and
ultimately lead to an explosion of prices. This would have ended any
chance of containing the 1979 oil-price shock. It was in this environment that the Administration and the Federal Reserve moved to suppress the speculative fever and return order to financial markets. On
March 14 the President announced a series of budgetary and administrative actions designed to stabilize the situation. These included
measures to reduce Federal expenditures, to strengthen wage and
price monitoring, and to encourage energy conservation. In addition,
the President authorized the Federal Reserve to institute a program
of selective controls on credit.
The controls programâ€”explained in more detail belowâ€”induced
banks and other financial institutions to intensify actions to restrict
the availability of virtually all types of credit. The growth of bank
business loans and other lending covered by the program was curtailed sharply. The program also had the important psychological
effect of curtailing household borrowing, as many forms of credit not
explicitly covered by the program, such as home mortgages and auto
loans, also fell sharply. A good part of these declines, however, probably stemmed from the rapid rise in interest rates.
Economic activity was apparently beginning to slow even before
the imposition of the credit controls, but the subsequent decline in
consumer demand was intensified by the controls. The economy
reached its cyclical peak in January. Nevertheless, the first-quarter
growth in real GNP was at an annual rate of 3.1 percent. During the
second quarter real GNP dropped at an annual rate of 9.9 percent,
exceeding the previous record of 8.2 percent set in the first quarter
of 1975. Furthermore, the decline of 10.4 percent at an annual rate
in real final sales was far and away the sharpest postwar drop in that
category. Housing and automobile sales were the key sectors of
weakness, accounting for about two-thirds of this drop in final
demand. There was a modest amount of inventory accumulation but
it was surprisingly small given such a large decline in final sales.
Interest rates, which had continued to rise for a brief time after the
introduction of the credit controls program, fell sharply due to weakening loan demand and a declining economy. Rates peaked around
the end of March and then fell further and more quickly than they




136

had risen just 2 months earlier. By late June the credit controls were
no longer constraining the demand for credit, and by July the prime
rate had fallen to 11 percent, down from its peak of 20 percent. In
light of these developments, the controls were removed in early July.
After the second quarter's record drop in real GNP, most observers predicted that the economy would experience 2 more quarters of
decline. There were fears that the downturn might approach the severity of the 1974-75 recession. Indeed, the unemployment rate,
which had jumped to 7.6 percent in May, was forecast by many to be
between 8Â¥2 and 9 percent by year-end.
In fact, private demand rebounded with surprising alacrity. The
sharp decline in interest rates, combined with the absence of a significant stock of unwanted inventories, contributed to the brevity of
the recession. The two sectors that had led the decline in the second
quarter recovered quickly in the third. By September, housing starts
had increased 70 percent above their May lowâ€”by far the quickest
bounceback on record. Car sales also regained some of their lost
ground. October sales ran at an annual rate of 9.2 million units, still
lower than their year-earlier levels, but 28 percent above their May
low rate of 7.2 million units. The third quarter rebound in real final
sales was a strong 4.1 percent, but inventory liquidation held the
growth in real GNP to a more modest 2.4 percent.
In the fourth quarter real growth picked up to a 3.7 percent annual
pace, with continued strength evident in personal consumption and
housing. With the turnabout in economic activity in the second half
of the year, the labor market also improved.
At the same time that the recovery was taking place, tightening
monetary conditions produced another upswing in the interest rate
roller coaster (Chart 7). From July to December the prime rate advanced from 11 percent to a record level of 21% percent, while the
Treasury bill rate rose from 8 percent to 17 percent. Long-term interest rates also rose by about 2 to 3 percentage points over the
same period. After mid-December interest rates dropped sharply for
a time but nevertheless remained unusually high. These developments raise serious doubts about the future of the recovery and bring
prospects of a leveling off or possibly a decline in output during the
early part of 1981. Furthermore, the persistence of the Iran-Iraq war
raises the possibility of sharply higher energy prices during 1981. At
the end of 1980 the key features which had characterized the U.S.
economy over most of the previous 18 months remain dominant: a
surprising strength of demand straining against high interest rates, a
stubborn inflation, and continued vulnerability to external oil shocks.




137

THE MAJOR SECTORS OF AGGREGATE DEMAND

The decline of the economy during 1980 as a whole was dominated by drops in expenditures on real consumer durable goods (down
7.7 percent over the 4 quarters), residential structures (down 18.0
percent), and real business fixed investment (down 6.0 percent)
(Table 14). The sectors of real demand that grew during the year
were personal consumption of services, Federal Government purchases, and net exports. Service consumption grew 2.8 percent over
the 4 quarters of 1980. Federal Government purchases were up 4.7
percent. Real net exports grew from $42.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 1979 to $55.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 1980. A 6.7 percent reduction in imports combined with a 3.9 percent rise in exports
to produce this result.

Personal Consumption

Expenditures

The year 1980 began with the personal saving rate at a 28-year
low, with consumer debt burdens near record highs, and with attitude surveys showing consumer pessimism about the outlook. The
modest strength in consumption that had been evident in 1979 despite the deceleration in real incomes had worsened the budget position of households. This, together with high interest rates and the
imposition of credit controls, produced a retrenchment in consumer
outlays. Real personal consumption expenditures fell in 1980 for the
first time in 6 years. The 0.3 percent decline in consumption over the
year, combined with the modest 0.5 percent increase in disposable
income, helped to increase the saving rate from 4.7 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1979 to 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1980
(Chart 8).

The decline in consumption in 1980, which was largely the result
of a decline in credit-sensitive purchasesâ€”particularly durable
goodsâ€”was concentrated in the second quarter. In that quarter total
real consumption fell at a record rate of 9.8percent. The improvement
in household debt positions that had begun in late 1979 was accelerated during the late spring and early summer by the credit controls
program. Extensions of consumer credit in the second quarter fell at
nearly a 60 percent annual rate. Outstanding consumer debt declined
for 4 straight months from April to July, and for the second quarter
as a whole it fell at a record 13.8 percent annual rate.
The rapid drop in interest rates helped to bring a quick reversal of
the second quarter's consumption decline. In June real retail sales
grew at a 17.8 percent annual rate; the gain in July was at an even
greater 27.3 percent pace. For the third quarter as a whole real consumption advanced at an annual rate of 5.1 percent, regaining nearly
one-half of the second quarter's drop. In the fourth quarter real consumption grew at a 3.3 percent annual rate.
Durable Goods. Real expenditures on consumer durables fell 7.7 percent during 1980, their second year of decline. The consumer durables cycle during 1979 and 1980 was much like that of the 1974-75
recession. During the first half of 1980 real consumer durable goods




139

expenditures continued the virtually unbroken decline that had
begun after the fourth quarter of 1978. Over this period purchases of
real consumer durables declined 16.3 percent, with the steepest drop
concentrated in the second quarter of 1980. A long and gradual slide
culminating in 1 quarter of very steep decline was also the pattern
during 1974-75; the peak-to-trough decline then was also 16.3 percent. During the last half of 1980 real consumer durable expenditures regained nearly one-half of the second quarter's decline.
Growth in the third quarter was at an annual rate of 21.9 percent.
Growth in the fourth quarter was at a rate near 7 percent. Automotive purchases dominated quarter-to-quarter movements in consumer durables during the year, leading the first-half declines as well
as the last-half gains. By year-end car sales were running at a 9-million unit rate, but sales were apparently being held back by a combination of the high interest rates on consumer loans and high car
prices. Real automotive purchases fell 12.9 percent during 1980oas a
whole. Similar weakness was evident in real consumer demand for
other durable goods, which fell 4.0 percent over the 4 quarters of
1980.
Other Consumption. Real nondurable goods consumption fell 1.2 percent during 1980. Purchases of gasoline, oil, and other fuels fell 3.2
percent. In part this reflected the effects of the recession, but much
of the decline in these energy demands was due to conservation efforts in response to sharply higher prices. By year-end the consumption of these goods was 11 percent below the peak levels set in 1978.
Real consumption of services grew at a sluggish 2.8 percent over
the 4 quarters of 1980, down from the 1979 pace of 3.6 percent.
Service consumption tends to be much more stable than goods consumption over the business cycle because many of these expenditures, such as housing and medical care, cannot be delayed or postponed. Nevertheless, important cyclically sensitive components of
service consumption were quite weak during the year. Transportation
services, for instance, fell at an annual rate of 11.9 percent in the
second quarter and 2.0 percent over the entire year.
Residential Investment

The path of real investment in residential structures over the last 2
years was like that of consumer durables. It was marked by a slow
and gradual slide throughout 1979, ending with a very sharp decline
in the spring of 1980. Residential construction picked up rapidly
thereafter, but at year-end housing starts had leveled off in response
to higher mortgage interest rates. The pattern of housing activity in
1979 and 1980 reflected new developments in housing finance. As
noted in Chapter 2, mortgage lenders now compete for loanable
funds on a more even footing with other lenders. Consequently, the




140

chief cyclical determinant of housing activity has become interest
rates rather than credit availability. As events have demonstrated,
however, these institutional changes did not insulate housing from
tighter monetary conditions.
The financial environment that determines the health of the housing sector had been weakened by the sharp rise in interest rates that
began in 1979. By October of that year, most mortgage rates had
risen to around 13 percent, a level that discouraged many potential
home buyers. At the same time, increases in construction loan rates
stretched the ability of homebuilders to finance new construction and
carry inventories of unsold homes. This trend was accentuated in
early 1980 by a further rise in interest rates on mortgage commitments to a record 16 percent in April. The increased interest rates
pushed monthly mortgage payments higher than many could afford.
In addition, even though mortgage finance was largely exempt from
the provisions of the credit controls program, mortgage lenders were
less willing to commit long-term funds in such an uncertain environment. During the year State and local government housing authorities continued to provide a substantial amount of mortgage support
through purchase of residential mortgages at below-market interest
rates financed by tax-exempt bonds. But Federal and related agencies
provided only modest support to the mortgage market as compared
with the last cyclical downturn. Home sales reached their nadir by
late spring. Housing starts in May plummeted to a 906,000-unit
annual rate, down 36 percent from their January level and down
nearly 50 percent from their average 1979 level. During the second
quarter single-family starts averaged 671,000 units at an annual rate,
which was only slightly more than one-half 1979's total. Multifamily
units fell to a rate of 382,000 units in the second quarter after averaging 551,000 units during 1979.
The midyear decline in mortgage interest rates lagged somewhat
behind the drop in other long-term yields, but by August most mortgage rates had fallen to near 12 percent. Even with the high interest
rates, however, sales of new homes had begun to increase in May,
and construction activity followed quickly. Housing starts increased
in June for the first time in 6 months. The surprisingly quick increase
in starts probably stemmed from the relatively low level of new home
inventories during the spring. With very few houses for sale, the increase in sales provided the needed stimulus for new building.
During the fall and early winter of 1980 mortgage rates again
began to creep upward. Nonetheless, sales of new homes and total
housing starts remained moderately strong through November. Although some weakening in sales was evident during the fourth quar-




141

ter, the low level of inventories encouraged a continuation of building activity.
The average price of a new home (adjusted for changes in quality)
increased at an 11 percent annual rate in the first 3 quarters of 1980,
which was about as fast as in the preceding year. Many of the homes
built in 1980 were smaller and more austere than those constructed
in preceding years, reflecting the recession weakness in incomes and
the high cost of mortgage finance.
Business Fixed Investment

Real business fixed investment declined 6.0 percent over the 4
quarters of 1980. Business fixed investment averaged 10.7 percent of
GNP, somewhat lower than the 11.0 percent level in 1979. Producers* durable equipment declined 4.8 percent during 1980. The volatile automotive portion of equipment purchases fell 16.2 percent
during the year, its second year of very large declines. The remaining
components declined 2.4 percent. Investment in nonresidential structures dropped 9.1 percent over the same period (Table 15).

Several factors contributed to the decline in business fixed investment. First, the deceleration in final sales reduced the need for immediate additions to capacity. The Federal Reserve Board's index of
capacity utilization rates in manufacturing dropped from 83.9 percent
in January to a 5-year low of 74.9 percent following the spring decline. The sizable drop in this aggregate index, however, masked
some important differences among certain industries. In the durable
goods materials industries, for instance, capacity utilization rates fell
below 70 percent. Thus key suppliers of hard goods found themselves with plenty of capacity to satisfy demand over the near term.
In addition, forecasts of recession indicated that capacity needs
would not be rising until early 1981. These forecasts, in conjunction
with the high cost of funds during the early part of 1980â€”widely
perceived as temporaryâ€”made the delay of capital investment plans
more attractive.
Finally, shrinking sales and increasing debt service costs seriously
reduced corporate cash flow. Internally generated funds for invest-




142

ment were sharply diminished by the 13.3 percent decline in profits
during the second quarter of 1980. While aggregate measures of
profitability and corporate cash flow reflected cyclical weakness, these
measures understated the extent of the problem by masking important distributional imbalances. In particular, oil and coal industry
profits represent a growing share of the aggregate. From the first
quarter of 1979 to the third quarter of 1980 corporate profits in the
petroleum and coal industries grew from $15.0 billion, or 6.9 percent
of total corporate profits, to $22.2 billion, or 11.3 percent.
Inventory Accumulation

Cautious inventory policies continued throughout 1980. Real inventory accumulation in the fourth quarter was virtually unchanged
from its level in the fourth quarter of 1979 and thus had almost no
impact on the overall growth in real GNP over the 4 quarters of
1980.

VRATIO OF REAL INVENTORIES AT END OF QUARTER TO REAL FINAL SALES AT MONTHLY
RATES.
SOURCE: DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE.

As compared with the 1970s, inventory-to-sales ratios remained
relatively low during 1980 (Chart 9). What was more interesting was
the rapid response of production to the changes in final sales. As




143

Table 16 shows, the pattern of output, sales, and inventories in the
nonfarm business sector in 1980 was quite different from the pattern
of the 1974-75 recession. A sharp drop in final sales in the fourth
quarter of 1974 was accompanied by a smaller percentage reduction
in output. This resulted in an unintended accumulation of inventories, with real inventory investment of $13.3 billion at an annual
rate. The inventory-to-sales ratio rose markedly. This set off a sharp
adjustment in subsequent quarters, and over the first half of 1975 inventories were decumulated at a $13.9 billion annual rate.

This sharp inventory cycle was not in evidence in 1980. Final sales
fell at an annual rate of 10.8 percent in the second quarter, the most
rapid decline ever recorded. But the output response was nearly as
rapid and inventories increased at an annual rate of only $0.6 billion.
While inventories did decline in the third quarter of 1980, indicating
efforts to trim unwanted inventories, the swing was distinctly more
modest than in 1974-75.
Several factors account for the improved management of inventories. Inventory control and information systems continue to improve the ability of production managers to maintain the proper balance between raw material stocks and market demand. Also, unlike
the earlier period, there were no serious doubts about the availability
of raw materials and supplies this time around. Thus, precautionary
overstocking of inventories to ensure adequate supplies of inputs for
production was not apparent in 1979-80. In addition, high and volatile interest rates have increased both the cost and risk of holding
large inventory stocks.
The External Sector

Following 2 years of rapid expansion, the growth in the volume of
U.S. merchandise exports fell in 1980 as world economic activity
slowed. At the same time, however, the volume of U.S. imports




144

dropped even faster, in large part because of the recession here. As a
result, net exports measured in constant 1972 dollars showed a very
large $13.5-billion increase during the year.
In value terms, shifts in the U.S. trade balance were importantly
affected by payments for oil. From the third quarter of 1979 to the
first quarter of 1980 the oil import bill increased by about $20 billion
at an annual rate because of much higher oil prices. Other trade
flows only partially offset this increase, and the merchandise trade
deficit widened by $15 billion to an annual rate of $43 billion in the
first quarter. After the first quarter, however, the volume of oil imports declined sharply. Thus, despite some further increases in oil
prices, the oil bill fell, contributing to the marked narrowing of the
trade deficit. The merchandise trade deficit for the whole of 1980
was an estimated $26 billion, $3.5 billion smaller than in 1979. Invisibles transactions, which reached a record surplus of $33 billion at
an annual rate in the first quarter, more than offset the deficit on
merchandise trade during 1980.
For 1979 the U.S. current-account deficit was a small $788 million.
It was in deficit by about $10 billion at an annual rate in the first half
of 1980, moved sharply into surplus in the third quarter, and is likely
to show a surplus of $3-$6 billion for 1980 as a whole.
The most noteworthy feature of recent U.S. trade performance has
been its strength. From 1977 to the second quarter of 1980 the
volume of U.S. exports grew by 40 percent. More significantly, the
share of U.S. exports as a percentage of the total exports of the industrial countries over this period increased by about 1XA percentage
points, reversing a declining trend visible since the 1950s. At the
same time, the volume of U.S. imports showed almost no growth,
even though real GNP rose by about 7 percent. This was a major
break in longer-term trends, which have shown U.S. imports growing
at rates well above the growth of real GNP.
These aggregate indicators of recent trade performance are all the
more striking in view of the widespread popular notion that the
United States is losing its ability to compete in both foreign and domestic markets. It may be that these views stem from unwarranted
generalizations from particular sectorsâ€”such as automobiles, where
foreign pressure clearly has increasedâ€”to aggregate trade. In addition, it may be that losses in relative terms vis-a-vis certain trading
partnersâ€”most notably Japan and a certain number of newly industrializing developing countriesâ€”are viewed as more significant. Each
of these concerns is certainly legitimate to some extent, but they
should not obscure the overall success of the United States in foreign
trade. Encouragement can be drawn from our recent aggregate performance, which most analysts ascribe to the increased competitive-




145

ness of U.S. producers in the wake of the depreciation of the dollar
in 1977 and 1978,
Government Purchases of Goods and Services

Real government purchases of goods and services grew 1.5 percent
during 1980, as gains in Federal purchases more than offset the decline in State and local purchases. Over the 4 quarters of 1980 State
and local purchases fell 0.3 percent. Reduced purchases of durable
goods (down 1.6 percent) and structures (down 6.5 percent) were the
key factors. Real compensation of employees grew 0.7 percent in
1980, a significant deceleration from the 2.4 percent average rate in
the previous 3 years. There had been widespread expectations that
reductions in Federal grant-in-aid support, particularly for public
service employment payrolls, combined with the recession squeeze
on tax receipts and political pressures for reduced growth, would
force an even sharper cutback in the growth of State and local payrolls. Instead, State and local governments have attempted to insulate payrolls from the worst of the budget pressures while cutting expenditures elsewhere. The decline in structures investment over the
year was heavily concentrated in those areas dependent on the housing cycle: sewer system construction and highway and street construction and renovation.
Real Federal purchases of goods and services grew 4.7 percent
during 1980. Real defense spending grew 5.7 percent during 1980,
with the pace of spending picking up in the last half of the year. Real
nondefense purchases grew at a slower 3.2 percent for the year as a
whole.
LABOR MARKET DEVELOPMENTS

The volatility in demand for goods and services during 1980 produced similar swings in the demand for labor (Table 17). Civilian
employment peaked at 97.8 million in February 1980. Then during
the next 4 months employment fell sharply (1.1 percent) to 96.8 million in June. Over this same period unemployment rose from 6.5 million to 7.8 million. Automobile and construction employment were
especially hard hit. Although these two industries constituted only
about 6 percent of total payroll employment, they accounted for
nearly two-fifths of the decline in employment from February to
June.
Employment growth resumed at midyear. The magnitude of the
subsequent recovery differs, depending on which of the two standard
measures of employment is utilized. Judged by the household survey,
employment growth after midyear was relatively modest so that by
year-end total employment was still 500,000 lower than in December
1979. When measured by data from business payrolls, however, em-




146

ployment grew more vigorously after midyear and by December 1980
stood some 450,000 higher than a year earlier. Statistical discrepancies of this sort are not unusual for changes over short periods of
time. Even with this difference, both measures clearly indicate that
the decline in overall employment during 1980 ended quickly.

The impact of the year's labor-market weakness was spread unevenly across demographic groups. The unemployment rate for adult
men rose by a much greater percentage than did the unemployment
rates for women and teenagers. The total unemployment rate rose
from 5.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 1979 to 7.5 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1980. The unemployment rate for men 20 years
and over rose from 4.4 percent to 6.3 percent during this period. By
contrast, the unemployment rate for women 20 years and over only
increased from 5.7 to 6.7 percent. In the third quarter of 1980 the
adult male unemployment rate exceeded the adult female rate. While
this is highly unusual, adult male unemployment rates typically rise
more than adult female rates during recession. This is because
output declines tend to be concentrated in construction and durable
goods manufacturing, sectors with a much higher proportion of adult
male workers than, say, the relatively stable service sector. In the
fourth quarter employment recalls in such industries as autos, steel,




147

and construction helped to reduce the adult male unemployment rate
below that of adult females.
Unemployment duration lengthened significantly in 1980. In the
last quarter of 1979, before the recession began, 48 percent of the
unemployed had been looking for work for less than 5 weeks, and
only 8.5 percent, or 524,000 people, had been without jobs for 27
weeks or more. By the last quarter of 1980 about 1.1 million people,
or 14 percent of the unemployed, had been looking for work for 27
weeks or more. Many of these workers were eligible for up to 39
weeks of unemployment compensation, with additional benefits if
their job loss was due to foreign competition or if their firms or
unions provided supplemental unemployment benefits.
During the 4 years of economic expansion from 1976 to 1979 the
civilian labor force grew at an average annual rate of 2.8 percent.
The rise in unemployment during 1980 dampened this growth to 1.3
percent. After increasing by about 1 percentage point per year
during the last half of the 1970s, the female labor force participation
rate grew by about one-half, rising to 51.6 percent in 1980. The male
labor force participation rate of 77.4 percent was down slightly over
the year.
PRICE DEVELOPMENTS

Inflation dominated the economic news in 1980 as it did in 1979.
The implicit price deflator for GNP rose 10.0 percent over the 4
quarters of 1980, substantially faster than the 8.1 percent rate of increase in the deflator during 1979 (Table 18). The producer price
index for finished goods increased 11.7 percent from December 1979
to December 1980, following a 12.6 percent rise during the preceding 12 months. For the 12 months ending in November 1980, the
CPI increased 12.6 percent, the same as over the corresponding
period in 1979. These measures all reflected energy price
surges early in the year and farm price increases late in the year. The
most disappointing news, however, was the acceleration in various
price measures which exclude the direct effects of such special factors
as energy and food. As explained in Chapter 1, such measures are
often used as a proxy for the "underlying" rate of inflation. After remaining surprisingly stable during most of 1979 in the face of very
large oil-price increases, these measures showed significant increases
in 1980.
The spring decline in aggregate demand brought rapid changes in
the prices of certain sensitive industrial commodities. Sharp decreases were registered by producer prices of nonferrous metals as
well as lumber and wood products. These price reductions had an
importantâ€”if temporaryâ€”moderating influence on producer price
measures. Excluding food and energy, producer prices of crude ma-




148

terials fell for a full third of the year. One other measure, the Bureau
of Labor Statistics measure of spot market prices, fell 11.5 percent
from February 1980 to June 1980. The turnaround in activity in the
second half-year once again tightened industrial markets by enough
to erase the early-year declines. Producer prices for crude materials
excluding food and energy rose 10.6 percent in the 12 months
ending in December 1980.

Consumer Prices

As in 1979, the behavior of energy and food prices, together with
the effects of mortgage interest rates on the CPI, attracted attention
throughout the year. These are discussed in more detail below. Less
marked by the public, but of more concern for the longer-run outlook, was the increase in the underlying rate of inflation as evidenced
in the behavior of consumer prices after these special factors are excluded.
The underlying rate, as approximated by the CPI excluding food,
energy, and home purchase and finance, jumped from 7.2 percent in
the 12 months ending November 1979 to over 11 percent in December, and it stayed in the neighborhood of 12 percent during the first
quarter of 1980. From April to November the measure grew at an
average annual rate of 9.0 percent, a slowdown from the pace in the
first quarter, but noticeably above the 1979 performance.
A second measure of the underlying inflation rate is the fixedweight price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding
energy and food. This measure, shown in Table 19 along with the




149

previously discussed CPI measures, reflects a similar acceleration
over the year as a whole. Over the 4 quarters of 1980 the index rose
9.6 percent, up from the 7.2 percent increase over the 4 quarters of
1979.

It is difficult to ascribe the acceleration of these measures at the
beginning of 1980 to any single factor. It is likely that the most important cause was the pass-through of oil-price increases into other
commodities. About half of all oil is used in the production and distribution of other goods and services. Oil-price increases therefore
must eventually be reflected in final product prices. Similarly, as described below, the rapid advance in unit labor costs during 1979 and
1980 exerted further upward pressures on prices. Finally, the latter
part of 1979 and the early months of 1980 saw an upsurge in expectations about inflation and an upsurge in consumer buying. In such
an atmosphere business may well have raised prices ahead of increases in costs. The relative improvement in the underlying rate following the spring's decline in demand offers some support for this
view.
Prices of Energy, Food, and Housing

The measures of the underlying rate of inflation omit the primary
sources of month-to-month variability in consumer prices. In particular, half of the CPI is accounted for by energy, food, and home purchase and finance. And 1980 saw very volatile movements in these
prices.
Energy. Energy prices as measured by the CPI, which had climbed
at a 55 percent rate in the 6 months between March and September




150

1979, slowed to a 19 percent annual rate in the last months of that
year. During the fall of 1979 the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) announced an increase in the price of Saudi Arabian light crude oil of $6.00 per barrel. That was followed by a series
of $2.00 per barrel increases in January, April, and August. These
price increases were accompanied by the phased decontrol of domestic crude oil prices, which had begun in June 1979. The effect of
these actions was a burst of price increases for oil products during
the first 3 months of 1980, averaging an annual rate of almost 100
percent. Gasoline, for instance, which was priced at $1.04 per gallon
in December, moved up to $1.23 per gallon in March. Similar increases were registered in other oil-related energy components of the
CPI, in particular home heating oil.
By the second quarter the burst of OPEC-related energy price increases began to play itself out. In the 5 months between May and
October 1980 the energy component of the CPI grew at an average
annual rate of just 1.7 percent. This was in quite marked contrast to
the 40.4 percent average annual rate of increase experienced over
the prior 5 months. By November gasoline was actually 0.8 cents per
gallon lower than it had been in March, and heating oil was up only
1.9 cents during the same period. Thus, although the energy sector
spent the year in the limelight, it was a major direct source of inflation
only in the first quarter of the year.
Food. Food prices in the CPI increased 10.6 percent in the 12
months ending November 1980, as compared with a 9.8 percent rise
over the previous 12 months. The farm value of food increased
nearly 15 percent over the period. Marketing costs increased about 9
percent.
Over the course of 1980 the food price situation was quite volatile.
During the first half, food prices increased less than 5 percent at an
annual rate. During the second half, however, the rate of increase
more than doubled. Recession-induced weakness in demand during
the spring, followed by drought during the summer growing season,
contributed to the acceleration in monthly food price movements.
Prices of retail meat, which accounts for nearly 30 percent of all food
spending at home, actually fell at an annual rate of 11.8 percent
during the first half, and rose at a rate of 35 percent from June to
November.
The extended period of very hot and dry weather damaged crops
in the Southwest (cotton, soybeans, sorghum, and peanuts) during
the early summer. The adverse weather conditions persisted and
moved north and east affecting the corn crop and meat production in
July and August. As the summer progressed the full extent of the




151

crop damage became evident. Prices received for the major crops increased 20 to 30 percent during the second half of 1980.
Housing. The home purchase, finance, insurance, and taxes component of the CPI is a matter of controversy. Ideally, a cost-of-living
index should reflect the cost of shelter services provided by owneroccupied houses. For rented houses, this is precisely what is captured
by market rents. Under current practice, however, the home purchase
and finance component of the CPI in effect treats the purchase of a
house as it would any ordinary good. But houses do not only provide
shelter; they are also assets which yield a return. As a consequence,
the movement of house prices reflects not only the cost of shelter but
also the value of the investment. Since the CPI also assumes that part
of the mortgage used to finance a house is "purchased," the confounding of consumption and investment considerations is exacerbated by the treatment of mortgage interest costs. The Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS) has been concerned for some time with the adequacy
of the homeownership component of the CPI. BLS, in fact, currently
publishes several experimental indexes based on alternative treatments of homeownership.
For the present, at least, the CPI tends to overstate the importance
of home purchase and finance and, given the volatility of mortgage
rates, to produce startling monthly variations in the CPL During the
first 6 months of 1980 the home purchase and finance component of
the CPI increased at a 27.6 percent rate, adding about 3 percentage
points to the annual rate of inflation over the period. In July and
August the fall in mortgage rates dominated the index. The home
purchase and finance component fell at an annual rate of over 25
percent in July, and this decline was large enough to offset the increase in the other components of the index, resulting in an unchanged CPI from June to July. While this zero change in prices was
widely regarded as a statistical anomaly, it was no more or less
anomalous than the inflationary influence that the home purchase
and finance component had imparted to the CPI throughout the first
half of the year. This influence began to be felt again during the late
fall and early winter as mortgage rates climbed to near their spring
peaks. The home purchase and finance component promises to have
a heavy impact on the CPI in the early months of 1981.
WAGES, PRODUCTIVITY, AND INCOME SHARES

As discussed in Chapter 1, the primary goal of anti-inflation policy
during 1980 was to prevent the increase in oil prices from becoming
a stimulus to higher wage settlements. The policy was motivated by
the facts that the long-term behavior of prices of goods and services
closely reflects the behavior of business costs and that wages, salaries, and fringe benefits account for roughly two-thirds of the total




152

costs of production. The evidence suggests that while the policy was
partially successful, it was not able to prevent an acceleration of
wages. As shown in Table 20, all measures of labor compensation accelerated between 1979 and 1980 to a level of about 9 or 10 percent. The largest wage gains were in manufacturing, where average
hourly earnings grew 10.8 percent over the 12 months ending in December 1980. The smallest gains were in the construction industry
(7.2 percent over the same period).

Although acceleration in wages, salaries, and fringe benefits seems
to have taken place in both union and nonunion sectors, union wage
gains continued to exceed nonunion wage gains. Uncertainty exists as
to whether or not these results reflect the relative bargaining
strength of union over nonunion workers, as well as the extent to
which they mirror conditions specific to individual industries. These
differentials may also result from the more prevalent use of cost-ofliving adjustments (COLAs) in union contracts. To the extent that inflation is unanticipated, workers under contracts with COLAs will
tend to receive larger wage settlements than those without COLAs.
For this reason, sudden increases in inflation rates may tend to widen
union-nonunion wage differentials. Finally, the 1980 wage differentials may result from the fact that a number of important unions were
able to maintain wage gains even though aggregate labor markets
were slack. Major contracts were settled in 1980 in the aerospace,
steel, telephone, and clothing and apparel industries.
Despite the step-up in nominal wage increases, real wages continued to fall throughout 1980. However, as was pointed out in last
year's Report, customary calculations of the real wage which use the
CPI can be deceptive. Table 21 sets forth several calculations of real
wage change utilizing alternative price indexes.
The additional cost of imported energy was a major factor in real
wage declines in 1980, as it was in 1979. Increases in the price of




153

imported energy eventually will reduce real incomes in the United
States. This reduction must be achieved by some combination of
price inflation, wage moderation, or shrinking profit shares. Wage
bargaining aimed at preventing this can only transform the adjustment into a more inflationary one.

Incomes policies can help to moderate the inflationary response to
an oil-price increase, but only if business and labor cooperate to
achieve the necessary adjustment. Such a willingness supported the
Council on Wage and Price Stability (CWPS) standards program
through its first year, 1979. In that year, as was noted in the last
Report, evidence suggested that the standards had helped to restrain
wage inflation by 1 to IV2 percentage points. Since there was no evidence of widening profit margins, it appears that the CWPS program
contributed to smoothing the adjustment to higher oil prices. While
there is evidence that cooperation with the standards was also high in
its second year, a combination of several program features seems to
have reduced but not eliminated its impact. A widening of the allowable range of wage increase and an undervaluation of cost-of-living
adjustments in multiyear contracts were important factors.
Productivity

Productivity growth continued weak in 1980, advancing a tiny 0.1
percent over the year ending with the third quarter. In 1979 private
nonfarm business productivity had declined 1.1 percent.
During the course of 1980 productivity growth fluctuated sharply.
In the first quarter productivity was essentially unchanged. With the




154

sharp decline in output in the second quarter, productivity declined
at a rapid 3 percent annual rate. This marked the seventh consecutive quarterly drop. With the resumption of modest economic growth
in the third quarter, productivity rebounded sharply, rising at a 4
percent rate.
The faltering productivity during the first half of 1980, combined
with a more rapid rise in wages, resulted in an acceleration in unit
labor costs. However, with the improvement in productivity in the
third quarter, the increase in unit labor costs moderated substantially. For the year ending with the third quarter, unit labor costs rose 10
percent, a modest improvement from the increase recorded during
1979.
Distribution of National Income

The recession's impact was evident in the shifting distribution of
national income during 1980 (Table 22). Compensation of employees, which had averaged 74.6 percent of national income over the
years 1976-79, rose to 75.3 percent in 1980. This increase in the
share of national income going to wage earners is the normal pattern
in a recession. Employer contributions for social insurance continued
to account for a growing share of the compensation total. Corporate
profits and proprietors' income as a share of national income fell
sharply to 14.8 percent in 1980, down from the 17.1 percent average
share during 1976-79. The corporate profits share fell to 8.6 percent. The unusually high level of interest rates was responsible for
boosting the net interest share of national income to 8.5 percent, its
highest level in the postwar period. Net farm income fell in 1980
from its relatively high level in 1979. After adjusting for changes in
inventory, net income from farming was about $24 billion for the

year, 23 percent lower than in 1979. Net cash income, the cash available to farmers for capital expenditures and operator income, was
less affected and fell about 6 percent. The deceleration in cash receipts for livestock and continued inflation in farm production expenses were the principal factors in the decline.
ECONOMIC POLICY

As in 1979, economic policy in 1980 aimed at stemming an acceleration in prices and wages. Both fiscal and monetary policy sought
to restrain aggregate demand. As noted above, these policies were
supplemented by a program of voluntary standards for wage and
price behavior.
Fiscal Policy

Changes in the high-employment surplus (HES) are a useful measure of discretionary fiscal policy. The actual Federal budget deficit is
affected not only by changes in discretionary policy, such as changes
in tax rates or more rapid spending on defense programs, but also by
the state of the economy. In particular, cyclical swings in incomes
and employment affect tax receipts. Outlays for such programs as unemployment compensation and food stamps are similarly affected.
These changes in receipts and outlays alter the budget deficit without
any action by the Congress or the President. Thus, the actual surplus
or deficit is a poor measure of discretionary fiscal policy. The HES
measures what the surplus would be if the economy were at high employment. By evaluating the budget at a standard level of GNP, the
measure abstracts from those changes in budget receipts and outlays
that result from cyclical changes in GNP.
The High-Employment Budget. When judged by this measure, discretionary fiscal policy remained tight in 1979. The high-employment
surplus increased $13.5 billion in 1979 (Table 23). The chief factors
in the tightening were the sluggish pace of outlay growth during
1979 (particularly for grants-in-aid), the inflation-induced increases in
personal income taxes, and legislated increases in social insurance
taxes. Over the 4 quarters of 1980, however, the HES fell by $6.8
billion. Two unusual factors were responsible for the apparent move
toward expansion during 1980. First, the delayed effect on individual
tax refunds and final settlements from the Revenue Act of 1978 lowered the HES by roughly $8 billion, starting in the first quarter of
1980. Second, due to large increases in interest outlays caused by




156

record high interest rates during the year, discretionary outlay changes
appear larger than they actually were. By convention, interest payments are unadjusted in the calculation of high-employment outlays.
In other words, high-employment interest payments are defined to
be equal to actual interest payments. Thus, the high-employment surplus tends to understate the degree of discretionary fiscal restraint
when interest rates increase, and vice-versa. Excluding these two factors, the high-employment budget surplus actually tightened by
roughly $10 billion over the 4 quarters of 1980.

Budget Outlays and Receipts. Federal budget outlays for fiscal 1980
were $579 billion, an increase of $85 billion, or 17 percent over the
fiscal 1979 level. This marked acceleration in budget outlays was due
largely to the combined impact of higher interest rates, growing unemployment, and increases in the cost of entitlement programs due
to cost-of-living increases. Interest outlays jumped 23 percent in
fiscal 1980, while outlays for income security and health, which include social security, unemployment insurance, and other major Federal entitlement programs, grew 19 percent. Together these three
areasâ€”health, income security, and interestâ€”accounted for 61 percent of the change. In addition, defense outlays grew 17 percent in




157

fiscal 1980, up sharply from the 10 percent growth of the prior fiscal
year.
Federal budget receipts rose by 12 percent compared to 16 percent during fiscal 1979. The recession-induced weakness in incomes
and the delayed impact of the Revenue Act of 1978 on individual tax
refunds and final settlements combined to produce this result. Individual tax receipts grew 12 percent in fiscal 1980, down sharply from
the 20 percent fiscal 1979 gain. Corporate tax receipts fell 2 percent
in fiscal 1980. The Federal budget deficit increased from $28 billion
in fiscal 1979 to $59 billion in fiscal 1980.
Monetary Policy and Financial Markets

As discussed in Chapter 1, the Federal Reserve adopted a new procedure in October 1979 to guide its daily open market operations.
Under the new procedure, designed to exert better control over the
growth of the monetary aggregates, the Federal funds rate is allowed
to vary over a much wider range. In a report submitted to the Congress in February 1980, the Federal Reserve set forth its objectives
regarding increases in the money and credit aggregates during 1980
(Table 24). These ranges called for a deceleration in monetary expansion in 1980 from the preceding year.

Estimate for fourth quarter 1980 based on November data.
Note.â€”M-1A is currency plus private demand deposits, net of deposits due to foreign commercial banks and official
institutions.
M-1B is M-1A plus other checkable deposits (negotiable order of withdrawal accounts, accounts subject to automatic
transfer service, credit union share draft balances, and demand deposits at mutual savings banks).
M-2 is M-1B plus overnight repurchase agreements (RPs) issued by commercial banks, overnight Eurodollar deposits held by
U.S. nonbank residents at Caribbean branches of U.S. banks, money market mutual fund shares, and savings and small time
deposits at all depository institutions.
M-3 is M-2 plus large time deposits at all depository institutions and term RPs issued by commercial banks and savings and
loan associations.
Bank credit is total loans and investments plus loans sold at all commercial banks.

Except for M-1B, the rates of growth of the various monetary aggregates during the year roughly matched or exceeded their 1979
pace. Some of the relative movements in the various monetary aggregates in 1980 were the result of special factors. At the beginning of
the year the Federal Reserve had anticipated that funds attracted to




158

automatic transfer services (ATS) nationwide and negotiable order of
withdrawal (NOW) accounts in the Northeast would cause M-1A to
grow about one-half percentage point slower than M-1B. In fact,
more funds flowed into these accounts from both regular savings accounts and demand deposits than was originally forecast. These developments boosted M-1B growth and lowered M-1A growth, each
by about three-quarters of a percent relative to what they otherwise
would have been.
For the year as a whole M-1B, M-2, and M-3 exceeded their target
ranges while M-1A did fall within its range. However, if one adjusts
the target ranges for M-1A and M-1B in light of the actual experience with NOW and ATS accounts, then both of these measures fall
roughly at the upper end of the adjusted range.
Within the year, money growth, credit flows, and interest rates experienced unusually wide variations. The year began with money and
credit demands apparently accelerating despite the sharp increase in
interest rates in the fourth quarter of 1979. In February the growth
of money and credit surged, boosting demand for reserves above the
level consistent with the Federal Reserve's monetary growth ranges.
The resulting pressures in money markets, combined with deteriorating inflationary expectations, forced both short- and long-term rates
up sharply.
Data available in early March suggested that credit growth had not
been deterred by the general monetary tightening and the sharp increases in interest rates. Moreover, the increasing speculative activity
in financial and commodities markets raised concern among many in
the financial community about the threat of a financial panic. Extraordinary measures were called for to dampen excessive credit demands, reduce the spiraling inflationary expectations, and ease the
strains in financial markets.
On March 14 the President announced an extensive anti-inflation
plan that included authorizing the Federal Reserve Board to implement certain types of credit controls under the provisions of the
Credit Control Act of 1969. Operating under its own authority, the
Federal Reserve also introduced a voluntary credit restraint program
and tightened some already existing regulations, as detailed below.
Taken together, the credit restraints were intended to reinforce traditional monetary policy measures that control overall money and
credit growth while limiting the burden on certain sectors hard hit by
high interest rates. Those sectors included small businesses, farmers,
home buyers and builders, and auto dealers and purchasers.
The measures were designed to restrain the growth of certain
types of consumer credit as well as those liabilities of large banks that
had been used to support a rapid buildjup in business loans. These




159

actions included: (1) a requirement that all types of lenders maintain
on deposit at a Federal Reserve Bank a certain percentage of increases in credit card lending and otfrer categories of unsecured consumer credit; (2) an increase in the marginal reserve requirement on
managed liabilitiesâ€”including large time deposits ($100,000 or
larger) with maturities of less than a year, Eurodollar borrowings,
and security repurchase agreementsâ€”of large member banks and
U.S. branches and agencies of large foreign banks; (3) an extension
of special deposit requirements to increases in managed liabilities of
large nonmember banks and to increases in total assets of moneymarket mutual funds; and (4) a surcharge of 3 percentage points on
frequent borrowing by large member banks from Federal Reserve
Banks. In addition, the Board announced a voluntary program under
which commercial banks and finance companies would limit the
growth in total loans to U.S. customers to 6 to 9 percent for the
period from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980.
Expansion of credit and money slowed abruptly after these measures were announced. The reaction of financial institutions, households, and businesses was sharper than anticipated. Banks and other
financial institutions responded by accelerating and intensifying
measures to restrict credit availability already in train; consumers and
business sharply altered their credit behavior. Credit card sales and
applications dropped off abruptly in March. Consumer installment
credit outstanding declined in April for the first time in 5 years.
Commercial bank lending to businesses moderated in March and
then declined for the next 3 months. Over this same period the pace
of monetary expansion slowed. During April all the monetary aggregates actually fell below their target ranges. The narrower aggregates
declined for the second quarter as a whole.
As evidence mounted that credit growth had been arrested, the
Federal Reserve began to relax various provisions of the program. In
early July the Board ended the program entirely, and the President
revoked the Board's authority under the Credit Control Act.
In retrospect, it appears that another factor contributing to the
abrupt decline in credit growth was that interest rates finally had
reached levels in late February and early March which were sufficient
to discourage borrowing. However, data available at the time did not
show this development. For example, business loans at large banks
had increased rapidly from December to mid-February, in part due to
borrowing in anticipation of the rumored adoption of credit controls,
but in late February and early March business borrowing from these
large banks stagnatedâ€”a pattern that could not be discerned until
late March. Similarly, new home sales fell slightly in February and




160

plunged in March, although the only information available in early
March had shown that sales advanced in January.
The mid-March announcement of credit controls did not immediately break the upward spiral in interest rates. In late March and
early April the Federal funds rate came within a few basis points of
20 percent, and rates on most short-term and long-term market instruments rose to record highs before falling sharply over the course
of the second quarter. The Federal funds rate fell faster than other
short-term market rates from April to mid-June, but the funds rate
then stabilized for the next 2 months at around 9 percent. During
this period there were occasions when the Federal Reserve kept the
Federal funds rate from falling below the 8V2 percent lower bound
set in May by the Federal Open Market Committee. Longer-term
rates also declined as the spiral of inflationary expectations apparently was reversed in light of the growing slack in the economy and the
weakness in the monetary aggregates. Downward adjustments in administered rates, like the prime rate and home mortgage rates,
lagged the declines in market yields.
The downswing in most interest rates ended in June and July as
monetary aggregates accelerated and credit demands again surged.
The Federal Reserve did not accommodate the strong demand for
bank reserves associated with acceleration of the monetary aggregates through the summer and fall, and the rate of expansion of adjusted nonborrowed reserves slowed from 31 percent at an annual
rate in the second quarter to 4 percent in the third. Meanwhile, between late August and early December the discount rate was raised in
three steps to 13 percent, and the Federal Reserve reimposed an additional surcharge on frequent borrowings by large banks. The Federal funds rate increased to over 20 percent in December. Other
short-term market rates followed this upward climb. The prime rate
adjusted more rapidly on the upswing than it had when rates had
come down earlier in the year. Long-term rates, responding once
again to continued inflationary pressures, reached rates at the end of
the year near or above their March-April peaks. In mid-December
short-term interest rates reached new peaks and began to fall rapidly
once again. By early January the commercial paper rate, for instance,
had fallen 3% percentage points from its mid-December peak. Longterm interest rates fell about 1V4 percentage points over the same
period.
The volatile movements of the narrow monetary aggregates over
the course of the year reflected in part the pattern of economic activity. But the atypical behavior of the demand for money during 1980
also contributed to this volatility. As noted in Chapter 1, the demand
for moneyâ€”which is used by economists to characterize the relation-




161

ship among money, interest rates, and economic activityâ€”has shown
a tendency toward abrupt shifts in recent years. In particular, such
shifts in 1975 and in 1976 led to monetary growth in the narrower
aggregates, M-1A and M-1B, that was well below that expected on
the basis of the historical relationship between money, income, and
interest rates. While not fully understood, such shifts have followed
rapid increases in interest rates to record levels, which appear to
induce firms and households to adopt cash-economizing financial innovations. (These were discussed in detail in the 1978 Report.)
In the second quarter of 1980 another shift in money demand apparently took place. Declines in M-1A and M-1B were greater than
would have been expected even in the face of the sharp fall-off in
economic activity and high interest rates. But the current episode appears to differ somewhat from the previous shifts in that this time the
shift was largely offset in the subsequent 2 quarters. This offset suggests that some special factors may have been at work. One
hypothesis is that the imposition of credit controls may have
temporarily led holders of currency and demand deposits to draw
down these balances in the second quarter. With the end of the controls program in July this temporary depressant disappeared, and
households were able to rebuild their cash balances. Whether this explanation is correct or not, it seems likely that a temporary moneydemand shift contributed to the pattern of a decline in the money
supply in the second quarter followed by an unusually rapid money
growth in the second half of the year.
Thrift Institutions. In the first quarter of 1980, deposit flows to thrift
institutionsâ€”mutual savings banks and savings and loan associationsâ€”slowed to the lowest rate since the fall of 1974. But after
market interest rates peaked in late March and early April thrift deposits once more began to expand at the healthier pace registered in
the preceding year. From December through April the decline in
thrift deposit flows was softened by an inflow of funds attracted to
the variable rate instruments offered to saversâ€”the 6-month money
market certificates (MMCs) and the new 2V2-year small saver certificates (SSCs). For the next 5 months, however, there were net withdrawals of MMCs as depositors shifted funds into the higher yielding
SSCs. From April to July funds were also shifted into money market
mutual funds, where the technical method for calculating return gave
these funds a temporary yield advantage over MMCs. By October
MMCs had resumed healthy expansion, and for the first 11 months
of the year MMCs and SSCs at thrift institutions together grew by
$115 billion.
The other major sources of funds for thrifts also had interest costs
tied to market rates. Members of the Federal Home Loan Bank




162

(FHLB) System increased their borrowing from the FHLB by over $7
billion to a level of about $47 billion. Many large institutions also
augmented their small-account deposit flows by issuing "jumbo"
($100,000 or larger) certificates of deposit. Small denomination accounts with interest rates fixed by regulation experienced net withdrawals throughout the year. By the end of 1980 these fixed-ceiling
deposits accounted for just over half of total thrift deposits, compared to roughly two-thirds at the end of 1979.
While the new deposit instruments and FHLB borrowings helped
the thrifts sustain asset growth by allowing them to compete for
funds at market interest rates, this new-found competitive status was
achieved at considerable peril to the short-run profitability of these
institutions. For much of last year the interest cost on such funds was
well above the return on the longer-term asset portfolios, thereby de-pressingTHrift industry profits.
In an environment of growing uncertainty regarding the direction
of interest rates and their ability to sustain deposit flows, thrifts apparently became somewhat more cautious in their asset management
in early 1980. When high interest rates curtailed deposit inflows in
earlier cycles, thrifts generally sustained their mortgage lending activity by selling off their liquid asset portfolios. From March to May
1980, however, savings and loans (S&Ls) reduced their home mortgage commitments at a record rate but continued to acquire liquid
assets. The percentage of assets held by insured S&Ls in liquid instruments actually increased over most of 1980â€”an unprecedented
development in a period of weak deposit flows.
Home mortgage commitments rebounded sharply from June
through September following the declines in interest rates and the
resumption of deposit flows. In the fourth quarter commitments fell off
slightly as rising mortgage interest rates once again led to a reduction
in housing sales.
Credit Flows. Credit extended to the nonfinancial sectors of the
economy during the first 3 quarters of 1980 was well below the pace
of the preceding year, even though Federal borrowing doubled.
Funds raised by private nonfinancial borrowers (including State and
local governments) plummeted in the second quarter in the face of
high costs, restricted credit availability, and the recession-induced reduction in demand. While private credit flows rebounded somewhat
in the third quarter, they continued to lag behind the 1979 pace.
The household sector experienced the sharpest reduction in borrowing during 1980. In late 1979 the ratio of consumer installment
and mortgage credit repayments to disposable personal incomeâ€”a
common measure of the burden of household debtâ€”reached its historical peak. Thereafter, the rate of increase of these household debt




163

categories gradually abated through the first quarter of 1980. As reported earlier, the credit controls program induced consumers to
reduce their installment debt sharply in the second quarter, and their
rate of mortgage borrowing nearly halved. Even with some recovery
of borrowing in the third quarter, required household debt repayments as a percent of disposable personal income continued to fall
throughout 1980. At year-end this measure of household debt burdens was well below the mid-1979 peak. Moreover, real financial net
worth per capita rose over the year. Taken together, these trends
suggest that the household debt burden may not be as serious a constraint on consumer spending in 1981 as it was in late 1979 and
1980.
Borrowing by nonfinancial businesses followed a pattern similar to
that of the household sector, though not as severe. Second quarter
borrowing fell much more sharply than the decline in the financing
gap (the excess of capital expenditures, including inventory accumulation, over internally generated funds), as businesses liquidated
some of the short-term assets built up over the previous 3 quarters.
In the third quarter businesses once again began to increase their
liquid asset portfolios, and corporate borrowing increased despite a
further reduction in the financing gap. Corporations took advantage
of the precipitous drop in long-term rates in May and June by issuing
a record volume of long-term bonds, but when long-term rates
moved upward later in the summer they returned to short-term
credit expansion to meet their financing needs.
The liquidity positions of nonfinancial corporations have deteriorated significantly since 1976, when the ratios of liquid assets and
long-term debt to short-term debt reached their cyclical highs. By the
end of the second quarter of 1980 the corporate liquidity ratio
(liquid assets relative to short-term debt) had reached an all-time
low, and long-term debt as a percent of total debt was considerably
lower than the previous low reached in early 1975. Historically, businesses have tended to restore their liquidity and move to a healthier
balance in their liability structures near the end of recessions, when
reduced credit needs and lower long-term rates allow them to liquidate their short-term borrowing and extend the maturity of their liability structure. This time, however, the sharper-than-usual increases
in interest rates have attenuated this normal restructuring process
and threaten to induce further deterioration of the financial health of
corporations in 1981.

THE PROSPECTS FOR 1981 AND 1982
In 1981 the economy should continue its modest recovery from the
1980 recession. Real growth is projected to be about 1% percent
over the 4 quarters of the year, with virtually all of it coming in the
last 2 quarters. Although both employment and the labor force are
expected to rise about Wz million during the year, the labor force
gain is likely to be a shade larger. In consequence, the unemployment at year-end 1981 is anticipated to be slightly above its current
level. The overall rate of inflation is forecast to be little changed
from its 1980 pace. Given public concern with inflation, both fiscal
and monetary policy are expected to be a restraining influence on
economic activity in 1981 and beyond. However, there is both need
and room for a prudently designed tax cut which would be phased in
gradually over the next 2 years.
Over the 4 quarters of 1982 real growth is expected to be 3Vz percent, with the proposed tax cuts providing significant stimulus. The
somewhat faster pace of economic activity should yield employment
gains of roughly 2 million during the year. The unemployment rate is
expected to decline gradually throughout 1982. The continued moderation in economic activity is projected to produce a slowing in the
overall rate of inflation of about Wz percentage points during 1982.
FISCAL POLICY

The forecast presented below is based on the economic policy
measures described in the 1982 budget. In fiscal 1981 Federal outlays are projected to be $662.7 billion. This amounts to a 14 percent
increase, a slowdown from the 17 percent growth in fiscal 1980. A
further slowdown is projected in fiscal 1982, with outlays rising 12
percent to $739.3 billion. Most of the increase in Federal outlays
over the 2 years stems from the effects of inflation. Adjusted for inflation, total outlays will increase about 2 percent, with sizable real
gains in defense spending partially offset by declines in nondefense
spending.
In fiscal 1981 receipts are projected to be $607.5 billion, rising to
$711.8 billion in fiscal 1982. Both these receipts, and to a lesser
extent expenditures, reflect the President's proposed Economic Revitalization Program (ERP), designed to moderate the rise of tax burdens and provide incentives for business capital investment. The
budget cost of the program is $3.3 billion in fiscal 1981, rising to
$22.5 billion in fiscal 1982. The fiscal 1982 budget also includes a
proposal to increase the Federal tax on motor fuels by 10 cents per
gallon on June 1, 198L Thereafter, the tax per gallon would increase
with inflation. The proposed increase in the motor fuels tax is expected




165

to yield approximately $13 billion in fiscal 1982 and larger amounts
thereafter.
The tax reductions embodied in the ERP will not totally offset increases in other taxes. Social security taxes, the windfall profits tax
on oil company revenues, and inflation-induced increases in personal
taxes will combine with the proposed motor fuels tax and withholding of tax on interest and dividends to produce a rising tax burden in
1981 and 1982 despite the ERP. In addition, even with the budgeted
acceleration in defense spending and continued increases in interest
outlays, overall growth in Federal spending will be relatively modest
in real terms. Thus, the high-employment surplus is expected to increase substantially in both 1981 and 1982, helping to moderate
demand and lower inflation.
The Economic Revitalization Program

The major focus of the ERP is on increasing investment and encouraging innovation. Depreciation rules would be both liberalized
and simplified under the plan. This would increase the rate of return
on new investment and the cash flow of firms making investments.
The program would also make the current investment tax credit
(ITC) partially refundable. The ITG and accelerated depreciation
proposals would be retroactive to January 1, 1981. These two proposals are explained in detail in Chapter 1.
To shift additional national resources into investment, a largerthan-usual share of the funds available for tax reduction will have to
be devoted to investment incentives. But some other forms of tax
relief are both feasible and desirable. The President's program proposes three principal areas of such relief. First, individuals and employers would receive an income tax credit sufficient to offset the rise
in social security taxes which took place at the start of the year. This
type of tax cut was chosen because it not only would reduce tax burdens but also lower business costs and thus help modestly with our
inflation problem. Second, for workers who face a growing social security tax burden but earn too little to pay income taxes, the program would expand the earned income tax credit. This would more
than offset the increase in social security taxes for our lowest-paid
workers. Third, the program proposes a phased reduction in the tax
burden on two-earner families by reducing the so-called "marriage
penalty" that taxes married couples with roughly equal incomes at
rates higher than unmarried couples with the same incomes.
These reductions in individual income taxes would not become effective until January 1, 1982. The program, as originally proposed in
August 1980, had provided for implementation of these tax cuts immediately upon passage. The delay in the effective date is dictated by
budgetary prudence and the desire to avoid rekindling inflationary




166

expectations. Of course, if the economy should weaken seriously
during 1981, the Congress would have reason to advance the effective date of these tax cuts.
MONETARY POLICY

In July 1980 the Federal Reserve tentatively set its monetary aggregate growth target ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of
1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 generally one-half percentage
point below the previous year's targets (Table 24). As discussed in
Chapter 1, this reduction is intended to provide sustained monetary
restraint consistent with an eventual return to price stability. There is
little doubt that these target ranges will restrain the economy in
1981, but the amount of that restraint is less certain.
A rough method of assessing the restrictiveness of monetary policy
in the period ahead is the increase in velocity implied by keeping
monetary growth within the target ranges while still supporting expansion of nominal GNP sufficient to permit a modest recovery from
the 1980 recession. Given the likelihood that inflation will sustain
considerable momentum over the year, the implied increases in the
velocities of the key monetary aggregates are well above the longterm historical averages. Historically, such large increases in velocity
have been associated with a substantial rise in interest rates, a rise
that could threaten the prospects for a moderate economic recovery
in 1981.
Several potential developments during 1981 could alter the degree
of monetary restraint implied by the money growth targets. First, as
discussed earlier, in 1975 and 1976 there were sizable shifts in the
demand for money in a direction that tended to increase velocity and
thus accommodate more nominal GNP growth for a given monetary
growth. One factor thought by many to be associated with the earlier
shiftsâ€”a rapid runup in interest rates piercing previous peak levelsâ€”
occurred in late 1980. While a money-demand shift cannot be predicted with any confidence for 1981, the possibility that another shift
may materialize raises the difficulty of interpreting the degree of restrictiveness of the money growth ranges.
In addition, the introduction of NOW accounts on a nationwide
basis in January will alter to some degree the relationships among
the various aggregates and their relationship to economic activity.
Shifts out of demand deposits into NOWs will depress the rate of
growth of M-1A. On the other hand, NOW accounts probably will
attract some savings deposits and other interest-bearing deposits,
thereby boosting M-1B. The degree of the shift into NOW accounts
will depend on the aggressiveness with which depository institutions
price these new instruments and promote them, as well as on the
public response. Partly oh the basis of NOW account growth in New




167

England, the Federal Reserve has adjusted the midpoints of the
target ranges for these narrow aggregates in an attempt to account
for these structural changes (Table 24). But whether the adjusted targets will in fact yield the same degree of monetary restrictiveness in
1981 as the announced unadjusted targets would have yielded in the
absence of nationwide NOWs is unknown.
Shifts into NOWs from demand and most interest-bearing deposit
categories at banks and thrifts will have no impact on the rates of expansion of M-2 and M-3. However, other financial developments
could influence their growth patterns. In particular, there is considerable uncertainty about whether money-market mutual funds and the
variable rate SSCsâ€”both of which are included in M-2 and M-3â€”
will continue their unusually rapid growth in 1981. There is also uncertainty as to whether these instruments will draw funds from deposit categories in M-2 and M-3 or from sources not included in
these broader aggregates.
Finally, several technical problems associated with the Monetary
Control Act of 1980 will confront the Federal Reserve in 1981, further complicating the implementation of monetary policy. As discussed in Chapter 2, the act requires a sweeping restructuring of reserve requirements and extends both reserve requirements and
access to the discount window to nonmember banks and thrift institutions. It will take some time for these institutions to develop a
stable pattern of reserve management and borrowing behavior.
During this transition period the Federal Reserve will find it more
difficult than usual to predict borrowings, excess reserves, and other
reserve measures. Thus, the relationship between reserves and
money, which is the key to controlling money growth, will probably
be less certain during 1981 and perhaps over a longer period.
In the face of all these technical difficulties and uncertainties, the
danger in rigidly keeping the growth of M-1A, M-1B, or any single
monetary aggregate within a narrow preset range regardless of other
developments is obvious. With the long-run monetary growth ranges
for 1981 already implying considerable tightness, there is a great risk
that developments unrelated to the basic course of economic activity
could artificially boost the growth rates of some of the aggregates
and induce excessive monetary stringency. The Federal Reserve has
attempted to account for the structural changes by adjusting the
ranges for the narrow aggregates. Another option could be to place
more emphasis on the broader aggregates like M-2, which are unlikely to be so greatly affected by the structural changes. An additional
adjustment that would reflect the greater uncertainty of financial relationships in 1981 would be to widen the limits of the longer-run
ranges.




168

The uncertainty of developments in 1981 calls for flexible response
on the part of monetary policy. Since the Federal Reserve began announcing its longer-run targets in 1975, it has been understood that
"The longer-run ranges will be reconsidered as conditions warrant."
In 1981, this statement assumes even greater importance than usual.
WORLD AND DOMESTIC OIL MARKETS

As has been the case in the recent past, developments in world oil
markets will continue to influence U.S. inflation and growth. World
oil demand is likely to remain weak during 1981 due to the sluggish
pace of economic activity in the industrialized nations and the continued adjustment to 1979's rapid increase in oil prices. In addition, oil
inventories, which prior to the outbreak of the war between Iran and
Iraq were very high by historical standards, may still insulate the consuming nations from limited supply disruptions. Nevertheless, even
with these elements tending to limit price pressures, the price of imported oil is expected to increase somewhat faster than inflation in
1981 and 1982.
Decontrol of U.S. oil prices will bring still sharper increases in domestic oil prices during 1981. In November 1980 the average price
of domestic oil was about $28 per barrel. That price will rise to the
world market level by October 1981, at which time the price is expected to be in the neighborhood of $40 per barrel.
The total burden to U.S. consumers of the relative price increases
in oil during 1981 is expected to reach about $30 billion by the end
of the year. The bulk of this will go to the Federal Government in
the form of higher receipts from the windfall profits tax and increased revenues from corporate taxes on the profits of oil companies. This increase in Federal revenues is one source of the estimated
increase in the high-employment surplus during 1981. Of the remaining total, roughly $3 billion will accrue to foreign producers and
about $8 billion to domestic producers. Some small fraction of these
amounts will be respent in the United States in 1981, but the economic drag caused by the increase in oil prices during 1981 will still
amount to roughly $10 billion.
THE ECONOMIC FORECAST

The economy has now experienced 2 quarters of moderate real
growth following the sharp decline in the second quarter of 1980. At
the same time there was a rapid runup in interest rates through midDecember. While significant declines in interest rates were recorded
thereafter, the effects of taut financial conditions during 1980 are
likely to weaken the pace of recovery during the first half of 1981.
These weak conditions should be particularly evident in housing and
in spending for consumer durables. Overall, it is likely that real GNP




169

will be essentially flat in the first half of the year, with a distinct possibility of 1 quarter of actual decline.
After midyear the pace of activity should pick up, although by historical standards growth will remain modest for a period of recovery
(Table 25). The restrictive stance of monetary and fiscal policy will
contribute to this result. In addition, consumers' real incomes will be
restrained by rising oil prices. Over the 4 quarters of 1981 the combination of fiscal and oil-price imposed restraint is estimated to rise
by about $60 billion, or 2 percent of GNP.

As the economy moves into 1982 it should maintain the momentum of the last half of 1981. Business fixed investment is expected to
be a particular source of strength because of the proposed tax incentives for capital spending.
Consumer Expenditures

Consumer spending in 1981 will be constrained by sluggish growth
in after-tax income due in part to inflation-induced increases in effective personal tax rates and the step-up in social security taxes. Overall, real after-tax incomes will show only a very small gain. Rising
energy prices will also continue to put pressure on consumer purchasing power. As a consequence, consumer spending is projected to
grow less rapidly than real GNP during 1981.
Last year the personal saving rate rose somewhat, ending the year
at 5% percent. Over the last 4 years the saving rate has averaged a
shade under SVfe percent, roughly 2 percentage points below the
average of the preceding 10 years. Nevertheless, the attempt to maintain living standards in the face of sluggish income growth is likely to




170

produce a slight decline in the saving rate during 1981. Despite this,
real consumer purchases of goods and services are only projected to
rise by slightly more than 1 percent over the 4 quarters of 1981.
Consumer spending is expected to be particularly sluggish in the
first half of the year. Purchases of autos and other credit-sensitive
goods are likely to be the most affected, leading to a decline in durables spending during 1981. In contrast, expenditures by consumers
on both nondurable goods and services are projected to rise during
the year. A somewhat healthier growth in real consumer spending
should be evident in 1982 partly due to the gains in disposable incomes that will follow the personal tax cuts proposed for the start of
that year.
Business Fixed Investment

Surveys of capital spending plans by business for 1981 are currently showing surprising strength. One private survey indicates that for
1981 as a whole real spending on plant and equipment will increase
2 percent. The most recent Department of Commerce survey is
slightly less optimistic, suggesting that business plans to increase real
investment outlays by about 1 percent. The year-over-year increase
indicated by these surveys would involve vigorous gains in investment during 1981.
These surveys need to be interpreted with, caution. Business spending plans tend to be revised downward when the economy weakens,
as it is projected to do in the first half of 1981. Thus despite the surveys, some continued weakness is expected during the first half of
1981. However, business capital spending should begin accelerating
in the second half of 1981. An important source of this growth will
be the proposed liberalization of both depreciation allowances and
the investment tax credit. These are assumed to go into effect in
mid-1981, retroactive to the start of the year. But given the lags in
the investment process, these tax incentives should have their major
impact in 1982 and beyond. Indeed, real business capital spending
during 1982 is expected to increase substantially faster than real
GNP. One further reason for the strength in this sector is the marked
increase in capital spending anticipated in the energy industry.
Housing

During the last several months of 1980 the short-term prospects
for the housing market worsened somewhat. After the swift rebound
during the summer, housing starts leveled off at roughly a 1.55-million unit annual rate for September through November. Many observers were surprised that housing starts were maintained at that
level, especially in November, in light of very high and rising interest
rates. Part of the explanation appears to be that multifamily startsâ€”




171

which increased from September to Novemberâ€”were bolstered
somewhat by Federal subsidy programs. Single-family starts declined
during this period partly due to a reduction in the rate of new home
sales in September and October, but sales unexpectedly turned up
slightly in November despite a rise in mortgage rates to 14 percent
and above.
The high mortgage rates that are likely to prevail during much of
1981 will delay any further rebound in homebuilding activity. At current interest rates, many potential home buyersâ€”especially those
looking for their first homeâ€”cannot afford the required monthly
mortgage payments. Nevertheless, with the continued high rate of
household formation by the postwar baby-boom generation and the
tax advantages of homeownership, potential housing demand is quite
strong. Moreover, new financing arrangements may help reduce the
problems of affordability. Thrift institutions are now offering several
versions of the graduated-payment mortgage and have begun to offer
shared-appreciation mortgages in which the lender receives an equity
interest in the house in exchange for lower mortgage rates. In addition, there have been reports of homebuilders offering to meet part
of the buyer's monthly mortgage payments in exchange for a higher
sales price.
These factors suggest that housing starts may fall somewhat during
the first half of 1981 in response to high mortgage rates. But thereafter, growing housing demand and the further development of innovative financing arrangements should lead to some rebound in homebuilding even if interest rates remain high. By the end of 1981 housing starts are expected to be in the range of 1.5 to 1.7 million units,
with further gains probable during 1982.
Inventories

As observed above, recent inventory behavior has been noteworthy
for its relatively quick adjustment to changes in final sales. As a consequence, unlike previous periods of recession and recovery, there
has been no major inventory cycle this time around. Over the coming
months the sluggish pace of economic activity will create continued
pressure for moderation in inventory accumulation. In addition, the
current high level of interest rates provides an additional incentive to
hold down inventories. This suggests that inventory investment will
be quite modest in the first half of 1981 and should gradually gain
thereafter, roughly in line with sales, as economic growth quickens.
The Foreign Sector

The pattern of economic growth projected for the other industrial
countries is quite similar to the one projected for the United States:
very slow growth in the first half of this year, followed by somewhat




172

more rapid growth thereafter. During this year and next, growth
abroad is likely to average between 2 and 3 percentâ€”roughly comparable to average growth in this country. As a result of this similarity
in growth patterns, net exports are not expected to show major
swings over the coming 2 years. From the fourth quarter of 1980 to
the end of 1982 a modest decline in net exportsâ€”about $2 billion in
constant dollarsâ€”is projected. This decline will result primarily from
a somewhat more rapid rise in import volumes than in export volumes, although neither of these is projected to grow very strongly.
Some loss in U.S. competitiveness is implicit in these projections.
American goods are likely to become somewhat more expensive in
relation to foreign goods, both because of somewhat higher inflation
in the United States and because of the strength of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The strength of the dollar is likely to persist
so long as interest rates in the United States remain high relative to
interest rates abroad and if, as predicted, the U.S. current account
remains in surplus. While the surplus is projected to diminish somewhat during the course of 1981 from the very high level reached in
the second half of 1980, it should remain large through 1982 in the
absence of any future oil-price shock.
Government Purchases

Real Federal purchases are projected to increase by about 3*A percent during the course of 1981, and by a smaller amount in 1982.
During both years real defense purchases are anticipated to increase
substantially, offsetting projected declines in real nondefense purchases.
State and local government spending in real terms fell in 1980 and
is forecast to decline again during 1981. The economy's sluggish
growth, continued taxpayer resistance to new spending programs,
and budget tightness will serve to hold down spending. With the resumption of healthier economic growth in 1982, State and local government purchases are expected to increase in real terms, although
substantially more slowly than GNP.
Employment and Unemployment

Employment is likely to increase by slightly less than IV2 percent
during 1981 and, with the pickup in economic activity in the following year, to advance by a shade more than 2 percent during 1982.
Growth in the labor force is projected to average about 1% percent over the next 2 years, advancing at a somewhat slower rate in
1981 and speeding up in 1982. This pace is in line with average
annual growth over the last 30 years, although it does represent a
distinct slowdown from the 2x/z percent annual gain recorded in the
1970s.




173

These projections for employment and the labor force imply that
the unemployment rate at year-end 1981 will be between 7V% and 7%
percent, although it is likely to be above this range in the early part
of 1981. During 1982 the unemployment rate is projected to decline
steadily, ending the year in the range of 7Vi to 7V2 percent.
Wage and Price Developments

Wages and prices should decelerate over the next several years.
Several factors will be at work. With both fiscal and monetary policy
aimed at continued restraint in aggregate demand, the prospects are
for modest economic growth through 1982. These developments
should limit demand relative to supply in both labor and product
markets, gradually reduce inflationary expectations, and ultimately
yield a better wage and price performance. At the same time, expanded tax incentives will spur investment and thus improve productivity growth. This too should contribute to moderating wage and
price increases.
As discussed in Chapter 1, however, reducing inflation via demand
restraint and increased productivity does not yield quick results. Furthermore, a number of factors will serve to keep inflation relatively
high in the near future. These will include higher food price inflation, the recent increases in social security taxes and the minimum
wage, and the continued rise in energy prices resulting from further
oil-price increases and the decontrol of domestic energy prices.
These factors suggest that wage and price increases during 1981 may
nearly match those recorded in 1980.
Wages and Unit Labor Costs. After showing moderation through most
of 1979, wage rates accelerated last year. While the relatively slack
labor market will limit further wage acceleration this year, there is
unlikely to be any noticeable slowdown. Both oil and food prices will
rise sharply in 1981, maintaining the pressure for sizable wage gains.
But by 1982, with continued restraint in aggregate demand and
lower food- and oil-price rises (decontrol will be completed), the rate
of pay increase should diminish, returning to the vicinity of wa^e
gains seen in 1979.
Private wages and fringe benefits are projected to increase 10 to
lOVfe percent during 1981. In addition, the jump in payroll taxes
which occurred on January 1, 1981 added slightly over one-half percent to the level of compensation. As a result, increases in total
hourly compensation should average about lOVa to 11 percent over
the 4 quarters of 1981, with a large bulge in the first quarter. With
only a modest boost in payroll taxes scheduled for 1982, the rate of
increase in total hourly payroll costs should slow noticeably.
In the face of sluggish economic activity in the first half of 1981,
productivity could well record a slight decline. Thereafter, with the




174

reemergence of modest but sustained economic growth, productivity
is projected to increase slightly faster than its underlying trend rate
of 1 to IV2 percent. This productivity performance, in conjunction
with the slowdown in the increase in hourly compensation projected
for late 1981 and into 1982, should substantially moderate increases
in unit labor costs.
Product Prices. The large share of wage and salary payments in total
business costs makes the advance of unit labor costs a fundamental
determinant of the trend increase in product prices. Thus, the prospects for product prices basically mirror those for unit labor costs,
with the overall rate of price inflation as measured by the GNP deflator expected to be noticeably improved by 1982. Over the 4 quarters
of 1982 the overall inflation rate is expected to drop to about 8%
percent. During 1981, however, the rise in the deflator should roughly match the 1980 increase of 10 percent. Adoption of the motor fuels
tax could add another one-fourth to one-half percentage point to
growth in the deflator. The near-term projection for inflation reflects
developments in energy discussed above and agricultural markets,
which deserve special attention.
Food Prices. Significantly higher prices for food are anticipated for
1981, with a rise of about 12 percent likely. The production adjustments already underway by meat producers, together with the effects
of the summer-long drought, will exert upward pressure on commodity prices. Continued increases in energy costs and labor wage rates
imply that food marketing costs will increase at about the rate of general inflation.
Meat price increases will probably be most visible to the average
consumer. After 5 years of steady increase, pork production is expected to fall 6 to 8 percent. Beef production is likely to be only
slightly higher than its low level in 1980. Live animal prices are forecast to be much higher than in 1980. High prices (and limited supplies) of feedgrains will limit increases in poultry production. Meat
supplies will also be tight on a world scale. While the seasonal pattern of the 1981 meat price increase is still in doubt, it appears that
retail meat prices will rise most notably from April through August
before stabilizing (and perhaps declining) late in the year. Crop conditions in the United States and worldwide will determine this pattern. Generally poor crop conditions early in the year could push
grain prices much higher. Under these conditions, retail meat prices
would be lower in the first half (as herds are liquidated) but higher in
the second half than is now expected.
Agricultural conditions also point to higher prices for most other
food items during 1981. Commodity price increases resulting from




175

the drought in 1980 will be reflected in food prices during most of
1981.
The Consumer Price Index. The CPI merits special attention because
of its high visibility and its key role in the indexing of both wage contracts and benefit levels under Federal entitlement programs. The
CPI is expected to increase by \2x/z percent over the 4 quarters of
1981, with roughly one-half percentage point of this increase accounted for by the proposed increase in the motor fuels tax. This increase, which is roughly the same as was registered during 1980, is
about 2 percentage points higher than the increase forecast for the
GNP deflator. Among other reasons for this difference, the CPI is
more sensitive to increases in oil and food prices. Further, mortgage
interest rates have no direct effect on the deflator. Although the increase in the CPI in 1981 is likely to match the 1980 increase, the
first quarter of the year is likely to see a surge of inflation in the CPI
due to already recorded mortgage interest rate increases. After this
effect has passed the outlook is for improvement during the remainder of the year and continuing through 1982. During 1982 CPI inflation is expected to decline to about 9 Vz percent.
Uncertainties in the Outlook

Among the various uncertainties in the outlook, two deserve particular attention: the possibility of a serious collision between the
demand for funds and the monetary targets of the Federal Reserve,
and the possibility of sharply higher oil prices should the continued
loss of Iraqi and Iranian oil, or some other shock, tighten oil markets.
Interest rates now appear to have peaked in mid-December of last
year. Most short-term rates have already fallen sharply, some by as
much as 3V2 percentage points. While long-term interest rates have
fallen by much smaller amounts, the peaks in these rates also seem to
have passed. But additional dramatic declinesâ€”like those of last
springâ€”are not likely this year. There remains considerable uncertainty as to what the Federal Reserve's operating targets imply for
the path of interest rates between now and the end of 1982. Furthermore, interest rates are still unusually high for the early stages of a
recovery. Should rates surge upward again, it is likely that housing
and other interest-sensitive sectors would suffer serious setbacks. In
this event, weakness in economic activity could continue past midyear, and the rise in the unemployment rate might continue throughout the year.
A second risk is the possibility of a major hike in oil prices. Such a
shock would contribute significantly to inflationary pressures at the
same time that it would depress real economic activity and drive up
the unemployment rate. The precise quantitative effects of such a




176

hike would depend on many factors, including the response of the
Federal Reserve. Under plausible assumptions, if in early 1981 the
world market price of oil were to rise $10 per barrel above that already assumed, then by year-end this would add about 2 percentage
points to the inflation rate and reduce the growth of real GNP from
what it otherwise would have been by 2 percentage points. Some
further effects would be felt in 1982, and by year-end the unemployment rate would be about 1 percentage point higher than it would
have been without this increase in oil prices.
While the two major uncertainties in the outlook raise the possibility that the recovery will be weaker than forecast, a stronger recovery
is entirely possible. Any improvement in the outlook must have at its
core a reduction in the rate of inflation. A better inflation performance could result from several causes, the chief among them being
improved productivity, more moderate wage gains, or favorable crop
developments. If, for example, that part of the slowdown in productivity which had remained ^a bit of mystery were to reverse itself, the
outlook for business costs and prices could be greatly improved. Reductions in inflationary expectations would follow, reinforcing the
direct effects of the productivity improvement. Presuming the Federal Reserve maintained its monetary targets, the improved inflation
outlook would tend to reduce interest rates and generally ease conditions in financial markets. As a consequence, real economic activity
could advance more rapidly than forecast.
THE GOALS OF ECONOMIC POLICY
The Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment and Balanced Growth
Act sets forth both general and highly specific objectives for two of
the most important indicators of the country's economic health, the
unemployment rate and inflation, and establishes the target of reducing Federal outlays to 20 percent of GNP. The act establishes specific
milestones for the achievement of these objectives. An interim goal
of Federal outlays equal to 21 percent of GNP is set for 1981; interim goals of 4 percent for the overall unemployment rate (3 percent
for adults) and 3 percent inflation are both set for 1983.
According to the act, beginning with the 1980 Economic Report the
President may, if he deems it necessary, modify the timetable for
achievement of the interim and final goals for unemployment, inflation, and Federal outlays as a share of GNP. Last year's Economic
Report discussed in some detail the degree of progress toward these
goals and the reasons why their achievement by 1983 was not possible. The chief reason was the 1979 rise in oil prices. Federal policies




177

in 1979 and 1980 were of necessity aimed at limiting the negative
impact of these oil-price increases.
Economic policy now faces a stiff challenge: to reduce a stubborn
inflation, improve the growth of productivity, and expand output and
employment. The policies required to meet this challenge are discussed in Chapters 1 and 2 of this Report, and they will lead to substantial progress toward the goals of reduced inflation and lower unemployment over the next 5 years. Longer-term projections are
shown in Table 26. But even with this progress, it will not be simultaneously possible to achieve 4 percent unemployment and 3 percent
inflation in the time envisioned in the Humphrey-Hawkins Act or in
last year's Report Attempts to reach either goal on the act's timetable
would frustrate progress toward the other goal and could substantially impair the prospects for improved economic performance. In the
long run such attempts would prove self-defeating and result in very
harmful economic and social consequences. The more gradual path
shown in the table will allow us to make progress toward our goals
and to maintain them once achieved. Over the years ahead Federal
spending as a share of GNP will decline, but the level of spending
required to meet national needs and priorities, especially in the defense area, will not permit a reduction to the numerical target set
forth in the act.

SUPPLEMENT

National Income and Product Account Revisions
The national income and product accounts (NIPA), which provide data on
aggregate output and income, were substantially revised in 1980 by the
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The revisions included a refining of accounting concepts and estimation procedures, and introduced new and more recent sources of data. The last




178

major revision of the NIPA occurred 5 years ago and was reported in the
January 1976 Survey of Current Business published by the Commerce Department. The current revision will be described in an article in the December
1980 Survey. All of the NIPA data discussed in this Report are the revised data,
except as noted.
The major features of the revision are these:
â€¢ The data from three major new sources are now incorporated in the
NIPA. These are 3EA's 1972 input-output tables, the 1977 censuses,
and the 1973 and 1976 Compliance Measurement Program of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
â€¢ Normal data sources which would have been used in the postponed July
1980 annual revisions of the NIPA (e.g., IRS tax return information,
annual surveys of manufacturers, housing, and retail trade) were also
utilized in these revisions.
â€¢ The major conceptual change in the NIPA involves the treatment of certain international transactions. The reinvested earnings of incorporated
foreign affiliates of U.S. companies are now included in exports of services. The repatriated earnings of these affiliates were previously included
in exports of services. The reinvested earnings of incorporated foreignowned affiliates in the United States receive similar treatment thus
adding to imports of services. Because the U.S. earnings abroad are
larger than the foreign earnings here, the net result is higher net exports and gross national product especially since the late 1960s. Gross
domestic product is, of course, unaffected by the change. This change
makes the handling of foreign earnings in the NIPA consistent with that
used in the balance of payments accounts since 1978.
â€¢ The treatment of international transactions has also been changed by
using a new procedure for estimating the prices of service exports and
imports.
â€¢ More detailed analysis of Federal purchases has allowed separate constant dollar estimates for both nondefense and defense purchases beginning in 1972.
â€¢ The level of detail at which output is deflated has been increased.
â€¢ Estimating procedures now allow a more complete differentiation between dividend and interest income than was previously reported.
The revisions have raised estimates of real GNP by about 3 Vz percent for
1979, by about 2V2 percent for 1974, and by lesser amounts for earlier years.
About one-third of the upward revision for the years 1977-79 was due to the
conceptual change in the handling of foreign earnings. In addition, the revision in the deflators has, on balance, reduced estimates of prices, thus raising real output. Finally, estimates of real nonresidential fixed investment
have been substantially increased, especially since 1973. The ratio of real




179

nonresidential fixed investment to real GNP, which had previously averaged
9.9 percent between 1974 and 1979, now averages 10.4 percent.
Past business cycle patterns have been little changed by the revisions. The
GNP-measured turning points are all as previously reported. However, the
peak-to-trough declines have been reduced by one-half percent and 1 percent for the 1970 and 1974-75 contractions, respectively. The NIPA now
show the 1974-75 contraction being interrupted by 1 quarter of slight expansion in the second quarter of 1974, immediately following the period of
the Arab oil embargo.
Total compensation remained roughly the same as before revision, but its
composition changed. Wages and salaries in the most recent years are now
higher and supplements lower than had been previously reported. Business
net interest was revised upward by significant amounts especially in recent
years. These revisions rise to $13.7 billion for 1979. Corporate profits were
raised significantly, but chiefly because of the conceptual change in reinvested foreign earnings. Lowered estimates of corporate taxes contributed to
higher corporate retained earnings and saving estimates for the most recent
years. Personal saving estimates were also raised. This is because estimates
of personal consumption were barely changed, while personal income was revised upward considerably. The personal saving rate in the 1970s was revised
upward from an average 6.4 percent under the old estimates to 7.1 percent
under the new estimates.
Potential GNP

Until a formal reappraisal of the historical growth in real potential output
can be completed in the light of the 1980 benchmark revisions to the NIPA,
a provisional procedure has been used to estimate real potential GNP. The
provisional procedure includes two major changes. First, revised data on
business output indicate a somewhat more rapid gain in worker productivity
since 1973. As a result, the trend rate of growth in potential GNP has been
increased by one-fourth of a percentage point from 1973 on. Thus the onehalf percentage point deceleration in the old potential series that occurred in
1973, principally due to reduced productivity growth, has been changed to a
one-fourth point deceleration. The further one-half point deceleration in potential that had been assumed starting in the first quarter of 1979 is still
maintained. The second major change in the series was to add directly to
potential the dollar estimate of the conceptual change to rest of world output
that occurred from the revisions in the handling of reinvested foreign earnings. In this manner, the gap between actual and potential GNP is unaffected
by conceptual changes to the NIPA. The dollar amount of these conceptual revisions has been growing very rapidly recently. As a result^theseichanges actually increase the estimated growth of potential in recent years by nearly 0.2
percentage point. The newly-constructed series grows somewhat less than 3
percent since the first quarter of 1979. This growth rate is expected to continue through 1981. Thereafter the series is projected to grow at 3 percent




180

per year. This modest acceleration is due to the combined effect of a small
assumed increase in the growth rate of worker productivity offset by an expected decline in the contribution to growth of the conceptual changes to
the NIPA. On balance, these changes to actual and potential GNP result in
smaller output gaps over the recent past (Table 27).

CHAPTER 4

The World Economy: Coping with
Transition
The economic challenges facing the United States which have been
discussed in previous chapters of this Report are not unique to this
country. The problem of continuing high inflation is broadly shared
by many of the industrial (and developing) countries. The enormous
increase in the price of energy has created difficult problems of adjustment everywhere. Productivity growth has slowed not only in the
United States but also in other countries. At the same time that all
countries individually take actions to deal with these problems, cooperation among countries is required to manage the ever increasing
interdependence of the world's economies.
Over the next several years four major challenges will have to be
surmounted to bring about the transition to a world economy with
less inflation and higher growth.
First, a combination of demand restraint and vigorous efforts to
improve supply must be employed to bring down inflation and raise
productivity.
Second, the constraints placed on world economic expansion by
limited supplies of energy must be loosened by policies to increase
energy availability and reduce energy demand.
Third, continued close attention is needed to assure that the international financial system effectively handles the much enlarged flow
of financial resources among countries.
Finally, the open trading system that contributed so importantly to
rising prosperity in past decades must be strengthened in the face of
increasing pressures to adopt protective measures and the temptation
to indulge in "beggar-thy-neighbor" policies.
The energy challenge is well understood and its international aspects were discussed extensively in last year's Report. It will therefore
be dealt with only briefly in this chapter. Following an initial discussion of recent and prospective economic performance in the major
industrial countries, the chapter examines each of the remaining
three challengesâ€”the challenge to the conduct of macroeconomic
and structural policies, the challenge to the financial system, and the
challenge to trade relations.




182

THE INDUSTRIAL ECONOMIES: TRENDS AND PROSPECTS
In 1974-75, following the tripling of oil prices by the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the industrial world experienced its largest recession since the second World War. In 1980,
following a second major rise in oil prices, economic expansion again
came to a halt. It is abundantly clear that price shocks of the size experienced in recent years cannot be absorbed without serious strains
and disruptive side effects: real incomes are squeezed, inflationary
forces are intensified, and output and employment are reduced.
Fiscal and monetary policies cannot substantially offset or counteract
all of these effects. Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies could
moderate the decline in output, but at the cost of building yet higher
inflation into the economy. Restrictive policies, on the other hand,
could limit the rise in inflation, but they would also tend to accentuate the decline in output and employment. Following the second oilprice shock, most countries have opted for policies of moderate restraint. This choice reflects the judgment that such policies would
stand the best chance of reducing secondary distortions in the structure of costs and prices and in the distribution of income among sectors, and thus would help speed the process of adjustment to the
higher oil prices. That judgment appears to have been correct.
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

Although all the evidence is not yet in, it appears that the second
oil-price shock is being absorbed more smoothly than the first one
was. Recent indicators and current projections show a smaller swing
in output and a lesser surge in inflation for most countries. Table 28
shows recent growth rates and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) projections for the major countries.
Except for the United Kingdom, the general pattern is one of relatively mild and brief recession concentrated in the second half of
1980, followed by a very modest but strengthening recovery in 1981.

There are several reasons why the recession appears to have been
milder, and the rise in inflation less, after the second oil-price shock
than after the first. In the first place, inventory movements are substantially smaller in the current cycle than they were in 1974-75. The
massive inventory liquidation that marked the earlier recession is not
being repeated. As a result, the decline in output has been smaller
and the projected pace of recovery is initially slower.
Consumer spending also has been better maintained in relation to
income. Saving rates rose sharply in all countries following the first
oil-price shock, but they have not done so recently, except in the
United Kingdom. Slowing consumer demand is fully accounted for in
most countries by weakening household incomes, rather than by
marked changes in saving behavior.
Finally, real wages in most countries have adjusted downward more
rapidly in the wake of the recent oil-price rise than they did after the
first one, and they have done so with a smaller acceleration of nominal wages. Both the different response of real wages and that of
nominal wages have important consequences.
When the world price of oil rises, countries that import oil lose
real income. This loss can be absorbed in several ways. If nominal
wages rise in line with traditional productivity increments and also to
match all increases in consumer prices that result when higher
energy costs are passed through, then real wage incomes are protected. Corporate profits, however, are squeezed. In this case household
consumption opportunities are preserved, but investment demand is
likely to be curtailed as firms grapple with reduced cash flow and
lower returns on new investment. Alternatively, if nominal wages rise
by a lesser amount in relation to prices, then real wage incomes are
squeezed, but the associated decline in real labor costs provides firms
with a margin that offsets, in whole or in part, the increase in their
energy costs. In this case, consumption may be curtailed, but investment incentives are better maintained.
Chart 10 shows the difference in how the real income loss was absorbed abroad following the two oil-price shocks. In 1974-75 unit
labor costs rose much more than value-added deflators for manufacturing. This implied a sharp rise in the labor share of total value
added, and a corresponding fall in the profit share, which was only
gradually restored in subsequent years. The squeeze on profits was a
major cause of low rates of investment in most foreign countries
during the following years. And lagging investment largely explains
the "hesitant recovery" abroad that was described in the 1978 Report
In contrast to the experience abroad, real wages fell in the United
States in 1974-75, and investment demand grew apace during the
subsequent recovery.

In 1979-80, the* increase in unit labor costs in major foreign countries remained less than the rise in value-added deflators, thus giving
manufacturers some room to absorb increased energy costs without a
major squeeze on profit margins. Largely for this reason, but also because the needs to modernize production and improve energy efficiency are substantial, business investment abroad may not weaken
unduly in the current recession and may begin to rise again at an
early stage of the projected recovery.
The necessary reduction in real incomes, whether it is initially absorbed by wage earners or by their employers, can be associated with
a larger or smaller acceleration in inflation. If nominal wages rise
sharply, and firms resist the erosion of profit margins by further raising prices, then the adjustment will take place in an environment of
rising inflation. By contrast, if nominal wages do not accelerate, then
real wages will initially fall as higher oil prices are passed through,
but the underlying rate of inflation will not accelerate. And once the
pass-through of higher oil costs is completed, actual price rises will




185

begin to moderate. The second pattern is preferable, not only because it is more likely to sustain investment but also because it generates less inflation. The relative moderation of nominal wage increases
in most countries recently, in sharp contrast to the nominal wage explosions that occurred in 1974, is therefore encouraging.
Despite these generally favorable developments, only sluggish
growth is now projected for most countries during 1981. Two major
factors account for this. First, as already noted, inventory building
will not provide added strength. Second, fiscal and monetary policies
will remain restrictive. Fiscal deficits in 1980 were little changed from
those of 1979 in the major foreign t countries, despite the slowing
revenue growth and expenditure increases associated with weakening
economic activity. Discretionary fiscal policy actions tended to work
toward restraint. Announced policy intentions in most countries suggest a further shift toward restraint in 1981. Growth in government
expenditures, in particular, is planned to stay below anticipated
growth in gross national product (GNP) in most countries, thus reducing the share of government and limiting the rise in budget deficits.
EXTERNAL POSITIONS

For the OECD countries as a group, the two oil-price shocks have
had similar effects on trade and current-account positions. In nominal terms, the current account of the OECD as a whole shifted from
surplus to deficit by about 1 percent of GNP in 1974 and by about
P/2 percent of GNP in 1979-80. In both periods, however, the
volume of real imports fell relative to exports; real trade balances
therefore rose, moderating the decline in GNP relative to domestic
demand.
But in one important respect the 1974-75 and 1979-80 periods
have been very different. Both the volume of imports and of exports
declined precipitously after 1974, even in relation to the large fall in
GNP. The current decline in trade volumes has been much more
moderate, and more nearly in line with the path of GNP. A renewed
expansion of world trade, albeit at moderate rates, is anticipated as
recovery proceeds.
Although the aggregate shift in current-account positions was
broadly similar after the two oil-price shocks, there are some important differences in the way this shift was distributed among the major
OECD countries (Table 29). In general, a larger share of the total
shift has been absorbed by those countries whose relatively good inflation performance and previously strong external positions made
them better able to finance these deficits. Most notably, the remarkable performance of Germany in 1974, when its surplus increased by
$5.7 billion despite the rise in its oil bill, has not been repeated.




186

Rather, the German current account shifted from a surplus of about
$9 billion in 1978 to an estimated deficit of $17 billion in 1980. The
Japanese current account also moved sharply, from a $17-billion surplus in 1978 to an estimated $13-billion deficit in 1980. This shift
reflected not only higher oil payments but also the adverse shortterm effect of yen depreciation during 1979 and the first quarter of
1980 on the nominal trade balance. These two effects more than
offset the strong Japanese trade performance, in volume terms,
during the past year.

By contrast, the current account of the United States improved by
an estimated $20 billion over this same period, as discussed more
fully in Chapter 3. Similarly, the United Kingdom moved into substantial surplus during 1980, both because that country has become
largely self-sufficient in oilâ€”so that its trade account was not strongly
affected by the rise in oil pricesâ€”and because the recession has been
relatively more severe in the United Kingdom than elsewhere, thus
limiting imports.
INFLATION

The different pattern of absorption of the recent oil-price shock
compared to the earlier one shows up clearly in the movements of
wages and prices. Chart 11 traces the movements of consumer prices
and hourly earnings in manufacturing over the past decade for the
major industrial countries. As measured by consumer prices, rates of
inflation outside the United States tended to decline during 1978 to
levels comparable to those prevailing in the early 1970sâ€”though
with substantial dispersion among countries. But consumer price inflation accelerated everywhere during 1979 and into 1980 under the
impact of higher energy prices. In sharp contrast to the earlier
period, however, hourly earnings accelerated only moderately, and
lagged behind consumer prices in almost all countries. As oil prices




187

stabilized in mid-1980, inflation rates peaked and then began to
recede in the second half of the year. On current projections, and
assuming that oil prices do not again rise sharply, a continued reduction in inflation rates is in prospect for most countries during 1981 â€”
indeed, a somewhat more rapid reduction abroad than in the United
States (Table 30).

Substantial differences among the major countries will persist,
however. At one extreme, inflation rates in Germany and Japan
during 1981 are likely to return to the moderate levels that were
achieved in 1977-78. On the other hand, relatively high inflation is
likely to persist in a number of other countriesâ€”especially Italy, but
also the United States, France, and Canadaâ€”where wage rigidities
appear to be more significant. In the United Kingdom, the continued
adherence to restrictive fiscal and monetary policies, the strength of
the pound, and substantial slack in labor and product markets appear
to be causing a rapid decline in inflation from the high levels reached
in 1979 and early 1980. But even so, inflation in the United Kingdom
will remain relatively high.

SUMMARY ASSESSMENT

It is not possible to provide a definitive explanation of why the oilprice rise was absorbed more easily during the current cycle than it
was in 1974-75. Timing is certainly one important consideration.
The most recent runup in oil prices came at a time when most countries were still on an upswing from the previous recession, rather
than at a peak. Hence, cyclical factors tended to offset, rather than
accentuate, the 1979 price shock. In addition, the 1974 shock followed hard upon a major surge in industrial and agricultural commodity prices, which generated strong speculative pressures and excessive inventory accumulation. Commodity pricesâ€”except for the
explosion in prices of precious metals in 1979 and early 1980â€”have
shown a less marked upward trend in the recent period.
The key element promoting smoother adjustment, however, has
been the restrained response of nominal wages to rising prices in
most countries. This restraint has served a double furiction. It has
helped to preserve a relationship between costs and prices that will
encourage a more rapid resumption of growth by maintaining profitability and thus investment. It has also limited the rise in underlying
inflation rates and thus reduced the probable duration and severity
of the fiscal and monetary policy restraint that is required.
A number of factors may explain the moderate behavior of wages,
and different factors may be more important in some countries than
in others. The unambiguous adoption, in almost all countries, of
monetary policies that did not seek to finance the rise in oil prices
with faster rates of monetary expansion has certainly been an important factor, as has the pursuit of moderately restrictive fiscal policies.
"Jawboning" by government officials may also have had an effect in




189

some countries, and in the United States a more formal incomes
policy has played a role. Wage moderation may also have reflected
the higher average levels of unemployment and associated labor
market slack that prevailed in 1979. In some countriesâ€”especially
those where the oil-price shock has been absorbed most rapidly such
as Germany and Japanâ€”wage moderation may reflect an implicit
social consensus under which unavoidable reductions in real incomes
are accepted by wage earners in the understanding that the distribution of income will not thereby be shifted to their disadvantage.
Although the adjustment to the recent runup in oil prices has proceeded relatively smoothly in most countries, it cannot be denied that
the process is very costly. While the increased oil bill due to the price
rises of 1979-80 amounts to about 2V2 percent of the combined GNP
of the OECD member countries, the cost in lost output is much
larger. Taking into account the effects of both the oil-price rise itself
and the restrictive monetary and fiscal policies it called forth, the
OECD estimates that the level of GNP in the OECD member countries may be some 6 percent, or about $500 billion, lower by the beginning of 1982 than it would have been in the absence of the oilprice rise. While this estimate might be somewhat on the high side, it
is nevertheless clear that even smooth adjustment cannot prevent
major secondary repercussions.
RISKS IN THE OUTLOOK

Excluding the United States, real GNP in the major industrial
countries is projected to rise at about a 2 percent annual rate from
the second half of 1980 to the first half of 1982â€”a pace unlikely to
be rapid enough to prevent some further increases in unemployment.
Inflation rates in the industrial countries outside the United States
are projected to slowâ€”averaging about 8.5 percent by the first half
of 1982, as compared to 11 percent in the second half of 1980.
The possibility of worse outcomes cannot be dismissed, however.
In particular, one cannot be entirely confident that the pattern of
wage moderation will continue, inasmuch as the reasons for it are not
fully understood. A continuation of relatively restrictive monetary
and fiscal policies in most countries is widely viewed as necessary to
contain this risk, but these policies may also slow recovery by more
than is now projected. More critically, the situation in the oil market
is once again precarious following the interruption of supplies from
Iran and Iraq. A further large increase in oil prices in 1981 could undermine the still fragile process of consolidation and recovery. The
following section addresses this issue in more detail.

THE GLOBAL OIL MARKET

Table 31 summarizes world petroleum production and use patterns
over the past 8 years. The most striking aspect of the table is how
small the year-to-year fluctuations in production have been. The
major disruptions of 1974 and 1979 were associated with very
modest shifts in the balance between consumption and production. It
is the low price elasticities of supply and demand in the short run,
rather than wide fluctuations in the quantities supplied or demanded, that make disruptive price movements possible.

The 1979 rise in oil prices occurred despite increased oil production. The curtailment of Iranian supplies in late 1978 was more than
made up in 1979 by production increases elsewhere. Nevertheless, a
number of prior developments had created conditions favorable to
price increases. First of all, world consumption of petroleum, though
rising more slowly after 1975 than in the previous decade, nonetheless increased steadily from 1975 to 1978, reducing the excess production capacity that had emerged after the first oil-price shock.
Second, the real price of oil fell during this period, thus encouraging
consumption and also reducing the real value of OPEC revenues. Finally, stocks were drawn down during the course of 1978â€”perhaps
because falling real oil prices had made stock building appear unprofitable. As a result, the margin of flexibility available to accommodate the curtailment of Iranian supplies was small, and the incentives
for OPEC countries to raise prices were strong.
It is clear that smaller price increases than actually occurred would
have been sufficient to balance consumption and production. Rising
demand for stocks, however, kept pushing prices higher well into




191

1980. After midyear, when consumption had fallen sufficiently to accommodate and moderate the stock buildup, price pressures began
to ease. In fact, excess supply conditions were avoided only because a
number of OPEC countries cut back their production.
Hindsight also shows that a less ambitious restocking pattern
during 1979 and up to mid-1980 would have made a smoother adjustment possible. One cannot be certain of all the reasons why this
restocking occurred, but several factors may have been important.
First, additional stocks may have been needed to keep the distribution system operating smoothly, given the growing fragmentation of
the world oil market and the resulting decreased ability of the major
oil companies to shift supplies around to accommodate shifting
needs. In addition, the disruption in late 1978 and early 1979 greatly
increased feelings of uncertainty about future supplies and thus
raised the precautionary demand for stocks. Finally, the rise in prices
itself tended to increase the incentives for stock accumulation in anticipation of capital gainsâ€”at least until prices had risen sufficiently
to make further price rises appear less probable. This speculative
motive may have been strengthened by the belief that OPEC countries respond asymmetrically to market conditions. If OPEC producers respond to tight market conditions by raising prices but cut back
on production when markets weaken rather than allowing prices to
fall, they in effect build a ratchet under existing prices. Stock building then becomes a particularly attractive form of speculation when
prices begin to rise, since the risk of major financial loss from a subsequent fall in prices is much reduced.
Although the massive buildup of stocks during 1979 and 1980 was
very costly because of the added pressure it placed on oil prices,
these stocks have subsequently proved valuable because they have
provided a cushion in the face of the Iran-Iraq war. The oil market
would in all probability have been slack in 1981, with little pressure
on oil prices, if the Iran-Iraq war had not occurred. Prior to the onset
of hostilities, consumption per day was several million barrels below
world capacity, and stocks were at very high levels. Now, however, the situation is more difficult to assess. The war has removed
nearly 4 million barrels a day from world oil supplies for an undetermined length of time, but some of this loss is being offset by increased production elsewhere. At the moment, stocks are still above
their normal historical levels, and severe market pressures have not
emerged.
The margin, however, is a narrow one. If oil consumption continues to decline as further adaptation to higher prices outweighs the
effects of resumed economic growth, if the war does not widen, and
if stock drawdowns are permitted to occur as needed, then a balance




192

may be preserved. Stocks are in fact being drawn down, consistent
with the objectives set for the major oil-consuming countries at the
meeting of the International Energy Agency late last year. But if the
disruption is more severe, or mismatches on a country-by-country
basis between demands and stocks induce a scramble for extra supplies and a bidding up of prices in spot markets, or if expectations of
price risesâ€”warranted or notâ€”induce speculative withholding of
stocks in anticipation of capital gains, then acute market pressures
could once again develop.
DIRECTIONS FOR ECONOMIC POLICY: NEEDS AND
CHALLENGES
Despite the progressive absorption of the 1979 oil shock and the
projected beginning of moderate recovery this year, the world economy will be grappling with several difficult problems in the years immediately ahead.
First, policies of demand restraint are needed in all countries to
fight inflation. This need is felt not only in those countries where inflation rates are highest, but also in those where considerable progress has already been made in bringing inflation down. For these
latter countries, the concern is that an early relaxation of restrictive
policies before inflationary expectations have been firmly laid to rest
would allow inflation to reaccelerate. This would not only undo the
progress achieved but would also undermine the credibilityâ€”and
hence the effectivenessâ€”of subsequent anti-inflation policies. The
degree and duration of needed restraint, of course, varies among
countries. Where inflation rates have been persistently high, continued restraint for a number of years may be necessary to bring inflation down and to convince people that it will stay down. Where inflationary expectations are less deeply entrenched and where inflation is
lower, a shift to less restrictive policies may be possible sooner.
Because of the momentum of inherited inflation and rigidities in
the setting of wages and prices, restrictive demand policies that aim
to reduce inflation will also slow the growth of production and keep
unemployment relatively high for some time. In this way, the inflation problem gives rise to an unemployment problem. Unemployment rates have risen in most countries during the 1970s, and no
early reversal of this trend is in sight. High unemployment is costly
not only because it imposes hardships on those who do not have
jobs, but also because it fosters "preservationist" attitudes among society generally. Economic restructuring becomes more difficult when
workers in declining firms or industries fear they will be unable to
find other work, when pressure on governments to subsidize unprof-




193

itable activities intensifies, and when trade protection becomes more
attractive.
The second fundamental problem is that in most industrial countries the growth of potential output has fallen because of lower productivity gains. The decline in productivity growth has generally been
less marked abroad than in the United States, but it has occurred to
some extent in all countries. Although all the reasons for this decline
are not known, several common factors can be identified. Higher
energy prices lead to the substitution of labor for energy, and thereby induce a slowing in productivity. Productivity growth has been
slowed also by lower rates of investment in many countries, leading
to a smaller rise in capital per worker and a slower pace of adoption
of the technological innovations embodied in new capital goods. Finally, productivity growth outside the United States has been reduced because opportunities for technological borrowing have diminished as the "technology gap" between the United States and other
industrial countries has diminished or, in many sectors, disappeared.
The decline in productivity growth directly reduces the scope for
increases in real incomes and standards of living. Nevertheless, some
have argued that as long as the growth of production is also limited
by restrictive demand policies the decline in productivity is not all
bad because it leads to more employment, and hence less of an unemployment problem, than would be the case if productivity growth
remained higher. This argument, however, ignores the fact that lower
productivity growth increases cost-push inflation. Since wage demands do not adjust downward when productivity growth slows, unit
labor costs rise faster, putting increased upward pressure on prices.
If nominal wage demands then accelerate in an attempt to achieve
the real income gains obtained in the past when productivity growth
was higher, the underlying inflation rate is increased still further. As
a result, demand policies have to be more restrictive than otherwise
to achieve a deceleration of inflation. In this way a slowing of productivity imposes a double burden. It reduces the growth of potential
output, and at the same time it increases the degree of economic
slack that is needed to achieve a given deceleration of inflation.
THE SEARCH FOR SOLUTIONS

While restrictive demand policies are needed to fight inflation,
other policies must be put in place to reduce the costs that restrictive
demand policies inevitably impose on the economy and to restore
over time a more normal growth in productivity and living standards.
Three broad approaches need to be pursued. First, supply-oriented
policies that raise productivity and increase economic flexibility need
to be put in place. Second, policies to increase energy supply and to
reduce the demand for energy are needed to weaken the energy con-




194

straint on growth. Finally, policies that directly influence wage an
price setting can play a role in some nations in lowering actual an
expected inflation.
Supply-Oriented Policies

As discussed in Chapters 1 and 2 with respect to the U.S. econo
my, supply-side measures can make a significant contribution to improved economic performance. Beyond the direct benefits that such
measures can provide by increasing the efficiency with which resources are allocated, they can also serve to reduce the costs of restrictive demand policies. If flexibility in labor or product markets is
increased, the effectiveness of demand restraint in slowing inflation
also improves. If productivity growth is enhanced, not only does potential output rise but higher levels of capacity utilization can also be
achieved, since cost-push inflation is reduced.
There is no master plan of supply-side policies that will be equally
useful to all countries, given their different institutional arrangements and structural relationships. Earlier chapters of this Report discuss a number of policy approaches appropriate to the United States,
and many of these may also be useful in other countries. Two approaches, in particular, stand out as important in most countries.
First, policies are needed to raise the share of GNP that is invested
in new plant and equipment. Higher investment is necessary to raise
productivity growth, to increase domestic energy production, and to
accelerate the economic restructuring that higher oil prices and
global shifts in patterns of comparative advantage have made necessary.
A potential problem exists with respect to greater investment, a
problem which some have called the "low-growth trap." The argument is that if restrictive demand policies are used to fight inflation,
investment will also be reduced because the existence of unutilized
capacity will make companies unwilling to undertake investments that
may not be needed until the more distant future. Lower investment,
in turn, would reduce productivity growth and potential output, and
hence reinforce the need for demand restraint. Thus, the final outcome might be a prolonged period of stagflation.
While there are indeed difficulties in trying to increase investment
during a period of demand restraint, one need not accept the "lowgrowth trap" argument. Low rates of capacity utilization do, by themselves, have a negative effect on investment. Other factors, however,
are also important and can offset this effect. As was emphasized earlier in this chapter, the recent oil shock has been absorbed in a way
that has limited the erosion of profitability and cash flow to enterprises, and thus has supported investment. Moreover, the need for restructuring may require substantial investment even in sectors where




195

capacity utilization is low. The U.S. automobile sector is a clear example, and similar requirements exist in most countries. Finally, as
discussed in Chapter 1 with reference to the United States, there is a
good deal of evidence that policies to raise the return on capital investment or to lower the cost of capital can have substantial impacts
on investment demand even when significant excess capacity exists.
For all of these reasons it seems probable that countries can avoid a
low-growth trap and, by pursuing vigorous investment-oriented policies, raise the share of investment in GNP even while continuing with
policies of overall demand restraint.
The second supply-oriented approach is to increase the flexibility
of labor and product markets by reducing unnecessarily burdensome
regulation, by increasing competition within and across borders, and
by improving policies for structural adjustment in industry and agriculture. Policies, for instance, that improve flexibility in labor markets through job training or other programs, or which reduce the
downward rigidity of wages in the face of high unemployment,
achieve several important objectives simultaneously. They reduce unemployment directly by easing frictional unemployment and stimulating the demand for labor in sectors where prevailing wage rigidities
have made hiring unprofitable. Perhaps more important, greater
labor-market flexibility increases the speed with which restrictive
demand policies translate into lower rates of inflation. To the extent
that this occurs, higher rates of real growth can be accommodated.
Even if demand policies do not change so that nominal income
growth is limited, real income growth is larger to the extent that inflation is less. Moreover, if inflation declines more quickly in response to demand restraint, both the severity and the duration of the
needed demand restraint are reduced, thus further improving the
prospects for higher growth and a more rapid absorption of the unemployed.
Other examples of policies that enhance flexibility include U.S. efforts in deregulation and regulatory reform, the progressive dismantling of price controls in France during the past several years, and
the moves in some countries to allow more realistic pricing policies
in nationalized sectors.
There are serious difficulties to be overcome, however. In many
cases governments lack the tools for evaluating the costs and benefits
of structural policies. Divisions of authority among agencies with different objectives or loyalties make coherent policy formulation, implementation, or evaluation difficult. There is, in general, a need to
increase the "transparency" of government operationsâ€”both internally, so that governments themselves can come to a clearer perception of just what it is they are doing, and externally, so that those




196

outside government, both at home and abroad, can form a clearer
idea of what is to be expected. A further inescapable difficulty is that
strong political pressures arise to influence structural policies when
potential gains or losses to particular sectors are at issue. More powerful techniques to enhance transparency can serve not only to improve the quality of decisionmaking, but alsoâ€”by making costs and
benefits clearerâ€”to stiffen the resistance of governments to unbalanced political pressure.
Energy Policies

Increased investment in alternative energy sources, efforts to promote more efficient use of existing supplies, and measures to reduce
vulnerability to supply disruptions are needed to improve growth
prospects over the longer-term. So long as oil supplies are scarce and
uncertain, and energy markets lack the flexibility to absorb disruptions in the flow of oil, the risk of recurrent oil-price shocks cannot
be avoided.
While the market incentives provided by sharply higher energy
prices will furnish the major impetus for many of the needed adjustments, government actions will also be needed in some cases. The
development of some new sources of energy, for instance, may require government participation because of the long lead-times, very
large scale, and technological risks associated with them. Furthermore, the building up and management of petroleum stockpiles requires a government role since private stocking provides insufficient
protection against oil-supply disruptions for the reasons discussed in
Chapter 2.
There is also a strong rationale for a broader international coordination of energy policies. The potential gains from a more rapid expansion of U.S. coal production, for instance, are increased if other
countries, anticipating the increased availability of coal, at the same
time increase the capacity of their electric-power systems to use coal
instead of other fuels. More broadly, part of the social benefits that
arise when one country increases its energy production or reduces its
energy demand accrue abroad, since energy consumers in all countries will benefit from the resulting reduced pressure on world
energy prices. Joint projects and other forms of international cooperation may therefore be particularly appropriate in the field of energy.
The rationale for international coordination of government policies
is especially strong with regard to oil stocks. If countries attempt to
increase their own security by bidding for stocks and thereby create
conditions of excess demand, all countries will suffer the consequences of sharply higher oil prices. Conversely, the willingness of
one country to use existing stocks in times when markets are tight
may depend on the extent to which other countries do the same. A




197

coordinated use of stocks may forestall a surge in oil prices, but few
countries would act individually to draw down their stocks if they
thought that others would then exploit the opportunity to protect or
increase their own.
Incomes Policies

The adoption of policies to influence directly the process of wage
and price setting is another approach to improving economic performance. Elsewhere in this Report the possibilities as well as the
problems of implementing tax-based policies to encourage wage and
price restraint in the United States are discussed. The major foreign
countries do not now have formal incomes policiesâ€”though interest
in using them has at various times been evident in several of them. It
does appear to be the case, however, that those countries with the
greatest downward flexibility in wage and price behavior, and hence
also the lowest inflation rates, have a stronger social consensus than
those countries with higher inflation. Ironically, it may be that explicit incomes policies would be easiest to implement in those countries
where the implicit social consensus makes them least needed.
MONETARY POLICY AND EXCHANGE RATES

In addition to the fundamental economic and social issues involved
in designing and carrying out sustained policies of demand restraint
and supply enhancement, there are problems of a more technical
nature that must be dealt with. One of these, which has received a
good bit of attention recently, arises from the interaction between
domestic monetary policy and the foreign-exchange markets.
If it is perceived that different countries, through their monetary
and fiscal policies, have significantly different objectives, especially
with respect to inflation, then exchange rates are likely to move. For
instance, if some countries use monetary policies aggressively to
achieve a rapid decline in inflation while others pursue more expansionary policies that are judged likely to increase inflation, the currencies of the former countries will tend to appreciate against those
of the latter. Such exchange-rate adjustments are both unavoidable
over the longer run and necessary to prevent the building up of distortions in relative price levels across countries, so long as different
policy objectives persist.
Exchange-rate adjustments do not always proceed smoothly, however. Exchange markets may at times become disorderly, and exchange rates may move more* sharply than necessary to accommodate
differences in policies or in other fundamental economic variables.
Such risks probably increase when the divergence in policy objectives
becomes more marked and expectations about future economic performance correspondingly more diverse. Particularly when inflation




198

rates are high, differences in policy objectives may have a magnified
effect on exchange rates if the countries that attempt to ease policy
are viewed as giving up on the fight against inflation. For these reasons, some combination of broad consistency in economic policy objectives and cooperation in exchange-market policies is probably necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of the international monetary system.
As discussed earlier in this chapter, most countries are now pursuing broadly similar policies of demand restraint aimed at reducing inflation, and exchange markets have not been subject to major disruptions over the past 2 years. Monetary policies in many countries have
focused on keeping the rates of money growthâ€”differently defined in
different countriesâ€”on target or within target ranges. These targets
are themselves set with an eye toward steady reduction in the rate of
monetary expansion so as to be consistent with the hoped-for reduction in inflation. Even though monetary policies have shared the
same general objectives and approach, they have had different consequences in different countries with respect to both the level and the
variability of interest rates. For various reasons these differences have
been particularly wide in the recent past and have raised several
questions about the relationship between domestic monetary policies
and the variability of exchange rates.
To the extent that actual and expected rates of inflation differ
across countries, nominal rates of interest tend to be different even
when monetary authorities pursue policies that restrict nominal
demand growth to a comparable extent. If different interest rates
simply reflect differences in underlying inflation expectations, international financial markets should not, in theory, be disrupted. Market
participants would recognize that higher nominal yields on assets denominated in some currencies do not necessarily translate into higher
rates of return if exchange rates move over time to reflect differences
in inflation. For a variety of reasons, however, this mechanism may
not always function smoothly. Purchasing power parities do not hold
with any great precision in the short or even the more medium term.
Therefore, market participants need not assume that depreciation
will offset higher nominal yields over the period during which the
asset is held. Furthermore, if asset holders perceive that monetary
authorities are likely to resist incipient currency depreciations
through intervention, they may be tempted to seek out high nominal
returns on the expectation that they will be able to unwind their positions before the depreciation occurs. In such circumstances downward pressure on the exchange rates of countries with lower inflation
and nominal interest rates might arise.




199

The large differences in monetary structures and instruments of
monetary control across countries may also produce substantial differences in real interest rates for comparable degrees of monetary restraint. In particular, monetary systems which rely more heavily on
nonprice rationing effects to achieve restraint may tend to have lower
real rates of interest than those which have fewer such rigidities
(though such rigidities may also cause greater dispersion of interest
rates across different financial markets). Where such real interest rate
differences arise, exchange-rate pressures may emerge even when
nominal interest rates are properly discounted for inflation.
A second problem on which attention has focused has been the
greater volatility of interest rates. As discussed in other chapters of
this Report, both the change in the operating procedures of the Federal Reserve and major changes in the structure of U.S. financial
markets have led to increased variability in U.S. interest rates. If foreign exchange markets are highly sensitive to interest rate movements, then variations in U.S. interest rates may lead either to greater variability in the exchange rates of other countries vis-a-vis the
dollar or else to greater fluctuations in their interest rates. Of course,
a reduction in the volatility of interest rates in the United States
would be desirable on domestic grounds as well, if it could be accomplished without compromising the ability of the Federal Reserve
to achieve its monetary growth objectives.
Although it is clear that considerations of exchange-rate volatility
may sometimes reduce the freedom of monetary authorities to conduct monetary policies solely on the basis of domestic objectives, the
problem may have been overstated in recent public discussions. Moderate movements in exchange rates, even if not strictly necessary
from the perspective of fundamental economic conditions, need not
impose significant costs on economic performance. Furthermore, if
longer-run expectations concerning inflation and current-account balances are such as to provide stability to exchange rates, interest rate
differences are not likely to be a major and continuing source of
trouble.
The strength of the dollar in the latter part of 1980, for instance,
reflected not only high interest rates but also the strong current-account position of the United States. At the same time, the weakness
of the German mark, not only vis-a-vis the dollar but also against the
other currencies of the European Monetary System, was also due to
the large and unaccustomed German current-account deficit in 1980.
The yen, to take another example, strengthened during the second
half of last year and yet further in early 1981 despite a lowering of
Japanese interest rates and a large, although declining, current-account deficit. This strength probably reflects the relatively buoyant




200

Japanese trade performance in volume terms, and also perhaps the
ability of the Japanese authorities to attract OPEC funds. Again, the
continued strength of sterling during 1980 was only in part the result
of high nominal interest rates. Oil independence, the strengthening
current-account position, and the general credibility of the British
government's commitment to policies of restraint were also important.
To sum up, it appears that even with broad consistency in monetary policy objectives, problems can sometimes arise from the potential flow of funds across borders in response to differences in nominal interest rates. While the threat of such flows can complicate the
conduct of monetary policy, this threat need not be so severe as to
deprive carefully managed monetary policies of the flexibility they
need to meet domestic objectives. Flexibility in monetary policy may,
of course, occasionally require somewhat greater fluctuations in exchange rates than would otherwise be the case, but if fundamental
economic conditions are such as to promote stability, such movements should not pose major problems.
CHALLENGES TO THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM
The international community possesses a marvelously articulated
set of private and public financial institutions through which funds
are channeled from short-term lenders to long-term borrowers, from
surplus to deficit countries, from one currency to another, and from
capital-rich countries to capital-poor developing ones. The smooth
functioning of this financial system has helped to make possible a
rapid expansion of international trade and a relatively sizable transfer
of resources to developing countries, both of which have contributed
importantly to postwar economic growth and development. While the
system has periodically required attention to keep it up to date with
changing financial conditions, it has adapted and performed its critical functions well over the last three-and-a-half decades.
The huge increase in the volume of international financial flows
occasioned by the recent oil-price rise, following upon a similar increase only 5 years earlier, has placed a major strain upon international financial institutions. Making sure that these institutions can
continue to conduct vitally needed financial transfers soundly and efficiently is a second major challenge to economic policymaking in the
years immediately ahead. If the needed transfers of resources from
surplus to deficit countries are not made, or if they occur in ways
that permit countries to avoid the painful adjustment to higher oil
prices, the prospects for sustainable world economic growth and development will be seriously harmed.




201

The volume of international financing is reflected in Table 32,
which describes current-account positions, net of official transfers,
for broad country groupings, as compiled and projected by the
OECD. The table provides an indication of the orders of magnitude
involved, but specific numbers should not be overemphasized since
even the historical numbers are subject to substantial margins of
error. The projections for 1981 are particularly uncertain because the
assumption of a constant real oil price that underlies these projections is at risk on account of the Iran-Iraq struggle.
Very large financing needs will persist over the next several years.
While the OPEC surplus is expected to decline if oil prices do not
rise sharply again, the decline will be more than matched by a projected improvement in the current-account positions of the larger
OECD countries. The deficits of the smaller OECD countries will
remain roughly unchanged at levels thatâ€”while broadly financeableâ€”are nevertheless viewed as a problem by the countries themselves. The already substantial deficits of a number of the non-oil developing countries are projected to rise further, but whether financing on the scale implied by such deficits will be forthcoming must
remain a question of serious concern.

At an aggregate level, of course, the borrowing needed to finance
deficits must be matched by the lending that surplus countries undertake. The relative ease, compared to expectations, with which the
"recycling" of funds was carried out after the first oil-price shock no
doubt owes a great deal to this "adding-up" property. The sharp increases in liquidity arising from massive inflows of OPEC funds into
the major national and Eurocurrency banks provided the funding for
the large increase in lending by these banks to the deficit countries.




202

No "Say's Law" operates in international financial markets, however, to assure that desired lending matches intended borrowing on a
country-by-country basis. Much of the money available for lending
comes from countries, especially OPEC countries, who wish to place
their funds in short-term liquid deposits. But much of the borrowing,
especially on the part of newly industrialized countries with relatively
fragile debt-servicing capacity, is for long-term needs. Between these
two different sets of preferences stand the intermediariesâ€”some official international institutions and some international capital markets,
but principally the large private banks of the industrial countries
which accept liquid short-term deposits, make illiquid long-term
loans, and in return for the profits they earn bear most of the risks
involved. Channels of intermediation, however, can become clogged
or overburdened. Perceptions of risk may limit the willingness of intermediaries to expand their lending to certain countries, or high
borrowing costs may simply preclude countries with low incomes
from borrowing, since they lack the resources needed to service this
debt.
FINANCING THE DEFICITS OF THE NON-OIL DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

The broad financing pattern for the non-oil developing countries
over the period from 1973 to 1979 is shown in Table 33, taken from
IMF compilations. The character of the flows that finance these countries' deficits has changed markedly since 1973 when a large share of
the financing was with funds, such as government transfers, that did
not create debt. Since 1975, however, deficit financing has come to
depend increasingly on sources that do create debt, especially on
long-term borrowing on market terms from private sources. Beginning in 1979â€”and partial evidence suggests the trend continued into
1980â€”the share of private long-term financing declined. Offsetting
that decline were a small rise in official financing, a stronger increase
in short-term borrowing, and a slowing of reserve accumulation.
The aggregate data in Table 33 mask considerable diversity among
countries, but two main groups can be identified. One group consists
of the low-income developing countries which, largely unable to
afford market terms, rely heavily on official financing on concessional
terms. For them the continued availability of official finance on affordable terms is a major concern. In particular, the expansion of World
Bank resources through the Sixth Replenishment of its soft-loan affiliate, the International Development Association (IDA), is critical for
these countries. Yet without the approval of the U.S. Congress, IDA
resources cannot be replenished. Unfortunately, that approval did
not come out of the post-election Congressional session. If replenishment is not forthcoming, IDA will exhaust its commitment authority
in March, and it will have no resources with which to meet the rising




203

requirements of the low-income countries it serves. Speedy action by
the new Congress is therefore essential.

A different set of concerns arises for other developing countries
such as the exporters of manufactured goods whose long-term deficit
financing has come to a large extent from the private capital markets.
For them it is obviously critical, first, whether the slowdown in longterm bank lending since 1978 is a "pause" that will shortly be reversed or a more permanent development; and, second, whether official resourcesâ€”on which the poorer countries often have first
claimâ€”will be adequate to fill any remaining gap.
Private Financing

It is probable that the slowing of long-term bank lending to developing countries reflects both a greater unwillingness on the part of
the banks to lend and an increased reluctance on the part of some
developing countries to borrow. The relative importance of these two
factors is hard to establish. There is considerable evidence that a
number of developing countries have deferred borrowing. Whether
they have done so because of high interest rates or, perhaps more
critically, because they are unwilling to accept higher spreads over
the London interbank rate (LIBOR) is unclear. Higher spreads raise




204

the cost of the loans, and they may also be interpreted in the financial markets as evidence that the borrowers are less creditworthy than
countries borrowing at lower spreads. There are also clear indications of reluctance on the part of the banks to continue to increase
their exposure in developing countries, either because of portfolio
management considerations or because of pressures from bank examiners to limit and diversify risks. Numerous factors affect the willingness of banks to extend loans to particular countries. Chief among
these are the external debt which a country has already incurred and
judgments by potential lenders about the risk that a country may
become unable to service its debt.
The problem of country risk arises most acutely if borrowing is
perceived to lead to debt-service payments which can be managed
only by still larger borrowing in the future. Several implications flow
from this perspective.
First, the willingness of banks to continue lending depends importantly on their perception of the longer-run economic prospects of
the borrowing country. A country that borrows to finance consumptionâ€”including the consumption of petroleumâ€”is a riskier proposition than one borrowing to finance productive investment. The investment generates a return that can, in turn, be used to service the
debt.
Second, while the additional loan needs of many borrowers stem
from the need to pay for an increased oil bill, the ability to obtain
financing depends partly on how well the borrower is deemed to be
adjusting its economy to the reality of higher oil prices. To some
extent, the greater the signs of progress toward reducing oil imports
or expanding exports to pay for them, the easier it is to finance the
remaining deficit.
Third, banks* concerns about debt rescheduling may be an important influence on the pattern of lending, but the direction of influence is ambiguous. If countries which were unable to service all of
their external debts were to reschedule their official debts while continuing to meet payments to private lenders, the banks would have
little incentive to assess borrowers' long-term prospects, or to lend in
ways that foster appropriate adjustment by borrowers. Instead, banks
have a clear incentive for caution when they are required to participate in rescheduling and to bear some reasonable portion of the
burden. Banks are then more careful about making loans to countries
where the longer-term prospects are uncertain. For this reason, the
United States and other official creditors have insisted on requiring
countries experiencing debt crises to seek relief from private as well
as official creditors in order to assure a comparable sharing of burdens among all categories of creditors. When rescheduling is unat-




205

tractive to banks, however, a somewhat contradictory possibility
arises: banks can defer rescheduling by continuing to lend. Delay
may enable both borrower and lender to ride out a troubled period,
but it can also exacerbate the troubles to be faced later on. Of
course, banks' willingness to postpone rescheduling in this manner is
limited by the increased risks involved. Furthermore, bank examination proceduresâ€”particularly in the United States and increasingly in
other countries as wellâ€”are designed to signal the emergence of excessive exposure to risk.
Fourth, the future scope for bank lending will depend strongly on
the continued expansion of world trade and the ability of developing
countries to participate fully in that expansion. If export opportunities are blocked, then even borrowing for productive investment may
not be sustainable because such investment may not yield, either directly or indirectly, enough foreign exchange to service the debt.
Conversely, with ample trade opportunities, developing countries can
earn the foreign exchange that enables them not only to service existing debt but also to demonstrate their continuing dependability as
borrowers. This interaction provides one of the major avenues for
developing countries to accelerate adjustment without sacrificing
longer-run growth prospects.
Although it is possible to set forth in general terms the considerations that will determine the extent of private bank lending to the
developing countries, it is impossible to predict with any precision or
confidence the extent to which the recent pause in long-term lending
will be reversed. On balance, the likelihood of somewhat reduced
growth in private lending is high enough to place great importance
upon the role of official agencies like the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
Official Financing

Over the past year, the ability of the IMF and the World Bank to
take the lead in promoting financing and adjustment patterns that
are appropriate in current economic circumstances has been
strengthened. The resources available to these institutions have been
increased, and their operating procedures have been modified.
The role of the IMF has been substantially enhanced. A 50-percent
increase in quotas, negotiated in 1978, went into effect on January 1
of this year. It will raise substantially the liquid resources available to
the Fund over the coming years. Beyond this, the IMF is exploring
the possibility of further increasing its resources by borrowingâ€”first
from member countries, particularly OPEC countries with large surpluses, but, if appropriate, from private sources as well. While such
borrowing could not, and should not, supplant quotas as the primary
source of Fund liquidity, it could play an important supporting role.




206

At the same time, access to the IMF by countries facing actual or
incipient balance of payments difficulties has also been substantially
increased. The quota increase itself has this effect, and it has been
complemented by adaptations in the structure of Fund lending programs. The adaptations effectively increase the cumulative amounts
that countries can borrow in relation to their quotas and lengthen
the adjustment period for IMF supported programs. Finally, increased emphasis is being placed on structural considerations in the
formulation of IMF stabilization and adjustment programs.
World Bank resources have also increased, albeit without full U.S.
participation. In the last days of its 1980 session, Congress did appropriate $328 million toward the Bank's 1977 Selective Capital Increase. But the Congress has yet to approve the U.S. share of the
1980 General Capital Increase. This increase went into effect in October 1980 with the formal agreement of 75 percent of the Bank's
voting power.
The World Bank, too, has modified its programs in the past year.
While continuing to expand its traditional project and sector lending,
the Bank has begun to develop a new type of lending program aimed
specifically at structural adjustment. This lending is intended to complement the shorter-term borrowing that countries engage in for balance of payments reasons with long-term funding to restructure
economies in ways that will strengthen their underlying external positions. Furthermore, ways are actively being soughtâ€”perhaps through
a new energy affiliate of the Bankâ€”to increase sharply the resources
available for energy exploration and development in developing
countries. Over time, the resulting increase in domestic energy availability will tend to ease the financial burden of developing countries
by lowering their oil imports. Increased world supplies and more
suppliers may also make future energy price shocks less likely.
The extent to which the official institutions will be able to meet the
future financing needs of the non-oil developing countries will
depend in part upon the size of the gap which must be filled after
private financing and bilateral assistanceâ€”particularly OPEC assistance for oil-deficit countriesâ€”has been accounted for. The size of
this gap is very difficult to predict. But the recent expansion in the
resources of the official institutions and their demonstrated capacity
to adapt to changing needs suggest that they are capable of dealing
with a very wide range of possible problems.
CHALLENGES TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE RELATIONS
The progressive dismantling of trade restrictions during the postWorld War II period and the resulting rapid growth of world trade




207

were of central importance to the worldwide rise in prosperity during
the 1950s and 1960s. But the open trading system has come under
increasing pressure in the 1970s. Economic growth has slowed, unemployment rates have risen, and the balance of payments positions
of oil-importing countries have deteriorated. As a result, protectionist
sentiments have strengthened, and the promotion of exports has
become a more explicit aim in many countries. Furthermore, mounting structural difficulties in a number of key sectors have encouraged
the view that cartelization or market-sharing agreements among
countries can ease the burdens of adjustment. As a consequence, the
climate for trade has become more clouded despite the ratification in
1979 of the agreements reached in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. These agreements strengthen the international trading system
by limiting the use of trade-restrictive practices and improving the
mechanisms for the settlement of disputes and thus represent an important step forward. They are unlikely to prevent an intensification
of trade frictions, however, if the underlying commitment of governments to open trade is eroded.
An important but perhaps inevitable cause of the emergence of a
more difficult environment for trade is the decline in the relative
dominance of the United States in the world economy. In the early
post-World War II period the United States was in a strong position
to promote a more liberal trading order without much regard to
strict reciprocity. Because imports constituted only a small share of
the U.S. market, the growth in imports that freer trade entailed was
not viewed as disruptive. At the same time, the demand for U.S. exports was strong because foreign production capacities had been
damaged by the war and because American goods embodied technologies not available elsewhere. Thus, open trade was not perceived as
a threat to the overall U.S. trade position. For other countries, on the
other hand, the promise of increased access to the vast U.S. market
made the opening of their own borders to imports seem a favorable
exchange.
While the conditions that made it so easy to support no longer
prevail, open trade nevertheless confers substantial benefits on the
world economy. Preservation of an open trading system must therefore become a truly multilateral effort and the shared responsibility
of the major trading nations. It is probable that few governments
today can effectively resist taking actions to redress what are viewed
domestically as the unfair trade practices of others. All countries
must therefore practice self-restraint, not only in the traditional sense
of minimizing protectionist measures against imports, but also in
avoiding measures that artificially promote exports at the expense of
other countries. It must be recognized that the only real alternative




208

to closer cooperation is to risk a cycle of trade retaliation that would
leave all countries substantially worse off.
Three specific challenges to open trade are taken up in the following pages: the heightened pressures to use trade barriers to save domestic jobs, the increased use of direct and indirect subsidies to promote exports, and the emerging reliance on market-sharing arrangements to ease adjustment.
PROTECTION AND EMPLOYMENT

The pressure to protect domestic sectors from import competition
is, to a large degree, a pressure to preserve jobs. Imports are seen as
substituting foreign for domestic employment and income abroad for
income at home. This pressure increases when economic growth
slows and unemployment levels rise, since alternative employment
possibilities are reduced.
Job losses of course occur continually within an economy as some
sectors contract. But meanwhile new jobs are being created in expanding sectors. International trade is but one of the pressures
behind such shifts. Indeed; the evidence suggests quite strongly that,
at least in the United States, changes in consumer demands and differential productivity gains from capital investment and technological
change have been far more important than increased imports in accounting for relative employment declines in lagging sectors.
But regardless of the source from which the pressures for adjustment come, intersectoral shifts in employment cannot be achieved
without transition costs. The skills no longer needed in declining sectors may not match the skills required in growing sectors. The regional distribution of employment opportunities may shift, but workers may not be in a position to move. And, even if workers who lose
jobs find new ones, their wages and job satisfaction may be lower if
specialized skills acquired over many years are made obsolete. The
more rapid the pace of adjustment, furthermore, the greater these
transition costs will be, since less of the adjustment can then be accomplished through natural employee attrition and ongoing demographic shifts. Because of transition costs, governments are often
tempted to intervene in an attempt to slow the pace of adjustment.
Such policies can perhaps be justified when the pressure for rapid
adjustment is very strong or when it is thought that the pressure will
subsequently be reversed. The risk is, however, that government efforts to ease adjustment may have the effect of deferring or preventing it. Experience suggests that this has often been the case. Such
outcomes are costly. Although transition costs are avoided for a time,
productivity is impaired, inefficiency is increased, inflationary pres-




209

sures are strengthened, and in the longer term employment too may
suffer.
In seeking a balance between justified intervention to reduce transition costs and undue protection of uneconomic sectors, careful assessment of the broad range of costs and benefits is needed. This is
particularly the case with regard to the use of trade-restrictive policies, for three reasons.
First, pressure to restrict imports can easily arise even when imports are not themselves the major threat to existing jobs because
the tools are more readily at hand to restrict imports than to deal
with other adjustment problems. In the United States the President
has considerable discretionary power to impose trade restrictionsâ€”
subject, however, to prior findings of injury by the International
Trade Commission. In other countries too, import restriction is generally easier to implement than adjustment policies requiring government budget resources.
Second, there is mounting evidence that trade protection is a very
expensive way to preserve jobs. In case after case that has been examined, the cost to consumers per job savedâ€”that is, the extra costs
faced by consumers in the form of higher prices when imports are
restrictedâ€”has turned out to be at least several times higher than an
average worker's income. Although these consumer costs are large in
the aggregate, in no one instance do they seem large on a per capita
basis. As a consequence they are not highly visible and therefore easy
to overlook.
Finally, trade restriction, like other forms of domestic protection
but more clearly so, impairs employment prospects over the longer
run. Jobs saved in the protected sectors are saved in part at the expense of jobs elsewhere in the domestic economy. Higher prices for
protected goods reduce consumers' ability to purchase other goods,
and thereby limit employment growth. If imports are restrained,
export opportunities and employment in the export sector are also
reducedâ€”directly if foreign countries retaliate, and indirectly even if
they do not, because the exchange rate tends to appreciate to restore
balance between exports and imports over the longer term. Moreover, trade restrictions increase prices directly and further exacerbate
inflation by limiting productivity growth. As a result, the ability of
governments to pursue expansive policies to support employment is
further reduced. Thus the jobs saved by trade restrictions are likely
to be matched by job losses elsewhere. As is so often the case, however, the jobs saved are immediate, specific, and highly visible; the
jobs lost are in the future, diffused throughout the economy, and
almost invisible.




210

While all countries, in attempting to balance long-term gains
against short-term pressures, may find the need for trade-restrictive
actions compelling from time to time, the risks are that such policies
will be resorted to excessively. These risks become considerably
larger to the extent that other countries aggressively use subsidies to
promote exports. The following section takes up this issue.
EXPORT SUBSIDIES

Countries subsidize exports directly or indirectly for a variety of
reasons. Faster export growth is seen as a way of overcoming the balance of payments deficits that higher oil bills have caused for many
countries. Subsidies may form part of an industrial strategy to promote the growth of key sectors and to exploit economies of scale
when they dictate a global marketing approach. Subsidies may also
be a counterpart to other policies, for instance, policies to limit
excess capacity and job losses in declining sectors by selling abroad.
Subsidies to exports can also arise indirectlyâ€”for instance, from domestic policies that keep the price of energy, and hence the cost of
production in energy-intensive sectors, artificially low. Or they can
arise when investment incentives to particular regions or industries
reduce the cost of capital to firms that produce certain goods.
The Subsidies Code that was negotiated in the Multilateral Trade
Negotiations places certain restrictions on the use of subsidies and
permits the adoption of countervailing duties in cases where subsidies can be shown to cause injury to trading partners. However,
given the various and often complex forms that subsidies can take,
and the fact that subsidies of exports may often arise as by-products
of policies directed at domestic goals, the Code by itself is unlikely
fully to resolve the problems that subsidies sometimes create. Selfrestraint among countries in the use of subsidies is therefore necessary. Two considerations are of critical importance in this regard.
First, subsidies often end up losing their effectiveness in promoting
exports. Initially, profits and employment in a subsidized activity will
increase and a competitive advantage will emerge. Gradually, however, the extra profits that are created by the subsidy may be diluted by
higher wages for the workers in that activity, orâ€”if the activity is a
large user of scarce resourcesâ€”in higher prices for those resources.
A familiar example is the bidding up of the price of farm land suitable for a particular crop when the price of that crop is supported by
the government at higher levels. The bidding up of costs of production in this way ultimately tends to eliminate the competitive advantage that the subsidy provides, thus increasing pressures for yet further subsidization to restore the advantage and making removal of
the subsidy increasingly difficult.




211

Second, the pressure for countries to match the subsidies provided
by other countries means that the opportunity to increase market
shares through subsidies is far less than it appears to each country in
isolation. This consideration is particularly important in the area of
export-credit subsidization, which has increased sharply in recent
years. Most of the major industrial countries have official exportcredit agencies that provide medium and long-term financing at fixed
rates of interest for "big ticket" exports, such as power plants, aircraft, and manufacturing plants. These interest rates have not risen
in step with rises in market rates, thus greatly increasing the subsidy
element of such trade financing. Yet, because export agencies in all
countries are under pressure to match or perhaps improve on the
terms provided by others so as to help secure the sale for a domestic
producer, the likely result is a costly standoff, with global overcapacity in subsidized sectors persisting. The heads of state of the major
countries made a specific commitment at the Venice Summit in June
of last year to bring export-credit rates more closely into line with
market rates. Efforts to renegotiate an export-credit agreement based on this commitment failed, but negotiations may resume
this year. In some countriesâ€”particularly some members of the European Communityâ€”it may not be clearly perceived how wasteful
and counterproductive export-credit subsidies are.
MARKET SHARING

Antitrust laws in the United States prohibit firms from attempting
to divide up markets by allocating market shares, formally or informally. The anticompetitive and price-raising consequences of such arrangements are well known. On an international level, however, there
are increasing temptations for governments themselves to develop or
to bless such market-sharing arrangements for sectors facing structural difficulties. The Multi-fiber Agreement, which sets a framework
within which individual countries have negotiated a complex system
of quotas on textile and apparel imports, is an example. Relatively
longstanding agreements exist with respect to shipbuilding. The
issue of automobile imports, so important in the United States, has
also been of great interest and concern internationallyâ€”and indeed
informal or formal industry agreements between European and Japanese auto producers are widespread.
The temptation to "organize** world markets when adjustment
pressures arise is understandable. If a number of countries need to
adjust, the pressures to assure that each country bears its fair share
of the adjustment burden are powerful. Negotiated arrangements
may appear both more effective and less confrontational than the use
of formal grievance procedures under the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs (GATT). As short-term responses to serious




212

threats of disruption, market-sharing arrangements may indeed be
preferred if the alternative is a resort to predatory behavior.
There are serious risks, however, in following this course. First, the
substitution of informal, ad hoc agreements for the more formal
mechanisms of the GATT reduces the transparency of the trading
system. The "rules of the game" become more complex and less visible to public scrutiny, and procedures for redress become uncertain.
Second, such agreements may perpetuate themselves. In seeking to
assure that adjustment is fairly distributed, they may in fact delay the
needed adjustments and perpetuate the excess capacities that gave
rise to the problem in the first place. Finally, such arrangements, by
requiring balance among countries in the degree of adjustment,
almost always guarantee that it is not the least efficient capacity
which is eliminated.
NEEDED RESPONSES

Pressures on all countries to use trade policies to promote shorterterm gains for particular sectors, to ease the process of adjustment,
or to protect jobs in sensitive areas will almost certainly remain
acute. It is also quite certain that in some cases such pressures will
not be resisted. Indeed a simon-pure attitude is unwarranted on the
part of any country, and unrealistic when other countries also yield to
such pressures. From a broader perspective, however, it is highly important to keep restrictive trade policies within circumscribed limits.
First, the achievement of both higher exports and lower imports is
not feasibleâ€”strictly so for the world as a whole, and to a very large
extent for individual countries. The only effective choice is one between slow trade growth or more rapid trade growth, and the historical record makes clear that the latter is to be preferred. Second, it is
imperative to aim for consistency in the formulation of policy. The
overriding need in all countries is to reduce the current inflation, and
also to reduce the inflation-proneness of economies that have
become more inflexible and less competitive. Trade policies that aim
for short-term protection intensify inflation directly by reducing competitive pressures, and they increase economic rigidities by sheltering
excessive wages, profits, and other incomes in particular sectors from
the discipline of the market. Better integration of trade policy into
overall economic policy formulation is needed in all countries to provide a clearer perspective on its real costs and benefits.

Appendix A
REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT ON THE ACTIVITIES
OF THE
COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS DURING 1980




215




LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL
COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS,

Washington, D.C, December 31, 1980.
MR. PRESIDENT:

The Council of Economic Advisers submits this report on its activities during the calendar year 1980 in accordance with the requirements of the Congress, as set forth in section 10(d) of the Employment Act of 1946 as amended by the Full Employment and Balanced
Growth Act of 1978.
Cordially,
CHARLES L. SCHULTZE, Chairman




GEORGE C. EADS
STEPHEN M. GOLDFELD

217




Report to the President on the Activities of the
Council of Economic Advisers during 1980
The Council of Economic Advisers was established by the Employment Act of 1946 to provide economic analysis and advice to the
President and thus to assist in the development and implementation
of national economic policies. The Council also advises the President
with regard to decisions on other matters that affect the health and
operations of the Nation's economy.
The enactment of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act
of 1978â€”the Humphrey-Hawkins Actâ€”substantially revised the chartering legislation of the Council of Economic Advisers for the first
time since 1946. This revision left unchanged the basic mission of
the Council of Economic Advisers but created a new framework for
the government's pursuit of its economic policies. This act and its requirements were discussed in detail in the 1979 Economic Report.
Charles L. Schultze, Chairman, and George C. Eads, Member, continued to serve in these positions throughout 1980. On May 27,
1980, Lyle E. Gramley resigned to become a Governor on the Board
of the Federal Reserve System. On August 20, 1980, Stephen M.
Goldfeld became a Member of the Council. Mr. Goldfeld was formerly Professor of Economics at Princeton University.
RESPONSIBILITIES
The responsibilities of the Council of Economic Advisers have
grown steadily as new economic problems have placed new demands
on the Council and its staff. Over the last decade especially, the
growing recognition that many "noneconomic" decisions have major
consequences for our economy has led to a broadening of the Council's activities. Today, the Council is responsible for advising the
President not only on Federal fiscal policies but also on policies affecting specific sectors of the economy, on regulation and regulatory
reform, on energy policies, and on international economic policies.

MACROECONOMIC POLICIES
From the outset, the Council's fundamental role has been to advise
the President on comprehensive economic policies designed to
achieve the government's objectives for price stability, employment,
and output. To fulfill this responsibility the Council develops economic forecasts several times each year with the assistance of an
Interagency Forecasting Committee. The members of this Committee
include, in addition to the Council, representatives from the Office of
Management and Budget and the Departments of the Treasury,
Commerce, and Labor. This group, which is chaired by a Member of
the Council, meets to analyze the outlook for individual sectors of
the economy and to develop detailed economic forecasts for the
period immediately ahead. The Chairman of the Council presents
these forecasts to the Economic Policy Group (EPG), which is made
up of the President's principal economic advisers and meets each
week to discuss and develop the Administration's proposals touching
on economic policy. The Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers is a member of the EPG and of its steering group.




220

In the final months of each year, during the preparation of the
President's annual budget, the Council works with other members of
the EPG to develop and present to the President proposals for both
the stance and the design of Federal fiscal policies during the coming
fiscal year. The Council monitors the progress of the economy and
offers advice on when changes in fiscal policies are in order. Advising
the President on macroeconomic policy has remained one of the
Council's major responsibilities.
The Chairman of the Council took an active role in the March
budget revisions, in the decision to invoke the Credit Control Act,
and in the design of other steps taken at that time to halt inflationary
expectations.
In addition, the Council continued its involvement in the program
of voluntary pay and price standards, including monitoring the progress of the second program year. On November 12 the Chairman of
the Council of Economic Advisers resumed the position of Chairman
of the Council on Wage and Price Stability.
During the late spring and summer, the Council actively participated in the development and presentation of the Administration's Economic Revitalization Program.
The Chairman of the Council also chairs the Interagency Committee on Housing and Housing Finance. In 1980 the Council again coordinated special surveys of the conditions in housing markets.
The Council co-chaired with the Office of Management and
Budget a congressionally mandated study on the indexing of Federal
programs. The Council chaired the subgroup on issues involved in
the choice of an index. This report will be presented to the Congress
at the beginning of 1981.
MICROECONOMIC POLICIES
The Council of Economic Advisers has become increasingly involved in the analysis of microeconomic issuesâ€”the economic developments and the policy actions that affect individual industries, markets, or sectors of the economy. In 1980 the Council took part in formulating and articulating the Administration's policies on agriculture,
energy, hospital cost containment, industrial adjustment, regulation,
regulatory reform, and international trade.
Especially important in 1980 were the interagency studies of the
automobile and steel industries. The Council took an active role in
these studies and in the development of policy responses to problems in these two industries. In addition, the Council is a major participant in an ongoing study of the potential economic consequences
of, and policy responses to, a major oil-supply disruption.
In 1980 the Council continued to chair the Regulatory Analysis
Review Group (RARG). This interagency group was created late in


http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/ - 81 - 15 : QL 3
333-5H0 0
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis

221

1977 to review selected analyses of the economic effects of major
regulatory proposals. The President has ordered that each major regulatory proposal issued by a nonindependent regulatory agency must
be accompanied by a regulatory analysis. The agency originating the
proposal develops the analysis and makes it available in draft form
for public comment before the final regulation is issued. During the
period for public comment the Regulatory Analysis Review Group
evaluates a select few of these regulatory analyses and files its appraisal in the agency's record of public comment.
In 1980 eight regulations were reviewed by RARG: the Environmental Protection Agency's air carcinogen policy, its guidelines for
water effluents in the leather tanning and finishing industry, its visibility regulations for Federal Class I areas, and its ambient air quality
standards for carbon monoxide; the Department of Energy's building
energy performance standards and its consumer appliance energy efficiency standards; the Department of Education's rules concerning
the education of students not proficient in English, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's revisions of its minimum
property standards. At year's end the Environmental Protection
Agency's premanufacture notification requirements for new chemical
substances were being reviewed. Together with the staff of the Council on Wage and Price Stability, the Council's staff served as the analytic staff for the RARG. In addition, the Council and the staff continued their active involvement in proposed regulatory reform legislation and in the development of administrative means to lessen the
burden of regulation.
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICIES
During 1980 the Council of Economic Advisers again took an
active part in international economic affairs. The Chairman of the
Council continued to serve as Chairman of the Economic Policy
Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). As such, he chaired two meetings of senior economic officials from OECD member governments to assess appropriate economic policies following the sharp rise in energy prices and to
achieve improved policy coordination among countries.
In consultation with senior officials from other countries, the
Chairman also prepared a position paper on economic policy issues
for the Venice Summit.
The Council is active in the OECD Economic Policy Committee's
working parties on short-term economic prospects, balance of payments adjustment, and macroeconomic structural and policy analysis.
Council Members or staff economists represent the U.S. government
at periodic meetings of these working parties during the year.




222

A Member of the Council represents the U.S. government at meetings of the OECD Special High-Level Group on Positive Adjustment
Policies, and in 1980 made an extended presentation on U.S. structural policies to this group. He also chairs a task force of the Special
Group that has been examining the alternatives used by governments
to identify and evaluate subsidies.
PUBLIC INFORMATION
The annual Economic Report is the principal medium through which
the Council informs the public of its work and its views. It is also an
important vehicle for presenting and explaining the Administration's
economic policies, both domestic and international. Distribution of
the Report in recent years has averaged about 50,000 copies. The
Council also assumes primary responsibility for the monthly Economic
Indicators, a publication prepared by the Council's Statistical Office,
under the supervision of Catherine H. Furlong. The Joint Economic
Committee issues the Indicators, which has a distribution of approximately 10,000 copies. Information is also provided to members of
the public through speeches and other public appearances by the
Chairman, Members, and staff economists of the Council. Finally, in
1980 the Chairman and Members made 13 appearances before Committees of the Congress to testify on the Administration's economic
policies.
ORGANIZATION AND STAFF OF THE COUNCIL
OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN
The Chairman is responsible for communicating the results of the
Council's work and for providing advice to the President. This duty
is performed through discussions with the President and in written
reports on economic developments. The Chairman also represents
the Council at Cabinet meetings and at many other formal and informal meetings of government officials. He exercises ultimate responsibility for directing the work of the professional staff. On November
12, 1980, the Chairman replaced Alfred E. Kahn, who had resigned,
as Chairman of the Council on Wage and Price Stability.
COUNCIL MEMBERS
The two Council Members directly supervise the work of the
Council's professional staff and are responsible for all subject matter
studied by the Council. They represent the Council at numerous
meetings of public and private groups, and they assume major responsibility for the Council's involvement in the activities of the government that affect the economy.




223

The Chairman and the Council Members work together on most
policy issues. Operationally, however, responsibility over major topics
of concern is divided between the two Members. Mr. Eads has supervised microeconomic analysis, including analysis of policies related to
such matters as energy, agriculture, social welfare, and international
trade. Mr. Eads also oversees regulatory reform activities. Mr. Goldfeld has the primary responsibility for macroeconomic analysis, including international monetary developments and the preparation of
economic forecasts, and for labor market policies.
PROFESSIONAL STAFF
At the end of 1980 the professional staff consisted of the Special
Assistant to the Chairman, the Senior Statistician, 12 senior and staff
economists, and 5 junior staff economists.

preparation of all statistical matter in the Economic Report. She also
oversees the verification of statistics in memoranda, testimony, and
speeches. Natalie V. Rentfro, Earnestine Reid, and Barbara L. Sibel
assist Mrs. Furlong.
In preparing the Economic Report the Council relied upon the editorial assistance of John Phillip Sawicki. Also called on for special assistance in connection with the Report was Dorothy Bagovich.
SUPPORTING STAFF
The Administrative Office of the Council of Economic Advisers
provides general support for the Council's activities. Nancy F. Skidmore, Administrative Officer, prepares and analyzes the Council's
budget and provides general administrative services.
Elizabeth A. Kaminski, Staff Assistant to the Council, handles general personnel management, coordinates the schedule for the Economic Report, and provides general assistance to the Council and the Special Assistant in the management of the Council's activities.
Members of the secretarial staff for the Chairman and Council

Stockdale, and Alice H. Williams. Secretaries for the professional
staff were Catherine Fibich, Bessie M. Lafakis, Joyce A. Pilkerton,
Margaret L. Snyder, and Lillie M. Sturniolo. Elizabeth A. Cralle provided secretarial assistance during the summer months and during
the preparation of the Report. Joseph Henley served as a clerk during
the preparation of the Report.
DEPARTURES
The Council's professional staff members are in most cases on
leave from universities, other government agencies, or research institutions. Their tenure with the Council is usually limited to 1 or 2
years. Senior staff economists who resigned during the year were
Paul N. Courant (University of Michigan), K. Burke Dillon (International Monetary Fund), David Harrison, Jr. (Harvard University),
David S. McClain (Boston University), V. Vance Roley (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City), Daniel H. Saks (National Commission for
Employment Policy), and Charles L. Trozzo (George Washington

'The term family refers to a group of two or more persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption and residing together; all such
persons are considered members of the same family.
2
Data for "black" include "other" races.
3
Revised using population controls based on the 1970 census. Such controls are not available by race.
4
Based on revised methodology; comparable with succeeding years.
9
Based on householder concept. Restricted to primary families.
â€¢The term "unrelated individuals" refers to persons 15 years old and over as of March 1980 and 14 years old and over for previous
years (other than inmates of institutions) who are not living with any relatives.
.. Note.â€”The poverty level is based on the poverty index adopted by a Federal interagency committee in 1969. That index reflects
different consumption requirements for families based on size and composition, sex and age of family householder, and farm-nonfarm

Not seasonally adjusted.
Civilian labor force as percent of civilian noninstitutionaf population.
Not strictly comparable with earlier data due to population adjustments as follows: Beginning 1953, introduction of 1950 census
data added about 600,000 to population and about 350,000 to labor force, total employment, and agricultural employment. Beginning
1960, inclusion of Alaska and Hawaii added about 500,000 to population, about 300,000 to labor force, and about 240,000 to
nonagricultural employment. Beginning 1962, introduction of 1960 census data reduced population by about 50,000 and labor force and
employment by about 200,000. Beginning 1972, introduction of 1970 census data added about 800,000 to civilian noninstitutional
population and about 333,000 to labor force and employment. A subsequent adjustment based on 1970 census in March 1973 added
60,000 to labor force and to employment. Beginning 1978, changes in sampling and estimation procedures introduced into the
household survey added about 250,000 to labor force and to employment. Unemployment levels and rates were not significantly
affected.

Note.â€”Data in Tables B-35 through 8-37 are based on reports from employing establishments and relate to full- and parttime wage and salary workers in nonagricultural establishments who worked during or received pay for any part of the pay
period which includes the 12th of the month. Not comparable with labor force data (Tables B-27 through B-33), which include
proprietors, self-employed persons, domestic servants, and unpaid family workers,* which count persons as employed when they
are not at work because of industrial disputes, bad weather, etc., even if they are not paid for the time off; and which are
based on a sample of the working-age population. For description and details of the various establishment data, see
"Employment and Earnings."

Reserves of depository institutions series reflect actual reserve requirement percentages with no adjustment to eliminate the effect
of changes in Regulations D and M. Prior to November 13, 1980, the date of implementation of the Monetary Control Act, only the
reserves of commercial banks that were members of the Federal Reserve System were included in the series. Since that date the series
include the reserves of all depository institutions. In conjunction with the implementation of the act, required reserves of member
banks were reduced about $4.3 billion and required reserves of other depository institutions were increased about $1.4 billion. Effective
October 11, 1979, an 8 percentage point marginal reserve requirement was imposed on "managed liabilities". This action raised
required reserves about $320 million. Effective March 12, 1980, the 8 percentage point marginal reserve requirement was raised to 10
percentage points. In addition the base upon which the marginal reserve requirement was calculated was reduced. This action increased
required reserves about $1.7 billion in the week ending April 2, 1980. Effective May 29, 1980, the marginal reserve requirement was
reduced from 10 to 5 percentage points and the base upon which the marginal reserve requirement was calculated was raised. This
action reduced required reserves about $980 million in the week ending June 18, 1980. Effective July 24, 1980, the 5 percent marginal
reserve requirement on managed liabilities and the 2 percent supplementary reserve requirement against large time deposits were
removed. These actions reduced required reserves about $3.2 billion.
2
Reserve balances with Federal Reserve Banks plus vault cash at institutions with required reserve balances plus vault cash equal to
required reserves at other institutions.
3
Includes reserve balances at Federal Reserve Banks in the current week plus vault cash held two weeks earlier used to satisfy
reserve requirements at all depository institutions plus currency outside the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve Banks, the vaults of
depository institutions, and surplus vault cash at depository institutions.
4
Reserve aggregates series have been adjusted to remove discontinuities associated with the implementation of the Monetary Control
Act, marginal reserve requirements, the inclusions of Edge Act Corporation reserves, and other changes in Regulations D, K, and M.
5
Reserve measures beginning November reflect increases in required reserves associated with the reduction of weekend avoidance
activities of a few large banks. The reduction in these activities leads to essentially a one-time increase in the average level of required
reserves that need to be held for a given level of deposits entering the money supply. In November, this increase in required reserves is
estimated at $550 to $600 million.

Installment credit covers most short- and intermediate-term credit extended to individuals through regular business channels,
usually to finance the purchase of consumer goods and services or to refinance debts incurred for such purposes, and scheduled to be
repaid (or with the option of repayment) in two or more installments.
2
Consists of credit cards at retailers, gasoline companies, and commercial banks, and check credit at commercial banks. Prior to
1968, included in "other," except gasoline companies, included in noninstallment credit prior to 1971. Beginning 1977, includes openend credit at retailers, previously included in ''other. Also beginning 1977, some retail credit was reclassified from commercial into
consumer credit. Credit secured by real estate is generally excluded.
3
Not reported separately prior to July 1970.
4
Because of inconsistencies in the data and infrequent benchmarking, series on noninstallment credit is no longer published by the
Federal Reserve Board on a regular basis. Data are shown here as a general indication of trends.
6
For installment credit, computed as the difference between extensions and liquidations (both seasonally adjusted); see also Table
B 67, For noninstallment credit, computed as the change from one month to another in the seasonally adjusted amount outstanding.
