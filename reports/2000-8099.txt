ECONOMIC REPORT
OF THE PRESIDENT

ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT
To the Congress of the United States:

Today, the American economy is stronger than ever. We are on the brink
of marking the longest economic expansion in our Nations history. More
than 20 million new jobs have been created since Vice President Gore and I
took office in January 1993. We now have the lowest unemployment rate in
30 years—even as core inflation has reached its lowest level since 1965.
This expansion has been both deep and broad, reaching Americans of all
races, ethnicities, and income levels. African American unemployment and
poverty are at their lowest levels on record. Hispanic unemployment is likewise the lowest on record, and poverty among Hispanics is at its lowest level
since 1979. A long-running trend of rising income inequality has been halted in the last 7 years. From 1993 to 1998, families at the bottom of the
income distribution have enjoyed the same strong income growth as workers
at the top.
In 1999 we had the largest dollar surplus in the Federal budget on record
and the largest in proportion to our economy since 1951. We are on course
to achieve more budget surpluses for many years to come. We have used this
unique opportunity to make the right choices for the future: over the past 2
years, America has paid down $140 billion in debt held by the public. With
my plan to continue to pay down the debt, we are now on track to eliminate
the Nations publicly held debt by 2013. Our fiscal discipline has paid off in
lower interest rates, higher private investment, and stronger productivity
growth.
These economic successes have not been achieved by accident. They rest
on the three pillars of the economic strategy that the Vice President and I
laid out when we took office: fiscal discipline to help reduce interest rates
and spur business investment; investing in education, health care, and science and technology to meet the challenges of the 21st century; and opening
foreign markets so that American workers have a fair chance to compete
abroad. As a result, the American economy is not only strong today; it is well
positioned to continue to expand and to widen the circle of opportunity for
more Americans.

The Administration s Economic Strategy
Our economic strategy was based on a commitment, first, to fiscal discipline. When the Vice President and I took office, the U.S. Government had




a budget deficit of $290 billion. Today we have a surplus of $124 billion. This
fiscal discipline has helped us launch a virtuous circle of strong investment,
increasing productivity, low inflation, and low unemployment.
Second, we have remained true to our commitment to invest in our people.
Because success in the global economy depends more than ever on highly
skilled workers, we have taken concerted steps to make sure all Americans
have the education, skills, and opportunities they need to succeed. That is
why, even as we maintained fiscal responsibility, we expanded our investments
in education, technology, and training. We have opened the doors of college
to all Americans, with tax credits, more affordable student loans, education
IRAs, and the HOPE Scholarship tax credits. So that working families will
have the means to support themselves, we have increased the minimum wage,
expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), provided access to health
insurance for people with disabilities, and invested in making health insurance
coverage available to millions of children.
Third, we have continued to pursue a policy of opening markets. We have
achieved historic trade pacts such as the North American Free Trade
Agreement and the Uruguay Round agreements, which led to the creation of
the World Trade Organization. Negotiations in the wake of the Uruguay
Round have yielded market access commitments covering information technology, basic telecommunications, and financial services. We have engaged in
bilateral initiatives with Japan and in regional initiatives in Europe, Africa,
Asia, the Western Hemisphere, and the Middle East. We have also actively
protected our rights under existing trade agreements through the World Trade
Organization and helped maintain the Internet as a tax-free zone.

Meeting the Challenges of the Future
Despite the economy's extraordinary performance, we must continue
working to meet the challenges of the future. Those challenges include educating our children, improving the health and well-being of all our citizens,
providing for our senior citizens, and extending the benefits of the economic
expansion to all communities and all parts of this Nation.
We must help our children prepare for life in a global, information-driven
economy. Success in this new environment requires that children have a highquality education. That means safe, modern schools. It means making sure
our children have well-trained teachers who demand high standards. It means
making sure all schools are equipped with the best new technologies, so that
children can harness the tools of the 21st century.
First and foremost, our children cannot continue trying to learn in schools
that are so old they are falling apart. One-third of all public schools need
extensive repair or replacement. By 2003 we will need an additional 2,400
schools nationwide to accommodate these rising enrollments. That is why, in
4 I Economic Report of the President




my State of the Union address, I proposed $24.8 billion in tax credit bonds
over 2 years to modernize up to 6,000 schools, and a $1.3 billion school
emergency loan and grant proposal to help renovate schools in high-poverty,
high-need school districts.
Second, if our children are to succeed in the new digital economy, they
must know how to use the tools of the 21st century. That is why the Vice
President and I have fought for initiatives like the E-rate, which is providing
$2 billion a year to help schools afford to network their classrooms and connect to the Internet. The E-rate and our other initiatives in education technology have gone a long way toward giving all children access to technology in
their schools. But there is still a great "digital divide" when children go home.
Children from wealthy families are far more likely to have access to a computer at home than children from poor or minority families. That is why, in
my budget, I propose a new Digital Divide initiative that will expand support
for community technology centers in low-income communities; a pilot project to expand home access to computers and the Internet for low-income
families; and grants and loan guarantees to accelerate the deployment of
high-speed networks in underserved rural and urban communities.
Third, we must continue to make college affordable and accessible for all
Americans. I have proposed a college opportunity tax cut, which would invest
$30 billion over 10 years in helping millions of families who now struggle to
afford college for their children. When fully phased in, this initiative would
give families the option to claim a tax deduction or a tax credit on up to
$10,000 of tuition and fees for any postsecondary education in which their
members enroll, whether college, graduate study, or training courses. I have
proposed increases in Pell grants, Supplemental Educational Opportunity
Grants, and Work Study. I have also proposed creating new College Completion
Challenge Grants to encourage students to stay in college.
We have seen dramatic advances in health care over the course of the 20th
century, which have led to an increase in life expectancy of almost 30 years.
But much remains to be done to ensure that all have and maintain access to
quality medical care. That is why my budget expands health care coverage,
calls for passing a strong and enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights, strengthens
and modernizes Medicare, addresses long-term care, and continues to
promote life-saving research.
My budget invests over $110 billion over 10 years to improve the affordability, accessibility, and quality of health insurance. It will provide a new,
affordable health insurance option for uninsured parents as well as accelerate
enrollment of uninsured children who are eligible for Medicaid and the State
Children's Health Insurance Program. The initiative will expand health
insurance options for Americans facing unique barriers to coverage. For
example, it will allow certain people aged 55-65 to buy into Medicare, and it




Economic Report of the President I 5

will give tax credits to workers who cannot afford the full costs of COBRA
coverage after leaving a job. Finally, my initiative will provide funds to
strengthen the public hospitals and clinics that provide health care directly to
the uninsured. If enacted, this would be the largest investment in health coverage since Medicare was created in 1965, and one of the most significant
steps we can take to help working families.
As our Nation ages and we live longer, we face new challenges in Medicare
and long-term care. Despite improvements in Medicare in the past 7 years,
the program begins this century with the disadvantages of insufficient funding, inadequate benefits, and outdated payment systems. To strengthen and
modernize the program, I have proposed a comprehensive reform plan that
would make Medicare more competitive and efficient and invest $400 billion over the next 10 years in extending solvency through 2025 and adding
a long-overdue, voluntary prescription drug benefit.
The aging of America also underscores the need to build systems to provide long-term care. More than 5 million Americans require long-term care
because of significant limitations due to illness or disability. About two-thirds
of them are older Americans. That is why I have proposed a $27 billion
investment over 10 years in long-term care. Its centerpiece is a $3,000 tax
credit to defray the cost of long-term care. In addition, I propose to expand
access to home-based care, to establish new support networks for caregivers,
and to promote quality private long-term care insurance by offering it to
Federal employees at group rates.
We must continue to make this economic expansion reach out to every corner of our country, leaving no town, city, or Native American reservation
behind. That is why I am asking the Congress to authorize two additional
components of our New Markets agenda. The first is the New Markets Venture Capital Firms program, geared toward helping small andfirst-timebusinesses. The second is Americas Private Investment Companies, modeled on
the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, to help larger businesses expand
or relocate to distressed inner-city and rural areas. Overall the New Markets
initiative could spur $22 billion of new equity investment in our underserved
communities.
I am also proposing a new initiative called First Accounts, to expand access
tofinancialservices for low- and moderate-income Americans. We will work
with privatefinancialinstitutions to encourage the creation of low-cost bank
accounts for low-income families. We will help bring more automated teller
machines to safe places in low-income communities, such as the post office.
And we will educate Americans about managing household finances and
building assets over time.
To further increase opportunities for working families, I am proposing
another expansion of the EITC to provide tax relief for 6.4 million
6 I Economic Report of the President




hard-pressed families—with additional benefits for families with three or
more children. We have seen the dramatic effects that our 1993 expansion of
the EITC had in reducing poverty and encouraging work: 4.3 million people
were directly lifted out of poverty by the EITC in 1998 alone. More single
mothers are working than ever before, and the child poverty rate is at its
lowest since 1980.
Our initiatives to open overseas markets will continue. We have successfully
concluded bilateral negotiations on Chinas accession to the World Trade
Organization and now seek congressional action to provide China with permanent normal trade relations. The United States will also work to give the
least developed countries greater access to global markets. We will participate
in the scheduled multilateral talks to liberalize trade in services and agriculture
and will continue to press our trading partners to launch a new round of
negotiations within the World Trade Organization.
We have a historic opportunity to answer the challenges ahead: to increase
economic opportunity for all American families; to provide quality, affordable
child care, health care, and long-term care; and to give our children the best
education in the world. Working together, we can meet these great challenges
and make this new millennium one of ever-increasing promise, hope, and
opportunity for all Americans.

Sustaining a Record-Breaking Expansion

W£ /*&/ *A* ^zrgztf industrial economy, the largest agricultural economy, the highest per
capita income, the highest level of education. It must have been a wonderful time to be
alive for most Americans, not for everybody, but for most Americans....I don't think we

buoyancy, for the United States everything seemed to be going right.

T

he policy strategy of maintaining fiscal discipline, investing in people
and technologies, and opening international markets has borne rich
fruit, allowing the Nation to exploit new opportunities and reap the benefits
of major scientific and technical advances. The results have been a 20million-job increase in payroll employment since January 1993, the lowest
unemployment rate since 1969, the lowest core inflation rate since 1965, the
lowest poverty rate since 1979, rising productivity, significant gains all across
the income distribution, and a Federal budget in surplus for 2 years in a row
after nearly three decades of deficits. The current economic expansion,
already the longest peacetime expansion on record, is on the threshold of
becoming the longest ever. The mood of optimism that prevailed at the dawn
of the 20th century prevails today as well.

These successes notwithstanding, the challenges we face on the threshold
of the 21st century leave no room for complacency. Change is a constant in
the American economy and an essential part of its success, but that success
must be earned. Americas workers and businesses need to prepare for the
arrival of ever-newer technologies and new ways of doing business.
Economic policy must adapt as well. And even beneficial change,
unfortunately, can leave some people and localities behind. Today amid the
general prosperity, some groups and communities remain in poverty and
lack adequate health care coverage. Some workers may be displaced and see
their standards of living suffer. And many families, well off and not so well
off, are facing a time crunch as the demands of work compete with the
needs of their children.
Lengthening life spans reflect the improved health of Americans in
general, but together with changing demographics they present a major
challenge for Medicare and Social Security in the new century. Engagement in the world economy has been vital to our economic success, but we
have important work ahead in opening up markets and spreading the benefits of trade and investment more widely in the world. We also face the
challenge of keeping the economy growing while preserving our natural
environment.
In this first Economic Report of the President of the 21st century,* each
chapter starts with a look back at the economic history of the century just
ended and contrasts where Americans stood economically at the beginning
of the century with where we stand now. The report reviews those key
developments that offer enlightening perspectives on the century's achievements and that will help us concentrate our energies on the challenges to
come. We will celebrate the successes, try to understand their causes, and
draw from them lessons for facing future challenges.
This chapter starts with a look at U.S. economic performance over the
past century. That performance has been, in a word, astounding. But it has
also been uneven: in the first half of the century the economy endured a
series of recessions, which culminated in the Great Depression. Although
less severe, the variations in the second half of the century have also been
significant. In particular, the economy's momentum seemed to be lost during the 20 years after 1973. That momentum has been recovered in the
1990s. This chapter therefore also examines some of the distinctive features
of the 1990s expansion and the policies that have put it on track to be the
longest expansion in the Nation's history and will, we expect, sustain it well
into the future.

*This report follows popular convention in regarding the new century as having
begun on January 1, 2000.
22 I Economic Report of the President




Growth and Inequality:
A Century-Long Perspective
Over the past century the U.S. economy has recorded spectacular performance. It has found the 2 percent answer to the American dream: if living
standards rise at 2 percent annually, they double every 35 years. This means
that by the time they reach their mid-30s, parents can provide their children
with a standard of living that is twice the level that they themselves enjoyed
as children. By maintaining an annual average increase in gross national
product (GNP) per capita of about 2.1 percent over the whole century, the
U.S. economy exceeded this target (Chart 1-1). When incomes grow at this
pace, each generation experiences a far more affluent lifestyle than the
previous one, and over the course of a lifetime, Americans can expect, on
average, a fourfold increase in living standards.
How much richer are Americans today than at the turn of the century?
Despite the uncertainties in the data, it is clear that total growth of the economy has been remarkable. In 1999 the economy produced almost 30 times
the volume of goods and services that it did in 1899, and it employed about
5 times as many workers in doing so. (That it took 5 rather than 30 times as
many workers is tribute to another great accomplishment, namely, enormous
increases in productivity.) Measured in 1999 dollars, average income per
capita in 1899 was a little less than $4,200. With an average 1999 income of

$33,740, Americans today can acquire (and businesses can produce) more
than eight times as many goods and services as could Americans living in
1899. But this simple comparison grossly understates the true improvement
in living standards for three important reasons. First, it fails to fully account
for the vast array of goods and services that were simply unavailable in the
past: aircraft, antibiotics, air conditioners, radio and television, and computers, to name only a few. Second, it fails to account for a substantial increase
in leisure, as the typical workweek has fallen to 35 hours. Third, it fails to
account for the impact of the improved health of the population in raising
life expectancy from 47.3 years in 1900 to about 77 years today, while also
improving the quality of those added years. (However, the improvement in
living standards may be overstated to the extent that workers, particularly
women, have shifted from nonmarket work at home, which is not captured
in the GNP measure, to market activity, which is.)
Through sustained economic growth, the United States has been able to
accomplish much both at home and abroad. Although poverty rates still
remain too high, growth has been the driving force lifting many of the poorest members of society out of poverty. Growth has created more opportunities and made it much easier to tackle the challenges of supporting a growing
number of retirees. By maintaining solid growth, the United States moved to
a position of global economic leadership sometime near the start of the century and remains in that position today. Recent World Bank data show that
U.S. income per capita is 27 percent greater than income per capita in
Japan, and 47 percent greater than that in Germany (based on purchasing
power parities).
As Chapter 2 documents, progress over the century has not always been
smooth. In the century's first half, growth was punctuated by several deep
recessions and by the disaster of the Great Depression. Fewer workers were
employed in 1939 than in 1929. Nonetheless, despite economic instability
and two world wars, in the first 50 years of the century income per capita
more than doubled, and income inequality declined.

The Golden Years of Equitable Growth
The quarter century after World War II was a period of rapid increase in
productivity growth, and the resulting rise in living standards was remarkable. From the cyclical peak of 1948 to that of 1973, business sector output
per hour rose by more than 3 percent per year, as innovative technologies,
strong capital investment, and a more skilled and educated work force
proved mutually reinforcing (Chart 1-1). Recessions interrupted this growth,
but median family income rose by 3.0 percent per year on average, and the
gains were widely shared. The average income of the poorest fifth of families
rose 3.4 percent annually, whereas that of the top quintile grew at a 2.8
24 I Economic Report of the President




percent annual rate. On average, living standards in 1973 were 82 percent
higher than in 1948. These were years when the American dream seemed
achievable for all.

Growth Undermined: Stagflation, Rising Inequality,
and Deficits
The two decades after 1973 were a rude awakening. It appeared as if the
early postwar vision of continuously rising incomes for all had indeed been
just a dream. The economy's performance deteriorated noticeably in several
dimensions. First, there was much greater economic instability than in the
early postwar period. Spurred by rising oil prices, inflation jumped to 11
percent in 1974, and a deep recession followed. After a few years of recovery,
inflation then soared to new heights, hitting 13.5 percent in 1980. When, in
response, monetary policy made a dedicated effort to bring inflation under
control, the economy entered the deepest recession of the postwar period:
unemployment rose to 10.8 percent in November 1982. Between 1973 and
1983 the U.S. economy recorded average yearly inflation and unemployment
rates of 8.4 and 7.2 percent, respectively—this was the period of the infamous stagflation. The economy did grow strongly in the mid-1980s, but
exploding Federal deficits, caused by a lack offiscaldiscipline, together with
the crisis in the savings and loan industry, undermined that success. Inflation
again started to rise, and the economy was already teetering on the edge of
recession in 1990 when declining consumer confidence following the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait pushed it over the edge.
Second, growth in productivity lost its momentum. Between 1973 and
1990, growth in business sector output per hour rose at Wi percent per
year—about half its rate from 1948 to 1973. Slower productivity growth in
turn affected wages. Between 1973 and 1993, annual growth in real
compensation per hour averaged 0.8 percent. Real earnings declined at the
end of the 1980s expansion and continued to decline in the 1990-91
recession. The economy did sustain a 1.9 percent annual increase in income
per capita over the 1973-90 period, but this was due primarily to rapid labor
force growth as more women and baby-boomers went to work.
Third, the years between 1973 and 1993 also saw a marked increase in
inequality: not only were real income gains meager, but they were also
unevenly shared. Those at the top did far better than those at the bottom.
After adjusting for consumer price inflation, income for the top quintile of
families increased at a 1.3 percent annual pace, but growth was minimal for
the middle class and markedly negative for the less well off. These income
data were partly driven by developments in earnings: between 1979 and
1993, real earnings in the lowest decile declined by 0.6 percent, whereas




Chapter 1 I 25

those in the highest decile rose 0.3 percent. The premium earned by college
graduates over high school graduates increased from about 40 percent to 70
percent. Moreover, the dispersion of earnings increased even for
workers with similar education and demographic characteristics. Finally,
the poverty rate of 13.5 percent at the cyclical peak in 1990 was considerably
higher than at the peak in 1973.

The Return to Broad-Based Growth in a
Record-Breaking Expansion
The expansion that began hesitandy in 1991 found its stride and has been
sustained. It will in all likelihood have become the longest expansion in U.S.
history—107 months free of recession—in February 2000. Since the beginning
of 1993, payroll employment has increased by more than 20 million jobs. Boosted
by higher employment and faster productivity growth, output growth has been
strong, with GNP per capita rising at an average rate of 2.7 percent per year
between the first quarter of 1993 and the third quarter of 1999. Participation in
the labor force has increased to a record 67 percent of the working-age population, yet the annual unemployment rate has declined to 4.2 percent—a level not
seen in 30 years. After remaining sluggish in the early years of the expansion,
output per hour has accelerated, to an average annual growth rate of 2.8 percent
between the fourth quarter of 1995 and the third quarter of 1999. In response,
solid real compensation gains have been recorded (Chart 1-2).

26 I Economic Report of the President




The benefits of this growth have been widely shared as well. Some
observers focus on changes over a decade or two and conclude that inequality is still rising, but they ignore the recent trends. Between 1993 and 1998,
real average household incomes have grown by between 9.9 and 11.7 percent
for every quintile of the income distribution, and the median African American household has seen a 15 percent increase in real income. Between 1993
and 1998, family incomes in the lowest quintile rose at a 2.7 percent annual
rate, slightly faster than the 2.4 percent rate recorded by the top quintile
(Chart 1-3). This recent experience contrasts sharply with the performance
from 1973 to 1993. Similar breadth is evident in the growth of earnings.
Although wage inequality continued to widen through 1994, for the past 5
years weekly earnings growth has been broad-based.
The economy is increasingly providing workers with good employment
opportunities. A recent analysis by the Council of Economic Advisers and
the Department of Labor found that 81 percent of new jobs created from
1993 to 1999 are located in industry and occupation categories that pay
wages above the median. These good jobs have not gone only to the professional elite: even when professional occupations were excluded from the sample, the study found that 71 percent of new jobs were in categories paying
above the median wage. Nor are workers with college degrees the only ones
gaining ground. Among workers with only a high school education, an overwhelming proportion of job growth was found to occur in those industry
and occupation categories in which these workers earn the highest wages.

Data on poverty also show progress. The proportion of Americans living in
poverty fell from 15.1 percent in 1993 to 12.7 percent in 1998. The poverty
rate for African Americans in 1998, although still high at 26.1 percent, was
the lowest ever recorded, and that for Hispanics is the lowest it has been since
1979. Since 1993, African American unemployment has declined from 13.0
percent to 8.0 percent, and Hispanic unemployment has fallen from 10.7
percent to 6A percent. For both groups these represent the lowest rates on
record. Meanwhile the unemployment rate for females aged 16 and over has
dropped to 4.3 percent, the lowest in 46 years.
Data on the probability of job displacement, which showed a rise in the
late 1980s and early 1990s, show a drop since then. The share of all workers
with 3 or more years of job tenure who became displaced from their jobs was
3.9 percent in the 1991-92 period but declined to 2.9 percent in the 199596 period. And because the labor market has been so robust in the 1990s, the
rate of reemployment following displacement has been higher in this decade,
as have earnings after displacement, than at comparable levels of unemployment during the 1980s. Workers' fears of job loss have also eased in recent
years: the share of workers who believe they are likely to lose their jobs
declined from 12 percent in 1993 to 8 percent in 1998.

The Engines of the 1990s Expansion
The performance of the economy over this expansion has surprised most
observers. Two decades of slow growth and rising inequality have ended. In
their place is a record-breaking expansion that has brought strong and equitable growth. The gloomy view of long-term U.S. prospects so popular in the
1970s and 1980s has proved decidedly misguided. The record of the past 7
years suggests that it may be time to reappraise what one popular book at the
turn of the last decade called the Nation's "diminished expectations." Before
undertaking such a reappraisal, however, it is useful to identify the principal
engines of this expansion, and to see how these have resulted in an expansion
that is unusual in important respects from previous long expansions. In this
section we look at the policy and private sector drivers of growth under four
headings: technology; trade and competition; education and skills; and proinvestment policies.

Information and Other Technology
The economy is clearly in the ferment of rapid technological change (a
story documented in Chapter 3). One powerful contributor to the strength
of this expansion has been investment in plant and equipment, particularly

28 I Economic Report of the President




computers and information technology. Prices of computers and semiconductors, adjusted for quality improvements, have been falling particularly
rapidly. Investment in information processing equipment and software took
off in the 1990s, growing at a rate of 19 percent per year from 1993 to 1999
(Chart 1-4). More broadly, the share of real investment in GDP has risen
dramatically, as has the share of high-technology investment in total investment. Real spending on research and development (R&D) increased at an
estimated annual rate of 5 percent between 1993 and 1999.
For many years it seemed that the information technology revolution was not
paying off in higher productivity, but that now seems to be changing. Companies have learned to use the new technology to operate more efficiently. New
ways of producing and delivering goods and services have been developed. Venture capitalists provide both funds and expertise to new companies with bold
ideas. And of course, the improvements in communications technologies have
been as dramatic as those in computers. The diffusion and development of the
Internet promise continued productivity payoffs still to come.
The revolution in information technology is the most visible and probably
the most important technological trend, but it is far from the only one.
Materials science, biotechnology, and medical technology have all advanced
rapidly and are generating their own economic benefits. America hosts many
of the preeminent scientific research institutions in the world, which have
pioneered numerous advances and trained the people who are now leading
these technological revolutions.

Chapter 1 I 29

Over the years, government support of scientific research and education
has been a vital element in the success of U.S. technology. Going forward,
the increased funding proposed in the Presidents science and technology
initiative is important to sustaining growth in the years to come.

Competition and Trade
Industries in which companies compete vigorously tend to be more
productive. Conventional economic logic argues that companies operate efficiendy and innovate whenever there is the chance of a profit payoff. In practice,
however, companies can become complacent and keep doing things the old way
even when new, more profitable methods are available. The pressures of competition encourage change and force companies to adopt the more productive
methods. And even as it keeps the pressure on businesses to improve and innovate, competition exposes them to best-practice technologies that will help
them to do so.
Competition in the global economy adds benefits beyond those from
domestic competition. The economy benefits from trade as firms face new
incentives, and resources shift to the most productive industries. In addition,
companies that face global competition are exposed to best practices
worldwide, challenging them to reach for the highest possible performance
themselves. The U.S. economy has become increasingly open to overseas
trade in the course of this expansion. Indeed, its importance in GDP has
grown even more than in previous long expansions. Between 1991 and
1999, trade (measured as the sum of exports and imports) in goods and
services as a share of GDP rose by 4.8 percentage points, compared with
increases of 1.5 and 3.5 percentage points during the expansions of the
1960s and the 1980s, respectively (Chart 1-5).
The Administrations antitrust and regulatory policies have fostered competition at home. At the same time, its trade policies have worked to expand
trade and open markets through major regional and multilateral agreements.

Education, Skills, and Work Incentives
Dazzling new technologies, redesigned business systems, new services—
the promise of these sources of economic growth can be realized only if people have the skills and the knowledge to use them. To take advantage of the
benefits of trade in expanding those industries where the United States has
comparative advantage, workers must acquire the necessary skills. Workers
who lose their jobs when industries contract, whether because of foreign
competition or because of technological advance, must often be retrained in
order to reenter the productive economy at a comparable living standard.

Strong job growth and low unemployment have been possible in this
expansion only because people have found that work has paid off. Providing
work incentives is an essential element in strong economic growth. With
one of the most highly educated, skilled, and motivated work forces in the
world, the United States has also been able to take advantage of growth
opportunities worldwide.
Policies to increase access to education and training and make work pay
have been a central theme of economic policy in this expansion.

Pro-Investment Policies
Output growth in this expansion has gone predominantly to households
and businesses rather than for government purchases. One can measure how
the growth of GDP over time has been allocated among the components of
GDP: consumption, investment, government purchases (Federal, State, and
local), and net exports (Chart 1-6). When this is done, the current expansion
stands out for the strong contribution of private investment spending. The
contribution of government purchases of goods and services to growth has
been only 7 percent, about a third of what it was in the two previous long
expansions.
Government purchases of goods and services reflect the direct use of
economic resources. But Federal spending also includes Social Security
payments and other transfers to households and businesses. On this broader




Chapter 1 I 31

Chart 1-6 Contributions to Economic Growth During Expansions

basis, the current expansion also shows evidence of fiscal restraint. Federal
outlays in 1991 were 22.3 percent of GDP. By fiscal 1999 this ratio had fallen
to 18.7 percent, as efforts to restrain spending combined with strong economic
growth. This decline in spending of 3.6 percentage points of GDP is much
greater than the 1.3-percentage-point decline during the 1982-90 expansion.
Since this measure typically declines as the economy moves out of recession—and the deeper the recession, the greater the decline—the comparison
between the two expansions is striking given that the current expansion was
launched from a much shallower recession. Moreover, this decline in
spending occurred even as revenues were rising (Chart 1-7).
According to the Administration forecast, assuming implementation of
policy as proposed by the President, Federal outlays are forecast to fall to 16.7
percent of GDP by 2010. This reduction results in part from a decline in
interest costs as debt is paid off.
But perhaps the most dramatic illustration of how unusual budget policy
has been in this expansion comes from estimates of the structural budget
deficit by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The structural budget
deficit adjusts the actual deficit to take out the effect of fluctuations in the
business cycle. It estimates what the budget deficit would have been if GDP
had been at its potential. According to the CBO s estimates, structural
deficits were pervasive during the long expansion of the 1960s, except at the
very beginning (Chart 1-8). And those deficits increased sharply until the tax
increase of 1968. Throughout its duration, the expansion of the 1980s was

also associated with large structural deficits—and large actual deficits as well.
This expansionary fiscal policy was accompanied by a tight monetary policy,
and this combination of policies contributed to relatively high real interest
rates and declining net national saving and domestic investment.

Chapter 1 I 33

The current expansion, by contrast, started with a large structural deficit and
turned it around, to the point that there is now a structural surplus, as Federal
spending has been kept in check while revenues have risen. Monetary policy,
meanwhile, has been given the freedom to encourage real growth while keeping
inflation low. Interest rates, as a result, have been lower than they would have
been. Indeed, real interest rates in this expansion have been considerably lower
than in the 1980s expansion. Using survey data to measure inflation expectations suggests that real short-term interest rates have been about half what they
were in the 1980s expansion, and real long-term rates are about a third lower.
Lower interest rates have stimulated investment spending, and this investment
has, in turn, boosted capacity growth and raised productivity—two key factors
that have helped keep inflation in check.
Although the current account (the balance of trade in goods and services plus
net factor income and net transfers) moved into deficit in both the 1980s and
the 1990s, the forces behind these shifts were different. In the 1980s both net
national saving and net domestic investment declined as a percentage of GDP,
so that foreign borrowing was used, directly or indirecdy, to finance consumption and Federal budget deficits rather than investment. In the 1990s, by
contrast, net national saving increased, and the capital inflow has helped finance
an investment boom.

Key Features of the Expansion
Driven by technological advance, more open markets, and investment in
physical capital and human skills—all with the ongoing support of Federal
policy—this expansion is on track to become the longest ever. In 1999, the
ninth year of the expansion, GDP grew by 4.0 percent, and 2.7 million payroll jobs were created. The expansion remained youthful-looking and vigorous despite its chronological age. How did the engines of this expansion, just
described, translate their energy into such a sustained performance?

Productivity Growth
The start of an expansion is usually a period of rapid productivity growth.
Companies set up factories and offices that are designed to produce a certain
target level of output. In a recession, output falls below this target, plants
operate less efficiently, and productivity falls. Companies may also retain valued workers that are not needed today but will be needed when the upturn
comes, and this, too, lowers average productivity. The surge of productivity
growth at the start of an expansion occurs as businesses are again able to
make better use of their workers and their physical capital.

34 I Economic Report of the President




The magnitude of this surge varies from expansion to expansion and
tends to be greater, the deeper the recession that preceded it. After a deep
recession, there is more ground that can be made up before the economy
returns to its long-term potential. After a while, however, this productivity
surge ends, and the economy moves closer to its normal or trend rate of productivity growth, which is determined by the rates of capital accumulation,
technological change, and enhancement of skills. Finally, in the last year or so
of an expansion, productivity growth often slows again in what has been
called an end-of-expansion effect. This likely results from diminishing
returns, as capacity becomes strained and a shortage of experienced and
skilled workers develops.
Chart 1-9 shows that the expansions of the 1960s and the 1980s very
much followed this pattern. Productivity growth was rapid in the first 2-year
period of the expansion but then started to fall off. It had dropped off sharply
by the seventh year of expansion in both cases. But the pattern for the current expansion looks very different. After the initial productivity surge,
growth fell for a couple of years, but since then it has actually been accelerating. Instead of looking like an old expansion suffering from diminishing
returns, this one has been getting stronger. This pattern of strong productivity growth at a mature stage of the cycle is a key reason why this expansion is
set to become the longest on record. And that is exactly the result one would
expect from policies that have stimulated investment, technology development, and skill enhancement.

Inflation
Accelerating inflation poses a threat to expansions and, unless kept under
control, eventually brings them to a halt. Chart 1-10 shows the pattern of
core inflation, as measured by the consumer price index excluding food and
energy, in the three long expansions since 1960. The 1960s expansion was
marked by 5 years of strong economic growth with low inflation. Administration policies in those years restored prosperity and full employment after
bouts with recession between 1957 and 1961. But during the mid-1960s, the
pressures of expenditure at the time of the Vietnam War stretched industrial
capacity too much, causing inflation to accelerate rapidly, until rising interest
rates and monetary restraint brought the expansion to an end.
The 1980s expansion started with very high unemployment and slack
resources, which helped restrain inflation in the early years of the expansion,
as did the collapse of oil prices and a strong dollar. But eventually the inflation path flattened out and started to turn up as the economy reached lower
levels of unemployment.
The pattern of inflation over the current expansion is surprising: core
inflation has been low and stable, when not actually declining, even as
unemployment has approached 4 percent. Chapter 2 describes several factors
that have contributed to this combination of low inflation and low unemployment. Certainly the pattern of productivity described earlier and the
rapid expansion of capacity have been important. The importance of investment for productivity growth was noted above, but rapid investment growth

has also been the driver of capacity expansion. Chart 1-11 shows that capacity utilization has remained at a moderate level and has grown more slowly
than in previous long expansions.

Questioning the Causes of Inequality
Three of the major driving forces behind the economy's recent success—
rapid technological change, increased trade, and tightfiscalpolicy—have all
in the past been viewed by some as sources of greater inequality of income. It
is remarkable, therefore, that even though these forces have been particularly powerful in the current expansion, the trend toward greater inequality that
began in the 1970s has been arrested, and income gains are now being shared
equally across income groups.
Economists are sometimes said to agree on very little, but there is a broad
consensus among them that the most important cause of rising earnings
inequality in the 1970s and 1980s was technological change. It was simply a
matter of supply and demand. The supply of highly skilled and well-educated workers was growing relatively rapidly during these years. Between 1973
and 1992, for example, the share of the civilian labor force with some college
education increased from 29.4 percent to 51.6 percent—or 3 percent a year
on average. But the relative earnings of these workers were rising even as their
supply was expanding, because demand was growing even faster. Something,

The capacity utilization rate is lower and has grown more slowly in this expansion than at
comparable junctures in past long expansions.

Chapter 1 I 37

it was argued, must be shifting the relative demand for skilled and unskilled
workers, raising demand for the former and lowering it for the latter. Some
attributed this skill bias to the impact of new capital investment in general and
computers in particular; others saw changes in management approaches and the
adoption of new, more flexible production methods as the cause. In either case,
technological change was seen as at the root of the wage disparity.
A second cause of inequality has been said to be international trade,
although most economists believed its contribution was far smaller than that
of technological change. Expanded trade benefits all countries that take part,
but within each country some people and industries may be hurt. Those who
maintain that trade had increased inequality made the following argument.
As developing countries with many low-skilled workers increasingly participate in trade, they put downward pressure on world prices of products
intensive in low-skilled labor. If the United States then opens up to trade
with these countries, low-skilled workers here become less scarce in the
world market, and their relative wages fall. Some claimed that globalization
imposes painful consequences on relatively underskilled workers: accept
lower wages, as in the United States, or suffer higher unemployment, as in
many European countries. In addition, the threat of foreign outsourcing by
firms and of increased international competition was said to have reduced
labors bargaining power—a factor also sometimes held responsible for the
slow rise in real wages.
Still other institutional and structural changes in the economy have been
implicated in increasing inequality. The decline in union membership, for
example, is seen as a factor reducing the bargaining power of U.S. workers. A
second source has been changes in the mix of industries, in particular the relative
decline in manufacturing employment for reasons other than international
trade. A third element was the decline in the real minimum wage.
To be sure, some of these proposed explanations are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, they may be interrelated. International competition may have
stimulated technological change. It has also been invoked to help explain the
declining share of manufacturing employment. Some also blame technology
and trade for higher structural unemployment: both may bring about structural change in the economy, as employment rises in some industries but falls
in others. Workers who have developed skills in one field are forced to make
a difficult transition into another.
Finally, there is a view that the rise in inequality could be attributed to cuts
in government social expenditure. The reductions in poverty in the 1960s, in
this view, were not simply the result of faster economic growth. The expansion of social programs, particularly Social Security for the elderly, played an
important role. By contrast, cutbacks in social spending were seen as hurting
the poor in the 1980s.

38 I Economic Report of the President




In light of these explanations, the recent direction of trends in inequality is
surprising. As reflected in the data on investment and productivity growth,
technological change appears to have accelerated over the past 5 years. Trade
and international investment have expanded at rapid rates, the price pressures from this increased trade have been considerable, and the trade deficit
has grown. Yet over this same period, real average hourly earnings have
increased, and income gains have been widely shared, in contrast to the 1980s.
Moreover, research shows that the hourly wages of lower wage groups have
increased about as much as or more than the wages of upper wage groups.
This remarkable turnaround shows that rapid growth in an open economy
can occur without worsening inequality. There always was a nagging doubt
associated with blaming technological change for rising inequality. Why, during the 1980s, was technological change apparently contributing little or
nothing to productivity growth, yet at the same time causing major shifts in
relative wages? Likewise, the explanation that ascribes a role to trade was
always controversial, because the evidence in support of these claims either
was weak or suggested that any impacts were small. This is not surprising,
because most U.S. workers are in domestic industries where there is little or
no international trade. Moreover, a large proportion of U.S. trade is with
countries such as Canada, Germany, and Japan, where wages are not very
different from those in the United States. Only a small fraction of U.S.
workers compete directly against very low wage workers overseas. To be sure,
in some economic models, international competition in even a few industries
is the sole determinant of relative wages across the economy, but the evidence
is that many domestic factors have an important influence on relative wages.
Whatever the explanation for the growth in inequality during the 1980s,
the recent experience suggests that it is time to reappraise the inevitability of
the allegedly adverse impacts of technology and trade. It is time to look at the
ways in which they may actually help foster growth with equity, and to
recognize that a flexible economy can adjust to these changes.
Rapid productivity growth and openness to trade—and the policies that
have supported them—have allowed the U.S. economy to operate and
sustain a high-employment economy. And in this high-employment
economy, employers have been recruiting workers at all skill levels and
training many who lack the necessary skills. Moreover, faster productivity
growth may allow firms to pay higher wages without raising prices, thus
dampening the inflationary impact of higher levels of employment.
Similarly, falling import prices will increase purchasing power, enabling real
wages to rise without accelerating inflation; surplus global capacity can also
help reduce inflationary pressures.
It is also quite possible that the shocks due to technology and trade have
been dissipated over time by responses in the economy itself. One possibility




Chapter 1 I 39

is that the direction of technological change responds to economic incentives. As the relative cost of workers who are less well educated falls, firms
have an increased incentive to employ them. Similarly, as international competitive pressures increase, firms either figure out new strategies (improved
technology, new products, or higher quality of existing products) that allow
them to compete, or they exit. Those firms that survive can compete
successfully with low-wage countries and thus are less affected by pressures to
reduce wages. The result is a far more resilient economy.
Finally, the connection between aggregate government spending and
poverty reduction is too simplistic. Determined deficit reduction in the
1990s has not hurt efforts to reduce poverty, because spending has been more
carefully targeted. Increased funding for the Earned Income Tax Credit and
for education and training programs has played an important role. Also
important have been increases in the minimum wage. Certainly a
higher minimum wage has raised wages at the bottom of the income
distribution, and it has not had a noticeably negative impact on employment
of the lowest paid workers.
Taken as a whole, the evidence on inequality suggests that policy has been
doing the right things. In addition, it provides an optimistic message. We
remain masters of our fate. We are not, as some suggest, condemned to be
buffeted by hostile global or technological forces, in the face of which we are
helpless. To be sure, two qualifications to this proposition are in order. First, the
final verdict on the impact of these forces is not yet in. The strongest test will be
whether these more recent trends are sustained if there is slower growth at home
and a global economic environment with less excess capacity. And second, we
must not become complacent. Although the trend of rising inequality has been
stopped, it has not been reversed. Similarly, although progress has been made in
reducing poverty, poverty rates remain far too high. There remains much for
policy to do, but the turnaround so far is heartening.

Is the Dream Restored?
Chapter 2 discusses reasons to believe that the level of unemployment at
which the economy will experience strong inflationary pressures has
declined. But far more important over the long run is the question of
whether productivity growth has increased. Certainly a great deal of anecdotal evidence suggests that technological change has been particularly rapid
and widespread, but until recently the official data offered scant proof that
these changes had boosted productivity. Over the past few years, as this
chapter has noted, productivity growth has clearly increased, but the full

40 I Economic Report of the President




implications of the economy's recent performance remain difficult to
interpret because we have not seen the end of the current expansion.
One favorable interpretation of the unusual behavior of productivity growth
in this cycle is that is not part of a typical cycle at all, but rather reflects a shift to
a new wave of innovation. Typically, when a technology is first introduced,
inexperience prevents users from extracting its full potential. Over time,
however, users learn by doing and productivity accelerates. Similarly, it is possible that the innovations in the current technological wave are interrelated, so
that breakthroughs in some areas yield benefits in many others. But we cannot
be certain how long the current growth spurt can be sustained.
A conservative approach is to measure the change in productivity not from
1995 but from the previous cyclical peak in 1990, so that the last recession,
the initial sluggish recovery, and the subsequent acceleration are all included.
On that basis, it is striking that growth in GNP per capita at 2.1 percent per
year, and that of GNP per worker at 1.8 percent per year, have matched the
pace recorded for the century as a whole (Table 1-1). One cannot say for certain, therefore, that the past decade has witnessed the emergence of a new
economy that will generate historically unprecedented growth. But we can be
more confident that we have at least returned to the pace of growth sustained
over most of the 20th century, which gave us the 2 percent answer to the
American dream and the more than eightfold increase in output per worker
over the 20th century. This, moreover, is a conservative view. There is certainly support, if not yet overwhelming evidence, for the view that the future
could be even more prosperous.

Chapter 1 I 41

Challenges for the Future
This chapter concludes with a brief summary of each of the remaining
chapters and the principal challenges that they identify for policy. Sustaining the
outstanding performance of the past several years means meeting the challenges
that still confront us as well as the new ones that lie ahead.

Stabilizing the Macroeconomy
Chapter 2 recounts in greater depth the story summarized in this chapter
of a strong expansion that shows no signs of losing its vitality. Following a
long tradition of the Economic Report of the President, the chapter focuses on
the performance of the past year. For stabilization policy the key future challenge is to sustain this performance: to maintain high levels of employment
while keeping inflation low and stable—a goal the Administration shares
with the independent Federal Reserve.
Given the current strength of the economy, prudence indicates that fiscal
policy should be directed at paying down the Nations debt and preparing for
predictable needs such as those of Social Security and Medicare as well as
unexpected ones. Fiscal discipline also frees capital for productive investments in education, businesses, and technology. Tax cuts should be modest
and targeted. Discipline over spending should continue. Policies should stay
directed toward such critical areas as saving, work incentives, education and
training, families and children, the environment, health care, and research
and development.
The chapter also examines the recent acceleration of labor productivity
and the role that computers have played in it. We find that from 1990 to
1999 the acceleration in productivity is associated strongly with the production and use of computers. But over the shorter period from 1995 to 1999,
there was a substantial increase in total factor productivity growth outside the
computer-producing industry.

Enhancing Productivity
Chapter 3 looks at the microeconomic, or industry-level, side of the technological change that has driven growth in this expansion and in this century.
Technological change has created new industries and altered the competitive
landscape of the American economy. The chapter describes the dynamic process
by which innovative products and services allow competitors to enter and
compete with established firms, lowering prices and improving service for
consumers. Two examples of these trends are evident in the telecommunications
and information technology industries; here many firms are exploring

42 I Economic Report of the President




the economic opportunities made possible by innovations in computers,
communications technology, and the Internet and e-commerce.
In telecommunications, technological and regulatory changes have led to a
surge in demand for communications equipment and services. Many of these
new products, in turn, are critical inputs into the information technology
industry. Firms are adopting information technology to lower costs, create
new products, and improve their productivity. By improving information
flows within the firm and between the firm and its customers, information
technology has the potential to revolutionize how businesses conduct
business in this century. E-commerce could fundamentally reshape the
nature of relationships between businesses and their customers, and between
businesses and businesses.
The Administration has acted as a catalyst for this growth by supporting the
basic and applied research necessary for creating new technologies. It has also
supported regulatory reforms, like the 1996 Telecommunications Act, that
encourage competition and entry from new providers and new technologies.
The future challenge is to sustain and increase this stimulus by increasing
investment in R&D and encouraging competition and innovation.

Promoting Skills, Education, and Development
Chapter 4 examines the implications for the labor market of an increasingly
technology-driven economy. The chapter focuses on two key transformations of
the labor market: the increasing value of education and the improved opportunities for women, minorities, and persons with disabilities. The last several
decades have seen a substantial gap emerge between the earnings of those with
a college education and of those with less education, even though the average
level of educational attainment has risen over the century. The economy has
clearly put a high premium on a new set of skills, and despite the progress that
has been made, there remains for some workers a mismatch between the skills
they possess and the skills that firms demand.
Chapter 4 also examines the role of government and the policies put forth
by this Administration to help workers adjust to the rapidly changing economy. The chapter includes a discussion of education policies from preschool
to postsecondary, and of private and government training programs. The
chapter presents evidence on the effectiveness of these training programs in
improving the achievement levels of students as well as the labor market
outcomes of various groups of workers. The evidence suggests which types of
programs might be most successful and cost-effective at improving the skills
of workers in the future.
The challenge in this area is to develop a comprehensive set of education
and training policies that create a framework of lifetime learning within
which workers can acquire and maintain the skills they need to be successful




Chapter 1 I 43

in the new labor market. The chapter discusses a number of recent initiatives.
These include efforts to reduce class size and improve teacher quality, policies
that have been shown to be effective at the elementary and the secondary
level; initiatives, such as the Technology Literacy Challenge and the E-rate,
that are attempting to provide students access to the technologies they will
need to master in order to succeed in todays labor market; the HOPE
Scholarship program, a tax credit that will ideally make the first 2 years of
college as universal as high school; and the Workforce Investment Act, a new
training initiative being phased in during 2000, which will help workers
acquire the skills they need in the 21st-century economy.

Supporting the Diverse American Family
The importance of skills and the shift from backwork to brainwork have
changed the employment prospects for women and, together with other
changes, have altered the character of the American family. Chapter 5
discusses how the decline in the importance of the traditional onebreadwinner, one-homemaker family and the increase in the prevalence of
two-earner and single-parent families have changed the opportunities and
challenges that American families face at the beginning of the new century.
In particular, the chapter looks at the balance between the rewards of work
and the needs and rewards of family time. It notes three key trends that have
shaped the American family. One is the rise in female labor force participation over the century, as more opportunities have opened up for women to
work and more women have taken advantage of those opportunities.
Another is the changing patterns of family formation and dissolution, which
have contributed to the growing prevalence of single-parent families. A third
is the improvements in health and life expectancy that have added new
responsibilities to those that most families can expect to face, namely, care of
elderly parents in addition to preparation for their own retirement.
The chapter then considers differences among family types with respect to
income and time available outside of work. It looks at Administration
policies that address the "money crunch" faced by families who feel their
resources are stretched to the limit. These policies include expansion of the
Earned Income Tax Credit, increases in the minimum wage, welfare reform,
the $500-per-child tax credit, and policies to help families invest in skills,
such as the H O P E Scholarship program, already mentioned. The
Administration has also pursued policies like those embodied in the Family
and Medical Leave Act to help families deal with the "time crunch" they face
while trying to balance work and family time.
Policies like the child tax credit and the Family and Medical Leave Act
have addressed important challenges facing the American family. But the
Administration recognizes that it will be a continuing challenge to ensure
44 I Economic Report of the President




that the economy provides workers both the opportunity to work and the
ability to spend quality time with their families.

Exploiting the Potential of Globalization
Chapter 6 analyzes the effects of globalization on the U.S. economy. Trade
and, to a much lesser extent, investment links were well established a century
ago, but both deteriorated during the interwar period. Over the past 50 years,
however, international trade and investment have risen sharply. Today, global
ties—through goods and services trade, through capital flows, and through integrated production relationships among firms and their affiliates—are generally
broader and deeper than ever before.
The forces driving globalization include technology and policy. Technological improvements—in transportation, communications, information
management, and elsewhere—have reduced the costs of doing business
internationally, thus lowering significant barriers to trade and capital flows.
These improvements have also increased the range of possible commercial
transactions, particularly in financial markets, and have created venues for
new kinds of transactions, such as electronic commerce. Policy has also
played an active role in reducing barriers to trade and investment. For
example, in the latter half of the 20th century, policy measures have sought
to reduce tariff and nontariff trade barriers. More recently, and especially
since the 1970s, many countries have decided to remove restrictions on
capital flows.
Our openness to the world makes us more prosperous. The freedom of
consumers and businesses to choose from a wider range of products and
services improves efficiency, promotes innovation, encourages the transfer of
technology, and otherwise enhances productivity growth. Trade allows us to
specialize in what we do best. All these benefits, in turn, lead to higher real
incomes and wages.
The United States has long sought to extend the benefits of international
trade and investment as widely as possible, but significant challenges remain.
Although trade liberalization lies at the heart of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and continues as a central objective of U.S. policy, a number of
institutional issues have come to the fore. The United States is seeking
greater consideration of labor and environmental concerns in the W T O and
more openness in its proceedings. Moreover, despite the substantial benefits
of trade, the transition to more open markets may be difficult for some U.S.
industries and their workers. Those who are dislocated suffer real costs, and
therefore the Administration supports domestic policies that help ease the
transition for those affected. The recent financial crises in Asia have been
particularly disruptive. Such crises in emerging markets draw attention to yet
another challenge: the risk that sudden reversals in capital flows can be




Chapter 1 I 45

disruptive in some cases. Finally, the growing U.S. trade deficit raises the
challenge of ensuring not only that the United States remains an attractive
location for investment, but also that Americans are saving enough for the
future.

Maintaining the Environment Efficiently
Chapter 7 notes that although economic growth and structural and
technological change have altered the U.S. economy substantially for the
better over the past century, they have brought in their wake an array of
environmental problems, including air, water, and soil pollution. However,
economic growth has also provided the innovation and the resources to
address these environmental problems.
The chapter describes how traditional regulatory approaches designed to
address environmental problems have delivered substantial benefits but have
carried significant economic costs. It then discusses how experiences with
market-based approaches to pollution abatement, such as permit trading and
emissions charges, have shown ways to achieve environmental goals at lower
cost while providing the proper incentives for innovation. It suggests that
applying these lessons about the design of environmental markets to future
environmental problems is critical if environmental goals are to be achieved
most efficiently.
The most significant environmental problem of the 21st century is probably global climate change. Chapter 7 argues that this problem is best
addressed through market-based approaches. The challenge is to design
policies appropriate to the problem. Emissions trading could serve as a
powerful tool to reduce greenhouse gases, because these come from a very
large number of sources with a wide range of abatement costs and have the
same environmental effect regardless of the source location.
In negotiations of the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention on
Climate Change, the Administration has advocated international
emissions trading and project-oriented mechanisms that effectively allow
for flexibility across sources and countries in meeting climate goals. A
broad international trading system can significantly lower the costs of
achieving emissions targets set in the Kyoto Protocol while also delivering
substantial revenue to low-cost-abating countries, which would be sellers
in an international emissions market. Future international climate negotiations can resolve many of the implementation issues regarding these
market-based approaches. Appropriate design of these approaches can
ensure that the first steps taken to address climate change will deliver
environmental benefits at the lowest possible cost.

46 I Economic Report of the President




Conclusion
As we enter the 21st century, the principal challenges we face are to sustain
the extraordinary progress that America has made in this record-breaking
expansion, and to make sure that all Americans share in the strong economy.
The goal should be to make the accomplishments of this new century even
better than those of the last. New policy issues will surely emerge, but the
policy framework that has worked so well—maintaining fiscal discipline,
investing in people, and opening international markets—is the right one to
take us forward.




Chapter 1 I 47

C H A P T E R

Macroeconomic Policy and Performance

The evolution of the stock market illustrates how dramatically technology has changed the
way we do things and the things we are able to do. At the start of the 20th century, the
purchase of stock was a lengthy and labor-intensive process. After a trade, messengers
would hand-deliver the stock certificates, which were then carried to a vaultfor safekeeping. Today, computers and instant global communications have made the trading of stocks
anywhere in the worldjust a mouse click away.

.S. ECONOMY PERFORMED very well in 1999. The economic expansion is on the verge of shattering the all-time endurance record,
set during the 1960s, of 106 months. Real (inflation-adjusted) output
increased a robust 4.2 percent over the four quarters of 1999, on a par with
the energetic pace set over the preceding 6 years of this Administration. An
additional 2.7 million nonagricultural jobs were created during the year,
bringing the total created during this expansion to nearly 22 million (20.6
million during the 7 years of this Administration). The unemployment rate
dropped to 4.2 percent for the year as a whole, its lowest level in 30 years
(Chart 2-1). The consumer price index rose by 2.7 percent over the 12




49

months of 1999, a pickup from the previous years 1.6 percent rate (Chart 22). A sharp rise in energy prices, following 2 years of declines, accounted for
more than the entire acceleration in consumer prices in 1999. Consumer
prices excluding energy and food prices were up only 1.9 percent over all of
1999, the smallest December-to-December percentage increase since 1965.
Over the first three quarters of 1999, productivity (output per hour) in the
nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, marking
the fourth straight year of strong productivity growth.
These statistics portray a vibrant economy ending the 20th century on a
strong note, with robust growth, high employment, and low and stable inflation. A key factor in the recent remarkable performance of the economy has
been an acceleration in productivity. In the long run, productivity growth sets
the pace for improvements in the quality of life. Rising productivity over most
of the last 100 years has dramatically changed the face of the American economy in terms of living standards, the affordability of life's basic goods, and the
range of goods and services Americans can buy.
As American workers became more productive, average nominal wages rose
from 15 cents an hour at the turn of the century to about $14 by 1999. Of
course, in general prices have also risen over that time. But the gains in wages
have far outpaced the rise in prices for the goods and services we buy. For
instance, a candy bar that cost a nickel in 1900 might cost about 50 cents
today, but today it takes the average worker just 2 minutes to earn that 50
cents, whereas in 1900 it took nearly 20 minutes of work to earn a nickel.
Other goods are not only cheaper but of better quality as well. For example, in
1916 a refrigerator with 9 cubic feet of storage cost $800, the equivalent of
over 3,000 hours of wages for the average worker. Today a refrigerator with
more than twice the capacity, and with features not available 80 years ago such
as an icemaker or an automatic defroster, costs about $900, or about 65 hours
of work at the average wage. But the computer industry offers the most dramatic example of our increased buying power. In 1970 a state-of-the-art
computer cost about $4.7 million, an amount equal to 15 times the lifetime
wages of the average worker. In 1999 a personal computer with more than 10
times as much computing power cost only $1,000, or less than 2 weeks of the
average workers pay, and this figure is likely to fall to just 1 days pay in the
next decade or so.
This record of long-term productivity growth and the resulting dramatic
changes in the quality of life are the result of investments, both public and private, in education, science and technology, business capital, and infrastructure. These and other causes and consequences of economic growth in the
past, and the outlook for continued growth in the future, are a recurring
theme of this chapter. Of course, the transformation and expansion of the
U.S. economy have not always been smooth: periods of growth were often

interrupted by recession, and in the 1930s by the Great Depression. Thus a
second theme of this chapter is how changes in the economy and in government policy have contributed to the macroeconomic performance we now
enjoy: solid growth, high employment, and stable low inflation.
As discussed in the other chapters of this Report, public policy has provided a strong foundation for the robust health of todays economy. One key to
the outstanding macroeconomic performance of the last 7 years has been the
reemergence of fiscal discipline, starting with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 93), continuing with the Balanced Budget Act
of 1997, and including the Presidents veto of proposed massive tax cuts in
1999. The Federal Government is once again a net saver. That is, the Federal Government is now a source of funds for private investments in education,
housing, and business; this is in contrast to the preceding 28 years, when it
was a net borrower, competing with households and businesses seeking funds
for investment. In fiscal 1999 alone this return tofiscaldiscipline freed over
$120 billion that can be used for private investment—investment that provides jobs and will improve future productivity and real wages. This contrasts
sharply with the record $290 billion deficit of fiscal 1992. Although the
strong economy accounts for some of the improvement, the Congressional
Budget Office s standardized-employment budget (which attempts to control
for cyclical and special factors) shows the same pattern of a large deficit in fiscal 1992 and a surplus in 1999. Monetary policy likewise has contributed to
supporting long-term growth: by keeping inflation low and stable, it has
reduced the distortions to investment decisions associated with high and
variable inflation.
With the economy running strong, it is vital thatfiscalpolicy continue to
be disciplined and directed at paying down the national debt. By adding to
national saving, Federal surpluses lower interest rates, lowering the cost of
consumer debt and home mortgages to households as well as the cost of
investment in technology and capital to businesses. Such investments boost
productivity and raise living standards. Federal spending needs to be targeted at top national priorities such as encouraging saving and investments in
people and technology, health care, families, and the environment. Likewise,
tax cuts should be moderate and targeted to areas where they can do the most
good. Looking ahead, paying down the debt now is the best way to prepare
for the looming retirement of the baby-boom generation and the consequent
demands on Social Security and Medicare, as well as for other needs we cannot today anticipate.
The first section of this chapter reviews the course of the U.S. economy
during 1999. The second examines patterns of national saving and investment in recent decades and how government deficits and surpluses have
affected national saving. The third section examines how the nature of the

52 I Economic Report of the President




business cycle has changed over the past century. The fourth andfinalsection
takes up the near-term outlook and the Administrations long-run forecast,
paying particular attention to the effects of changes in productivity trends on
growth and inflation.

The Year in Review
Real gross domestic product (GDP) increased 4.2 percent between the
fourth quarter of 1998 and the fourth quarter of 1999 (Table 2-1). Even in
the ninth year of the expansion, real output growth remained strikingly
robust. The breakdown of the contributions to growth by major category in
1999 was similar to that over the whole expansion to date. Household spending and business investment in equipment once again provided the main contributions to growth. Government spending provided somewhat more impetus to growth than in previous years of the expansion, owing to increased
spending by the Federal Government and by State and local governments.
The drag exerted by the fact that imports grew faster than exports weighed in
heavier than in the previous year.

Components of Spending
Real GDP growth was strong in each quarter except the second, when it
dipped to a 1.9 percent annual rate. The quarter-to-quarter movements in




Chapter 2 I 53

GDP were exaggerated by swings in inventory investment (discussed further
below), which slumped in the second quarter before rebounding in the third
quarter and then surging in the fourth. In contrast, growth in real final sales,
which excludes inventory accumulation, fell only modestly in the second
quarter. Real final sales increased 4.3 percent over the four quarters of 1999.

Household Spending
Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) raced ahead at a 5.4 percent annual rate over the four quarters of 1999, besting the 5.1 percent pace
set in 1998. Consumption growth contributed 3.6 percentage points to overall growth over the year as a whole. Real purchases of new motor vehicles
increased about 5 percent over the four quarters of 1999; this was off the 14
percent pace of 1998. Total sales of automobiles and light trucks reached a
record 16.8 million vehicles in 1999. Demand for housing also continued
strong in 1999. Single-family housing starts topped 1998 s record figure, as
did sales of new and existing single-family homes. The share of American
households who own their own homes was 67 percent in 1999. This figure
surpassed the record high annual level set in 1998. Growth in several housing
indicators stalled in the second half of the year, however, as the effects of higher mortgage rates began to take hold. Still, housing markets remained strong,
and measures of construction activity were at historically high levels.
Favorable economic performance continued to drive this robust growth in
household spending, and consumer confidence continued to run strong,
according to household surveys. Real disposable personal income (deflated by
the PCE chain-weighted price index) recorded impressive growth of about 3.7
percent at an annual rate over the four quarters of 1999. The strong stock
market and a pickup in the value of homes further boosted household wealth,
on top of sizable gains in each of the preceding 4 years. As a result, household
net worth nearly reached the level of six times annual personal income (Chart
2-3). With wealth continuing to grow faster than income, households have
been willing to spend a larger share of their disposable income (which, in the
measurement concept used in the national income and product accounts,
does not include capital gains). Hence the personal consumption rate rose for
the seventh straight year, and the personal saving rate correspondingly fell.

Business Investment
Real business fixed investment continued to boom last year. Real business
investment in equipment and software increased 11 percent at an annual rate
during 1999. Spending on information processing equipment and software
was the main contributor to the expansion in business investment. Adjusted
for quality improvements, prices for many of these goods declined sharply in
1999. Real outlays on computers and peripheral equipment were up 39 per-

cent over the four quarters of 1999, while real business spending on software
increased about 13 percent, and real spending on other information processing equipment (which includes communications equipment) increased 18
percent. As in the previous year, the brisk pace of computer-related investment resulted in part from the updating and replacement of older systems in
preparation for the century date change (better known as the year-2000 or
Y2K problem). Investment in transportation equipment also showed solid
gains; however, other categories of equipment investment were nearly flat.
Real spending on nonresidential structures declined about 5 percent over
the four quarters of 1999, as growth in earlier years (4.8 percent in 1997
and 2.9 percent in 1998) appears to have satisfied demand for new space
for a while.
Business inventories increased modestly through the first half of 1999. The
pace of inventory accumulation strengthened in the third quarter. However,
brisk sales brought inventory stocks down to lean levels relative to sales
through the first three quarters of 1999 (Chart 2-4). Toward the end of the
year, businesses apparently built up inventory stocks in anticipation of potential Y2K disruptions, but sales continued to keep pace.
For the decade of the 1990s as a whole, the overall inventory-to-sales ratio
showed a downward trend. This ratio for the manufacturing sector was falling
for most of the decade, and more recently the retail inventory-to-sales ratio
also has fallen. This downward trend in inventories is likely related to the
adoption of just-in-time inventory management as well as to the use of new

information technologies that enable businesses to manage with leaner inventories (as discussed in Chapter 3).

Government
Real Federal Government consumption expenditures and gross investment
increased 5.3 percent on a national income and product accounts (NIPA)
basis over the four quarters of 1999. Real defense spending rose 5.4 percent
during that period, reversing a downward trend that saw this spending category fall nearly 2.6 percent per year on average over the preceding decade.
Real nondefense spending was up 5.0 percent over 1999 as a whole. Federal
purchases of equipment and software were an important contributor to the
pickup in real Federal purchases.
The Federal Government surplus on a unified budget basis for fiscal 1999
(which ended in September) was $124 billion, compared with $69 billion in
fiscal 1998. The last time the Federal Government recorded two consecutive
budget surpluses was over 40 years ago. And at 1.4 percent of GDP, the fiscal
1999 surplus was the largest relative to the size of the economy in nearly 50
years (Chart 2-5). The challenge for the future is to maintain the hard-earned
fiscal discipline of recent years, so that the economy continues to reap the
rewards of greater investment and growth. In support of this goal, the President rejected a congressional proposal for large-scale tax cuts that threatened
the prospects for continued fiscal discipline; instead he has proposed a budget

framework that continues to pay down the national debt while providing for
critical needs and moderate tax cuts.
State and local governments increased real spending on consumption and
gross investment by 4.5 percent over the four quarters of the year. This pace of
spending represents a pickup from the average 3.2 percent annual increase
recorded over the previous 3 years. The strong economy has boosted State tax
revenues, so that most State governments today appear to be in excellent
financial condition. At the end of fiscal 1999, over two-thirds of the States
surveyed had surpluses equal to 5 percent or more of general fund expenditures (Wall Streets benchmark forfinancialsolidity), and one in three had balances equaling 10 percent of expenditures.

International Influences
International developments in 1999 posed a challenge to the continued
strong performance of the U.S. economy. Foreign growth rebounded in 1999,
but its past weakness kept demand for U.S. exports subdued during the first
half of the year. Export growth picked up in the second half of the year. Real
purchases of U.S. exports increased 4.0 percent over the four quarters of 1999.
Meanwhile, strong income growth in the United States and low relative prices
for imported goods fueled increased U.S. purchases of imported goods and
services for another year: real spending on imports increased 13 percent dur-




Chapter2 I 57

ing 1999. In tandem, anemic export growth and the surge in imports caused
the trade deficit to widen markedly in 1999, to about 2.8 percent of GDP.

Labor Markets and Inflation
The U.S. work force enjoyed another year of solid job growth and rising
real wages in 1999. The unemployment rate in each of the final 3 months of
the year was 4.1 percent, the lowest since January 1970. Real wages increased
for the fifth straight year. Despite the tight labor market, core consumer
prices, which exclude food and energy prices, increased by 1.9 percent, their
slowest pace in nearly 35 years, although a sharp rise in the price of oil sent
energy prices up and caused overall consumer price inflation to move upward.
At the aggregate level, these statistics paint a rosy picture indeed. Chapters 4
and 5, however, discuss the ongoing challenge of making sure that the gains
from this prosperity are shared as widely as possible.

Employment
Nonfarm payroll employment expanded by about 2.7 million jobs during
1999. Employment in the service sector grew rapidly in 1999, and employment in the government sector posted its strongest gain in 9 years, which was
entirely due to growth at the State and local levels. Since January 1993, Federal employment (excluding the postal service) has declined by 18 percent,
while private nonfarm employment has increased by 21 percent. The number
of manufacturing jobs, however, fell by 248,000 last year; this marked the second straight year of declines for this sector, which was particularly hard hit by
the slowdown in export demand. Manufacturing employment had been
increasing by 154,000 per year on average over 1993-97. But trends in this
sector appeared to improve over the year. Manufacturing production increased
more than 5 percent in 1999, and the pace of job reductions in the sector
slowed in the latter part of the year.
The unemployment rate averaged 4.2 percent in 1999, down from 4.5 percent in 1998. The average annual unemployment rate has fallen for 7 straight
years now, and in 1999 unemployment stood at its lowest annual rate since
1969. The benefits of the decline in unemployment have been widely spread.
The unemployment rate for nonwhites, for example, fell to 7.0 percent, its
lowest annual rate in 30 years. This excellent performance also extends to
other labor market measures. The official definition of unemployment counts
as unemployed only those who are looking for work. If one adds to the standard definition those who currently want a job but have not been looking (socalled marginally attached workers), the jobless rate of this combined group
was 5.0 percent in 1999, down from 5.4 percent in 1998. Indeed, the number of persons desiring a job but not looking has declined in each of the 5
years since these statistics were first collected.
58 I Economic Report of the President




The labor force participation rate—the percentage of the population over
age 16 that is either employed or looking for work—remained at 67.1 percent
in 1999 for a third straight year. In the early 1990s the participation rate
appeared to have plateaued, ending an upward trend from the mid-1960s
through 1990 that saw this rate rise from about 59 percent to 66.5 percent.
This long-term trend was driven by an increase in the participation rate of
women that more than offset a small decline in that of men. In the second
half of the 1990s the overall participation rate rose again, reflecting the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and welfare reform. Today participation
stands at its highest annual rate ever recorded. With the participation rate stable and the unemployment rate down, the employment-to-population
ratio—the proportion of the civilian population aged 16 and older with
jobs—rose to 64.3 percent last year, topping the record set in 1998.

Productivity and Compensation
Labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased by 2.8 percent
on an annual basis during the first three quarters of 1999. This marks the
fourth consecutive year of strong productivity growth. The recent surge in
productivity follows on the heels of more than two decades of relatively slow
productivity growth (1.4 percent on average over 1973-95). For comparison,
the average annual rate of productivity growth over this century has been
about 2 percent. We examine in detail the causes and consequences of shifts in
productivity trends below.
Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased 4.6 percent at an annual rate during the first three quarters of 1999. The strong housing market helped boost compensation in the construction industry, while a
slowdown in mortgage refinancing likely was behind the dropoff in compensation growth in the finance, insurance, and real estate sector, relative to the
rate in 1998. Not only has compensation growth been strong, but a larger
share of it is going into the pocketbooks of workers in the form of higher
wages and salaries. According to the employment cost index, growth in benefit costs has been remarkably subdued on average over the last 5 years, in large
part because of a sharp slowing in the growth of medical insurance costs. Previously, growth in benefits, especially health insurance, had caused the benefit
share of employment costs to rise. Medical insurance costs began to rise again
in 1999, however: the 12-month change was 5.8 percent compared with 2.5
percent in 1998.
The real consumption wage—compensation per hour deflated by the CPIU-RS, an index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that provides a
more consistent measure of inflation than the standard consumer price index
(Box 2-1)—increased 2.0 percent at an annual rate over the first three quarters
of 1999. This gain in real wages is below the brisk rates of the last 2 years but
well above the 1.4 percent annual average increase over 1960-98 (Chart 2-6).




Chapter 2 I 59

Box 2-1. The CPI-U-RS, a Consumer Price Index with More
Consistent Methodology
As noted in previous editions of the Economic Report of the President some of the recent deceleration in measured consumer prices is
attributable to a series of changes in the methods used to compute the
CPI. When making changes to its methods of computing the CPI, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics does not revise past official CPI data using the
newer method. In 1999, however, the agency produced a research version of the CPI, called the CPI-U-RS (the RS stands for "research
series"), in which 14 methodological revisions adopted since 1978 and
still in use today are applied back to that year. Throughout this edition
we use the CPI-U-RS rather than the CPI-U as a deflator when appropriate. (The text and chart footnotes indicate which series is being used.)
The new measure shows CPI inflation to have been lower than the
official estimate over 1977-98 by an average 0.45 percentage point (see
table). The difference is a percentage point over the 1977-82 period;
revised methods of measuring the cost of home ownership account for
most of the difference. In 1983 the BLS replaced a measure of home
ownership costs based on purchase price and mortgage interest rates
with a measure based on rental equivalence—roughly, what the
homeowner would pay to rent the same house.

A second important change, in 1999, was the switch to geometric
rather than arithmetic (fixed-weight) aggregation of price measurements within the lowest-level subcategories in the market basket.This
revision, which applies to low-level categories comprising 61 percent
of consumer expenditures, resolved two problems: the "functional
form bias" in rotating new stores into the sample, and the assumption
continued on next page...
60 I Economic Report of the President




Box 2-1.—continued
of no substitution between competing products within most categories. The effect of applying this geometric aggregation is largest
before 1995, when both problems affected the official series. The functional form bias was eliminated in 1995 for food and in 1996 for other
products, and so the effect of geometric aggregation on the discrepancy between the series diminishes. The effect of this formula change is
lumped together with a few other formula changes in the second line
of the table.
The BLS has omitted a few hard-to-measure methodological changes
from the CPI-U-RS, albeit with small effects. Among these are the new
procedures for hospital prices (implemented in 1997) and the switch to a
new method of sampling (which began to be implemented in 1999) that
may allow new products to enter the CPI earlier in their life cycle.
The CPI-U-RS includes methodological improvements but not the periodic updates of the CPI market basket designed to take account of changing spending habits. In 1998, for example, the 1982-84 market basket was
replaced with the 1993-95 basket. This change lowered CPI inflation by
roughly 0.2 percentage point relative to a CPI weighted by the earlier market basket. Beginning in 2002, the BLS plans to update the market basket
every 2 years rather than approximately once every decade.
Taken together, the methodological improvements instituted beginning in 1995, combined with the recent update of the market basket,
are estimated to result in roughly a 0.6-percentage-point slower annual increase in the CPI in 1999 compared with the methodologies and
market basket used in 1994.

But the growth in real wages in 1997 and 1998 was boosted by the effect of
declining energy prices on CPI inflation. Arguably, deflating compensation by
the core CPI provides a clearer picture of underlying real consumption wage
trends. If energy and food prices are removed from the equation, the real consumption wage increased 2.7 percent at an annual rate over the first three
quarters of 1999, slightly surpassing the 2.6 percent annual average increase
over 1996-98.

Prices
Inflation picked up in 1999 from its very low 1998 pace. The CPI
increased 2.7 percent over the 12 months of 1999, after rising 1.6 percent
during 1998. The chain-weighted price indexes for GDP and PCE increased
1.6 and 2.0 percent, respectively, over the four quarters of the year. These
inflation rates were also up from their 1998 levels. More than the total
increase in consumer price inflation can be attributed to energy prices, which

started to rise in March and continued to do so over the course of the year,
reversing a 2-year slide. Oil prices were a main factor in the down-and-up pattern of energy prices. The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a standard
benchmark for oil prices, stood at year's end at about $26 per barrel, a bit
above its level at the end of 1996, but well above that of a year ago, when
WTI cost about $11 per barrel.
Core inflation, in contrast, has remained subdued. On a consistently measured basis, the core CPI-U-RS increased only 1.9 percent over the 12 months
of 1999, slightly below the previous years 2.2 percent increase. By comparison, core CPI-U-RS inflation has averaged 2.3 percent over the last 7 years.
Core PCE prices, which also exclude the food and energy components,
increased by only 1.5 percent over 1999 as a whole, after rising 1.4 percent in
1998. Since the fourth quarter of 1992, core PCE prices have risen only 1.9
percent per year on average. The CPI and the PCE price index differ in the
goods and services they cover and in their method of computation, but by
either measure core inflation has remained remarkably stable and low
throughout this expansion.
A number of factors have helped keep core inflation in check despite
another year of strong output growth and tight labor markets. First, prices for
nonpetroleum imported goods were little changed over the year, after declining more than 3 percent over 1998. The market basket on which the CPI is
based includes imported goods, so that changes in the prices of these goods
62 I Economic Report of the President




feed directly into the index. Moreover, falling prices of imported goods discourage domestic producers from raising their prices as much as they otherwise might. A second factor that restrained inflation is the existence of spare
capacity in the manufacturing sector (Chart 2-7). Although labor markets
have been tight, capacity utilization in manufacturing remained below its historical average, reflecting weak manufacturing growth in 1998 and rapid
increases in capacity. Purchasing managers' lead times have been stable for
most of the past 2 years, suggesting an absence of production bottlenecks, but
lead times began to lengthen in 1999.
A third reason for the moderation seen in price increases is that gains in
labor productivity have partly offset increases in compensation. As noted,

compensation per hour increased 4.6 percent at an annual rate over the first

the 2.1 percent rate recorded in both 1997 and 1998. Even with labor markets tight, large increases in productivity have played an important role in
counteracting the wage part of the wage-price spiral typically associated with
a high-employment economy. A more extensive discussion of the relationships
among import prices, productivity, and inflation is provided below.

Inflation expectations remained low and stable throughout the year, supporting restraint in wage and price setting. According to the Michigan Survey of
Consumers, the median expectation over the next 5 to 10 years is for inflation
under 3 percent; that figure changed little over the year. Similarly, professional
forecasters' expectations of long-term inflation continue to be low and stable,
according to a survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.

Financial Markets
By comparison with the tumultuous events of the preceding year, 1999 was
a relatively tranquil year for financial markets. Even the looming century date
change and the potential it posed for Y2K-related disruptions did not seem to
unsetde the markets (Box 2-2). The Federal Reserve raised the target Federal
Box 2-2. Economic Impact of Y2K Preparations
One of the most anticipated events of the past year was the rollover
from the year 1999 to 2000. The public and the private sectors in the
United States and abroad devoted enormous resources to ensure that
theY2K bug did not spoil the new year. Moreover, anecdotal evidence
suggests that businesses and households stocked up near the end of the
year as a precaution against supply shortages. In the end these preparations paid off, and only minorY2K-related glitches were reported.
PotentialY2K disruptions involving information systems in the financial sector both in the United States and abroad had been a central concern well before the century date change. The smooth and efficient
operation of financial markets and the banking sector relies on the
extensive use of computers for record keeping, data exchange, and
electronic transactions.The Federal Reserve and the President's Council
on Year 2000 Conversion tracked efforts by financial institutions to
ensure that records would be accurately maintained and that operations would continue running smoothly over the transition to the new
millennium.
To allay concerns about a year-end shortage of liquid assets, the Federal Reserve took steps to assure markets that adequate liquidity would
be available. The Fed also acted to ensure that sufficient quantities of
cash would be available to the public at year's end. It was widely
believed that many people intended to withdraw abnormally large
amounts of cash near the end of the year, as a precaution against Y2Krelated glitches at banks and automatic tellers. In anticipation of this
rise in demand for cash, the Federal Reserve increased its order for currency through September by over 50 percent from the previous year.
The Fed also implemented measures making it easier for banks to
order and take delivery of cash. Public cash holdings rose by about 5
percent in December, an amount easily accommodated.

funds rate (the interest rate that banks charge one another for overnight borrowing) by 75 basis points in three steps, fully reversing the rate cuts it had
instituted in the second half of 1998 during the global financial crisis. The
yield on 30-year Treasury bonds rose more than \lA percentage points over the
course of the year, reflecting a number of factors in addition to the Fed rate
hikes. These included a rebalancing of international portfolios as the financial
crisis receded, and concerns that continued strength in the U.S. economy
would cause the Federal Reserve to further increase the Federal funds rate.
The stock market recorded another year of strong gains, with the S&P 500
index of stock prices rising 20 percent in 1999 (Chart 2-8). But the overall
strength of the stock market in 1999 masks a sizable disparity in performance
among stocks. In 1999 fewer than half of the stocks in the S&P 500 index
rose in value. In contrast, despite similar overall growth, during the first 4
years of the bull market over 70 percent of those stocks rose in any one year.
Stock gains were concentrated in a few sectors, mostly those associated with
high technology. In the mid-1990s the technology-heavy NASDAQ index
grew at about the same rate as the broader S&P 500, but its growth rate has
been about triple that of the S&P 500 in the last 2 years. Even more impressive is a popular average of Internet-related stocks, which increased about 160
percent per year over the past 2 years.

Chapter 2 I 65

The Calm Following the Storm
The year 1998 had been an especially stormy one for financial markets. The
Asian crisis in 1997 and the Russian debt default in August 1998 had precipitated a series of dramatic events in U.S. financial markets. Investors, including foreigners, had sought to reduce exposure to risk by selling high-risk
investments and buying Treasury securities. This "flight to quality" had in turn
bid up prices of Treasury securities, driving Treasury yields down (Chart 2-9).
Corporate bond premiums (the spread between the yield on corporate bonds
and Treasury securities), especially those on high-yield bonds, had risen
sharply. New issuance of private debt had dried up, and debt markets became
less liquid. For a time in the late summer of 1998, even the previously imperturbable bull market in stocks had turned bearish. Owing in part to concerns
that financial markets were freezing up and that a credit crunch might follow,
the Federal Reserve had cut the Fed funds rate three times, in September,
October, and November 1998, from 5.5 percent to 4.75 percent.
With the economy continuing to surge ahead and the unemployment rate
dropping to nearly 4 percent, the 30-year Treasury yield ended the year about
125 basis points above its level at the end of 1998. Premiums on investmentgrade corporate bonds fell back to levels somewhat above those prevailing
before the Russian crisis. Premiums on high-yield bonds stayed elevated relative to early-1998 levels, reflecting in part the high default rate among busi-

nesses with below-investment-grade bond ratings. Liquidity flowed freely
again, with new debt issuance rebounding. Overall, markets appear to have
returned to a state of relative normalcy, but with a renewed appreciation of the
risks associated with investments of all kinds.

Financial Modernization
Last year witnessed a watershed event that will change the way financial
institutions meet the needs of the American people. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act (GLB), which the President signed into law in November 1999, updates
the rules that have governed the financial services industry since the Great
Depression. Prior to GLB, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956 had largely prohibited banks from being affiliated with firms involved in underwriting securities or insurance. The financial services industry had been undergoing rapid change for several decades;
affiliations among banks, security firms, and insurance companies have
already occurred in the marketplace. By repealing those prohibitions and
allowing banks to merge with other financial institutions, the new law will
stimulate competition, increase consumer choice, and reduce costs for consumers, communities, and businesses while still providing an appropriate
statutory framework for community reinvestment and privacy protection.
GLB preserves the important role of the Community Reinvestment Act,
guaranteeing that banking institutions will continue to meet the needs of
potentially underserved communities. No bank may take advantage of the
new opportunities that GLB provides unless it shows that it is satisfactorily
meeting the credit needs of its community in general, and low- and moderateincome neighborhoods in particular. GLB also provides some protection for
the privacy of consumers by giving them the right to know whether their

have built on top of strong stock market performance in the 1980s and early
1990s. Many economists profess surprise at the remarkable bull market of the
1990s; others offer explanations for the sustained run, including a decline in
the risk premium that investors demand in return for holding stocks, and a
rise in expected corporate productivity and profits.
The first step in evaluating the performance of the stock market is to consider what determines the price of an asset (such as a share in a corporation)
that yields a risky return. A share of common stock provides the owner with a
claim on a portion of the issuing corporation s future profits. Hence the share
price should equal the present discounted value of the corporations net profits (that is, after payments to employees, suppliers, bondholders, and other
creditors) divided by the number of outstanding shares. The discounting of
future profits reflects two factors: the opportunity cost associated with waiting
for those future profits, and a premium related to the uncertainty about
whether those profits will materialize. The opportunity cost of receiving a dollar next year equals the interest an investor would receive by buying a risk-free
bond instead of the share of stock. Because a stock can be a risky investment,
investors demand a rate of return on stocks that is above that on a relatively
safe bond.
Changes in fundamentals such as corporate profits and interest rates appear
to explain some but not all of the dramatic runup in stock prices. Corporate
profits grew impressively over the 1990s, but not by as much as stock prices.

68 I Economic Report of the President




From 1989 to 1999, corporate earnings more than doubled, and forecasts of
future earnings were strong, on average, at the end of 1999. The inflationadjusted yield on Treasury bonds, meanwhile, is little changed from its level of
10 years ago and thus has provided only a slight impetus to stock prices over
the decade as a whole. The extraordinary rise in stock prices relative to actual
profits has therefore led economists to hypothesize that changes have occurred
beyond those measured by these fundamentals. One proposed explanation is
that investors have reduced the premium that they demand for holding
stocks. A second is that the outlook for future profits is brighter than commonly thought and that stock prices today more accurately reflect the true
productivity and profitability of American businesses. We consider each
hypothesis in turn.

The Equity Premium
From 1989 to 1999 the average annual real stock market return was over 14
percent, about %Vi percentage points higher than the average annual real
return on long-term government securities. Although this level of return on
stocks has been extraordinary, the fact that it has far exceeded the return on
government bonds is nothing new. In fact, the excess return of stocks over
bonds—the equity premium—has averaged about 4 percentage points over
the last two centuries. The equity premium has also varied considerably over
time, and over the second half of this century it has averaged about 7.3 percentage points (Chart 2-11).

Chapter 2 I 69

The additional riskiness of stock returns over that of bond returns does not
appear large enough to justify an equity premium of over 7 percentage points,
unless investors are extraordinarily risk-averse or their investment horizon is
very short. For this reason, economists have long been puzzled by the large
excess returns that the stock market has historically offered.
One explanation for the recent runup in stock prices is that investors may
have been responding to the fact that stocks have historically yielded much
higher returns than bonds over the long haul. In this view, the stock market
was simply undervalued in the past, and the recent runup in prices was necessary to bring valuations in line with the fundamentals. Two developments
may have spurred this behavior. First, the cost of owning a diversified portfolio of stocks has fallen with the creation of a growing number of low-cost
mutual funds. Diversification reduces the risks associated with holding stocks
and therefore should reduce the equity premium that investors demand as
compensation for risk.
A second development is that a new generation of investors is now in the
market, and the aversion of older investors to the risks of equity investing may
have diminished. Investors may have had lingering memories of the bear market of the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average
(adjusted for inflation) fell by more than 60 percent over 6 years. Some perhaps even remembered the Great Crash of 1929, when the Dow fell 64 percent in real terms over 3 years. Investors' attitudes toward the stock market,
and their tolerance for risk, may have only recendy recovered from these
painful episodes. Meanwhile many from the baby-boom generation and later,
who know bear markets only from history books, have become stock investors.
Indeed, the older generations recoil from stock investing may have been more
emotional than rational. Even an unlucky investor who had invested in the
stock market on the eve of the 1929 crash still would have realized a real return
of nearly 6 percent a year, on average, over the next 30 years. In sum, both the
low cost of diversification and changing attitudes toward the riskiness of stocks
suggest reasons that may have led investors to bid up stock prices in the 1990s.

Intangible Capital
A second explanation for the bull market may be that investors have higher expectations for future corporate profits than they used to. In theory, the
stock market value of a company should be closely related to the replacement
value of its assets. For example, if a company owns only one asset, a factory
that cost $10 million to build, the market value of that company should be
$10 million (abstracting from other factors that affect its profitability).
One possible explanation for the rise in the stock market over the last
decade is that U.S. businesses have accumulated large quantities of intangible
capital in addition to physical capital (plant and equipment). Intangible cap-

70 I Economic Report of the President




ital includes the value of intellectual property (including patents from research
and development investments), organizational structure, management expertise, and past investments in job training. These assets are not included in the
national accounts' measure of physical capital but do raise the productive
capacity offirms.In this view, stock market values—which should incorporate
information about investments in tangible and intangible capital—should
provide a better yardstick for capital than standard measures based on past
investments in plant and equipment alone, which may understate the true
productive potential of firms.
According to this explanation, the dramatic rise in the stock market value of
corporate businesses during the 1990s derives from a large increase in their
intangible capital stock, in addition to the increase implied by investments in
plant and equipment. The implied surge in investment in intangible capital
could have resulted from businesses' intensified efforts to increase efficiency
and productivity. In addition, the explosion in information technologies and
the Internet may have led to a surge in intangible capital investment, including the creation of new products and services and the redesign of production
processes and management.
One implication of this hypothesis is that labor productivity growth should
have increased sharply over the last few years, because workers now have more
productive capital—both tangible and intangible—at their disposal. Although
productivity growth has in fact increased, there is still too little evidence to
support or reject the notion that the true productive capital stock has grown as
rapidly as current stock market valuations imply.
It is inherendy difficult to measure and evaluate the different variables,
including perceptions of risk and profitability, that factor into stock market
prices. The proper valuation of technology stocks—the group that has driven
much of the market s growth in the last 2 years—is particularly tricky. Some
of these stocks currendy have low or even negative earnings but hold the
potential for strong profits in the future. Because these companies lack the
proven track record of long-term growth that more established firms usually
have, their stock prices may in principle be more prone to volatility as
investors revise their forecasts of future profits. Experts have a mixed record of
perceiving the underlying determinants of stock values. As already noted,
some were puzzled by the strength of the bull market in the late 1990s, yet the
market continued to soar. On the other hand, Irving Fisher, one of the
founders of financial economics, famously claimed just 2 weeks before the
1929 crash that "Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently
high plateau." In the final analysis, it is likely that neither of the two hypotheses described here will prove completely correct, and that several factors, perhaps including an overoptimistic view of future corporate profitability, have
combined to propel the stock market upward.




Chapter 2 I 71

Saving and Investment
Investment is the economic bridge linking the present to the future. By
deferring consumption today, we make available resources for investment,
which increases our ability to produce and consume in the future. Over the
last two decades, net domestic investment (gross investment minus capital
consumption) has generally exceeded net national saving, and the difference
has been made up by foreigners (Chart 2-12). Moreover, the share of GDP
that was saved had been very low through much of the 1980s and early 1990s.
This low rate of saving and its shortfall relative to domestic investment have
led some to conclude that the United States is not "saving enough," especially in light of the upcoming retirement of the baby-boomers. The picture is not
quite as clear, however, as these simple figures would suggest.

Trends in Saving
The ratio of net national saving to GDP has risen about 3 percentage
points over the last 7 years. Despite this sizable improvement, this ratio
remains low relative to its levels of the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, if the
national saving-GDP ratio were equal today to its levels in those decades, it
would suffice to cover domestic investment.
The recent upward trend in net national saving is the net result of changes
in the saving patterns of households, businesses, and governments. The ratio
Chart 2-12 Net National Saving and Net Domestic Investment

of gross personal saving to GDP has declined nearly 5 percentage points over
the last 7 years. However, over the same period, the gross national saving
rate—the sum of personal, business, and government saving—has increased
by 3 percentage points (Chart 2-13). The source of this difference lies in the
reversal of the role played by the Federal Government, which has transformed
itself from a major borrower into a major saver. In addition, State and local
governments have increased their saving as a share of GDP. Corporate saving
has also been on a gradual upward trend through the 1990s. Yet as already
noted, despite these positive developments in government and business saving, the national saving rate remains low relative to its 1960s and 1970s levels.
There are, however, reasons to believe that the measured national saving rate
does not accurately portray the accumulation of assets capable of supporting
future consumption.

Saving and Asset Accumulation
Although national saving is not as high today as in past periods, Americans
have nevertheless been accumulating vast quantities of assets. The ultimate
purpose of saving and investing is to provide resources for future consumption. To paraphrase Adam Smith, consumption is the sole end and purpose of
all saving. In considering the ability to consume in the future, it makes sense

Chart 2-13 Gross National Saving

to look at not only how much we save, but also at how that saving is invested
and how productive that investment is.
Much saving goes ultimately into business investment, where it raises future
productivity and thus output. The reported nominal national saving and
investment rates conceal an important development, namely, a sharp decline
in the relative price of business equipment, owing in large part to quality
improvements in capital goods. One dollar of saving buys more business
equipment, on a quality-adjusted basis, today than before. As a result, the
increase in productive business assets corresponding to the average dollar
saved by Americans has risen over time.
The recent runup in the stock market, already discussed, allows an even
more optimistic view on asset accumulation. Real household stock market
wealth has more than doubled since 1995. To the extent that this runup in
stock prices reflects an increase in the productive capacity of U.S. corporations—say, owing to investments in intangible capital or especially high
returns to investments in information technologies—this increase in wealth
augurs a real increase in future sustainable consumption. On the other hand,
rises in share prices resulting from changes in U.S. investors' willingness to
hold stocks or from overly optimistic views of future earnings do not imply
additional resources available for national consumption.
The upswing in the national saving rate over the last several years provides
an encouraging sign regarding the Nations preparations for the future. To the
extent that recent saving is more productive than past saving, so much the better. In any case, the Federal Government can further advance this favorable
trend in national saving by maintaining fiscal discipline, paying down the
debt, and thereby raising government saving.

The End of the Business Cycle?
Growth has been a defining characteristic of the U.S. economic experience
over the last century, but only when viewed from a long perspective: employment and income have often deviated, sometimes sharply, from their rising
long-run trends. Time and again the economy has risen over a period of years
to a temporary peak of activity, only to fall back downward, bottom out at a
trough, and from there once again begin torise.These peaks and troughs represent turning points of the business cycle; an expansion is defined as the period that starts from a trough and ends when a new peak is reached. Although
the business cycle has been a recurring feature of the U.S. economy for as far
back as we have reliable data, some observers have argued that the economy in
the 1990s has fundamentally changed and that the concept of the traditional
business cycle is outdated.

74 I Economic Report of the President




The beginnings and ends of U.S. business cycles are determined well after
the fact by the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of
Economic Research (NBER), a private, nonprofit organization of professional economists. For instance, the March 1991 trough that marked the beginning of the present expansion was not announced by the committee until
December 1992. In identifying the monthly dates for peaks and troughs, the
committee looks for across-the-board movements in a large array of economic indicators such as output, income, and employment. Using this methodology, the NBER has determined that since 1854 there have been 31 expansions
and 31 recessions, representing 30 peak-to-peak business cycles, not including
todays ongoing expansion. Although they are called "cycles," these economic
fluctuations are neither regular nor predictable. The longest expansion to date
was that of the 1960s, which lasted 106 months. (The current expansion is
expected to pass that mark in February 2000.) The longest contraction on
record lasted over 5 years, from the October 1873 peak to the March 1879
trough, whereas the shortest lasted only 6 months, from January to July 1980.

The Changing Nature of Business Cycles in the
United States
Forty-one years ago a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers
predicted that "The business cycle is unlikely to be as disturbing or troublesome
to our children as it once was to our fathers." Research quantifying the degree to
which business cycles have moderated over time confirms this view. If the severity of economic fluctuations is measured in terms of the output lost during a
recession, the 14 recessions between 1900 and 1953 cost on average about three
times as much as the 7 recessions since then. Even if the Great Depression of the
1930s is excluded, recessions in the earlier period still were on average more than
one and a half times as severe as those in the 1954-99 period.
Other evidence supports the notion that business cycle fluctuations have
diminished over time. From 1982 to 1998, fluctuations in GNP and unemployment were on average about 20 percent smaller than they were from 1954
to 1981, and fluctuations in inflation were less than half as large on average
(Chart 2-14). With the caveat that data from the 19th century and the early
20th century are less reliable than and not directly comparable to recent data,
business cycle fluctuations appear to have become less severe in the second
half of the 20th century than in earlier periods.
One other way to think about the postwar moderation of the business cycle
is in terms of the length of time that the economy has spent in recession and
the amount of time it has spent in expansion. The average length of expansions nearly doubled in the second half of the century, from about 2Vi years
during 1900-53 to about 5 years since then, and the average length of economic contractions has fallen from about 17 months to less than 11 months.

Unemployment Data," Journal of Political Economy, 1986.

Sources of Business Cycle Moderation
One source of moderation in the business cycle is the changing nature of the
U.S. economy. Historically, inventories have been one of the most volatile
components of spending. Businesses now tend to operate with much leaner
inventory stocks than before, and they appear to be better able to adjust these
stocks to changing economic conditions. The composition of output has also
tended to move from more volatile toward less volatile sectors. Spending on
services, which tends to be relatively insensitive to cyclical fluctuations, made
up over half of GDP in 1999, compared with less than a third in 1950. Conversely, the cyclically sensitive manufacturing sector makes up a smaller share of
aggregate output and employment than in the past.
The growing role of stabilization policies—fiscal and monetary policies,
which buffer the effects of destabilizing influences on the economy—may also
have contributed to this moderation of the business cycle. Over the last century, the role offiscalpolicy in affecting the business cycle not only has grown but
has indeed changed fundamentally. At the beginning of the 20th century, the
Federal Governments role in the economy was tiny. In 1900 there was no Federal income tax and no Social Security, and total Federal receipts equaled a
mere 3 percent of GNP. The Nations monetary policy was generally one of
simple adherence to the gold standard, which limited the use of monetary policy as a stabilizing tool.
The Federal Governments role in macroeconomic stabilization grew in
importance following World War II. Although the income tax had been

76 I Economic Report of the President




introduced in 1913 and Social Security in 1937, by 1940 income and payroll
taxes equaled only 3 percent of GNE Income and payroll tax revenue rose
thereafter as a share of GNP and has averaged around 14 percent over the last
30 years. It amounted to over 16 percent of GNP in 1999. The role and character of monetary policy likewise underwent a fundamental transformation
during the late 20th century. Recent experience supports the view that modern monetary policy can achieve the long-run goal of price stability while aiding in the cause of short-run macroeconomic stabilization by "leaning against
the wind" when macroeconomic imbalances develop.

Do Expansions Die of Old Age?
One question that has intrigued economists is whether each expansion contains the seeds of its own destruction. Is it true that the longer an expansion
lasts, the more likely it is to end in the next quarter or the next year? Studies
find no compelling evidence that postwar expansions possess an inherent tendency to die of old age. Instead, they appear to fall victim to specific events
related to economic disturbances or government policies. For instance, the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, which led to a doubling of oil prices in the fall of
1990, contributed to the decline in economic activity during the recession of
1990-91. American consumers, having suffered through the tripling of oil
prices in 1973-74 and their subsequent doubling in 1979, anticipated negative repercussions on the U.S. economy, and consumer confidence declined
sharply and consumption fell.
An example of policy affecting the end of an expansion is the Federal
Reserves successful disinflation at the end of the 1970s and in the early 1980s.
In 1979 the CPI inflation rate reached 11 percent. Under a new chairman, the
Federal Reserve dedicated itself to a renewed effort to reduce inflation, which
fell 8 percentage points over 4 years, to about 3 percent by the end of 1983.
As a result, the short expansion that started in July 1980 came to a halt one
year later. With the Federal funds rate peaking at just over 19 percent in June
1981, the economy fell into a 16-month recession, during which the unemployment rate rose above 10 percent.

An Expansion Is Only as Old as It Feels, and This One
Still Feels Young
Although the current expansion entered its 105th month in December
1999—what might be considered old age, based on the history of U.S. business cycles—it still appears young and vibrant when compared to the later
stages of past long expansions. What is noteworthy in todays economy is the
absence of developments that are frequently identified with the twilight of an
expansion. In particular, productivity has accelerated during the last several




Chapter 2 I 77

years, rather than stagnated as in other mature expansions, and price inflation
has been on a falling, not a rising, trend.
In the later stages of the two previous long expansions, productivity growth
slowed to just above a 1 percent annual rate (Table 2-2). In contrast, over the
last 2 years, productivity has been growing nearly 3 percent a year, in part
owing to rapid business investment. Strong productivity growth has enabled
the economy to grow rapidly and helped restrain the cost pressures typically
associated with a strong economy.
Inflation trends provide a second sign of an expansions age and health. Late
in the expansions of the 1960s and the 1980s, high rates of utilization and
decelerating productivity contributed to an acceleration in prices, that is, a rising inflation rate. In the current expansion, even with unemployment well
below 5 percent, the acceleration in productivity has helped keep inflation stable. In fact, inflation has fallen relative to the previous 2-year period. Surveys
of inflation expectations provide a further encouraging sign that inflation
remains in check: these surveys show that both consumers and professional
forecasters expect inflation to stay low over the next several years. Some have
argued that the U.S. economy is now nearly immune to the business cycle,
because of the effects of increased international competition, rapid innovation
and productivity growth, and improved flexibility of the production and distribution systems.

Of course, it is premature to declare the business cycle dead. But there are
reasons to believe that the economy will continue to perform as well as, if not
better than, it has in the recent past, with less of the roller-coaster ride that
characterized the 1970s and early 1980s (not to mention earlier decades).
Unlike in the 1980s and early 1990s, fiscal discipline is now the order of the
day. Projected surpluses can now be used to pay down the debt and free up
capital for investment in education, business, and technology, spurring faster
growth. Likewise, the Federal Reserve no longer follows the stop-and-go policies of the 1970s, but instead practices a systematic policy that fosters price
stability and long-term growth.

The Economic Outlook
As always, the growth of the supply-side components of GDP underlies the
projection of long-term growth. In particular, the prospect for continued productivity growth is the key issue in the economic outlook and the source of
many of the upside and downside risks to the Administrations projection.
Labor productivity trended upward at an average annual rate of 1.4 percent
from 1973 to 1995 but then accelerated to a 2.9 percent clip over the past 4
years (Chart 2-15). The unexpected surge in productivity growth has led to
several positive developments: it has restrained inflation, allowing the unemployment rate to fall lower than it otherwise might; it has increased economChart 2-15 Labor Productivity (Nonfarm Business Sector)

ic growth, with positive effects on the Federal budget balance; and it has
boosted stock market valuations.
Over the past 4 years, the income-side measure of output, gross domestic
income, has grown half a percentage point per year faster than the productside measure, gross domestic product. Because measurement error enters into
both, the Council of Economic Advisers believes that we learn something
from each, and therefore the following discussion focuses on an average of the
two measures in discussing trend productivity and potential output.

What Has Caused Productivity Growth to Rise?
Because the apparent acceleration in productivity is less than 4 years old, its
cause and future continuation remain controversial. A year ago, available data
showed productivity growth to be within the range of normal cyclical variation.
But more recent data, especially the October benchmark revision to the national accounts (Box 2-3), place the acceleration on more solid footing. National
accounts revisions result from changes in price measurement and new definitions as well as the arrival of new data. Abstracting from the first two, the databased revision over 1995-98 allows us to advance the start of the acceleration at
least to 1997 and perhaps as early as 1995. And insofar as the revised data are
more accurate, they make the identification of the acceleration more credible.
The Councils analysis finds that two developments account for half of this
acceleration: an increase in capital—especially computer and software capital—
and productivity growth in the computer-producing sector.
Labor productivity increases when workers have more capital to work with.
Capital deepening has been a persistent feature of the U.S. economy since
World War II, as capital services per hour has increased in almost every year. Yet
in 1995, business investment as a share of GDP climbed above its long-term
average, and it has continued upward since. As a result, capital services per hour
grew faster after 1995 than before. Estimation using preliminary data and
established methods of growth accounting (that is, weighting the growth rate
of capital services per hour by capitals cost share) finds that capital deepening
accounts for 1.53 percentage points of annual labor productivity growth during the 1995-99 period. This is up from 1.06 percentage points during the
1973-95 period (second line in Table 2-3). The difference between these
growth rates shows that capital deepening accounts for 0.47 percentage point
of the 1.47-percentage-point acceleration in productivity after 1995 (Table 23, column 3). Investment in computers and software accounts for all of this
gain from capital deepening. (Official data on capital services will not be
released until mid-2000, and so these calculations remain tentative.)
This contribution from capital deepening is important, but it is not the
whole story. Although capital deepening contributes to labor productivity
growth in the long run, it has not been a reliable guide to year-to-year fluctu80 I Economic Report of the President




Box 2-3. What Did We Learn from the GDP Benchmark Revision?
The Commerce Department's benchmark revision of the GDP statistics, released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis last October, incorporated new data from the last full economic census (conducted every 5
years) and from the benchmark input-output accounts from 1992, as well
as from the revised annual sources that are usually incorporated in the
annual July GDP revision. The benchmark revision also provided an
opportunity to change accounting definitions and to make the pre-1995
accounts consistent with current methods of deflation.
Spending. Over the 11-year period from 1987 to 1998, revisions raised
the annual rate of growth of real GDP by an average of 0.4 percentage
point.The revisions fall into three main categories (Chart 2-16): revisions
to source data, revisions to the methods used in adjusting for inflation,
and new definitions of spending categories and subcategories.
Incorporating new source data from the economic censuses and other
sources added about 0.2 percentage point per year to growth since 1994
but had little impact on earlier years.
Changes in deflation methodology accounted for the largest component of the benchmark revision for the 1987-94 period. This change
reflects the retrospective application of current CPI methods to the years
1978-94. (These methods were already in use for the post-1994 period.)
Among several new definitions introduced, the most significant is the
inclusion of computer software purchases in investment, which raises
the growth rate of real GDP by an average of 0.18 percentage point per
year over 1987-98. By 1998 the cumulative impact of these definitional
changes was to raise the measured level of nominal GDP by 2.0 percent
and the growth of real GDP since 1959 by 3.5 percent.
Income and saving. In the GDP accounts, pension plans for government employees were moved from the government to the household
sector, so that employer contributions to (and interest and dividends
earned by) these pension plans are now classified as personal income.
On the other hand, pension benefit payments were removed from the
transfer income component of personal income. This reclassification
boosted personal saving but reduced government saving by an offsetting amount.The personal saving rate still shows a marked decline over
the 1990s but was no longer negative in 1999 as it was under the old GDP
accounts. New source data boosted measured wages and salaries substantially in 1998, adding to income and saving.
With software now classified as investment, software depreciation is
added to the income side of the accounts. Although the new definition
boosted gross national saving, net saving is changed little.
Productivity. The reclassification of software as investment and the
improvements in deflation methodology boosted measured productivity

growth over most of the historical period affected by these revisions and
had been anticipated. In contrast, the changes brought about by the new

consistently measured basis) had been growing faster than had been
previously believed.

ations in productivity. In addition, the power of capital deepening to explain
even long-run changes can be overstated. For example, capital shallowing
accounts for very little of the post-1973 productivity slowdown.
Increasing quality of the work force has been another persistent feature of
U.S. economic growth. The American work force has become better educated, and since about 1980 the average worker is more experienced. Nothing
dramatically new happened to the index of labor composition (which measures the effect of education and work experience on productivity) after 1995,
but it may have added an additional 0.05 percentage point to labor productivity growth after 1995 (third line in Table 2-3).
Besides their role in capital deepening, computers enter GDP directly as
part of consumer durables and business investment. Hence, productivity
growth in the production of computers contributes directly to overall pro-

ductivity growth. Productivity growth has been particularly rapid in the computer-producing sector. A measure of productivity in the computer-producing
sector would capture this direct effect. However, it is impossible to be precise
about computer sector productivity because of the difficulty in measuring the
real inputs (such as engineering and other business services) to this sector from
other sectors. In lieu of a direct productivity measure, the rate of decline in the
relative price of computers tells us something about quality improvement in
the computer sector. The price of computers relative to that of nonfarm output, which had been falling at an 18 percent average annual rate before 1995,
fell at a 29 percent annual rate thereafter, indicating an acceleration in computer quality after 1995. An estimation that weights these changes by the
share offinalsales of computers in nonfarm output (about VA percent) finds
that improved computer quality added 0.23 percentage point to the post1995 acceleration (fourth line of Table 2-3). (These methods and estimates
are, of course, approximate; one study using different methods attributes most
of the acceleration in trend productivity to the computer-producing sector.)
These three explanations—capital deepening, changing labor composition,
and rising computer quality—may account for half of the post-1995 acceleration in productivity. The other half reflects all the other factors that affect productivity growth. These may include cyclical influences and new efficiencies
from the use of the Internet, especially for business-to-business transactions.




Chapter 2 I 83

The Outlook for Productivity
Can the factors that account for the more rapid pace of labor productivity
growth since 1995 be sustained? The data provide a mixed but, on balance,
positive picture.
The trend toward a more educated work force seems likely to continue with
support from the Administration s policy of promoting investment in education and job training. Moreover, the median age of the work force will continue to rise through at least 2008, when the leading edge of the baby-boom generation retires. But these trends are not expected to shift, and as a result, the
contribution of labor composition to productivity is not likely to change much
from its historical average of 0.3 percentage point per year.
The decline in the relative price of computers has been particularly rapid
over the past 4 years, and so it is prudent to expect that this rate will return to
its long-term rate of about 20 percent per year. If that happens, computers'
contribution to productivity growth will drop from about 0.4 to 0.3 percentage point per year.
The growth rate of capital services per hour increased in 4 of the past 5 years,
reaching 5.4 percent in 1999—a rate that implies a 2-percentage-point yearly
contribution of capital deepening to labor productivity growth. For 2000 the
pace of capital deepening is likely to increase further, because the current level
of investment is already very high. (The rate of growth of capital services
depends on the level of investment.) Projections over the longer run are more
speculative, but the level of nominal investment is expected to remain high relative to nominal output. The President s budget proposal—in which the Federal Government continues to pay down the Federal debt—also promotes this
investment. This high-investment economy is likely to promote a continued
strong pace of capital deepening and strong productivity growth.
Besides the contributions of labor and capital, cyclical and other considerations enter the productivity forecast. Most important, the level of productivity
in 1999 was likely above its trend, as hiring probably has not caught up with
the surge in output, and many vacancies probably remain unfilled. A model
that allows labor productivity to differ from its trend because of these cyclical
influences estimates the trend of labor productivity growth at a 1.8 percent
annual rate since 1990, up from a 1.6 percent annual rate from the peak of the
previous business cycle to 1990. Simulations from this model overestimate the
level of productivity from 1993 through 1997 and underestimate it thereafter.
Although these errors may stem from the lack of a role for capital deepening in
the model, this omission has the offsetting benefit that the estimate of the longterm trend in labor productivity is not overly sensitive to cyclical movements in
investment spending.
Second, the projection depends on the time horizon. A projection for the
near future extrapolates recent trends, whereas a projection for the distant
84 I Economic Report of the President




future extrapolates long-term trends. Near-term projections ought to balance
the probable continued role of capital deepening in supporting strong productivity growth with the likelihood that a lot of job vacancies will be filled.
Weighting these considerations, the Administration projects the trend rate of
increase in labor productivity at 2.2 percent per year for 1999-2002, which is
down from the nearly 3 percent pace actually observed over the past few years.
The projection of productivity growth then begins to fade toward its longterm rate, with growth of 2.0 percent for 2003-05 and then 1.8 percent for
2006-10. Productivity over the entire 1999-2010 interval is projected to grow
at a 2.0 percent average annual rate.

Supply-Side Components of GDP
In addition to productivity, the factors on the supply side whose effects on
GDP growth sum to total GDP growth include population, the labor force
participation rate, the employment rate, the workweek, and the two additional ratios shown in Table 2-4. In line with the latest projection from the

Bureau of the Census, the working-age population is projected to grow at
almost 1.1 percent annually through 2007 (a bit faster than projected last
year). In line with the latest projection from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the
labor force participation rate is projected to increase by less than 0.1 percent
per year. The length of the average workweek is projected to remain about flat
over the entire projection horizon. In contrast, the employment rate is projected to decline roughly 0.1 percent per year as the unemployment rate edges
up to 5.2 percent—the middle of the range judged consistent with long-run
inflation stability. From 2008 on, growth in the working-age population
slows a bit, and the labor force participation rate begins to fall as the first wave
of the baby-boom cohort reaches the early retirement age of 62.

Budget Effects of a High-Investment Economy
An economy fueled by high investment—especially in computers—will be
characterized by two forces that partly offset the positive effects on the Federal budget of faster productivity growth: higher depreciation and a larger
wedge between the CPI and the GDP price index.
A high-investment economy is an economy in which a large share of output
is required to replace worn-out capital, simply because more investment
means more capital goods to be depreciated. The share of nominal business
fixed investment in nominal GDP, which had averaged 11 percent since
1959, increased to about HVz percent by the end of 1999 and is likely to
increase further in the near term. The 1 ^-percentage-point increase in the
investment share thus far portends a similar increase in the share of total gross
domestic income claimed by depreciation. As depreciation claims an increasing share of income, less room will be available for the taxable components
such as profits and wages and salaries.
The rapid decline in computer prices, together with an increasing nominal
share of computers in GDP, also has negative effects on the Federal surplus
through the "wedge" between the CPI and the GDP price index. A larger
wedge reduces the Federal budget surplus because cost-of-living adjustments
for Social Security and other indexed programs increase with the CPI, whereas Federal revenues increase with the slower-growing GDP price index. The
effect is reinforced by the fact that the CPI is also used to index income tax
brackets and other features of the tax code.
Rapid declines in computer prices increase the wedge, because computer
prices have a 10 times larger weight in the GDP price index (1.1 percent) than
in the CPI (where the December 1999 relative importance weight is only 0.11
percent). For example, computer price declines held down the increase of the
GDP price index by 0.23 percentage point but reduced CPI inflation by only
0.03 percentage point.

86 I Economic Report of the President




Over the past 6 years, the CPI-U-RS has increased 0.6 percentage point per
year faster than the GDP price index. The projected wedge is in line with this
historical average, as the Administrations inflation projection flattens out after
2002 at 2.6 percent for the CPI and 2.0 percent for the GDP price index
(Table 2-5).

What Has Held Inflation in Check?
During the past 2Vi years the key measures of inflation have remained low
and stable despite an unemployment rate below 5 percent. Previous experience suggests that such a sustained period of low unemployment would push
up the inflation rate. Yet inflation, as measured by the four-quarter change in
the price index for GDP and the core CPI, has remained remarkably subdued.
In the 1995 and 1996 editions of the Economic Report of the President, the
NAIRU, the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation, was estimated to lie in a range centered around 5% percent. There is growing evidence that the NAIRU has fallen below that level. Indeed, several studies
using statistical methods that allow the NAIRU to change over time estimate
a pronounced drop in the late 1990s. Possible causes include spare manufacturing capacity, new efficiencies in the labor market from the expanded use of
temporary help workers and Internet job search resources, higher-than-expected productivity growth, and declining import prices. Manufacturing capacity
was discussed previously; the other factors are considered below.




Chapter 2 I 87

The Changing Labor Force
Over the past two decades, the aging of the baby-boom generation has
reduced the proportion of younger workers in the labor force. In the mid- and
late 1970s, young baby-boomers swelled the ranks of the youngest segment of
the labor force: in 1978 nearly 25 percent of American workers were between
the ages of 16 and 24. As the baby-boom generation aged, this share fell and
is now about 16 percent. Because younger workers are typically more prone to
unemployment spells than older workers (the unemployment rate of workers
aged 16-24 is nearly three times that of workers over 25), this aging of the
labor force reduced the overall NAIRU. According to recent estimates, the
changing age profile of American workers accounts for about 0.7 percentage
point of the reduction in the NAIRU during the 1980s but had no significant
further effect in the 1990s.
Rising education levels may also have brought down the NAIRU. The
1980s and 1990s were a period of marked increases in the educational
attainment of the U.S. labor force. In 1998, for example, 57 percent of
workers had some college education, up from about one-third in the mid1970s. Unemployment rates are consistently lower for groups with more
years of schooling. For instance, the unemployment rate for those with no
high school diploma averages about 4 percentage points higher than for
those with a high school diploma but no college. And the unemployment
rate of those with a high school diploma but no college degree is about 3
percentage points higher than that for college graduates. These differences
in unemployment rates may also reflect other worker characteristics that are
correlated with education, however, obscuring any causal link between educational attainment and the NAIRU.

Temporary Help Agencies
The rapid growth of the temporary help industry may also have contributed to a decline in the NAIRU. Temporary help agencies have existed
since the 1920s, but their role in labor markets expanded greatly during the
1980s and 1990s. Between 1982 and 1999, total employment in this industry increased more than sevenfold, and the industry's share of overall employment has grown from less than 0.5 percent in the early 1980s to more than
2.3 percent in 1999.
One way the temporary help industry may reduce the NAIRU is by creating short-term employment opportunities for workers who might otherwise
be unemployed. Businesses in cyclical or volatile industries need flexibility to
scale their payrolls up or down as demand fluctuates. Businesses frequendy
need temporary employees with specialized skills, who can substitute for permanent employees on leave. Similarly, the growing availability of temporary

88 I Economic Report of the President




work enables job hunters to work while they search for a permanent position
and provides opportunities for people who desire to work intermittently.
Labor market data support the hypothesis that the temporary help industry
creates employment opportunities. Thus far during this expansion, the temporary help industry has created 1.9 million new jobs, and this figure does not
count those workers who found permanent jobs through their temporary
assignments. Moreover, in 1997, 60 percent of all temporary workers would
have preferred permanent positions, and about a third of this group were
actively seeking permanent employment. This suggests that a significant proportion of temporary workers would have been unemployed in the absence of
the temporary help industry. In fact, a recent study found that the unemployment rate in 1997 might have been up to 0.3 percentage point higher if only
half of these "involuntary" temporary workers had remained idle while they
sought permanent employment.

The Internet Job Market
Yet another partial explanation for the decline in the NAIRU is improved
job matching through the Internet. The new medium has recently added to
its many functions that of providing the virtual space for a burgeoning labor
market. As both job hunters and recruiters discover its advantages, the
Internet job market is rapidly becoming part of the mainstream job market.
According to one study, nearly 60 percent of human resources managers
used online recruiting in 1998, up from 13 percent in 1996. Moreover, a
survey found that large companies are increasing the resources devoted to
Internet recruiting.
A leading Internet jobs clearinghouse is Americas Job Bank. Part of Americas Career Kit (see Chapter 4), Americas Job Bank is a partnership between
the Department of Labor and the public employment services operated by the
States. Funded by unemployment insurance tax revenues, Americas Job Bank
links 1,800 employment service offices around the country, aggregating information on over 1.5 million job seekers and a similar number of job opportunities in one convenient, easily accessible Internet site. Job hunters can post
their resumes and search the job listing data base; firms can post job listings
and search the resume data base. Americas Job Bank charges no transaction or
usage fees for either job seekers or employers.
Internet job sites such as Americas Job Bank represent a more efficient
mechanism for clearing labor markets than has been available before. These
sites dramatically reduce the cost of the search process for both job hunters
and recruiters, enabling labor market participants to investigate a greater
number of opportunities in less time and at lower cost. One study found that
the cost per hire of Internet advertising for an opening is about one-eighth
that of traditional advertising methods. Such improvements in efficiency




Chapter 2 I 89

make it easier and cheaper for job seekers to find suitable openings and for
corporate recruiters to find suitable candidates.

Productivity and the NAIRU
Over long periods, labor productivity and real product wages (hourly compensation deflated by the price of output) move in tandem, because businesses can afford to give real wage increases that are justified by productivity gains,
and competition forces them to do so. Eventually, a change in the rate of productivity growth tends to be matched by an equal change in the growth of
both actual and anticipated real wages. Breaks in trend productivity growth,
however, are difficult to recognize, and therefore wage and price inflation
adjust only gradually to any change.
A significant break in the trend rate of productivity growth has occurred
once before since accurate statistics have been kept. That break occurred after
1973. The productivity slowdown at that time elevated the NAIRU and contributed—along with demographics, oil price increases, and strong demand—
to rising inflation in the late 1970s. During that period, nominal hourly compensation increased at a rate that would have been consistent with stable
inflation if productivity had still been growing at its pre-1973 trend. Instead,
because productivity growth had fallen, the higher compensation resulted in
rising inflation of unit labor costs and prices. Making matters worse, many
wage setters adjusted to the higher rate of inflation, creating a wage-price spiral. This process of rising inflation might have continued had the back-toback recessions of 1980 and 1981-82 not raised the unemployment rate to 10
percent, well above the NAIRU. By the mid-1980s inflation was again stable,
but gains in real hourly compensation (deflated by the output price) had settled down to about Wi percent per year—a drop of almost half from the pace
of the 1960s.
The acceleration in productivity after 1995 may have initiated a similar
process, but in reverse, allowing the unemployment rate to fall lower, with less
consequence for inflation, than would have been possible otherwise. The rate
of growth of nominal hourly compensation has increased during recent years,
but these nominal increases have not resulted in rising price inflation. Businesses have been able to grant these larger pay increases without raising price
inflation, partly because increases in unit labor costs have remained stable as
rising productivity growth offset the rising compensation gains.
The new, higher trend growth rate of productivity since 1995 could have
temporarily lowered the NAIRU, because it can take many years for firms and
workers to recognize this favorable development and incorporate it into their
wage-setting process. In the meantime, the productivity surprise can stabilize
inflation of unit labor costs and prices even at unemployment rates below the
previous NAIRU. The Phillips curve estimated from the scatter diagram in

90 I Economic Report of the President




Chart 2-17 shows how this could happen. It assumes that nominal increases
in hourly compensation reflect three factors: a bonus for tight labor markets,
as reflected in a low unemployment rate; a full adjustment for expected price
inflation (with backward-looking inflation expectations); and a normal
increase in real wages (which here will be called the "real wage norm"). The
real wage norm may reflect prevailing views of the trend in labor productivity. But little is known about how the real wage norm is formed, and therefore
the model is estimated on the assumption that the real wage norm reflects the
previous years increase in real hourly compensation.
With stable productivity growth, and with unemployment equal to the
long-term NAIRU (where the diagonal regression line crosses the x-axis in the
chart), wage and price inflation are stable from one year to the next. However, a 1-percentage-point positive surprise in productivity growth has the effect
of temporarily lowering the NAIRU by \lA percentage point. With nominal
wage growth unchanged and productivity growth higher, unit labor costs, and
with them price inflation, would fall if the unemployment rate does not
change. Only with a lower employment rate would unit labor costs and price
inflation be stabilized. Hence the short-term NAIRU is lower.
The effect of the increase in productivity growth on unemployment
probably will not last indefinitely. If productivity growth is maintained at its
current high level, it will cease to be "unexpected," the real wage norm will
eventually rise to that same level, and the short-term NAIRU will gravitate
back to its long-term level.

Chapter 2 I 91

Declining Relative Import Prices
A decline in the relative price of imports can affect the short-term NAIRU
in a manner similar to an acceleration of productivity. Competition from
imports restrains the markup of prices over unit labor costs and thus reduces
price inflation for a given rate of wage inflation. (A 1 percent decline in relative import prices lowers the inflation rate by 0.1 percentage point.) The 4
percent annual rate of decline in the price of nonpetroleum imports relative to
U.S. nonfarm business prices during 1997 and 1998 lowered nonfarm price
inflation by about 0.4 percentage point per year. The effect on the short-term
NAIRU is similar to that of a productivity acceleration of the same magnitude
and can be argued to have lowered the NAIRU by about 0.5 percentage point.
World price trends cannot be expected to continue to restrain inflation as
much as they have in recent years. The relative price of nonpetroleum
imports firmed in 1999, and with strength returning to overseas economies,
these prices are likely to increase in 2000. In addition, the rebound in oil
prices in 1999 may exert some upward pressure on prices of commodities
that use oil as an input.

The Unemployment Forecast
The Administrations projection of the unemployment rate roughly follows its projection of the short-term NAIRU and reflects the factors just discussed. The short-term NAIRU, which has been centered around 5% percent over the postwar period and in the mid-1990s, probably fell into the 4
to AV2 percent range through the combination of the temporary help and
Internet innovations to the labor market, the productivity surprise, falling
relative import prices, and perhaps other factors. It is very difficult to quantify the long-term effects of the temporary help and Internet innovations to
the labor market. For the purpose of its conservative forecast, the Administration estimates that they account for roughly a 0.5-percentage-point permanent reduction in the NAIRU from its historical average, to a range centered around 5.2 percent. In contrast, the effects of the productivity surprise
and falling relative import prices are temporary and are expected to erode
over the next several years. As a consequence, in the Administrations conservative projection, the unemployment rate edges up to 5.2 percent by
2003 and remains at that level thereafter.

The Near-Term Outlook
After growing at a 4.3 percent annual rate over the past 4 years, real GDP
is projected to decelerate to an annual growth rate of 2.9 percent over the four
quarters of 2000. This rate, which was slighdy above the consensus projection

92 I Economic Report of the President




of professional economic forecasters when the GDP projection was finalized
in November, is now a bit on the low side.
Because it constitutes two-thirds of GDP, consumption is expected to
account for much of the expected deceleration. Personal outlays increased
faster than disposable income in each of the past 7 years, and the saving rate
plunged to 2 percent by the end of 1999. Although these consumption gains
are consistent with the rapid rise in stock market wealth, they are not likely to
persist unless the stock market continues to surge. More likely, real consumption growth will slow from its 5 percent rate over the past 2 years to rates consistent with the growth of real disposable income. However, if the stock market performs as well this year as it has in the recent past, it would present some
upside risk to the Administrations projection.
Real business fixed investment has increased faster than real GDP in almost
every year of this expansion. This pattern is expected to persist over the projection horizon as technological change boosts demand for computers and
communications equipment. In contrast, real business purchases of industrial
equipment have been nearly flat for the past year, and real investment in nonresidential structures has declined. If total demand slows as expected, purchases of these other investment goods and structures may decline.
Residential investment has been very strong, owing to continued gains in
real disposable income and increases in wealth. With real incomes continuing
to rise, housing starts are expected to remain high. However, the pace of residential investment is likely to fall back to a rate in line with the demographics of household growth.
Inventories remain quite lean in relation to sales. In fact, nonfarm inventories (measured as months of supply) have fallen to the lowest level on record.
These lean stocks militate against any near-term threat to the expansion from
excessive inventories. Nevertheless, as this report goes to press, there is speculation that firms may have stockpiled a buffer against Y2K disruptions before
the turn of the year, planning to work off these stocks afterward.
Real exports, which had grown only 2 percent over the four quarters of
1998, grew 4 percent during 1999. The pickup may reflect an economic
rebound among the United States' trading partners, especially those affected
by the Asian economic crises. For example, Korean GDP grew at a 15 percent
annual rate in the first three quarters of 1999 after falling 5 percent over the
four quarters of 1998. Exports to a group of 10 major U.S. trading partners in
East Asia, which fell $38 billion during the first year of the crisis (from the
second quarter of 1997 to the second quarter of 1998), have recouped about
half of that loss. A pickup is also evident among the 11 countries that have
adopted the euro as their currency. In these countries GDP has accelerated to
a 2.8 percent annual rate of growth during the first three quarters of 1999,
from a 1.9 percent annual rate during the four quarters of 1998. The matur-




Chapter2 I 93

ing recovery among these trading partners is expected to lead to solid growth
of U.S. exports for the next several years.
Even with this growth in export markets, however, net exports are likely to
fall even further in the near future as U.S. demand for imports continues to
outstrip foreign demand for U.S. exports. Nevertheless, the current account
balance is expected to stabilize after 2001 and then improve, as foreign output
growth boosts export demand while slower growth in the United States curbs
import demand.
Interest rates are expected to remain flat over the entire 11-year projection
span, at 5.2 percent (on a bank discount basis) for 91-day Treasury bills and
6.1 percent for the 10-year Treasury yield. Real interest rates, calculated by
subtracting the Administrations expected rate of inflation (2.6 percent in the
long term as measured by the CPI) from projected nominal rates, are projected to be similar to their historical averages.
On the income side, the Administrations projection is based on the longrun. stability of the labor share of GDP. This share is flat over the projection
period at about 58 percent—its historical long-run average. Wages as a share
of total compensation are expected to erode slighdy, as other labor income,
especially medical insurance premiums, is expected to grow faster than wages.
Because the labor share is projected to be flat and stable, so too is the capital
share. However, the division of income within the capital share is not stable.
As noted earlier, a rise in the depreciation share is a partial offset to the benefits of a high-investment economy, and this growing depreciation expense is
projected to come at the expense of profits. Profits before tax, which were 9.2
percent of GDP in the third quarter of 1999, are projected to slide to about
TA percent of GDP by 2006.
A moderation in output growth to 2.5 percent is projected for 2001-03
(Table 2-5), 0.7 percentage point below the economy's potential growth rate
at the beginning of that period. The tightness in labor and product markets at
the beginning of the period is expected to dissipate during this slow-growth
period. Over these 3 years, the unemployment rate is expected to edge up
slowly to 5.2 percent, the middle of the range of unemployment compatible
in the long run with stable inflation. From 2003 to 2007, the Administrations
forecast is built around a 3.0 percent growth rate of potential output. From
2008 to 2010, real GDP slows further to a 2.6 percent annual rate, reflecting
slower population growth and the anticipated retirement of the first wave of
the baby-boom generation.
The Administration does not believe that annual growth of 3 percent is the
best the economy can do; rather this projection reflects a conservative estimate
of the effects of Administration policies to promote education and to foster a
high-investment economy by paying down the national debt. The outcome
could be even better—as indeed it has been for the past 4 years. But the

94 I Economic Report of the President




Administrations forecast is used for a very important purpose: to project Federal revenue and outlays so that the government can meet its responsibilities
while living within its means. For this purpose, excessive optimism is dangerous and can stand in the way of making difficult but necessary budget choices. On the other hand, excessive pessimism can force difficult and possibly
counterproductive decisions where none is required. In the final analysis, the
only worthy objective is the creation of a sound forecast that uses all available
information as fully as possible.
As of December 1999, the current economic expansion, having lasted 105
months, was the longest ever during peacetime and only a month shy of the
longest on record. There is no apparent reason why this expansion cannot
continue. As already noted, expansions do not die of old age. It is always difficult to forecast the future of the economy, but the current situation of low
and stable core inflation and lean inventories reveals no obvious signs of an
imminent slowdown. The most likely prognosis is therefore the same as last
year s: sustained job creation and continued noninflationary growth.

As new types of information technology link together computers, telephones, and other
types of communications devices, network effects become increasingly important in determining the success orfailure of some products. In industries not subject to network effects,
the total value of a product is simply the sum of its value to each user. But in industries
where network effects are present, such as telephone or Internet service, the more links the
network has, the more valuable it is to each participant in the network.

O

ver the last century, the American economy has adapted again and
again to continuing technological change. Repeatedly during our history, American firms and workers have exploited opportunities inspired by a
succession of technical advances, in the process creating new products, new
services, and even whole new industries. The new ideas that have reshaped
individual industries have often had a broader effect on the economy as well.
Innovation makes it possible to produce more output from society's available
labor and capital, increasing the productivity of Americas workers. Those
productivity improvements have led to rising prosperity and living standards,
as Chapter 2 discussed.




97

Innovations during the 20th century have led to dramatic changes in how
firms compete in the American economy. In some cases, new technology has
given birth to new markets, where startup companies compete on equal
terms on a fresh and level playing field. In others, it has opened a door for
entrepreneurs to enter older industries and challenge the established incumbents. As these forms of competition have spread and flourished, consumers
have benefited in numerous ways, from expanded service, greater variety, and
falling prices. These gains come not just from the new entrants but also from
the old incumbent firms, forced to respond to the economic challenges
posed by their rivals.
Today, new technologies are transforming the economy. No one can yet
predict all the changes to come, but it seems clear that the information
economy is changing the way companies compete and the nature of work.
In addition to changing the competitive playing field, technology is
increasingly redefining the role of the firm. Somefirmsare expanding to take
on new roles and integrate new activities into their enterprise, some are
finding it efficient to outsource some of their activities to specialists outside
the firm, and some are restructuring through mergers and acquisitions. Two
industries where these trends are strikingly evident are telecommunications
and information technology; this chapter will look at both these industries,
in which many firms, old as well as new, are exploring the economic
opportunities made possible by innovations in computers, communications
technology, and the Internet.
Although technological innovation brings constant and ultimately
beneficial change to the economy, it also requires a constant reevaluation of
government policies to determine how best to shape the forces of change to
promote the public interest. As technology becomes increasingly vital to our
knowledge-based economy, a crucial task of government is to design an
appropriate technology policy to maintain the flow of new ideas, products,
and methods that sustains long-run growth.
One element of technology policy is governments role in creating but also
limiting the property rights of innovators. Without the intellectual property
rights provided by patents and copyrights, for example, the reward to innovation in many fields would fall, as imitators quickly develop similar products. Yet strong property rights for innovation can also create barriers to entry
and competition, hampering not only the mere imitators but also the true
innovators seeking to build on the existing knowledge base. This problem
becomes particularly acute as knowledge-based industries, such as software
and information technology, grow in economic importance.
A second element of technology policy in today s economy is supporting
the research and development (R&D) necessary to innovation. Although the
private sector in recent years has increased its R&D expenditure, some of the

98 I Economic Report of the President




basic and applied research that forms the building blocks for tomorrow's discoveries may not take place without government support. Rather than support technologies that have clear and immediate commercial potential
(which would likely be developed by the private sector without government
support), government should seek out new technologies that will create benefits with large spillovers to society at large. Basic research that expands
human knowledge is one example of the type of research that may have wide
applications in many areas of the economy. By supporting the research necessary for scientific advances, government funding can create the knowledge
from which will emerge the new technologies, new products, and new jobs of
tomorrows economy.
Another critical task for government is to ensure that the benefits of new
technologies are widely shared. Well-functioning markets inherently maximize the private benefits from exchanges between individuals and firms, but
markets do not always succeed in maximizing social benefits at the same
time. Inefficiencies in the market, whether created by insufficient R&D
incentives or from a firms market power, can limit the gains society receives
from technological innovation. One way to promote the widespread
adoption of innovations is to ensure that policy set by the public sector
fosters rather than stifles competition in the private sector. Antitrust policy is
one tool for encouraging competition. When the Nations antitrust laws were
originally adopted, market power created by economies of scale in the
production of many industrial goods was a major concern, but in todays
economy the market power inherent in products that become de facto
standards for an industry may be just as troubling. In addition to a vigorous
antitrust policy, government can promote competition by changing the
regulatory framework within which industries operate, to remove barriers to
competition and spur innovation, thereby creating jobs for American
workers and new services for American consumers.
In other areas of the economy, such as the rapidly developing field of
e-commerce, the challenge for government policy is different. Here new
businesses are springing up spontaneously, and at an explosive pace. By refraining from imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens, government can ensure that
innovative and valuable services will come to market. Government antitrust
enforcement will continue to ensure that mergers between large firms deeply
involved in the information economy will not injure competition.

Innovation and Economic Change: A Look Back
The changes that technology continues to unleash on our economy today
are sweeping and may at times seem overwhelming. No one yet knows what




Chapter 3 I 99

transformations the Internet and e-commerce, to take only the currently
most celebrated examples, will eventually bring. In these circumstances we
should remember that we are not the first generation to have to come to
grips with rapid technological progress. Notable examples of the rapid adoption of new innovations include electric power, automobiles, and television.
These earlier innovations spread through American households much as
have more recent innovations such as computers and cellular telephones
(Chart 3-1). As described below, throughout the 20th century new technological developments created new products and new ways for firms to conduct business, and so changed the structure of the economy. Those changes,
in turn, produced changes in the role of government in competition, regulatory, and technology policy.

One example, electricity, is a commonplace fixture in the economy of
today, but in 1900 the electric power industry was just getting under way. At
the turn of the century, fewer than 10 percent of homes had electric service,
and cities were still being wired for electric transmission grids powered by
central generating stations. At that time, only about 5 percent of factories
employed electricity as a power source; most still used steam or water power
to drive their machines through intricate arrangements of wheels, belts, and
shafts. Electricity was initially used to power similar systems, but the shortcomings of mechanical power distribution systems remained. Once factory

100 I Economic Report of the President




workplaces were reorganized so that groups of machines could be separately
powered by electric motors, however, manufacturers began to realize the full
potential of electricity to improve productivity. Over time, electric power was
incorporated into more and more elements of the modern factory. Some
have argued that the process may be repeating itself today with computers.
As modern businesses learn to use computers to change the way they operate,
they can find new ways to optimize business procedures and increase
productivity.
At other times during the century, technological advances in basic
industrial products such as oil dramatically increased productivity and
output, by expanding the scale at which firms could operate their plants.
But some of the largest firms also formed combinations, like the Standard
Oil trust, to limit competition. Concern about the market power of some
of these large new industrial combinations led to passage of two of the cornerstones of public policy toward competition. The Sherman Antitrust Act
(passed in 1890) governing anticompetitive actions by monopolies and the
Clayton Act (passed in 1914) governing mergers remain the basis of
antitrust law today.
The automobile, too, had made its appearance by the end of the 19th
century, but it remained a high-priced luxury item until Henry Ford built
the first automobile assembly line in 1913. Fords innovation revolutionized
the way cars were manufactured. Mass production of the Model T allowed
Ford to offer, on an unprecedented scale, a product that combined relatively
high quality with a dramatic reduction in cost. It made automobiles available
to millions of American consumers for the first time. As increasing numbers
of people bought the newer, cheaper cars, Ford continued to invest in his
factories, increasing their efficiency and realizing huge economies of scale.
Greater scale, in turn, allowed Ford to lower the cost of his automobiles still
further and sell even more. By the early 1920s the Ford Motor Company
dominated sales of automobiles in the United States, with a market share of
56 percent. Fords dominance was short-lived, however, as other manufacturers, with newer models and innovations of their own, adapted their
production processes following Ford s example. They were able to effectively
compete with Ford by satisfying consumer demand for variety. Ford's
innovation had a number of implications far beyond the automotive industry: it helped make America a more mobile society, for example. But perhaps
the most important outcome for the economy as a whole was that other
manufacturers in other industries soon copied the assembly line concept. The
impact of this spillover from Ford s idea to other industries was enormous:
mass production proved an economically efficient way to produce a vast
range of other consumer products.




Chapter 3 I 101

Another industry that saw major changes at the turn of the last century
was telecommunications. The Bell system had enjoyed a monopoly in telephone service in the United States until its basic patents on the telephone
expired in 1894, after which a wave of new competitors began providing
phone service. The Bell system had concentrated on serving major cities and
business customers, leaving many smaller communities unwired. Many of
these independents extended service to the underserved communities, while
others concentrated on competing with Bell in some major urban centers. By
1907, new entrants accounted for almost half the market. Service levels
increased rapidly with this new competition: telephone penetration (measured
as the number of phones per 100 people) rose from fewer than 2 in 1900 to
more than 10 by 1916. Many of the new entrants adopted the latest innovation
in telecommunications, automatic switching, much more quickly than the Bell
system, which continued to rely upon operators to connect calls manually.
Yet despite the advantages of this new switching technology, within a few
years the number of independents began to decline. Faced with competitive
pressure from the Bell system, most independents either failed, were
acquired, or signed sublicensing agreements that allowed them to connect
with the Bell system but limited their ability to compete with Bell.
The competitive failure of the independents was due at least in part to the
Bell systems successful exploitation of the network dimension of telecommunications. The Bell system invested heavily in the technology and equipment needed to create a long-distance network. Although most customers at
that time used the phone almost exclusively for local calls, businesses found
the long-distance service very attractive. The independents tried but were
unable to duplicate Bell s long-distance network connections, particularly in
major urban areas where the Bell system had its largest networks, and where
much of the long-distance business originated. Bell allowed the surviving
independents to interconnect with its system, but only under the competition-restricting sublicensing agreements. Many independents chose this
route, even though it meant signing away their own ability to expand and
challenge Bell in the future.
In this case, the network characteristics of telecommunications proved critical to the competitive outcome. By providing long-distance services that its
rivals were unable to duplicate, the Bell system was able to keep more people
connected to its network and exploit economies of scale in long-distance service. But as it connected more users to its network, the Bell system also made
it difficult for other companies to compete effectively. Without effective
competition, the Bell system was in a position to limit service and set prices
for that service at monopolistic levels.
Government policy toward these new technologies and new industries was
as varied as the industries themselves. In the cases of telephones and electricity,

102 I Economic Report of the President




government often chose to permit one monopoly provider to serve a geographic region but subjected the monopoly firm to rate regulation to prevent
consumers from being overcharged. In part, this policy response reflected a
view that some industries are "natural monopolies." In a natural monopoly,
high fixed costs may make competition inefficient because a single provider
could instead deliver service at the lowest possible cost. Also, in industries
like the telephone industry, where demand-side network effects are important, previous attempts at competition had ultimately foundered as one
dominant network emerged.
In other industries, however, competition seemed more effective at
restraining market power, and government policy favored continued competition. In the case of automobiles, despite large economies of scale at individual plants, several producers were able to effectively compete in the large
market pioneered by Ford, and policy intervention was unnecessary. In the
oil industry, where combinations such as the Standard Oil trust threatened
competition, government did intervene, but rather than establish a regulated
monopoly, it used the antitrust laws to create more competition. These early
policy responses shaped each of these industries during the years that
followed, and these policies are still applied to some firms today. Just as the
economy has changed over the last century, however, so, too, has the range of
policy responses available to promote competition as an alternative to
regulation, as discussed more fully below.

Innovation and Change in the American
Economy Today
Many of the same manufacturing industries that were just emerging at the
beginning of the century continue to thrive, but new technologies and new
processes are revitalizing these established industries and creating new ones.
These innovations are taking place throughout the economy, and many
involve both new technology and new ways of organizing the workplace.
Manufacturing industries remain dynamic and innovative, reflecting the
pace of technological change. Manufacturers creating new products and
processes account for about three-quarters of company-funded industrial
R&D expenditure in the United States. Productivity growth in manufacturing also remains high, averaging 4.2 percent per year between 1993 and the
third quarter of 1999, and these firms remain an important source of jobs for
workers without college degrees. In an increasingly global economy, however,
many manufacturing businesses have faced pressure to adapt to new ways of
doing business in order to compete effectively with foreign companies.




Chapter 3 I 103

One example is the "lean" production techniques first pioneered in the
Japanese automobile industry. These methods, which involve redesigning the
manufacturing process to eliminate waste and reduce the number of product
defects, resulted in far lower costs and higher quality than traditional techniques in the U.S. automobile industry could achieve. Competition from
Japanese and other foreign firms using these methods compelled U.S.
automakers to focus on improving quality, and they have dramatically lowered costs and improved quality as a result.
Innovation in production technology has also changed the nature of the
Nations steel industry. Innovative U.S. minimill firms found that they could
produce many steel products much more cheaply than could the traditional
integrated mills by using electric arc furnace technology to recycle scrap steel
and produce basic steel products. A U.S. minimill firm was also thefirstwilling to gamble on constructing a full scale thin-slab caster using a foreign
firms technology. This new technology allowed minimills to compete in the
large market for rolled sheet steel, used in such products as automobile body
panels. U.S. companies using these new technologies are now offering
increased competition to the traditional integrated mills; by the mid-1990s
minimills accounted for close to 40 percent of U.S. steel production.
The pharmaceutical industry is one that is taking advantage of technological developments in biomedicine as well as in information technology. Traditionally, companies sifted through thousands of compounds to find those
with desirable medical properties. Todays companies, in contrast, use a deeper understanding of human physiology that allows them to design, from the
molecules up, drugs that target specific illnesses. The industry is also using
the Internet to recruit patients for clinical trials of new drugs and to provide
more complete and accessible information on new drugs to physicians.
Perhaps the most dramatic evidence of the economic impact of the information technology sector itself comes from the capital market, as reported in
a recent study by a financial services company. According to the study,
Americas venture capital industry raised funds at a $25 billion annual rate in
the first half of 1999, about two-thirds of which were placed in the information technology sector, and of that about three-quarters in Internet companies. In terms of market capitalization, the information technology hardware
sector now accounts for about 14 percent of the U.S. total, versus 6 percent
in 1989. The software component has expanded from about 2 percent in
1989 to around 9 percent today. Stocks in the Internet sector have a market
value equal to around 4 percent of the total.
The importance of the information technology sector to the U.S. economy is
not reflected in stock market valuations alone. The computer and telecommunications industries contributed between 21 and 31 percent of GDP growth in
each of the yearsfrom1995 to 1998 (Chart 3-2). And the contribution of these

hardware-producing industries is only the tip of the iceberg. The bulk of
employment today is in the private service-producing sectors, which also account
for nearly two-thirds of GDP. Leading the growth in the service sectors have
been a number of knowledge-based industries such as finance, insurance, and
professional services (a category that includes business and legal services, among
others). Measuring the contribution of these new services to GDP is important
to developing an accurate picture of economic growth (Box 3-1).
In these knowledge-based industries, information technology has become
increasingly important as a way to create new products and deliver them to
customers. Broadly defined, information technology comprises technologies
that process, store, and communicate information. For example, large U.S.
banks now spend approximately 20 percent of their noninterest expense on
information technology designed to integrate back office functions such as
check processing with other functions such as customer service. Changes in
information technology are transforming the economy by allowing people to
communicate ideas and data in a variety of ways, from wireless phones to the
Internet. The following sections examine several examples of this trend.

Developments in Telecommunications
The telecommunications industry is an example of an older industry that
the new information technologies have transformed. From its origins as a
provider of simple voice telephony, this industry has evolved into a source of
advanced infrastructure and sophisticated services that are essential to a host




Chapter 3 I 105

Box 3-1. Measuring the Economy in an Era of
Technological Change
Technological advances raise challenging measurement issues for
government statisticians seeking to measure the size of the economy or
its rate of growth. If technological improvements in the manufacturing
process simply raised the quantity produced of a standard product (for
example, the number of yards of a particular fabric type) from given
inputs, there would be little problem—one could simply count the additional output. But many technological advances improve the quality of
existing products or even create new ones (such as Internet services).
The statistical challenges these advances present are enormous.
Existing statistical techniques do provide measures of some of the
quality improvements and new products. For example, the GDP statistics incorporate adjustments for improvements in computing power
when measuring real investment expenditure for producer's durable
equipment. Similarly, when calculating the consumer price index, estimates of real expenditure on automobiles incorporate adjustments for
improvements in the quality of new cars over time, reflecting changes,
such as antilock brakes and airbags, that make cars safer and better.
In many industries, however, the measurement issues defy easy statistical solution. The field of medicine offers numerous examples of
new drugs, devices, and treatments that have revolutionized care—for
example, new techniques for treating heart attacks have raised patient
survival rates; the development of an insulin pump has reduced the
incidence of medical complications among diabetics, while raising
their quality of life. Some of the most perplexing measurement problems involve industries that are heavy users of information technology,
such as finance, insurance, and business services. The widespread
introduction of automatic teller machines, for example, makes it possible to obtain banking services (mainly deposits or withdrawals) at any
hour of the day or night—a service that was nearly impossible to
obtain a few decades ago. And the mutual fund industry provides individual investors with diversification possibilities that would have been
barely conceivable 30 years ago.
The widespread use of information technology for e-commerce
poses especially complicated measurement problems. As more and
more businesses across a range of industries—from services to manufacturing to retailing—use e-commerce for some components of their
operations, it becomes increasingly difficult to account for what portion
of a final product or service may have been changed or enhanced by
the use of information technology.

These difficulties in measurement should not obscure the very real
contribution that technological advances make to the economy.
Government statistical agencies and others are therefore actively
pursuing new measurement initiatives to better gauge and understand
the impact of these changes.

of businesses from data processing to online publishing. Indeed, these
changes in telecommunications have been just as important for these information providers as for the telecommunications industry itself, since, as discussed below, major telecommunications advances like the Internet are
already having a major impact on how businesses do business.
These changes came about from a convergence of factors in which both
technology and government regulatory policy played a part. Beginning with
the Department of Justices antitrust case and the resulting 1982 consent
decree that divided the American Telephone and Telegraph Company into its
local and long-distance components, prevailing government policy toward
telecommunications regulation has focused on how to reduce barriers to
competition for both traditional telephone service and emerging new services. To allow more competition in wireless service, portions of the radio
spectrum were auctioned off, allowing new competitors to create their own
networks in competition with incumbent cellular providers. Using provisions
of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, new competitors in local phone markets have begun to negotiate interconnection agreements and to sell local
telephone service in competition with the dominant incumbent local
exchange carriers (Box 3-2). To encourage the regional Bell operating companies to make such entry possible, the Telecommunications Act required
them to meet a list of conditions on opening their markets to new entrants
before they were allowed to offer long-distance service in their own regions.
In December 1999 the Federal Communications Commission found that
one regional Bell company had met those conditions in New York.
The changes in the telecommunications industry that have resulted from
these two developments—the emergence of new technologies and the new
regulatory environment created by the 1996 Telecommunications Act—
have been dramatic. Hundreds of new companies have entered all segments
of the industry; the number of publicly held telecommunications companies
alone nearly doubled over a recent 5-year period. These new competitors
have been responsible for much of the recent growth in the local, longdistance, wireless, and equipment industries. Structural adjustments to this
new competition have forced layoffs at somefirms,yet the telephone service
and equipment sectors are responsible for the net creation of approximately




Chapter 3 I 107

Box 3-2. Implementing Local Competition Provisions in the
1996Telecommunications Act
TheTelecommunications Act of 1996 reduces barriers to entry in local
telephone markets. To facilitate the entry of competitors into networks
owned by incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs), the act allows a
requesting carrier to obtain access to the incumbent's network in any of
three ways. It can purchase local service at wholesale rates for resale to
end users, it can lease various (unbundled) elements of the incumbent's
network needed for service, or it can interconnect its own facilities with
the incumbent's network.
Six months after the 1996 act was passed, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued its First Report and Order implementing
the local-competition provisions.Thereafter, numerous ILECs as well as
some state utility commissions challenged the rules, claiming that the
FCC had exceeded its jurisdiction. In January 1999 the Supreme Court
affirmed the FCC's role in providing a roadmap for competition.
The FCC continues to monitor the progress of competition with traditional ILECs, and its recent reports show that local competition, although
still limited, is growing rapidly. Industry analysts also support this conclusion: one source finds that, by the middle of 1999, new entrants had
increased their revenue market share to 6.3 percent of local revenue.The
FCC's new orders on DSL-based services extend the process to this new
technology by further clarifying which network elements competitors
may access. This, too, should encourage local competition.

200,000 new jobs in 5 years. Both new and existing firms have invested tens
of billions of dollars in facilities, services, and R&D. These investments in
turn have led to increased network capacity, the deployment of new technology, and the rollout of advanced communications services.
These changes are particularly evident in the communications equipment
industry, which has boomed in the last few years. Investment in communications equipment grew from $46 billion (in inflation-adjusted dollars) in
1993 to $86 billion per year in 1998—a 13 percent annual growth rate over
5 years (Chart 3-3). Some of that equipment is being used by the new
providers of wireless services that are building out the systems made possible
by the wireless spectrum auctions. By 1998, companies providing wireless
telephony had invested more than $50 billion in new capital equipment, and
wireless phones are now increasingly common, with more than 69 million
Americans now subscribing to cellular service.
In addition to wireless services, demand for new equipment and fiber optic
cable by new local providers of switched voice and high-speed data services
like those used for accessing the Internet has spurred investment. These

developments reflect dramatically declining costs for both data transmission
and computing power. The cost of transmitting a single bit of data over a
kilometer of fiber optic cable has fallen by three orders of magnitude since
the mid-1970s. At the same time, the cost of information processing has fallen as more and more transistors can be packed onto a single semiconductor
chip. As technology continues to advance, semiconductor manufacturers
have been able to double the power of computer microprocessors every 18
months. Improvements in semiconductors and reduced costs for other components have helped account for the 20 to 30 percent annual decline in the
quality-adjusted price of computers. With new innovations in semiconductor technology still coming onstream, the cost of information processing
continues to plummet, increasing the capabilities of the information industry
and expanding the market for information services.
These falling prices have encouraged investment in the grid of telephone
lines, cables, opticalfibers,and signal processing and routing equipment that
forms the backbone of the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure. The
increasing public demand for fast and ready information has driven this
backbone industry, motivating tremendous volumes of private investment.
The growing demand for carrying capacity, or bandwidth, has led to investment in high-capacity fiber optic lines by telecommunications systems to
meet the new infrastructure demands. The number offiber-miles(the miles
of sheathed fiber in a bundled cable times the number of fibers in the bundle) is one way to measure system capacity. By this measure, the total volume




Chapter 3 I 109

of fiber optic cable deployed by telecommunications carriers in the United
States grew by about 16 percent in 1997, and by more than 21 percent in
1998, according to data from the Federal Communications Commission.
Consumer demand for telecommunications services is leading more and
more American households to purchase additional telephone lines. Although
some of these lines are used mostly for voice service, many are dedicated data
lines. The number of additional lines more than doubled from 1993 to
1997, from 8.8 million to 17.9 million. This surge in growth mirrors the
growth in American consumers' use of the Internet. In addition to extra
phone lines, many residential users are beginning to purchase new
high-speed broadband connections to the Internet being offered by phone
and cable companies. For users who need to download largefiles,the speed
of the connection can make an enormous difference in total transfer time.
For example, a 10- to 20-minute digitized movie clip might take 10
megabytes of computer memory and require about 24 minutes to download
with a 56-kilobit-per-second modem. By contrast, a cable modem or a
high-speed digital subscriber line (DSL) connection offered by the phone
company can download the same file in less than a minute. Rollout of these
new services is just beginning: many phone companies are only now
beginning to offer high-speed DSL connections in response to cable
companies' offerings. By the end of the third quarter of 1999, cable modems
were available to an estimated 37 million homes in North America, and
approximately 1.4 million cable customers had signed up for the service. In
contrast, only about 275,000 DSL lines were in service in the United States
in October 1999. Deployment of DSL is expected to expand rapidly,
however: as many as 2.1 million DSL lines may be in service by the end of
2000.
These investments are supporting the rapid growth of the Internet as it
becomes a standard feature in American homes and workplaces. According
to one survey, more than 118 million Americans had access to the Internet
in November 1999, of whom more than 74 million were actively using the
new medium. The use of e-mail at home has also risen sharply in the last
few years, but this usage varies by income: more affluent Americans are
much more likely to have e-mail access at home (Chart 3-4). This surge in
connectivity has helped put the United States far in the lead in Internet use
worldwide. The United States far surpasses Germany, Japan, or the United
Kingdom in the number of Internet host computers per capita. Only
Finland has a higher concentration than the United States, according to
statistics compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). The OECD also found that the United States
leads all other OECD member countries in the number per capita of web
servers designed for electronic commerce. The combination of relatively

How Information Technology Is
Changing the Economy
In addition to providing a new communications medium, the Internet and
its kindred technologies possess vast potential to enhance the economy's
productivity and make firms more efficient. Much as Fords assembly line
concept had broad spillover effects beyond the automobile industry, so, too,
the Internet and e-commerce are having broad effects throughout a number
of industries. Many firms are investing aggressively in these technologies to
speed the flow of important business information, internally as well as externally, and so raise productivity. Over the past 20 years, the real net stock of
information technology equipment in the private sector has been rising
steadily. The last 5 years have seen particularly sharp increases in the net stock
of computers and related equipment relative to other durable equipment
(Chart 3-5).
Even across industries that are making large investments in information technology, however, the amount of that investment per worker varies widely (Table
3-2). Telecommunications firms, nondepository financial institutions, and radio
and TV broadcasting firms all invested more than $ 15,000 per worker in information technology equipment, according to 1996 data from the Department of
Commerce. Other firms in industries that are also major investors, such as
banks, insurance carriers, and railroads, invested between $4,000 and $6,000
per worker in information technology equipment.

As firms adopt these new technologies, they are also changing the definition of what constitutes a firm in todays economy. For some manufacturing
firms, information technology offers new ways to integrate their suppliers
more closely in the design and manufacturing of products. Even where the
firms in the supply chain remain separate entities, the degree of cooperation
may come to resemble what might occur in a vertically integrated firm. At
the same time, other firms are finding that transactions that were once organized internally may now be better organized as market transactions, with
competitive bidding even for specialized orders of custom-made parts.
At the retail level, the rise of the Internet has made possible the "virtual
firm," which exists only to market goods through a website. With outside
specialists available to handle details like filling orders, a firm can be run
without the extensive supply infrastructure that many traditional brick-andmortar firms have built. As companies grow larger, however, some have
found that outsourcing important activities is not necessarily the best way to
handle growing volumes of customers. Instead these firms are now investing
in the same type of real-world infrastructure that their more traditional
competitors have always used.

Managing Information Flows
Information technology is having a major impact on how somefirmsorganize their own internal operations. Investments in computer hardware like
those described above often represent only a small portion of a company's




Chapter 3 I 113

total investment in information technology. Effective implementation of
this technology also requires investing in the staff who will operate it, in
developing specialized applications, and in user support. Cost surveys of
firms in the services sector suggest that, at small, centralized sites, the costs of
the staff required for operations and specialized software development may
account for 74 percent of total costs, far exceeding the more visible expenditures the firm may make on hardware and prepackaged software. To develop
the applications they need, many service firms are now conducting more of
their own R&D, and this activity is beginning to show up in the aggregate
R&D statistics. Whereas in 1987 nonmanufacturing industries accounted
for only about 8 percent of non-Federal R&D funds, by 1995 that figure was
25 percent. These investments have been concentrated in computer
programming and data processing services, in wholesale and retail trade, in
communications services, and in research, development, and testing services.
One area in which information technology can enhance productivity is the
management of inventories. For example, electronic scanners have been a
familiar sight in grocery checkout lines for some time, but some retailers have
begun to adopt new and more efficient distribution methods that rely on
these scanners and the wealth of transactions data they can provide. One
large retailer with a chain of grocery superstores has used information technology to track what is selling in its stores and to use that information to
build a more efficient distribution system. This firm uses its buying power to
generate large orders to manufacturers, which then deliver the demanded
goods to the firms warehouse distribution centers. Those centers, in turn, are
responsible for resupplying the individual retail stores. To keep revenue high
and costs low, the firm also analyzes its scanner data on sales to maximize the
use of its shelf space. Detailed information captured by scanners at each store
track how fast products are selling, so that stores can be resupplied at frequent intervals from the distribution centers. This avoids the need to keep
large and expensive inventories at the stores themselves. In total, this company has reduced its operating costs to a mere 17.5 percent of sales, compared
with 22 percent for a traditional supermarket.
The increased investment in information technology by companies has
coincided with a reduction in the economy-wide ratio of inventories to sales
during the current economic expansion (Chart 3-6). Although, to be sure,
information technology is used in many areas besides inventory management,
some of those investments may have helped businesses to better manage
inventory growth and improve productivity during the current expansion.
Information technology is also being used to better manage information
flows between firms, such as between a final-goods manufacturer and the
different levels of its supplier chain. In the automobile industry, for example,
one recent report notes that companies have largely replaced paper drawings

with digital representations as a means of storing, analyzing, and communicating data on products and parts. One original equipment manufacturer
estimated that it exchanges product data both within the company and with
its suppliers as many as 453,000 times a year.

Retail E-Commerce
Information technology is having an impact on how businesses do
business in yet another way, through the growing use of the Internet by firms
as a communications tool. The Internet is already revolutionizing
distribution technology at both the retail and the wholesale level. With
millions of people now online, the potential to use the Internet as a low-cost
means to communicate information to customers and receive orders for
products is growing ever larger. At the retail level, newfirmsare springing up
to market a whole range of consumer products from books and music CDs
to cars. E-commerce retailing has several potential advantages over traditional
retailing, some of which it shares with traditional mail-order firms. Like a
mail-order firm, a firm with a website may be able to offer more products
online than a traditional brick-and-mortar store, because it is far less limited
by shelf space constraints. It can make extensive product information available to interested customers around the country and the world, who can then
make their selections automatically, without the need for a salesperson.




Chapter 3 I 115

For e-retailers, the Internet replaces paper catalogs as the medium used to
distribute information to customers, but these retailers still face some of the
same challenges as traditional catalog and storefront retailers in delivering the
goods. In response, some large electronic retailers have now begun building
their own warehouse distribution centers, providing a real infrastructure to
complement their virtual one. At present, the Internet is so new that no one
can predict which business strategies and which retailers will succeed in the
new medium. Many Internet retailers continue to lose money as they build
their businesses and strive for the economies of scale needed to survive in a
marketplace shared with both other Internet rivals and traditional competitors.
Unfortunately, despite a proliferation of anecdotes, hard data on the
importance of e-commerce and the digital economy more generally remain
scant. This lack of appropriate data hampers analysis of the impact of the
digitization of the economy. For example, it is not currently possible to
separate out e-commerce activities from other types of commercial activities
in the statistical series produced by the Federal Government. Data specific to
e-commerce currently come, for the most part, from market research firms,
which use divergent definitions and methodologies. To address this problem,
major Federal statistical agencies (the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the
Bureau of the Census, and the Bureau of Labor Standards) are working
together to formulate an e-commerce initiative that will help ensure that
official government statistics accurately reflect the new digital economy.
Using private data for 1998, estimates of the value of online retailing range
from $7 billion to $15 billion; even taking the high end of this range,
e-commerce would account for only about 0.5 percent of retail sales. In one
1998 survey, however, nearly half of households with Internet access had
made online purchases within 6 months of the survey. In addition, a much
larger quantity of sales is influenced in some way by the Internet. For
example, many consumers research their purchases, such as automobiles or
books, online before buying them offline, through traditional outlets. By one
estimate, roughly $50 billion in offline retail sales was influenced by the
Internet in 1998.

Business-toBusiness E-Commerce
The Internet plays a significant role today in providing new distribution
channels for wholesale transactions between businesses. By one estimate,
business-to-business e-commerce is expected to grow from $43 billion in
1998 to over $1.3 trillion by 2003 (Chart 3-7). Using the World Wide Web,
companies can automate the order process and reduce costs. One major supplier of computer components had routinely been receiving orders by phone
or facsimile from several hundred customers all over the world. Processing
these orders was cumbersome, and moving several hundred of these

customers to a web-based solution promised to improve customer service
and give managers better access to information on the status of orders. The
company built a website targeted to these customers and soon was able to
move $1 billion in orders per month online.
Another firm that sells networking hardware also uses the Internet to
reduce its costs. Many of the company's products are built to order from customers' specifications. The firm routinely checks those specifications to make
sure the product will work as configured, but it found that nearly one in four
orders taken by phone, fax, or e-mail contained errors that caused the order
to be rejected or required additional customer contact. After moving the
process of configuration and pricing online, the company now reports that
98 percent of orders pass through the system without an error, saving both
the company and its customers valuable time and expense. Across all its operations, having moved more of its technical support and marketing functions
online, the company estimates that it now saves more than $300 million per
year in operating costs.
Business-to-business e-commerce is also resulting in new and more competitive markets. The Internet's size and reach have created deeper markets, with
larger pools of both buyers and sellers, for many basic commodities. Where
before specialized brokers were needed to match buyers and sellers in transactions, new websites today allow multiple buyers and sellers to find each other
and enter into transactions quickly and efficiendy. In the steel industry, for
example, the electronic equivalent of a spot market now matches customers and




Chapter 3 I 117

suppliers for surplus quantities of steel of various types. One firm that provides
such a virtual marketplace for transactions in this industry has seen both the
number of suppliers and the volume of product offered on its site expand substantially. In just one year, offerings on the site rose from about 20,000 tons a
month to over 120,000 tons.
Purchasing managers are also using information technology to actively manage and reduce their firms' procurement costs by changing traditional relationships between the firm and its suppliers. For example, many manufacturers buy
custom-made materials that they incorporate into finished products. Because
these materials are often made to buyers' specifications, there are no catalogs or
price lists to allow buyers to make price comparisons. Fragmented supply markets and the importance of product quality in supplier selection also make purchasing difficult. Concerns about the quality of new suppliers' products, for
example, may cause a firm to rely instead on existing suppliers that are known
quantities. One company achieves significant cost savings for the purchasing
managers who are its clients by using electronic bidding technology to conduct
auctions among alternative suppliers of a whole range of inputs. The company
has organized auctions for goods ranging from printed circuit boards to injection-molded plastic parts (Box 3-3).
Although this firm's electronic auction software is an example of information technology at work, an important part of the service that the firm provides is a detailed, specific analysis of the desired components, followed by an
extensive search for potential suppliers. In addition to the traditional suppliers that a firm has relied on in the past, the auction firm may find that other
suppliers around the world can produce the demanded good as well. Working with the buyer, the company screens these firms to determine whether
they are capable of producing the good that meets the buyer's specific needs.
This use of information technology to cast a wider net poses both challenges
and opportunities for suppliers. For efficient firms, it offers a way to compete
for business they might not have been able to bid on previously. But existing
suppliers must compete more aggressively than ever before if they wish to
retain or expand their business in an increasingly global economy.

Information Technology and the Theory of the Firm
These developments in information technology raise a number of questions about the organization of firms in a market economy. Information
technology has the potential to dramatically lower the cost of acquiring and
disseminating information of significant value to firms and their customers.
Using various types of information technology, firms can convey information
about products to potential customers, obtain more detailed and targeted
market data about customers and their needs, and then sell products to more
customers. But how will lower costs of communication affect the structure of
118 I Economic Report of the President




Box 3-3. Holding an Online Auction
An online auction specialist allows corporate buyers to lower their
procurement costs by providing the technology and support for
computerized auctions. Rather than sending out a paper request for
proposals and obtaining a single bid from each potential contractor,
buyers holding online auctions can allow bidders to observe how their
bids compare with those of their peers.To generate more competition,
however, the auction specialist does more than simply provide a
connection for the client firm's existing suppliers.The auction specialist
also searches out new potential suppliers that meet the buyer's
specifications.
In one such auction for printed circuit boards, the auction specialist
first identified 29 bidders in North America, Asia, and Europe. Eight of
the firms had done business with the buyer before, but the remainder
had not. Each supplier was linked electronically to the auction firm's
computer server, so that it could submit bids online, observe the bids
placed by its competitors, and then decide whether to submit a new,
lower bid of its own. Within 5 minutes after the auction opened, the
bids received for the circuit board contract quickly dropped to 18 percent below the buyer's historical average cost for such goods. As the
auction's closing time approached, more and more bids were submitted. By the time the auction had concluded, after about 1 hour, three
bidders had submitted virtually identical low bids, and the buyer was
able to reduce its expected cost by 42 percent, or $6.4 million.

the firm itself? When information is less costly to communicate, some firms
may decide to expand their operations to exploit greater economies of scope
in selling different products. Alternatively, other firms may find that, with
more customers for what had previously been low-volume markets, it is more
profitable to specialize, seeking lower production costs through greater
economies of scale. The evolving nature of the new technology makes it hard
to predict which effect will predominate, and the answers could easily vary
across different lines of business.
Information technology may also have far-reaching implications for the
structure of firms if it changes the sources of competitive advantage in the
markets where they conduct business. Using the new information and communications technologies, firms have greater potential to respond quickly
and more flexibly to challenges posed by changing circumstances. Older
sources of competitive advantage, such as established distribution networks,
may now seem outdated and unnecessary in light of new communications
tools like the Internet. By eliminating middlemen from the distribution
network, a firm can cut its costs while still serving its customers.




Chapter 3 I 119

However, the same technology that disintermediates some actors in the
economic chain between producers and consumers is also opening up new
opportunities for other firms that can effectively add value in a different way.
The auction firm that finds new suppliers, for example, replaces an internal
procurement decision process with a market-based specialist. As firms continue to restructure themselves to take advantage of these new opportunities,
they may find it worthwhile to expand or contract their activities to focus on
those where they add the most value to the economic chain.

Information Technology and Network Effects
As new types of information technology link together computers, telephones, and other types of communications devices, network effects become
increasingly important in determining the success or failure of some products. In industries not subject to network effects, the total value of a product
is simply the sum of its value to each user; adding more users increases the
total value only by the products value to the new users. But in industries
where network effects are present, such as telephone or Internet service, the
value of the product to each user, including the existing users, rises as the
total number of users rises. In the case of a phone network, for example, each
person is connected to the network by a wire (or a wireless) link. The more
links the network has, the more valuable it is to each participant in the network, because the network can be used to contact more people. This type of
network effect, also called a network externality, creates a cycle of positive
feedback in a growing network. As more people join the network, it becomes
more attractive to potential new members, and the network increases in size,
continuing the cycle. The same network effects that create positive feedback
in a growing network, however, can work against a network that is shrinking.
As a network shrinks, it becomes less valuable to members, and more members leave, causing the networks value to spiral downward.
Markets with strong network effects are referred to as "tippy," because they
can tip in favor of one firm or another, depending upon which firm is able to
generate enough positive feedback to win the allegiance of a sizable majority
of consumers. The winning firm in such a market then becomes the dominant network and may be in a position to establish a de facto standard for the
industry. Firms engaged in such a "standards war" may even choose to give
their product away initially if doing so increases the firm's likelihood that it
will own the dominant technology. Once a firm wins the standards war, consumers' switching costs may well be high enough that the firm can exercise
market power to earn above-normal profits.
As the history of the Bell system at the beginning of the century
demonstrates, network effects can have a dramatic impact on market
outcomes when one network becomes very large relative to its competitors.
120 I Economic Report of the President




Using its size and its superior long-distance service, the Bell system became
the dominant firm in areas of the country where it had once competed with
independent phone companies. To convince consumers to sign up for its
service over those of the independents, the Bell system advertised the advantages of its larger number of connections. By refusing to interconnect with
competing systems, the Bell system was able to exploit the advantage of its
large network to the detriment of its competitors.
Establishing a new network in an industry with strong network externalities
can be very difficult, because users of the existing network may have to incur
costs to move to the new network. In some cases, such as the software industry
or the computer networking equipment industry, these switching costs may
include major investments in equipment and training to use the new network.
An even larger cost for users of the new network, however, may be that imposed
by the lack of connections with the incumbent network.
These switching costs, however, do not necessarily allow the incumbent
firm to rest on its laurels. A new network can supplant an established network in certain circumstances. One advantage a new network may have is
that its new technology may simply work better for some applications than
the established networks technology. Where the old network may have to
worry about compatibility with existing standards, a new provider can start
from scratch and take advantage of technological developments to create a
better product. With a superior technology, a new network provider may be
able to convince some users to incur the switching costs because the advantages of the new technology are large enough to make it worthwhile even if
users cannot connect easily with the old network. Once it has established a
niche market among these users, the provider can then seek to expand the
use of its network to more mainstream customers. The computer industry,
for example, has seen several waves of technology go beyond an existing
dominant standard, and each of those waves in turn developed into its own
standard. Early computer technology was dominated by mainframes, but
mainframes were later supplanted by minicomputers for many uses, and by
personal computers for still more uses. In each case the new technology
started out not by directly challenging the incumbent, but by appealing to a
group of users not well served by the existing technology.
As information technology advances, the economic effects of new data and
communications networks will become increasingly important. The Internet
provides a model for how those networks can work together. The Internet
can be described as a "network of networks" held together by a standard
communications protocol. The hardware and software running any individual local network may be completely incompatible with the hardware and
software running a different local network, but with a standard communications protocol the two networks can talk to each other. This increases the




Chapter 3 I 121

value of each network to its users. Where these new technologies will take us
in the 21st century will only become evident over time, but by encouraging
connections between networks, government and the private sector can work
together to provide a strong platform on which new ideas and new
technologies can grow.

The Role for Government Policies
We have seen how firms in a range of industries are now realizing some of
the productivity gains that recent advances in information technology have
promised. For its part, this Administration remains committed to a policy
that encourages innovation and competition in the private sector to the
fullest extent possible. One element of that policy is establishing the rules for
protecting intellectual property rights to new products through patents.
Although patents have been used to protect the property rights of inventors
in their inventions since the founding of the Republic, the last several years
have seen an explosion in the number of patents granted in the United States
(Chart 3-8). Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain this surge in
patent grants, including the possibility that it reflects todays rapid pace of
technological discovery. A recent court ruling clearly indicating the
patentability of computer software may also have encouraged the patent
surge.
Chart 3-8 Patents Granted Since 1900
Since 1995, patent grants in the United States have increased at a historically
unprecedented rate.

Intellectual property rights in works of authorship, including those disseminated through the Internet, are protected through copyright. The
Administration has worked to set up a legal framework for electronic contracting and has supported protection of intellectual property rights in the
digital environment. In the latter area, the Administration has supported initiatives to ensure that copyrighted works are adequately protected on the
Internet. Information in the form of software, texts, music, and audiovisuals
is increasingly important to the economy, and all these media can be efficiently delivered over the Internet. Without legal protections commensurate
to those enjoyed by distributors of physical media, intellectual property
owners might choose not to make their works available in the digital environment. The Administration has also been active in advocating the development of international standards for the protection of copyrights on the
Internet and in promoting a balanced approach to protecting data bases.

Support for Research and Development
Maintaining and increasing the flow of innovative ideas to the economy
also require continuing efforts in R&D to create new products and services.
Over the last several years, private industry has continued to expand its funding of R&D, but many of these efforts are focused on the development
required to bring new products to market. To fill in the gaps in private R&D
efforts, government must go a step beyond encouraging private innovation
and competition. By supporting both the basic and the applied research necessary to create new technologies yet unimagined, government can act as a
catalyst for growth in the American economy in this new century.
In supporting R&D, the objective of government policy is to identify projects with large potential spillover benefits to the economy. Funding basic
and applied research is one way to accomplish this objective because it
expands the knowledge base of society. Although this research can generate
large payoffs in the form of new technologies, the private sector is unlikely on
its own to provide the amount of research, basic or applied, that is best for
society. Firms may underinvest in research because the social benefits from
the innovations they might make exceed the payoff that the firm itself can
capture with traditional mechanisms such as patents and protection of trade
secrets. Some of the most innovative ideas that research might generate may
not immediately result in commercially useful products or methods; they
may require an extended period of further development before that can happen, and often companies may not want to wait that long. Hence government support for basic research is critical in a knowledge-based economy,
where growth ultimately depends upon the flow of new ideas.
This problem seems particularly vexing for what are sometimes called
general-purpose technologies (GPTs). A GPT is a technology that may have




Chapter 3 I 123

many possible uses but that depends on the development of complementary
innovations for those uses to be exploited. For example, an ordinary desktop
computer can be put to a vast number of different uses, but all require complementary investment in software. Until a ready store of such complementary innovations is available, a GPT may not be very useful, and its creators
may have limited incentive to make improvements in the technology. As
these complementary innovations occur, however, the gains from further
innovation to improve the GPT itself increase. And in turn, as the GPT is
improved, the gains from creating still more complementary innovations rise,
these innovations then appear, and so on in a virtuous cycle. Jumpstarting
this virtuous cycle may be difficult, however, when the commercial gain
appears to be low. In such circumstances, government can again play an
important role by providing the initial funding for new technologies that still
need more basic research.
The Internet itself is a GPT that developed in just this way. For all the
considerable excitement today about its commercial potential, the Internet
did not start out as a commercial project at all, but as a way to interconnect
government computers at different sites to share information and data. At its
creation in 1969 under a U.S. Department of Defense project, the predecessor to the Internet (then known as ARPANET) consisted of just four nodes
at different locations. Over time, more nodes and more users were added,
until eventually the National Science Foundation (NSF) took over the
primary role in funding what by then had become the Internet. With the
introduction of the World Wide Web by the European Center for Particle
Research in 1989, and of a graphical user interface called Mosaic by the
NSF's National Center for Supercomputing Applications in 1993, the
Internet took a giant step further. From a tool used by a relatively small
number of government workers and academics, it was transformed into a
widely accessible public communications medium, and usage increased
dramatically. As the number of users expanded, commercial development
began and government sponsorship became unnecessary.

Technology Initiatives in the Budget
The Administration is committed to maintaining strong support for R&D
efforts in a wide variety of areas. The centerpiece of this commitment is the
21st Century Research Fund, which aims at ensuring stability and growth for
the Nations highest priority research programs. In the Presidents budget for
2001, approximately $43 billion has been committed to science and technology endeavors through this fund, a 7 percent increase over the previous
year. Through the fund, the Administration seeks to finance a broad and
balanced national R&D portfolio to ensure that technological advancements
continue to be made in areas of the economy where they are needed. Having
124 I Economic Report of the President




a balanced R&D portfolio is necessary because advances in one discipline
may depend upon research gains in separate fields.
A number of programs undertaken by the 21st Century Research Fund are
designed to leverage Federal R&D investments through partnerships with firms
in the private sector. For example, the Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles seeks to develop less polluting, more fuel-efficient technologies for cars
by combining the research efforts of Federal Government laboratories with
those of the major U.S. automakers. The Advanced Technology Program,
administered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is another
example of the Administrations efforts to encourage public-private partnerships
in R&D. This program provides funding for scientific and technical projects
that may offer substantial economic returns to the United States.
This year s budget also proposes a multiagency National Nanotechnology
Initiative that increases the level of funding for nanotechnology research in
2001 by more than 80 percent, to nearly $500 million. The initiative focuses on the manipulation of matter at the atomic and molecular levels, offering
an unprecedented chance to study new properties, processes, and phenomena that matter exhibits at a scale between atoms and molecules. The initiative
hopes to culminate in technologies with the unprecedented ability to create
new classes of devices as small as or smaller than a human cell. This research
could lead to continued improvement in electronics and electro-optics for
information technology; to higher performance, lower maintenance materials for manufacturing, defense, space, and environmental applications; and to
accelerated biotechnical applications in medicine, health care, and agriculture. The results of this effort could be as significant to our economy as the
development of the transistor and the Internet.
This year s budget also increases support for information technology R&D
from $1.7 billion to $2.3 billion. This program funds the fundamental
research in computer science that is expected to lead to major breakthroughs
in the next generation of supercomputers, networks, software, and applications. This ongoing work includes the Next Generation Internet Initiative,
which is connecting universities and national laboratories with high-speed
networks that are 100 to 1,000 times faster than todays Internet. R&D in
information technology also funds development of extremely powerful
supercomputers for applications in a variety of fields. Long-term research
under this programs umbrella will create high-technology, high-wage jobs
and will improve our quality of life. All of these projects serve as examples of
how a small investment today may yield significant benefits in the years to
come.




Chapter 3 I 125

Maintaining Competition
Another way in which government policy can encourage economic growth is
through reducing barriers to competition and entry rather than imposing
restrictions that in effect protect incumbent firms. For example, by making
more of the electromagnetic spectrum available for wireless services, as
discussed above, the Federal Government has enabled a number of new firms to
enter the market for these services. The prices that consumers pay for
wireless phone service have dropped, on average, as a result. In designing the
spectrum auctions, the Federal Communications Commission was careful to
limit the ability of existing cellular incumbents to acquire the lions share of
spectrum available, and this laid the necessary foundation for more competition
between competing wireless networks. Similarly, the Telecommunications Act of
1996 removed barriers to entry across telecommunications markets, and it set
conditions for regional Bell operating companies to enter long-distance markets
after making changes to permit the entry of new competitors for local telephone
services. In December 1999, the commission found that one company had met
those conditions in New York State and allowed it to begin offering longdistance service in New York. Companies in other States are expected to qualify
in the future as more local markets are opened to competition for both business
and residential customers.
Vigorously enforcing the Nations antitrust laws is another important element
of a policy that promotes competition. As noted above, concerns about the
competitive implications of mergers are not new, but the recent wave of large
mergers has highlighted this aspect of antitrust policy. One reason for this
merger activity is that firms are seeking to achieve efficiencies and become more
competitive in the global marketplace. The vast majority of these mergers pose
no competitive concern because they do not combine two significant competitors in a market that would raise a concern about diminished competition. In
other cases, however, the antitrust agencies at the Department of Justice and the
Federal Trade Commission have opposed elements of planned mergers that
would have diminished competition in several cases, including gasoline marketing and refining, grain distribution, avionics, waste disposal, banking services,
and mobile telephony. In these cases the antitrust agencies have opposed mergers because of their potentially adverse impact on consumers and have sought
divestitures that would preserve competition.
In analyzing mergers and other potentially anticompetitive conduct, antitrust
agencies increasingly must consider the effects that arise not only from traditional
economies of scale in production, but also from the effects of market power
created by network effects. For some products—for example, some types of basic
computer software and hardware—having a large installed base of users creates a
de facto standard both for those users and for product developers, who must use
that standard to create new, complementary products. Users accustomed to
126 I Economic Report of the President




using a particular standard may have built up a large investment in knowledge
and complementary products of their own that makes switching to any alternative, nonstandard product cosdy. Users also may be reluctant to switch when
alternatives to the prevailing standard do not have enough developers creating the
complementary products that would enhance the value of the basic product. In
these circumstances, a company that controls a standard might use that market
power to prevent other products from gaining the critical mass of users that
would enable them to challenge the standard and undermine its market power.
Antitrust agencies vigorously enforce the antitrust laws to preserve competition
and eliminate unreasonably exclusionary practices related to standards.
For completely new areas of economic activity such as e-commerce, the
Administration believes that growth can best be encouraged by limiting the
regulatory burden. Regulatory forbearance and policies that let nascent
markets grow have encouraged continuing investment in information infrastructure and made possible unprecedented growth in the development,
adoption, and use of e-commerce. As one example, the Administration has
successfully opposed the imposition of discriminatory taxes on Internet
activity: the Internet Tax Freedom Act establishes a 3-year moratorium on
new and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce.
Finally, all policies that rely on the private sector to provide valuable new
technologies or other innovations face a common challenge, namely, that of
ensuring that all members of society benefit from those technologies and
those innovations. Evidence is growing of a "digital divide," in which some
racial, ethnic, and income groups in the United States use the Internet less
than others. Created under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the
E-rate program for wiring schools and public libraries is an important means
of increasing the diffusion of Internet use and ensuring that access to
information is widely available (see Chapter 4). The discounts available
under this program have allowed more than 1 million classrooms to be
connected to the Internet. This policy, along with others discussed in the
following chapter, will help Americans develop the skills they need to
participate in an increasingly information-driven economy.

Conclusion
Recent developments in technology and regulation underscore the vital
role that government has to play in ensuring the foundations for a growing
economy and a vibrant private sector. By providing support for basic and
applied research, government can act as a catalyst for new innovations and
new technologies that may someday prove critical in maintaining Americas
technological lead in an increasingly information-dependent world.




Chapter 3 I 127

Similarly, by reducing barriers to competition wherever possible, the
regulatory environment that government creates can encourage the birth of
new services that will lead to continued growth, while ensuring that all
Americans have the opportunity to benefit. The dramatic changes in the
American economy over the last century should remind us that future
changes, still unpredictable, are sure to follow, creating new challenges and
opportunities during the century that has just begun. If government
continues to encourage firms and workers to meet those challenges, America
can maintain a strong, yetflexibleeconomy that fosters growth and provides
opportunity for all its citizens for many years to come.

Work and Learning in the 21st Century

Eunice Hunton Carter, born in 1899> was a trailblazer for expanded labor market
opportunities for women and minorities. She received bachelors and masters degrees from
Smith College, went on to Fordham Law School, and ultimately became the first African
American woman district attorney in New York. Special prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey
made her one of his "twenty against the underworld" who investigated organized crime in
the late 1930s.

T

he nature of work has changed dramatically over the past 100 years.
Today, vastly fewer people work on farms, and women are much more
likely to be working for pay. Discrimination, which long limited the
participation of minorities and women in the labor market, is now illegal and
has been greatly reduced. In addition, the educational attainment of our
labor force has risen sharply. These changes have combined to produce the
most diverse and highly educated work force in our country's history. The
tools and techniques of work also changed dramatically over the 20th
century. At the beginning of the 21st century this has meant a technological
revolution, which has affected the majority of jobs and put a premium on a
new set of skills. This chapter examines the new labor market and the role
government will play in preparing workers for the next century.




129

Formal education was a far less important job qualification for most workers
at the turn of the last century than it is now. Over 40 percent of the work force
was in agriculture, and another 28 percent was in manufacturing. Services,
broadly defined, accounted for the remaining 31 percent (Chart 4-1). In keeping with this industry mix, a large proportion (38 percent) of workers were
occupied in farming, forestry, or fishing. Another 25 percent were operators or
laborers. Managers and professionals represented just 10 percent of the work
force, and sales and administrative support occupations just 8 percent.
Over the course of the 20th century, the share of total employment in agriculture declined steadily. Until the early 1970s, manufacturing employment
grew roughly in line with growth in the labor force, and manufacturings
share of total employment remained roughly constant. Since then, however,
employment in services has accelerated, and the share of employment in
manufacturing has declined. The occupational mix has changed accordingly.
By 1999, 30 percent of workers were employed as managers and professionals, and 26 percent worked in technical, sales, and administrative support
occupations. Operators, fabricators, and laborers made up just 14 percent of
the work force, and farming, forestry, and fishing occupations represented a
scant 3 percent.
Most recently, the change in the industrial and occupational mix of the
economy has been associated with a technological revolution. That revolution has been a rich source of new jobs, but many of those jobs require familiarity with the latest technological advances. In 1996, for example, the share

of total employment in industries that are intensive users of information
technology was 41 percent. Projections by the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggest that this figure will rise to 44 percent by 2006. Other projections indicate that the five fastest growing occupations between now and 2008 will be
related to computers.
This evolution of the labor market from one based on a strong back to one
based on a strong mind has both caused and been driven by substantial
improvements in educational attainment. The change in the education of the
work force and the increasing value of education represent an important transformation of the labor market over the course of the century. A second important transformation has been an opening up of opportunities to women,
minorities, and persons with disabilities. The typical adult female in 1900 was
working at home or on the farm, and those women who worked for wages were
likely to be unmarried and in low-paying occupations. African Americans and
other minorities were also generally limited in their occupational choices. Over
the course of the century, however, women and minorities entered the labor
force in increasing numbers and enjoyed expanded occupational choice, and
their earnings have risen. All groups have made substantial improvements in
educational attainment and have shared in the greater wealth generated from the
accumulation of skills and higher productivity.
This chapter analyzes these two key transformations of the labor market—
the increasing value of education and the increasing opportunities for
women, minorities, and persons with disabilities—and assesses the challenges
they pose for current policy. Although education has proved to be an avenue
toward higher earnings for all, a large gap has emerged between the wages of
those with education beyond high school and the wages of those with less
education. The economy has changed in a way that places a high premium
on certain skills, some of them unknown only a few years ago, and workers
without those skills are increasingly likely to be left behind. This wage premium provides a strong market signal about the value of education, but evidence suggests that many workers lack the skills needed for today's jobs.
Therefore government policies have a role to play. Governments at all levels
have traditionally been involved in providing education, in part because of
the social as well as economic benefits associated with it. The last part of this
chapter examines the role of government and, more specifically, the initiatives put forth by this Administration to improve the quantity and quality of
education and training of the American work force and provide new opportunities for American workers. The challenge for public policy in the 21st
century will be to develop an appropriate set of education and training policies, one that creates a framework of lifetime learning within which workers
can acquire and maintain both the basic skills and the more technical skills
they need in the new labor market.




Chapter 4 I 131

The Transformation of the Labor Market
A hallmark of our increasingly technology-driven and knowledge-intensive
labor market is the importance of education for success. The gains in educational attainment that the U.S. labor force achieved over the course of the
20th century were impressive and have led to great improvements for many
groups. Yet the number of educated workers, although growing, has been
falling short of demand: employers eager to hire qualified workers have driven up the relative wages of those who have the desired skills. In the 1980s
and early 1990s, those who acquired the education and training that employers sought were rewarded in the labor market, while those who lacked that
preparation saw their earnings lag behind.

The Rising Importance of Skills and Education
Growth in Educational Attainment
The average level of education of the U.S. working-age population
increased dramatically in the 20th century. Many more Americans than ever
before are graduating from high school and college, and overall educational
attainment has increased. The median number of years that an adult American has spent in school rose from 8.6 in 1940 to nearly 13 in the 1990s. In
addition, the disparity between men and women in high school and college
completion rates has disappeared. In fact, in the decade just past, women
completed both high school and college at slightly higher rates than men.
The gap in years of schooling between whites and other groups also
narrowed substantially over the century. The gap between African Americans
and whites in high school graduation rates fell markedly from the 1940s to
the present (Chart 4-2). Whereas in 1940 the proportion of whites who had
completed high school was more than triple that of African Americans (41.2
percent versus 12.3 percent), by 1998 this gap had virtually disappeared,
with 88 percent of both groups having completed high school. Hispanics
have not made the same gains, however, and the proportion of this population that had completed high school (which includes those Hispanics who
immigrated as adults) was only 62.8 percent in 1998. Raising the high
school completion rates of Hispanics has been an important goal of this
Administration, and to achieve it, the President has pushed for the first-ever
Hispanic Education Action Plan. The Federal budget forfiscal2001 includes
$823 million in increased funding for a number of education programs that
help to improve the educational outcomes of Hispanics and other students
with limited English proficiency.
College completion rates increased over the second half of the century
(Chart 4-3). In contrast to high school completion rates, however, the racial

Americans has risen almost 10-fold since 1940, only 15.8 percent of African
Americans and only 10.4 percent of Hispanics aged 25-29 held bachelors
degrees in 1998. A number of Administration policies seek to improve access to
postsecondary education and are discussed later in this chapter.

Changes in the Demand for Skills
These statistics show clearly that the American labor force is becoming
more educated over time, but are these increases in educational attainment
keeping up with the demands of an increasingly technology-driven labor
market? And in that market, what happens to those who do not keep up?
The rise in importance of basic computer skills illustrates the concern. Computer use on the job has increased tremendously since the introduction of the
personal computer in the late 1970s. Already by 1984 about a quarter of all
workers were using a computer at work, and by 1997 that proportion had
risen to virtually half. What this trend implies is that the pool of potential
jobs is shrinking for those who lack basic computer skills.
But it is not just computer skills that are in demand in todays labor market. Survey evidence from the 1992-94 period indicates that most jobs available to workers without a college degree require not only specific experience
but the ability to perform basic tasks involving reading, writing, or arithmetic and the interpersonal skills to serve customers effectively. Focusing
specifically on jobs available to those without a college degree, this survey
found that over half of such jobs required workers, on a daily basis, to deal
with customers (70.0 percent), read or write paragraphs (61.1 percent), do
arithmetic (64.7 percent), or use computers (50.7 percent). Only 8 percent
of the jobs available to non-college graduates required none of these skills.
Does this imply that the skill demands of employers have been increasing
over time? Direct research evidence on this question is limited, but it suggests
that indeed they have. The same survey asked employers directly whether
overall skill use on jobs they had recently filled had risen in the past 5 to 10
years. The results indicate substantial increases in each of the skill categories
(23 to 25 percent) over this relatively short period. The data also show that
the changes in labor outcomes (wages and employment) for certain groups
that took place over this time have occurred in a manner consistent with
firms demanding greater levels of skill.
A mismatch does seem to be emerging between the skills that workers possess and the skills that employers demand. For example, a 1996 survey of
medium-size and large businesses by the American Management Association
found that 19 percent of applicants for vacant jobs lacked the necessary math
and reading skills, but by 1998 this proportion had increased to almost 36
percent. Another recent study, this one of manufacturers, found that demand
for nontraditional skills, such as computer skills, interpersonal and teamwork

134 I Economic Report of the President




skills, and problem-solving skills, has been rising rapidly, especially among
high adopters of new technology. Computer skill requirements were more
frequently cited than other requirements as having increased from 1993 to
1996. However, employers cited more difficulty in finding applicants with
good problem-solving skills than in finding qualified computer-skilled applicants. Although these results in part reflect the strong labor market of this
period, they also indicate a rising absolute demand for skills.

Changes in the Education Premium
A sharp increase in the wages of college graduates relative to those without
a college degree provides indirect but striking evidence of rising demand for
workers with higher level skills. Between 1979 and 1999 the median real
weekly wages of comparable male college graduates aged 25 and over who
worked full-time rose by almost 15 percent, from $833 to $957 (Chart 4-4).
Despite a 6 percent increase since 1996, the earnings of full-time working
males with only a high school diploma fell by 12 percent over the same period. In 1999 the real weekly wages of male high school graduates were $568,
down from $648 in 1979. Similarly, the real weekly wages of those with less
than a high school diploma declined by 27 percent between 1979 and 1999,
from $530 a week to $387, although their real wages in 1999 were 5 percent
higher than in 1995.
In 1979 the median weekly earnings of male college graduates were 29
percent higher than those of similar men who possessed only a high school

diploma (Chart 4-5). That same year the median earnings of male college
graduates were 57 percent higher than those of high school dropouts. Other
evidence suggests that these ratios had been roughly constant or even declining slightly in the decade prior to 1979. By 1999 college graduates were earning 68 percent more per week (again measured at the median) than high
school graduates, and 147 percent more than those who had not completed
high school. Since the mid-1990s the returns to lower levels of education
have increased at about the same rate as returns to college education, implying that the gap is little changed. Overall, this evidence suggests that there
has been rapid growth in the demand for skills over the past two decades,
because the premium associated with a college education has gone up even as
the supply of college graduates has increased.
Providing further support for the rising importance of skills is evidence that,
even within education groups, the rates of return to cognitive skills (reading and
math skills, for example) may have increased in recent decades. Research has
used longitudinal surveys to examine what impact a persons level of basic math
and reading skills, as measured by scores on cognitive tests administered in high
school, have on that persons wages after graduation. Results from a sample of
high school graduates who did not go on to college indicate not only that a
greater mastery of basic skills translates into higher wages, but also that this relationship has grown stronger over recent years. The implication is that basic skills
are more important in the labor market than in the past. The same data also
allow us to address the question of whether the educational wage premium

already demonstrated is due to differences in skills between those who choose to
go on to college and those who do not. When high school and college graduates
are compared, the results suggest that, controlling for scores on math tests,
between 1978 and 1986 there would have been no growth in the college wage
premium for women, and only one-third as much for men. This again demonstrates the growing importance of skills for labor market outcomes.
In addition to finding a widening gap between the wages earned by different education groups and between people with different levels of cognitive
skills, researchers have found evidence that skills associated with new technologies are becoming more important in the labor market. One such piece
of evidence is the gap in wages between workers in information technology
industries and those in other industries. According to the U.S. Department
of Commerce, in 1997 workers in information technology-producing industries earned on average almost 78 percent more than did workers in all industries combined. And this figure was up sharply from 56 percent in 1989.
To the extent that higher education indicates a higher level of skill, one common explanation for the premium associated with education is referred to as
"skill-biased technological change"—technological change that has caused
demand for high-skilled workers to increase more rapidly than that for lowskilled workers. What might account for this effect? One explanation may be
that when new technologies are introduced, workers already well endowed with
certain skills are better able to use them. Technological change may also create
scope for organizational changes in the workplace, such as more decentralized
decisionmaking, which would further stimulate demand for workers with
higher education. Adding to this, demand for less skilled workers has decreased
in relative terms as some low-skilled jobs have been replaced by more automated
production processes. But there are other possible explanations for the increase
in the college wage premium. One is decreased demand for low-skilled workers
as international trade has allowed imports to substitute for the goods these
workers used to produce. As discussed in Chapter 1, however, recent evidence
casts some doubt on these hypotheses: rapid technological growth and increased
trade in the 1990s did not lead to increased inequality but, in fact, coincided
with the end of a 20-year trend toward greater inequality. Other possible contributors to the higher college wage premium include the decline in the real
minimum wage over the 1980s and the loss of collective bargaining power with
the decline in unionization rates over the same period.

Growth in Opportunities
The 20th century witnessed changes in job opportunities for all workers.
Changes were already under way at the start of the century, when the
women's suffrage movement was active, and change continued with the civil
rights movement of the 1960s. Government has played a critical role in




Chapter 4 I 137

ensuring equal opportunity for all workers through the passage of the 19th
Amendment, and later through such legislation as the 1964 Civil Rights Act,
the 1967 Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the 1990 Americans with
Disabilities Act, and, most recently, the 1999 Work Incentives Improvement
Act. This last piece of legislation eliminated institutional barriers that had
limited the employment opportunities of persons with disabilities. Thanks to
these and other initiatives, jobs that were once closed to women, minorities,
the disabled, and the aged are now open to all, regardless of their work-irrelevant characteristics. Rising demand for labor in general may have contributed to growth in opportunities for groups that have traditionally lacked
access, but it should not be forgotten that these and other acts of government
helped open the door.

The Economic Progress ofWomen
The progress made by women in the paid labor market has been one of the
most important economic changes of the 20th century. In the early 1900s,
men and women, if they were in the labor market, typically worked in different jobs. Whereas some 79 percent of men worked in manufacturing or
agricultural jobs, the comparable figure for women was only about 47 percent. A plurality (28.7 percent) of women in the labor force were employed
as private household workers, but fewer than 1 percent of men held such
jobs. The differences for African American women are even more striking. It
is estimated that among African American women who were in the labor
market in 1890, over 90 percent worked as servants or agricultural workers.
Disparities remain even today, but todays occupational categories are
much more likely to contain substantial numbers of both men and women.
Table 4-1 examines the participation of female workers in a range of detailed
occupational groups and how it has changed over recent years. Many occupations experienced sizable increases in the percentage of women employed,
beyond the overall rise in female labor force participation. For instance, the
share of engineers who are female rose from 1.2 percent to 10.6 percent
between 1950 and 1999, and the share of lawyers who are female increased
eightfold, from 3.5 percent to 28.8 percent.
The opening of opportunities in the labor market for these groups has
gone hand in hand with improvements in labor market outcomes. An extensive social science literature documents these gains and attempts to identify
their sources. One way of assessing progress is to consider the earnings of one
group relative to another: Chart 4-6 shows the ratio of female to male median annual wage and salary income for all workers from 1967 to 1998 and the
comparable ratio for annual earnings of full-time, full-year workers from
1960 to 1998. In 1967 the median woman worker earned about 40 cents for
every dollar that a man earned. Among full-time, full-year workers, the ratio

and women has narrowed. In 1998 the ratio of median earnings of women to

those of men (again looking at full-time, full-year workers only) was 73 cents
on the dollar.
An important research and policy question is how much of this gap is due
to labor market discrimination. Because it is difficult to measure discrimination directly, researchers have explored this issue by first controlling for other
factors that might legitimately explain the gap. For instance, an additional
year of schooling is estimated to increase a worker s wages, on average, by 5
to 15 percent, and an additional 25 years of work experience increases wages
by an estimated 80 percent. These findings have led some to attribute much
of the male-female wage gap to differences between the sexes in education
and labor market experience. A recent study using longitudinal data from the
late 1980s found that about one-third of the pay gap was explained by differences in the skills and experience that women bring to the labor market.
This study also found that about 28 percent of the gap was due to differences
in the industries and occupations in which men and women worked and in
their union status. Accounting for these differences raises the ratio of female
to male median wages for the late 1980s from about 72 percent to about 88
percent, leaving around 12 percent unexplained.
Even as several beneficial trends have tended to boost women's wages relative to men's and helped narrow the male-female wage gap, two major trends
have worked simultaneously to widen it. The first is increases in the pay premium associated with higher skill (as measured by educational attainment
and labor market experience), and the second is increased differences in pay
across industries and occupations. Despite the gains just documented, these
trends have served to widen the wage gap because female workers still have
less labor market experience, on average, than male workers, and because
women tend to work in occupations with slower wage growth than those of
men. Rising wage inequality across occupations, together with increasing
economic returns to skills, slowed women's progress during the 1980s.
Although recent trends suggest that progress is being made, no one should
doubt that barriers remain. Studies that have tried to measure discrimination by
directly looking at pay differences between men and women in very similar jobs,
or by comparing pay with specific measures of productivity, have found
evidence of discrimination. There is also evidence that discrimination remains a
problem at the highest levels of management. For example, in 1999 only four of
the chief executive officers of Fortune 500 companies were women. A recent
study notes that of the five highest paid executives at each of 4,200 companies,
only 2.5 percent were women, and they earned about 45 percent less than their
male counterparts. Although differences in managerial experience and company
size can explain a large part of this wage gap, the "glass ceiling" may still be
stopping the advancement of women within management hierarchies. To make
further progress in this area, the President's 2001 budget proposal includes

140 I Economic Report of the President




$27 million for an Equal Pay Initiative that will, among other things, strengthen the ability of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to identify
and respond to wage discrimination.

The Economic Progress of African Americans
Over the long term, the convergence of earnings between African Americans
and whites is perhaps even more impressive than that between men and women.
The gap in earnings between African American and white males declined
between World War II and the late 1970s. One study showed that whereas in
1939 African American male wages averaged 43 percent of white male wages, by
1979 this percentage had risen to 73 percent. The study noted that convergence
in education has been central to these improvements. Chart 4-7 presents recent
evidence showing that the relative earnings of African American men have been
increasing only gradually since the 1970s. This trend is broadly consistent with
the education data presented above. Other research has shown that government
policy appears to have played a role in improving at least the employment rates
of African American men (Box 4-1), an area of considerable importance given
the differences in unemployment rates between the two groups.
Research has also shown a near convergence in the earnings of African
American and white females, although this trend has somewhat reversed in
recent years. One study found that African American women in 1939 earned
40 percent of what white women earned; by 1979 that ratio had risen to 90
percent. Chart 4-7 shows that African American women's earnings have
slipped relative to those of white women since the early 1980s. (However, the
gap in earnings between white women and African American women
remains smaller than the corresponding gap for men.) Despite these changes,
other indicators of progress have been encouraging. For example, the
unemployment rate for African Americans in 1999 was the lowest on record.

The Economic Progress of Persons with Disabilities
It has been estimated that one in five Americans of working age has a
disability. A person is typically considered disabled if he or she has difficulty
performing certain functions such as seeing, hearing, or walking; has
difficulty performing activities of daily living; or has difficulty with certain
social roles such as attending school or working. It is also estimated that 1 in
10 Americans is severely disabled, in need of assistance from specialized
devices or other persons to perform basic activities. For working-age persons
with disabilities, reducing discrimination, easing the transition into work,
and improving labor market outcomes have been important goals of this
Administration.
The labor market behavior of persons with disabilities often tracks the
behavior of the broader groups to which they belong. For example, the




Chapter 4 I 141

Box 4-1. The Role of Government Policy in Improving the
Economic Status of African Americans
The Federal Government has led the way in extending opportunities to all Americans. Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act outlawed
employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex,
or national origin and established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to monitor compliance with the law and
enforce its statutes. These statutes covered employers with at least
100 employees beginning July 1965; the threshold was lowered to 25
employees 3 years later. In September 1963, Executive Order 11246
prohibited employment discrimination by Federal contractors. The
Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 extended civil rights
coverage to employers with 15 to 24 employees and expanded the
enforcement power of the EEOC.
Measurement of the effects of civil rights legislation has been
difficult, since the timing of the legislation coincided with many other
significant changes in the U.S. labor market. Despite improvements
in employment and wages for African Americans since the mid-1960s,
it is sometimes difficult to identify a single cause for each change, or
to measure the extent to which Federal policy (as opposed to other
factors such as economic conditions or local sentiment) played a
role. Nonetheless, researchers have documented a link between the
enactment of Federal antidiscrimination policy and evidence of
further opportunities for minorities and reduced discrimination.
An alternative argument is that these policies came about in part as
a result of demand from employers. In a tight labor market, discrimination becomes costly, and it is possible that the passage of Title VII
and subsequent legislation provided a justification for what would
have occurred anyway. Nonetheless, it appears that government
policy played a role and achieved its intended effect of opening
opportunities and increasing the share of African American
employment.
Some have argued that, rather than providing net economy-wide
gains, Title VII and its amendments merely shifted African American
employment from small to large employers. To isolate the true effect
of the legislation, a recent study compared the growth in employment share across large firms with the growth across small firms
newly bound by the 1972 expansion of the EEOC. The study found
that there were gains in the employment share and pay of African
Americans in the industries most affected by the 1972 legislation.
The timing of these gains provides evidence that the Federal policy
positively affected the labor market status of African Americans.

long-term decline in the labor force participation of men, particularly older
men, and the long-term increase in female labor force participation are also
evident in the populations of disabled men and women, respectively. Overall,
however, persons with disabilities have lower rates of labor force activity
(whether working, looking for work, or laid off). They are limited in their
choice of occupation, and they are less likely to work in higher paying
occupations than persons without disabilities. These limitations are particularly evident for those with severe disabilities. In 1994, for example, only
29.5 percent of adults aged 20-64 who had severe disabilities participated in
the labor market. In contrast, 84.5 percent of adults in that age group
without disabilities and 81.6 percent of those with moderate disabilities
participated in the labor force. Despite some evidence of an upward trend in
the labor market activity of those with severe disabilities, there is ample room
for improvement.
The increasing importance, documented above, of education and of
certain skills in the labor market will undoubtedly play an important role
in future labor market outcomes for the disabled. The rate of labor force
activity of severely disabled workers with a college degree (52.4 percent)
was more than 1.5 times that of comparable workers with only 12 years of
education (31.2 percent). It was about three times that of workers with less
than 12 years of education (17.3 percent). Evidence also suggests that having computer skills improves the labor market outcomes of workers with




Chapter 4 I 143

severe disabilities. For example, a recent study examined the earnings and
work behavior of a group of workers who had experienced a spinal cord
injury. Although their injuries led to a large decrease in employment,
hours worked, and weekly earnings, if they had computer skills they
returned more quickly to work and had relatively higher earnings once
there. These results were still observed after controlling for educational
attainment.
In recent years, government policies have begun to focus on helping
disabled workers return to work. The 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act
was designed to eliminate discrimination against the disabled, including in
the workplace. In December 1999 the President signed the Ticket to Work
and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, to help eliminate the
institutional barriers that limit employment opportunities for persons with
disabilities. The act provides health insurance protections to the working
disabled by giving States new options to allow workers with disabilities to
buy into Medicaid. It extends Medicare coverage for an additional 4V2
years for beneficiaries of disability insurance who return to work. It also
creates a Medicaid buy-in demonstration program to help those who are
disabled but still able to work. And it provides grants for States to develop
infrastructure that will help people with disabilities return to work. The act
also offers a "Ticket-to-Work" for disabled beneficiaries of Social Security
disability insurance and Supplemental Security Income, giving them more
choice in the selection of vocational rehabilitation and employment service
providers.

Preparing the American Work Force
for the 21st Century
The transformation of the economy from one based on agriculture and
manufacturing into one based on services and high-technology skills has
meant many changes for the American economy and people. It has, for
example, led to the rise of new economic centers such as Silicon Valley and
the decline of other areas that were once vibrant and had jobs in abundance.
This Administration has led the battle to revitalize those areas of the country
that have been left behind (Box 4-2). The changing economy has also meant
a new set of challenges for the American worker. To compete successfully in
the new economy, the American work force must continue to change. This
section documents the role of education and training in providing the skills
necessary for the labor market of today.

144 I Economic Report of the President




Box 4-2. Helping Areas Left Behind: Opening New Markets
The movement from agriculture to manufacturing that took place
at the beginning of the 20th century implied a movement of jobs and
people from rural to urban areas. Later, suburban employment grew
as the rise in service occupations led to job creation outside the central cities. Accompanying this change has been a broader movement
of manufacturing jobs out of the Northeast and the Midwest, the
Nation's traditional manufacturing centers, to the South and the West.
In all geographic regions, however, the largest share of employment
growth between 1980 and 1990 took place in suburban counties. The
movement of manufacturing and service jobs from central cities and
rural areas has led to the further decay of many of these areas and to
a spatial mismatch between the availability of jobs and workers to fill
them.
To help revitalize areas that have been left behind because of sectoral shifts or urban flight, the Administration has implemented a
number of important policies and proposed others. A prime example
is the creation of empowerment zones and enterprise communities in
struggling areas, as provided for in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Businesses in these areas are eligible for tax incentives to facilitate employment, financing, and investment. In 1994 the
first 9 empowerment zones were designated, along with 95 smaller
enterprise communities. These programs have leveraged over $10
billion in additional public and private revitalization efforts, and a
recent survey of businesses operating in the 31 empowerment zones
created to date finds that these tax incentives have been an important
factor in employment decisions. The fiscal 2001 budget proposes a
series of extensions to this program, including a third round of 10
new empowerment zones. It will also extend existing wage credits for
existing and new empowerment zones through 2009.
In addition, the Administration has proposed a new set of policies
to spur investment in low-income areas.These include a tax credit to
spur equity capital; creation of America's Private Investment Companies (APICs), patterned after overseas investment institutions to
leverage investment in untapped domestic markets; and several programs designed to assist small businesses in low-income areas. The
proposal would expand BusinessLINC, a public-private partnership
that encourages large businesses to work with small business owners; microenterprise initiatives to provide funding for technical assistance to low-income microentrepreneurs; and the targeting of Small
Business Investment Company resources to areas served by the New
Markets initiative.

Other policy initiatives seek to overcome the spatial mismatch
between workers and jobs. One of these is the "Moving to Opportunity" demonstration project, which helps families that leave highpoverty inner-city neighborhoods through counseling and rental
assistance. Another is the "Bridges to Work" demonstration project,
which provides placement, transportation, and support services to
inner-city residents so that they can take advantage of suburban job
opportunities.

Building Foundations: Educating Americas Youth
The economic decision to improve ones skills—to invest in ones own
human capital—is based on both the cost of that investment and the expected
return. The cost includes such basic things as expenditure on tuition and
books, but it also includes an opportunity cost: the earnings that the worker
could have made had he or she chosen to stay in the labor market rather than
go to school. And the return—or, to be precise, the private return—consists
mainly of the higher wages available in the labor market to workers with
more schooling or training. On average, having more years of formal schooling leads to better labor market outcomes for those schooled: higher wages,
higher rates of employment, and lower rates of unemployment. Although it
is difficult to put an exact dollar figure on this return, the evidence presented
above indicates that it has increased substantially in recent decades. Further,
and perhaps more important from a policy perspective, evidence suggests
that society at large benefits from having a more educated population.
The social return to education, for example, might include a more productive
work force that can pay taxes, draws less on government-provided social
programs, and participates more effectively in the democratic process.
Given the high rate of return to schooling, individuals and families have a
tremendous private incentive to invest in education. People often make great
financial and personal sacrifices so that they or their children can get more
schooling, or schooling of higher quality. Despite the incentives, however,
there are a number of reasons to expect that people might underinvest in
education. Financial constraints present a problem for some. Because they
cannot use their future human capital as collateral, would-be students may
not be able to borrow enough to finance their education. They may also be
underinformed, or misinformed, about the true opportunities available in
the labor market. In particular, they may not know or realize what level of
wages they could eventually earn if they make the human capital investment,
or the length of time over which they will reap the returns. Perhaps most
important for policy, when people make these personal decisions, they may
not take into account the benefits of their further education to the rest of
146 I Economic Report of the President




society as well as to themselves. These explanations all point to a role for
government to play in the provision of education and training.
The challenge for government with respect to schools is to give students
the skills they need to succeed in todays economy and tomorrows and to
participate more fully in American life in general. Fortunately, students
themselves are recognizing the need for improved skills, and many are seeking greater challenge in their education. Students today are taking more
courses in core academic subjects than did their counterparts in the early
1980s, and the courses they are taking are more challenging. For example, a
higher percentage of high school graduates are completing algebra and
higher-level mathematics courses, as well as courses in biology, chemistry,
and physics, than in the 1980s. The proportion of students taking college
advanced placement examinations has also increased dramatically, from 50
twelfth-graders out of every thousand in 1984 to 131 per thousand in 1997.
Although measuring educational progress is difficult, test scores may be
indicative, and here the signs are mixed but generally positive in recent years.
Since the early 1980s, scores on the National Assessment of Educational
Progress (NAEP) show modest improvements in mathematics and science
proficiency, but little change in reading and writing proficiency. Differences
in NAEP scores by sex are now small, with females scoring higher in writing
and reading achievement and males generally scoring higher in science and
mathematics. Results for African Americans and Hispanics also show
improvement since the mid-1970s. Indeed, the end of legal segregation, followed by efforts to equalize spending on public schools since 1970, has made
a substantial difference in student achievement. On every major national test,
including the NAEP, the gap between minority and white students' test
scores narrowed substantially between 1970 and 1990.
Scores on the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT, a test typically taken by
college-bound high school juniors and seniors) have also shown improvement in
recent years. Mathematics scores on the SAT were 16 points higher in 1995
than in 1980, although students scored higher on both parts of the test, mathematics and verbal, in the early 1970s (Chart 4-8; scores reflect the recentering
that occurred in 1995). Between 1976 and 1995, the combined verbal and
mathematics scores of African Americans climbed by over 50 points, while those
of white students remained roughly stable. Observed gains in SAT scores are
particularly impressive given that the proportion of high school graduates taking
the test has increased by about a fourth since the early 1970s.
The gains that the U.S. education system has achieved in the past few
decades deserve recognition, but they should be viewed in a broader context.
Schools have been changing, but the economy has been changing more
quickly. The result, as discussed above, is that a high school diploma alone is
no longer a ticket to the middle class. Even at higher educational levels there
may be a mismatch between the skills acquired in school and the skill

requirements of jobs. To right this balance, the Administration has made
improving education one of its highest priorities (Box 4-3).

Greater Access to Preschool Education: The Head Start Program
Research demonstrates that the early preschool years, when human ability
and motivation are being shaped, are critical for skill formation. Developmental programs that intervene early in life have been shown to be more costeffective than later attempts at remediation. One such program is Head Start,
which since 1965 has provided comprehensive developmental services for
Americas low-income preschool children as well as social services for their
families. These services focus on fostering intellectual, social, and emotional
growth as well as providing a comprehensive health program. Since 1993,
funding for Head Start has nearly doubled, to $5.3 billion in 2000. The additional funds have enabled Head Start to increase its enrollment from 714,000
to 877,000 children since 1993 and to enhance the quality of its services. The
Presidents 2001 budget proposes a $1 billion increase in this program.
Although conclusive evidence is limited, two recent studies have shown the
effectiveness of Head Start. A 1995 study used a nationally representative data
set to compare children who had participated in the program with their siblings
who had not. This methodology allowed the researchers to control for many
confounding factors that they could not observe but that may be related to outcomes. The study found significant and persistent effects of Head Start in

148 I Economic Report of the President




Box 4-3. The Administration's Education Goals
In his 1998 State of the Union Address, the President stated that
"[t]he Information Age is, first and foremost, an education age, in
which education must start at birth and continue throughout a
lifetime." To meet the challenges of the information-based, skillsintensive economy, the President has set ambitious goals for the
Nation's education system:
• All students will read independently and well by the end of third
grade.
• All students will master challenging mathematics, including the
foundations of algebra and geometry, by the end of eighth grade.
• By 18 years of age, all students will be prepared for and able to
afford college.
• All States and schools will have challenging and clear standards of
achievement and accountability for all children, as well as effective
strategies for reaching those standards.
• There will be a talented, dedicated, and well-prepared teacher in
every classroom.
• Every classroom will be connected to the Internet, and all students
will be technologically literate.
• Every school will be strong, safe, drug-free, and disciplined.
To achieve these goals, the President has proposed and implemented a broad agenda of education policies that extend from
preschool to college.
increasing test scores and school attainment and in reducing grade repetition for
whites. However, the large and significant gains in test scores for African
Americans were found to be quickly lost after they left the program, perhaps
because of lower quality in the schools that so many of them attend after leaving
the program. Another study using the same methodology found large positive
effects on test scores and schooling attainment for Hispanic children, although
long-term follow-up was unavailable.

Improving Elementary and Secondary Education
It is important to ensure that all students have access to good-quality educational resources once they enter school. As was stated at the beginning of this
chapter, students need society's help as they prepare themselves for a changing
work force and the demands of a technology-driven labor market. The President
has therefore laid out a three-part agenda to help State and local governments




Chapter 4 I 149

build and maintain a world-class elementary and secondary school system. The
first part of this agenda focuses on setting high standards. A national consensus
has emerged on the key role of standards in school improvement: 48 States now
test their students, and 36 publish annual report cards on individual schools.
However, only 19 States currently use more extensive public rating systems to
identify low-performing schools, and only 16 apply sanctions to failing schools.
A second and related way to encourage local cooperation in improving
schools is to increase the accountability of those responsible for their outcomes. The Administration has proposed the Education Accountability Act,
which requires States and school districts to comply with accountability measures in order to receive Federal funds. These accountability measures include
identifying failing schools and making critical investments to turn them
around; reconstituting or closing chronically underperforming schools;
employing qualified teachers and assigning them to teach in their field of
expertise; instituting disciplinary codes and issuing school report cards; and
ending social promotion by making sure students get the help they need to
succeed in school.
Finally, the President has emphasized the importance of investing in strategies aimed at raising student achievement. These include assuring students of
access to the latest technology, reducing class sizes in the early grades,
improving teacher quality, providing opportunities for extended learning in
after-school and summer school programs, providing free and appropriate
public education to students with disabilities, and offering options for
public school choice. Each of these strategies is discussed below.
Improving Access to the Latest Technology. Computer and technology skills
are increasingly important for students as they prepare for the future. Knowledge of these skills provides a gateway to higher wages and to the new jobs of
the 21st century. Accordingly, in 1996 this Administration made it a
priority to help all children gain access to the tools they need to prosper in a
changing economy. The Technology Literacy Challenge had four basic goals:
to equip all classrooms with modern computers, to connect all classrooms to
the Internet, to promote the development of quality educational software,
and to prepare teachers to use technology effectively. It is important to find
creative ways to use technology in the classroom, because evidence suggests
that it can be a useful tool. For example, a recent study showed that eighth
graders who use computers to learn higher order thinking skills, or who had
teachers trained in the use of technology, raised their achievement in
mathematics by more than one-third of a grade level.
The Technology Literacy Challenge program addresses the goal of equipping
classrooms with computers through the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund.
Resources available through this fund can be used to help States and local school
districts increase the number of modern, multimedia computers in the classroom. The funds 2000 budget was $425 million. In the 1998-99 academic year
150 I Economic Report of the President




there were 9.8 students for every multimedia computer in use. This represented
an improvement from 21.2 students per computer only 2 years before. The
Administration has also supported the Computers for Learning program, an
interagency effort to refurbish surplus computers from Federal Government
operations and distribute them to schools. Thousands of computers from this
program are currendy in use in schools across the country.
One of the most important programs designed to help in linking schools to
the Internet has been the E-rate program created under the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Through this program, approximately $3.6 billion has
been made available since 1998 in the form of discounts to over 50,000
schools and libraries so that they can afford telecommunications equipment,
Internet access, and internal connections to the classroom. The level of the
discount for which a school is eligible is determined by the proportion of
children eligible to participate in the Federal school lunch program. In this
way the E-rate targets those schools and libraries that serve the most disadvantaged students. In fact, 70 percent of funding in the programs second
year went to schools in the lowest income areas.
Progress so far has been dramatic. In 1994, according to the Department
of Education, only 3 percent of classrooms had Internet connections; by
1998 that figure had risen to 51 percent. Already the E-rate alone has helped
connect more than 1 million classrooms.
There is still a long way to go, however, before all children have easy access
to the new medium. A "digital divide" remains for poor and minority children who lack the same access to this technology in their homes that other
children enjoy. In fact, households with incomes over $75,000 are more than
five times as likely to have a computer at home and more than seven times as
likely to have home Internet access as those with incomes under $10,000.
But with recent advances through the E-rate, the gap between rich and poor
within schools has narrowed tremendously (Chart 4-9).
An essential complement to computer hardware and Internet access is
developing user-friendly educational software with engaging content. The
Department of Educations Technology Innovation Challenge Grants support partnerships among educators, the private sector, and nonprofit organizations to develop compelling applications of educational technology. For
example, teachers in San Diego are working with university researchers and
other partners to develop a curriculum of studies with an ocean exploration
theme, designed to improve performance in mathematics and science.
Finally, making effective use of this new hardware and software requires training teachers to use the new technology. The Congress has approved a $75 million
initiative proposed by the President to help train new teachers in the use of the
new high-tech tools in their classrooms. This program will help ensure that all
new teachers entering the work force can integrate technology effectively into
their curriculum and teaching styles.

Class Size Reduction. Average class size in the United States declined from
29 in 1961 to 24 in 1991. Despite this improvement, however, many parents
and educators believe class sizes are still too large. There is also substantial
variation in class size, with many students still being taught in classes with
more than 30 students. Smaller classes allow teachers to interact more with
each student and to tailor instruction to that students needs, and they allow
students to participate more in class discussions. These benefits can boost
students' academic performance. In Tennessee's Project STAR, for example, a
group of students from kindergarten through third grade were randomly
assigned to either regular-sized classes (22 to 25 students) or smaller classes
(13 to 17 students). Over 11,000 students in 79 schools eventually participated in the program. Results show that students in smaller classes learned
more in the first year of the program than did students in larger classes, and
that these gains were maintained as these children continued in smaller
classes in subsequent years. Some researchers have argued that children get a
one-time gain from a reduction in class size, and that this gain is maintained
in later years whether or not they remain in smaller classes.
In his 1999 State of the Union Address, the President proposed the first-ever
nationwide effort to reduce class size in the early grades. The Congress passed
the proposed legislation in 1999. School districts around the Nation received a
total of $1.3 billion to enable them to recruit, hire, and train new, qualified
teachers for the 2000-2001 school year. This was the first installment of a 7-year
initiative to help schools hire 100,000 new teachers and reduce class size in the
152 I Economic Report of the President




early grades to a nationwide average of 18. All 50 States have received funds
through the program. A recent report by the Department of Education on the
programsfirstyear estimated that 1.7 million children are benefiting from the
program; that 29,000 teachers have been hired; that, in schools receiving the
bulk of the funding, class sizes for grades one through three were reduced by an
average of five students; and that the programs flexibility has allowed it to
complement State and local efforts.
Improving Teacher Quality. Research has shown that teachers do make a
difference to student achievement, although the exact characteristics that
make some teachers more effective than others remain elusive. In fiscal
2000, $98 million was appropriated for Teacher Quality Enhancement
Grants, which help link teacher preparation institutions and high-need
school districts, to strengthen teacher education and to provide incentives
to prospective teachers to teach in high-need schools. As part of the
Hispanic Education Action Plan, in the fiscal 2001 budget the Administration has requested $100 million for Bilingual Education Professional
Development. This would be an increase of $28.5 million over the fiscal
2000 level. The funding will provide more than 2,000 additional instructors in bilingual education and English as a second language with the
high-quality pre-service and in-service training they need to teach students
with limited proficiency in English.
Opportunities for Extended Learning in After-School Care and Summer
School. The summer months can be an important time for learning outside
of the classroom. Recent evidence has shown, however, that the test scores
of poorer children are more likely to fall over the summer than those of
children from wealthier families. This research suggests the importance of
providing disadvantaged children with increased opportunities to learn.
The President has called for a large investment in after-school and summer
school programs to give children the extra help they need to meet high
educational standards. The fiscal 2000 budget more than doubled Federal
investment in these programs (21st Century Community Learning Centers), to $453 million, to provide educational support to 675,000 students.
The President has proposed doubling funding again for fiscal 2001, to
$1.0 billion.
Providing Public Education to All Students with Disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Act, first enacted in 1975, has helped change the lives of
millions of people with disabilities. Before its enactment, approximately 1
million children with disabilities were shut out of schools, and hundreds of
thousands more were denied appropriate services. In 1986, 26 percent of
children with disabilities were educated in regular classrooms. By 1996 that
proportion had risen to 45 percent. Today, people with disabilities are graduating from high school and going to college in unprecedented numbers.




Chapter 4 I 153

During this Administration, the Federal investment in educating young
people with disabilities has more than doubled, from nearly $3.0 billion in
fiscal 1993 to about $6.0 billion in fiscal 2000, and the fiscal 2001 budget
would increase this spending by $333 million. More important, however, is the
Administrations strong commitment to improving the educational outcomes of
disabled children. The 1997 amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities
Act made it clear that the education of children with disabilities must be based
on the same challenging standards applied to nondisabled students, with
appropriate modifications and supports for their disabilities.
Options for Public School Choice. Charter schools provide parents with
greater choice within the public school system. They also allow educators an
opportunity to create innovative learning environments while remaining
accountable for student achievement. The number of public charter schools
nationwide has risen from 2 in 1993 to nearly 1,700 in 1999. Through the
Presidents leadership, startup funding of $145 million for as many as 2,000
charter schools in 2000 has been provided.

Greater Access to Postsecondary Education
As discussed earlier in this chapter, the difference in average wages between
those Americans with postsecondary education and those without it is
considerable. One way to help people improve their economic status is to
provide greater access to postsecondary education and more opportunities for
people to enhance their skills throughout their working lives. The Administration is committed to making postsecondary education both attainable and
affordable for all Americans, from recent high school graduates to adult learners
and displaced workers. To help ensure access to 4-year and community colleges
(Box 4-4), the President has proposed and supported programs that prepare
students for postsecondary education and help make college affordable.
Preparing Studentsfor College. Too many children, especially from low-income
families, are reaching college age without the skills and knowledge they need to
go on to college. Recent research has shown that students form their educational expectations early, and courses taken early in junior high or high school are
closely related to postsecondary enrollment. This indicates that the end of high
school may be too late to inform students of the importance of a college education. Rather, information on the importance of college admission requirements
as well as on financial aid is critical for students early in their educational careers.
GEAR UP (Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs) helps low-income students prepare for education beyond high school by
providing tutoring, counseling, mentoring, information on financial aid, and
other assistance these students need to become ready for college. The President
is requesting $325 million for GEAR UP in fiscal 2001, an increase from $200
million in fiscal 2000, to finance needed services to over 1.4 million students in
high-poverty schools.
154 I Economic Report of the President




Box 4-4.The Role of Community Colleges
Community colleges more than doubled in number and quadrupled
their enrollments during the 1960s. In 1995, 5.5 million students were
enrolled in these 2-year colleges, accounting for 38 percent of enrollments in all postsecondary institutions. Because community colleges
typically charge lower fees than 4-year institutions and operate under
open admissions policies, they have helped provide greater access to
education for people at all income levels.They have lowered the costs
of attendance in other ways as well, by offering evening and weekend
classes where workers can enhance their skills while holding a job.
Community colleges were originally designed as a stepping stone
for students who would later transfer to 4-year colleges to complete
their bachelor's degrees.Today, however, community colleges provide
a wide range of offerings, including vocational training and continuing
adult education. The dramatic increase in community college enrollment was primarily the result of growth in part-time students; today
roughly 65 percent of community college students attend part-time.
Almost 36 percent of community college students are 30 years old or
older, compared with only 22 percent of students at public 4-year colleges. These schools have become an important source of the lifelong
learning that today's dynamic economy demands. Recent evidence
suggests that community colleges have increased the overall educational attainment of the American work force, and that one of their
major roles has become that of providing access to higher education
for those not traditionally served by the 4-year college system. Other
evidence suggests that these schools also effectively address the skills
mismatch described earlier. For example, a recent study noted that
high-technology manufacturers were less likely to report difficulty in
finding skilled labor in communities that had a community college than
in those that did not.

TRIO programs are another important resource to help disadvantaged
students prepare for and succeed in college. These are educational outreach
programs designed to motivate and support students from low-income
families. There are currently 2,400 TRIO programs serving 700,000
students. The fiscal 2000 budget is $645 million. Evaluation results from one
type of TRIO program, Upward Bound, found that students in the
program were four times more likely to earn a college degree than students
from similar backgrounds who were not in TRIO.
Helping Finance Postsecondary Education. Enacted in 1997, the HOPE
Scholarship program and the Lifetime Learning tax credit represent the
largest Federal investment in higher education since the G.I. Bill over 50




Chapter 4 I 155

years ago. In 2000, 13.1 million students—5.9 million receiving HOPE
Scholarships and 7.2 million claiming the Lifetime Learning credit—are
eligible to benefit. The budget for HOPE Scholarships in fiscal 2000 was
approximately $5 billion. Each HOPE Scholarship provides a tax credit of
up to $1,500 for each of the first 2 years of college for students enrolled on
at least a half-time basis. This credit is phased out for joint tax filers with
incomes between $80,000 and $100,000, and for single filers making
between $40,000 and $50,000. By reducing the financial barriers to
continued education, the President hopes to make the first 2 years of
college as universal as high school.
In addition, the 2000 Federal budget provides $7.6 billion for Pell
grants, a program that provides direct financial assistance to help financially
needy students pay for their postsecondary education. The maximum
award was increased 43 percent between 1993 and 2000, from $2,300 to
$3,300.
To further these goals, the President's 2001 budget proposes a $30
billion investment in the form of a college opportunity tax cut. This
initiative would offer a 28 percent tax credit for higher education expenses
and would set higher income thresholds than do existing education tax
credits. Unlike with the HOPE Scholarship, there would be no limit on
the number of years in which a student could claim the credit. When fully
phased in, the credit would cover $10,000 in expenses.
The Lifetime Learning tax credit targets adults who want to go back to
school, change careers, or take courses to upgrade their skills, as well as
college juniors and seniors and graduate and professional degree students.
The 20 percent credit applies to the first $5,000 of a family's qualified
education expenses through 2002 and to the first $10,000 thereafter, and it
phases out at the same income levels as the HOPE Scholarship. The fiscal
2000 budget for this credit was $2.4 billion.
Student loans have opened the doors to college for millions of Americans. In 1993 the President established the direct student loan program to
reduce costs and increase efficiency in the Federal Government's student
loan programs and to offer expanded benefits to borrowers. The program
offered students the option of income-contingent repayment: installments
were based in part on the borrower's income after completing studies. In
the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, the Administration proposed
and obtained significantly lower interest rates for borrowers on student
loans, easing the burden of repayment for new borrowers and for borrowers
who consolidate their loans.

156 I Economic Report of the President




The Continuing Challenge: Reeducating
and Retraining
Progress in strengthening formal education is a key ingredient in preparing
young people for the labor market, but training after formal education is also
essential, both for those just entering the market and for those well into their
careers. To take advantage of the opportunities offered by an increasingly
global, competitive, and information-driven economy, workers today may
require ongoing, lifelong learning.

The Provision of Training
In large measure, it is the responsibility of individuals and firms, not of
government, to develop the methods and practices most appropriate for promoting lifelong learning and training. As with education, both individuals
and firms have strong incentives to invest in training: both stand to reap high
returns from their investments. But as with education, government policies
may have an important role to play in facilitating such investments.
Employers have a clear interest in providing their employees with the
specialized training they need to perform those tasks that they can perform
for that employer and nowhere else. Companies should therefore be willing
to provide training in these firm-specific skills. In contrast, many other valuable skills are occupation- rather than firm-specific, and still others, such as
many mathematical and literacy skills, are quite general in their application.
The data on training described below suggest that firms do provide substantial training in general skills, but it is difficult to disentangle the cost of
employer investments in training from that of employee investments in
training, even when the employer sponsors the training.
Firms provide general training for several reasons. They may simply be
unable to find employees with the necessary occupational skills, or employees
may need some general training before they can benefit from training in
more firm-specific skills. When firms provide general training in their own
facilities but do not pay employees their full wages while in training, it is
largely the employees, not the firms, who are then doing the investing—they
are paying an opportunity cost. In practice, both individuals and firms are
likely to share in these investments, but employers will be reluctant to invest
heavily in general skills when workers have high turnover rates, since the firm
does not reap the returns on the investment. Despite the evidence that firms
do provide general training, there is reason to believe they might underinvest
in such training.
As in the case of education, there are reasons to believe that individuals might
underinvest in their own general training. If they are not sure that the skills they
will acquire will result in higher wage offers, they will hesitate to bear the costs.
They may also underinvest because their incomes are too low to carry them




Chapter 4 I 157

through a period of unpaid training. In times of rapid technological progress,
workers may be unaware of the value of new training or consider it too risky: the
same rapid change that makes the skill valuable today may make it obsolete
tomorrow. Finally, again as with investments in formal schooling, individual
workers may fail to invest in training because they do not take account of the
full social benefits of training in their decisionmaking.
All these underinvestment scenarios provide reasons for government
policies to encourage general training. One way in which government
attempts to encourage investment in training is by allowing employers to
deduct from taxable income the tuition payments for schooling they provide
for their employees. Other policies are discussed below. First, however, it is
worthwhile to review the evidence on the value of firm-based training.

Firm-Based Training
Privately provided training by firms themselves is the primary mechanism by
which workers receive training in the United States, and there is evidence that
this firm-based training is growing. Although this source of training is difficult
to measure, a number of surveys have been conducted and agree on several conclusions. First, training is very widespread: in 1994, 81 percent of all establishments offered some type of formal training, and 57 percent said that they had
increased the amount offered since 1991 (only 2 percent reported providing less
training). Second, firms with more than 1,000 employees are more likely to
invest in training than small firms; virtually all large firms report that they offer
formal training. This may be because smaller firms have trouble financing
certain fixed costs associated with training, or because it is more difficult to
measure the informal training that takes place in smaller firms. Third, there is
considerable variation across industries, with a higher incidence of training
provision in nonmanufacturing than in manufacturing firms. Fourth, establishments with more highly educated workers (which also tend to be larger establishments) are more likely to provide training. Finally, training is more likely
when the firm is already making other investments, such as investments in
capital, or in new organizational practices, such as self-managed teams or other
"high-performance" work practices.
These data suggest that firm-based training becomes more prevalent as
firms experience rapid technological progress, but much training is specific to
the employer and is not of a general nature. For example, training in basic literacy and numeracy, in computer skills, or in teamwork is less common than
training in safety procedures or in new, firm-specific production methods.
Only 27 percent of all establishments provide training in basic educational
skills for their workers, whereas 53 percent invest in computer-related skills
and 82 percent invest in safety training. Although more workers receive
training from their employers than from government-sponsored programs,

158 I Economic Report of the President




the level of employer-provided training may still, for the reasons discussed
above, fall short of what is socially optimal. This is particularly true for lower
income groups or those in industries experiencing increases in imports or
other conditions associated with worker dislocation.
These incentives to underinvest in employer-provided general training
may be particularly strong in the United States, where labor turnover is high
and there is no national, standardized credentialing system for this type of
training. U.S. companies invest roughly $60 billion a year on education,
training, and upgrading skills, but this is modest relative to the challenge
posed to the Nation by rapidly changing workplace demands.

Government Training Programs
Government training programs are aimed primarily at workers who have
lost their jobs and are having difficulty finding new ones, or at those who are
unemployed and disadvantaged and may lack the skills or experience to enter
the labor market without further preparation. Some employment and training programs are designed specifically to help welfare recipients go to work.
Typically, training programs include some form of remedial or vocational
education, subsidized employment to provide job experience, or guidance in
how to find a job.
Modern U.S. training programs trace their history back to the mid-1960s.
The 1964 Economic Opportunity Act created the Job Corps, which still
operates today, currently providing training for disadvantaged youth at over
100 urban and rural residential centers throughout the United States. Since
its inception, the Job Corps has served more than 1.7 million young people.
The Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA) was enacted in
1962 to retrain technologically dislocated workers, but the Economic
Opportunity Act of 1964 shifted its emphasis toward disadvantaged workers.
In 1973 MDTA was replaced by the Comprehensive Employment and
Training Act (CETA). This program, which gave State and local governments
the authority to operate training programs with Federal grants, also had a
public service job creation component, which grew quite large in the late
1970s. In an effort to shift more responsibility to the private sector, the Job
Training Partnership Act (JTPA) replaced CETA in 1982. JTPA eliminated
the public service employment component of training and further decentralized its administrative structure by giving primary responsibility for the
program to State and local governments and the business community. The
program currently serves over a million economically disadvantaged persons
annually and was until recently the principal training program for the
disadvantaged. JTPA is in the process of being replaced by the Workplace
Investment Act, discussed below.




Chapter 4 I 159

The first major mandatory training program for welfare recipients was the
Work Incentive (WIN) Program of 1967. This program generally provided
recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) with job
search assistance. In 1988 WIN was replaced by the Job Opportunities and
Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program. Created by the Family Support Act of
1988, this was a comprehensive welfare-to-work program that gave AFDC
recipients the opportunity to take part in job training, work, and educationrelated activities that would lead toward economic self-sufficiency. The
comprehensive welfare reform legislation passed in 1996 replaced JOBS (as
well as the AFDC) with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
(TANF) block grant. TANF gives States the flexibility to design their own
welfare programs, provided they require recipients to participate in work or
work-related activities in exchange for time-limited assistance. Within certain
limitations, States may provide both pre- and postemployment services,
including training to help welfare recipients find and keep a job.
Government appropriation specifically on training and employment
services in fiscal 2000 amounted to approximately $5.5 billion a year, a level
that implies that government-funded training opportunities for U.S. workers
are limited relative to those available to workers in other countries. Comparative research done in 1994-95 found that the United States spent only 0.2
percent of its GDP on publicly funded employment and training programs,
much less than many other industrial countries, including the United
Kingdom (which spends 0.5 percent of GDP) and Sweden (3.0 percent).
Are government employment and training programs effective in improving labor market prospects for the disadvantaged? A review of the evidence
provides grounds for cautious optimism. One general conclusion, however, is
that these programs appear to have been more successful for disadvantaged
adults—women in particular—than for disadvantaged youth.
Disadvantaged youth are perhaps the most difficult population to help, and
success has been limited except in a few highly intensive or particularly well run
programs. One program that has shown noteworthy success is the Center for
Employment Training (CET) in San Jose, the only one of the 13 Jobstart
demonstration programs found to be effective in increasing youth earnings. An
evaluation of this program showed a 40 percent ($3,000) increase in participants' earnings. The Job Corps has also been shown to produce significant gains
in earnings (about 15 percent per year) and to reduce the number of serious
crimes that participants commit. Both of these programs are considerably more
intensive than most other efforts: enrollees either reside at the programs facilities
(in the case of the Job Corps) or spend many hours per month undergoing
training (in the case of the CET). Finally, a number of programs have been
specifically targeted at young single parents on welfare. Some of these programs
have produced small short-run gains in employment and educational

160 I Economic Report of the President




attainment among teenage parents. However, it has proved difficult to sustain
these gains once the program has been terminated.
The evidence is much more consistent that job training programs increase the
earnings of disadvantaged adults, and particularly those of economically disadvantaged women. The JTPA Title II program, which offers short-term training
and job search assistance to disadvantaged adults, appears to have increased the
earnings of women in the program by 15 percent, and of men by 10 percent.
More intensive programs that offer subsidized employment and supportive
services to long-term welfare participants have yielded larger earnings gains.
Mandatory welfare-to-work programs, which tend to offer job search assistance
rather than training, have shown modest but positive effects on earnings and
employment and small negative effects on welfare receipt. Given the very low
initial earnings of most disadvantaged adults served by training programs, the
gains made by most programs have not been enough to pull many of those
served out of poverty. However, most studies documenting this finding were
completed before the recent expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit
(EITC). It may be that the EITC boosts starting incomes enough so that the
additional earnings generated by job search and training programs can then
move noticeable numbers of participants out of poverty.
Research on the effects of employment and training programs for dislocated
workers, although much more limited, suggests that some of these programs can
be effective. Carefully targeted job search assistance programs can decrease the
duration of unemployment and the receipt of unemployment insurance among
displaced workers. These programs are generally cost-effective for the government. One study has suggested that for every dollar the government spent on
targeted job search programs, the government saved about $2 in the form of
reduced unemployment insurance payments and increased tax receipts due to
faster reemployment.
Taken together, these results suggest that employment and training programs can achieve modest employment and earnings gains for disadvantaged
women. These programs are also often cost-effective. Results for other groups
are less clear. Moreover, the earnings gains generated by successful programs
have usually not been enough to lift participants out of poverty. To some
extent this is not surprising given the relatively modest and short-term nature
of the investments these programs make. It is possible that more intensive
interventions, focused on local skill demands and tailored to individual
needs, would produce greater gains.

Trainingfor the 21st Century
As Chapter 2 has documented, the macroeconomic environment for
American workers improved markedly during the 1990s. The Nations labor
market is performing at extraordinary levels, with the unemployment rate at




Chapter 4 I 161

a 30-year low, labor force participation at an all-time high, and real compensation measures recording strong gains. But even in todays economy, the
rapid pace of change and the premium put on technology and skills may
cause some workers to lose their jobs and have trouble finding new jobs given
the skills they have. And those workers who have failed to acquire the
necessary skills may have trouble securing employment that provides the
middle-class standard of living they are striving for. This Administration has
made it a priority to pursue training policies that will help ensure, for all
those willing to work hard, an opportunity to prosper.
A key component of the Administrations efforts to strengthen work force
development and promote lifelong learning is the Workforce Investment Act
(WIA). Signed into law in August 1998, WIA represents the first major
reform of the Nation's job training system in over 15 years. The act, which is
now being implemented, will streamline and revitalize the system that
provides workers with the information, advice, job search assistance, and
training to find and retain good jobs, and provides employers with a pool of
skilled workers. The act aims to enable any adult interested in advancing his
or her career to continue learning, regardless of income; it also aims to
provide high-quality information and services to all job seekers. Seven key
principles are embodied in the law:
• Streamlining services: A variety of programs are being integrated at the
street level to make the delivery system more accessible to both individuals
and businesses. The Department of Labor has provided implementation
funds to each State. Over 1,000 one-stop centers have already been
opened. A group of Internet tools has also been created to provide timely
and comprehensive labor market information (Box 4-5).
• Empowering individuals: Individual Training Accounts, along with consumer reports providing key information on the performance of training
providers, and job counseling at one-stop centers will enable individuals to
make informed training choices.
• Making services universally accessible: WIA aims to provide ready access to
core employment-related services to all in need of those services.
• Increased accountability: States and local communities will be held
accountable for meeting performance measures, will suffer sanctions if
they fall short, and will receive incentive funds for strong results.
• Strong role for local boards and business: State and local Workforce
Investment Boards will be chaired by a member of the business community and have a majority of members from business.
• Provide local flexibility: Local authorities will have flexibility to tailor
delivery systems to meet the needs of their community.

Box 4-5. Using Technology to Help Workers: America's Career Kit
America's Career Kit uses the Internet to offer innovative ways to
help workers find jobs, help employers find workers, and provide
timely and valuable information about the labor market to all stakeholders. The initiative is designed to help reduce the mismatch
between worker skills and shifting employer requirements. America's
Career Kit consists of the following four websites:
• America's Job Bank is an Internet site that lists both job openings
and resumes. With 6 million users each month, it is the Nation's
largest online labor exchange.
• America's Talent Bank allows job seekers to post their resumes
online, where potential employers can view them. A growing numbers of workers with information technology skills are using this
resource.
• America's Career InfoNet provides information for both prospective employees and employers on employment trends, prevailing
wages, and job training requirements. Data are also available on
States and localities.
• America's Learning Exchange is an electronic marketplace for training and education resources. As of January 2000, the exchange
counted 4,540 providers, 162,053 courses, and 42,968 programs.

• Improved youth programs: The act will foster connections between
academic and occupational learning and provide activities geared toward
youth development. A youth council will be established under each local
Workforce Investment Board to improve coordination among organizations
that serve young people. Given the mixed results of previous short-term training programs, WIA will require 12-month follow-up services in its programs.
The 2000 budget included $2.4 billion for the Universal Reemployment
initiative. In a period of rapidly changing job demands, this program aims to
provide training and reemployment services to all dislocated workers who want
and need them. To this end, reemployment services will be targeted to unemployment insurance claimants in danger of exhausting their benefits, and funding for one-stop career centers will be increased. A new initiative will fund grants
to identify skill shortages and target resources to industries struggling tofilljobs.
Finally, a new effort to encourage lifelong learning is taking shape through the
Learning Anytime Anywhere Partnership program. This program supports partnerships among universities and colleges, businesses, community organizations,
and other entities to use technology to address challenges in lifelong learning
and postsecondary education.




Chapter 4 I 163

Conclusion
Two key developments—the growing importance of education and the
expansion of opportunity—transformed the American labor market in the
20th century. Tomorrows workers will need skills andflexibilityto respond
to the opportunities and challenges that technology is making available. As
long as skills command a premium in the labor market, both workers and
firms will have an incentive to invest in education and training. But for any
of a number of reasons, workers and firms might nevertheless underinvest in
their human capital. Therefore government policy has continued—and will
continue—to play a role in the acquisition of skills by the American work
force. It is important, however, not to downplay the roles of other, noninstitutional factors, the most important of which is the family. As the chapter
has noted, much of a persons skill formation occurs before he or she enters
school. This implies that the environment in which a child is raised is very
important for that child's later learning. Chapter 5 discusses the American
family and the challenges it faces.

The Changing American Family

Among the trends that have shaped the American family over the course of the century
one of the most important has been the rise in female participation in the labor force as
more opportunities have opened up for women to work and more women have taken
advantage of those opportunities.

F

or most of the 20th century, the prototypical American family was a married couple with children in which the wife did not work for pay. But for
decades now this traditional one-breadwinner, one-homemaker family has
made up a declining share of families, as more wives have entered the paid
labor force and as single-parent families have become more widespread. At
the beginning of the 21st century, fewer than a third of all families are married couples in which the wife does not work outside the home. This means
that a majority of American families face—and in consequence the Nation
faces—different opportunities and different challenges from those of a society of "traditional" families.
The changes in the American family, viewed over the entire span of the
20th century, have been dramatic (Table 5-1). In 1900, for example, about

80 percent of children lived in two-parent families with a mother or stepmother who worked on the farm or at home. Fewer than 10 percent of
American children lived in one-parent families. The typical home had few of
todays conveniences (only 8 percent of dwelling units had electricity in
1907), and many women sewed their own clothes and gave birth in the
home rather than in a hospital. Women early in the century married
younger, had more children, and died younger than women today. Ten percent of children died in infancy, and average life expectancy for both men
166 I Economic Report of the President




and women was less than 50 years. The average household had close to five
members, and a fifth of all households had seven or more. Job opportunities
for women who did not live on farms were limited as much by custom as by
physical demands: only a fifth of all women worked for pay, and those who
did were mainly single and poor.
The average family today enjoys many advantages that its counterpart of a
century ago did not. As we have seen in earlier chapters, the material standard of living of the average family is much higher now than it was then.
People are more likely not only to live longer but to remain healthy into
retirement as well. It is partly because of these very advances, however, that
families today face a different set of challenges than did families 100 years
ago. In particular, the expansion of opportunities for women to work for pay,
and the greater desire of women to seek such work, have added a new challenge to the perennial one of having adequate resources to meet family
needs. That new challenge is how to balance the material gains from more
hours of paid employment against the desire to reserve time for the responsibilities and enjoyments of family life.
This chapter examines these two challenges. It begins with an overview of
some of the key trends that have created the modern American family: the
rise in female labor force participation, changes in family formation and dissolution, and improvements in health and longevity. It then explores the
emergence of a diverse set of family types, focusing on differences in incomes
and in time spent at work. The remainder of the chapter explores the challenges these different kinds of families face—and their policy implications.
This discussion is organized in two parts. The first discusses the "money
crunch": thefinancialconstraints that still burden many families despite the
remarkable growth in the American standard of living. This problem is more
likely to confront single-mother families and one-earner couples than twoearner couples. The second part discusses the "time crunch": the shortage of
time to devote to family needs that results from the increased participation of
parents, especially mothers, in the paid labor market. This problem affects a
vast number of families, including many for whom the money crunch is less
pressing. The chapter also discusses recent favorable trends in family incomes
and reviews some of the Administration s policies designed to address the
money and time crunches.

Key Trends Shaping the American Family
Among the many trends that have affected the American family over the
course of the century, three have been particularly important. The first is the
rise in female participation in the labor force as more opportunities have




Chapter 5 I 167

opened up for women to work and as more women have taken advantage of
those opportunities. The second is not a single trend but a set of related
changes in how families form and dissolve, which have contributed to the
growing prevalence of single-parent families. The third is improvements in
health and life expectancy that have made care for older relatives—and providing for their own retirement—increasingly important issues for heads of
families today. Many other kinds of households—including people living
alone—are also part of American society and face challenges of their own,
but this chapter focuses primarily on those challenges that affect families
with children.

Female Labor Force Participation
Women have always worked, whether on the family farm, in the home, or
in the paid labor force. What distinguished the 20th century was the
enormous increase in the proportion of women who work for pay. In 1999
about three-fifths of the female population aged 16 and over were in the
labor force (either employed or looking for work). This is three times as high as
the female labor force participation rate in 1900. And the participation
rate of women aged 25-44—those most likely to be balancing work and
child rearing—has risen severalfold, from less than 20 percent in 1900 to
over 75 percent today (Chart 5-1). The participation rate of women in this
age group with children under age 18 has been somewhat lower than the
overall rate but has shown a similar pattern of increase. Over the past 25
years the share of working mothers in this age group who were employed
full-time has been roughly 71 percent.
Many factors have contributed to this growth in women's participation in
the paid labor market, including increases in education and wages for
women, the opening up of more opportunities for women to work, and
changes in family structure. As a result of higher labor force participation
rates and later marriages, a larger proportion of women than ever before
experience a period of independent living and employment before marriage.
This gives them greater attachment to the labor force and increases the
chances that they will continue to work, or return to work, after they marry
and start a family.

Family Formation and Dissolution
Marriage remained a fairly universal experience throughout the 20th century. Among the population 15 years old and over, the proportions of both
men and women who are married are roughly the same today as a century
ago, although lower than in the 1950s and 1960s. Only 6 percent of women
aged 45-64 in 1998 and 12 percent of women aged 35-44 had never been
168 I Economic Report of the President

married. However, one study found that women today are spending a smaller
fraction of their adult lives married than did their counterparts a few decades
ago. A much larger proportion of children are being born to unmarried
mothers. As a result, the share of children living in one-parent families
increased from 9 percent in 1900 to 28 percent in 1998.
Several strands of evidence suggest that people are spending a smaller fraction of their lives married than in 1900. First, people are marrying slightly
later. In 1900 the typical first marriage was between a woman of 22 and a
man of 26; now the typical bride is 3 years older and the groom nearly a year
older. Second, divorce rates are much higher today than at the beginning of
the century. In 1900, among those aged 35-54, widowhood was far more
common than divorce. Over the century, the probability of being a widow in
this age range declined markedly, while the probability of being divorced rose
(Chart 5-2). The divorce rate, which jumped from around 10 per 1,000
married females per year in the mid-1960s to more than 20 per 1,000 in the
mid-1970s, has drifted down slightly since then but remains high. A third
reason why people spend a smaller fraction of their lives married is that life
expectancy is longer today relative to the typical duration of a marriage. The
net result of all these forces is that only 56 percent of the population aged 15
and over are married today, rather than 68 percent as in 1960. Thus it is
probably not surprising that the proportion of children living in singleparent households has risen dramatically.

The increased prevalence of single-parent households is also related to the
rise in out-of-wedlock births. For unmarried females aged 15-44, the number
of births per 1,000 women increased dramatically from 7.1 in 1940 to 46.9
in 1994, but it has since stabilized and begun to decline, reaching 44.3 in
1998 (Chart 5-3). In contrast, this measure of the birth rate among married
women has been dropping since the baby-boom of the 1950s and 1960s,
although it remains nearly twice that of unmarried women. As a result of
these trends, the share of all births that were to unmarried women of all ages
increased eightfold, from 4.0 percent in 1950 to 32.8 percent in 1998,
although this figure has begun to level off in recent years. Some of this
increase reflects lower marriage rates generally, and some reflects the rapid
increase in the late 1980s and early 1990s in out-of-wedlock births, including those to teens. (The Administrations efforts to reduce teen pregnancy are
discussed later in this chapter.)

Life Expectancy and Health
The life expectancy and health of Americans increased dramatically over the
20th century. Major public health initiatives (such as immunization campaigns,
better sewage systems, and education about hygiene) as well as medical advances
(from antibiotics to pacemakers to bone marrow transplants) have led to the virtual eradication of numerous diseases and conditions that once contributed to
high death rates and low life expectancy. For example, technological innova170 I Economic Report of the President

tions, better obstetrical care and nutrition, more widespread access to prenatal
care, and greater use of antibiotics all contributed to tremendous improvements
in the health of mothers and infants. The infant mortality rate dropped by more
than 90 percent over the century, from 99.9 per 1,000 live births in 1915 to 7.2
per 1,000 in 1998. The maternal mortality rate dropped similarly: whereas in
1900 more than 80 women died from pregnancy-related complications for
every 10,000 live births, by 1997 this rate had fallen to less than 1 death for
every 10,000 live births—more than a 98 percent decline. Advances also have
been seen in other areas. Death rates from coronary disease have declined by 51
percent since 1972, improved sanitation has dramatically reduced typhoid and
cholera in the United States, and the widespread use of vaccines has eliminated
smallpox and polio.
These improvements have meant longer life spans for most Americans.
Over the century, the average life span in the United States increased by
30 years, and one study attributes five-sixths of that increase to advances in
public health such as vaccinations and food safety. Life expectancy at birth
for a woman rose from 48.3 years in 1900 to 79.4 years by 1998. For men it
rose over the same period from 46.3 years to 73.9 years. Older Americans
now have longer remaining life expectancies as well. Whereas the average 60year-old white man in 1900 could expect to live almost to age 75, by 1998 a
man of that age could expect to live almost to age 80. Combined with the
recent declines in fertility behavior, these changes in life expectancy have led

trend that will con-

Increasing Diversity Across Families
Income and the time to enjoy it are two key components of economic
well-being. In principle, the strong growth in productivity and the resulting
growth in real wages over the past century, described in Chapter 1, could
have allowed material standards of living to increase while simultaneously
allowing families to work shorter hours. But in fact, the substantial increase
in female labor force participation and the increase in the proportion of
households headed by single females mean that there are more families with
working women, and many women are working more hours. These trends
also mean that there is now a greater diversity in family structure as well as
differences in incomes and hours of work among family types.

Diversity in Family Structure
Traditional one-breadwinner, one-homemaker married couples have been
declining as a share of all families, from 67 percent in 1952 to 27 percent in
1999 (Chart 5-4). Rising female labor force participation has increased the
proportion of all married-couple families in which the wife works, and these

now account for roughly half of all families. Reflecting the trends in marriage
and divorce discussed above, the share of all families headed by a single
householder with no spouse present (predominantly single-parent families)
increased from 13 percent to 23 percent between 1949 and 1999. Although
most children living in single-parent families live with their mothers, the
share of single-parent families headed by fathers has more than doubled since
1975 and stood at 19 percent in 1999. It is estimated that more than a third
of all children do not live with their biological fathers (Box 5-1).

Box 5-1. The Importance of Fathers
Although the proportion of single-parent families headed by the
father is rising, the mother has typically been the custodial parent in
such families. For this reason, and because of the higher incidence of
poverty in female-headed families, the discussion of single-parent
families in this chapter focuses on single mothers. An important issue
for such families is the link between children's well-being and the
absence of the father.
It is ectimated that 36 percent of American children live apart from their
biological fathers; about 40 percent of children in fatherless households
have not seen their fathers in at least a year. Before they reach age 18,
more than half of America's children are likely to have spent a significant
portion of their childhood living apart from their fathers.
Yet there is strong evidence suggesting that the presence of a father
matters:
• Children under age 6 who live apart from their fathers are about
five times as likely to be poor as children with both parents at
home.
• Girls without a father in their life are two and a half times as likely
to get pregnant and 53 percent more likely to commit suicide.
• Boys without a father in their life are 63 percent more likely to run
away and 37 percent more likely to abuse drugs.
• Children without father involvement are twice as likely to drop out
of high school, roughly twice as likely to abuse alcohol or drugs,
twice as likely to end up in jail, and nearly four times as likely to
need help for emotional or behavioral problems than those with
father involvement.
The absence of a father has effects beyond those on his own children:
it can affect communities as well. About 4.5 million children in 1990
resided in predominantly fatherless neighborhoods in which more than
half of all families with children were headed by single mothers.

Chapter 5 I 173

Box 5-1. — continued
Although most fathers can afford to pay child support (an estimated
74 percent of noncustodial fathers have incomes above the poverty
level), about 2.8 million men are "dead-broke," noncustodial fathers,
most of whom do not pay child support. Administration efforts aimed
at helping these fathers to work and support their children are detailed
later in this chapter.

Increasing life expectancy has also changed the structure of the family. For
example, over 70 percent of adults aged 30-54 in the early 1990s had living
relatives who spanned three or more generations, and over 40 percent of
adults aged 50-59 had living family members from four or more generations.
In addition, nearly 2.4 million families now have more than two generations
living under one roof. Longer life expectancy has meant that more grandparents are able to watch their grandchildren grow to adulthood. And younger
generations are facing caregiving responsibilities for older relatives. A 1997
survey estimated, for example, that 22 percent of all U.S. households provide
care for an elderly person.
At the same time, grandparents have also become more important as caregivers—including primary caregivers. Over the last three decades, for example, the share of children under age 18 living in a household headed by a
grandparent has risen by more than 70 percent (Chart 5-5). Most of the
Chart 5-5 Grandchildren in Grandparents' Homes by Presence of Parents
A larger share of children today live in households headed by a grandparent. The proportion of
these children who share the home with neither of their parents has increased since 1990.

increase in this share during the 1990s was from an increase in the share of
children living in households with neither parent present. Between 1980 and
1990, by contrast, the increase came mostly from children living in grandparent-headed households with just a single parent present. The share of such
households with a single father present, although small, continued to grow in
the 1990s.
Consistent with the focus of the chapter, this discussion has emphasized
family types likely to have children present. It is important to recall, however, that American households cover a much wider range of diversity than this
(Box 5-2).

Diversity of Income and Hours of Work
An examination of income growth among families with children by family type reveals important differences among two-earner married couples, oneearner married couples, and families headed by single females. To some
extent these differences represent choices about how many hours to work and
how many to leave free for other things. But they may also reflect underlying
differences in education or other factors that affect earnings opportunities.
Box 5-2. The Diversity of American Households
The Census Bureau defines a family as two or more people related
by birth, marriage, or adoption who reside together. A household, by
contrast, is defined as any person or group of people who occupy a
single housing unit.Thus households include single people and groups
of unrelated people who reside together.
In 1970 the proportion of households fitting the traditional definition
of a family (a husband, a wife, and their children) was 40 percent; by
1998 only 25 percent of households fit that definition. The number of
Americans living in unmarried-partner households is large and growing rapidly. From 1994 to 1998 the number of married-couple households increased by 2 percent, while the number of unmarried-partner
households increased 16 percent. In 1998 about 1.7 million, or 1.6 percent, of households were same-sex partnerships.
The fraction of individuals choosing to live together outside of a formal marriage rose dramatically in the second half of the 20th century.
One study reports that only 3 percent of women born between 1940
and 1944 had lived in a nonmarital cohabitation by age 25, whereas for
women born 20 years later, 37 percent had cohabited by that same
age. In fact, despite lower marriage rates and a later age of first marriage now than several decades ago, evidence indicates that individuals are still forming coresidential relationships at about the same point
in their lives.




Chapter 5 I 175

For the past 50 years, the median income of two-earner couples has been
higher than that of one-earner couples, which in turn has been higher than
that of families headed by a single female (Chart 5-6). Moreover, the gap
between the median income of two-earner couples and that of the other family types has widened, both in absolute dollars and in percentage terms.
Chart 5-6 Median Family Income by Family Structure
The median income of the typical two-earner married couple has exceeded that of other family
types for at least half a century and continued to grow strongly after 1973.

1989

Although many measures of income inequality have stopped rising in recent
years, the real median income of married-couple families where the wife is
not in the paid labor force is less than three-fifths that of married-couple
families where the wife works for pay. Recent increases have brought the real
median income of female-headed families in 1998 above its previous peak in
1979, although that income is only a little more than a third the median for
two-earner couples. To a great extent, of course, these differences reflect factors other than family type. As emphasized below, wives in two-earner couples are likely to have greater earnings opportunities than wives in singleearner couples. And single mothers tend to be younger and less educated
than married mothers, with the result that their earnings are likely to be
lower as well.
Median incomes provide one perspective on differences in income by family type, but they necessarily conceal the extent of income variation within
each family-type grouping. Among families with children, there is considerable overlap between the distributions of income for each family type, par-

ticularly in the lower income ranges (Chart 5-7). The distribution of femaleheaded families with children, however, is more concentrated in the lower
income range.

The income differences across families shown in Chart 5-7 are due largely to
differences in earned income from employment, not differences in wealth or
transfer payments (such as welfare payments). In 1998, wage and salary earnings
represented 87 percent of income for the average married-couple family with
children and 69 percent for the average female-headed family with children.
Differences in hours worked are a major factor accounting for differences
in income across family types. Not surprisingly, dual-earner couples devote
more total hours to work than the other family types, on average, and have
the highest concentration of families in the portion of the distribution with
the most hours worked (Chart 5-8). Among single-earner family types, husbands in single-earner couples work more hours on average than single
mothers.

The Rising Earnings of Women with Children
The typical mother today now contributes significantly more earnings to
family money income than did her counterpart several decades ago. The
median earnings of single mothers with children rose from $4,800 to
$12,000 (in 1998 dollars) between 1968 and 1998, and among working sin-

gle mothers the median rose from $11,300 to $15,000. The median earnings
of all wives with children rose from zero (more than half had no earnings) to
$10,400 during this same time period, and from $7,600 to $18,000 for
working mothers. As a result, married working mothers' earnings today represent 30 percent of the couples combined earnings, compared with only 15
percent in 1968. In addition to raising average family income, mothers' earnings have dramatically increased the proportion of families who are well off.
The share of working wives earning more than $20,000 rose from 14 percent
to 43 percent between 1968 and 1998, and the share of single working
mothers earning above $20,000 rose a smaller (although still sizable)
amount, from 21 percent to 37 percent. Among married couples, wives'
earnings have had a big effect in increasing the proportion of wealthy families: in 1998 only 18 percent of all men earned more than $60,000, but
when wives' earnings are included, 37 percent of all married couples with
children had combined earnings above $60,000. In contrast, among families
headed by single women, only 2 percent had earnings above $60,000.
Thus, although most women now contribute to family income, there are
pronounced differences across different types of families. These differences in
mothers' contributions can be traced to differences both in wages and in
hours of work.
As discussed in Chapter 4, women's wages have risen over time, in part
because of rising skill levels. But single mothers have experienced slower wage
178 I Economic Report of the President




gains and have considerably lower wage rates, on average, than married mothers
who work. The lower wages of single mothers are related in large measure to
their lower average educational attainment than married mothers who work.
Across all family types, about one-third of mothers have a high school diploma
but no college. However, single mothers and wives who are not working are
much less likely than working wives to have graduated from high school,
although as a group each has made substantial strides in raising their educational
attainment over the past three decades (Table 5-2). Furthermore, a smaller share
of single mothers than of married mothers who work have at least some college,

although the increase in the single mothers' share since the late 1960s has been
large. In contrast, employed wives have strikingly higher levels of education than
all others, so that a portion of the stronger growth in median incomes for these
families shown in Chart 5-6 is due to their higher and rising educational attainment, which feeds into their higher wage rates.
The rising incomes of mothers are also a function of their rising hours of
work, and here, too, single mothers differ from married mothers on average.
Thirty years ago single mothers worked longer hours than married mothers,
and thus their hours have risen less over time. For example, the share of single mothers working full-time rose 11 percentage points, to 67 percent,
between 1968 and 1998, whereas the share of married mothers working fulltime rose 18 percentage points, to 52 percent. The increase in full-time work
arose almost entirely from women entering the labor force in greater numbers, not from a switch from part-time to full-time work: between 1968 and
1998 the proportion of single mothers who worked rose from 69 percent to
82 percent (Table 5-3); that of married mothers increased from 51 percent to

75 percent. (The proportion of married mothers working part-time increased
substantially less, from 17 percent in 1968 to 23 percent in 1998.) Married
mothers have dramatically increased their hours of work, but they continue
to work somewhat less than single mothers.
A portion of the higher average earnings growth for married mothers relative to single mothers arises from the positive correlation between education
and hours of work: well-educated women work longer hours. Well-educated
women have also increased their hours of work the most over time. From
1968 to 1998, the proportion of mothers with less than a high school
education who worked increased from 52 percent to 57 percent. For
mothers with at least some college, in contrast, the proportion increased
from 55 percent to 82 percent. Several factors shape the decision to work for
pay. On the one hand, the potential to earn a high wage makes work attractive, and thus the well-educated should have greater incentive to work. On
the other hand, higher earnings and higher husbands' incomes tend to lessen
the need to work long hours—this "income effect" provides an incentive for
women to consume more leisure or home time with their children. Highly
educated women tend to be married to high-income men, and thus the husband s higher income induces the family to place a greater value on the wife's
home time relative to paid employment. Over time, however, the effect of
husbands' incomes on wives' hours of work has declined. Thus, highly educated women with children have increased their employment rate the most
over time, and today they have the highest rate among women with children.
The outcome is that highly educated women, working many hours and earning high wages, have contributed very significandy to the number of families

180 I Economic Report of the President




in the upper tail of the income distribution. For these families, incomes are
high, but so, too, are hours of work (Box 5-3).
In sum, the growth of female hours of work and female earnings has had
different effects on different family types. For married mothers, strong
growth in wages and hours worked have been a primary source of family
Box 5-3. Women Professionals, the Rat Race, and
the Time Crunch
As shown inTable 4-1, the proportion of women in many professional occupations has risen dramatically since 1950. As recently as 1979
only 10 percent of doctors and 13 percent of attorneys were women,
but by 1999 these percentages had increased to 25 percent and 29
percent, respectively. The female share of enrollment in professional
schools has been rising and exceeded 40 percent in 1996.To the extent
that female professionals who are married have husbands who work
full time, this growing professionalization of the female work force has
created a time strain for many American families. There is little evidence that human resource systems originally designed for men with
stay-at-home wives have adapted to ease this strain by offering jobs
with shorter working hours. On the contrary, work hours among college-educated employees have been trending upward over the last
several decades.
One of the reasons for some firms' reluctance to abandon existing
work norms is their use of "rat race" work practices. In many professional settings, members of the professional group benefit from the
productivity of other group members, yet these contributions to productivity are difficult to measure and reward directly. Firms instead find
that a worker's willingness to work long hours often serves as a proxy
for valuable yet hard-to-observe characteristics such as commitment
and ambition. In response to this use of work hours as a screening
device, workers will tend to overwork as a means of signaling to management their ability and willingness to contribute.
For example, in a survey conducted at two large Northeastern law
firms, associates (young attorneys) and partners alike were in agreement that "billable hours" and especially "willingness to work long
hours when required" were important factors in promotion to partner.
Not surprisingly, associates at these firms worked long hours. Also not
surprisingly, associates felt overworked: most indicated that they
would gladly forgo their next raise in exchange for the opportunity to
work fewer hours. Nonetheless, most associates indicated that they
would be much more willing to work fewer hours if all other associates
also agreed to cut back. Of course, firms might be reluctant to abandon
these work practices unless they can develop other effective means of
screening junior employees.




Chapter 5 I 181

income growth over the last 30 years, even though married women's earnings
on average still account for less than a third of the couple s earnings. The
wages of female family heads have not grown as rapidly over time, so that,
despite working many hours, their earnings lag behind those of married
women.

Challenges Families Face
Over the century just ended, the American family experienced many
positive changes that have resulted in richer lives for many parents and their
children. Family income has increased dramatically and poverty has
decreased. People live longer and are much healthier. Over the past few years,
the gains from a strong labor market have been shared widely and fairly
equally. Other favorable recent developments include a fall in teen pregnancy and out-of-wedlock birth rates and a stabilization of divorce rates. Despite
this general prosperity, however, family income inequality remains high, and
many families are experiencing a "money crunch" that makes it difficult to
meet basic family needs. Many of these families have incomes that fall below
the poverty threshold, but the perception of a "money crunch" is by no
means limited to families officially classified as poor.
Perhaps an even greater number of families today are experiencing a "time
crunch." With more women working more hours, the amount of family time
devoted to work has increased, while that available for leisure and other family activities has declined. This time crunch affects a wide range of families
from poor single mothers to prosperous two-earner couples.
This section explores the challenges facing American families as they deal
with the money crunch and the time crunch. In each case, an analysis of the
dimensions of the challenge and how it affects different kinds of families is
followed by a discussion of policies that address that challenge.

The "Money Crunch"
Despite the increases in female labor supply and earnings discussed above,
a large number of families with children—both married and female-headed—belong to what are sometimes called the working poor. Those families
with incomes in the lower tail of the distribution in Chart 5-7 are the most
likely to suffer from the money crunch. Based on the distributions in the
chart, in 1998, 8 percent of families with working wives, 27 percent of families without working wives, and 64 percent of female-headed families had
incomes below $25,000 (about 1.5 times the poverty line for a family of

182 I Economic Report of the President




four). These families, whose incomes have lagged behind the general
advance, are at the epicenter of the money crunch.
Families headed by single females tend to have fewer financial resources
than other families, and the number of children living in such families has
grown substantially. Whereas families headed by single females made up only
10 percent of all families with children in 1970, in 1998 that figure was 22
percent. In 1970, just 11 percent of all American children under 18 years of
age lived in such families; in 1998, 23 percent did. About half of all African
American children under age 18 live in single-mother households, up from
30 percent in 1970. The fraction of white children living in single-mother
households rose from 8 percent in 1970 to 18 percent in 1998. And as discussed earlier, the percentage of children living with grandparents has also
been increasing in recent decades.
Divorce and out-of-wedlock childbirth are two events that contribute
directly to lower incomes for female-headed families. It is estimated that 22
percent of women who get divorced experience a 50 percent or more decline
in family income. Also, never-married mothers are much less likely to have a
child support award than divorced mothers (44.1 percent versus 75.6 percent
in 1995), and for those who have received child support payments, the annual amount received by never-married mothers is much less than that received
by divorced mothers ($2,271 versus $3,990 in 1995).
Reflecting these low income levels, poverty rates for families headed by
single females with children under age 18 are very high: 38.7 percent of
these families were poor in 1998, compared with 6.9 percent of marriedcouple families with children. Although the job is not finished, this
Administration has championed policies to increase the rewards from work
and reduce poverty, including the expansion of the earned income tax
credit, welfare reform, and the creation of the State Children's Health
Insurance Program. These policies have contributed to improving living
standards for lower income families, and the overall poverty rate has
dropped from 15.1 percent in 1993 to 12.7 percent in 1998. These official
poverty rates are based on a definition of income that does not include the
earned income tax credit, Medicaid, food stamps, or other noncash
benefits. An experimental poverty measure incorporating improvements
proposed in a 1995 report by the National Academy of Sciences (a measure
that does include the earned income tax credit and noncash benefits)
shows an even larger drop.
Adequate income is certainly essential for families to develop a sense of
economic well-being, but that sense of well-being may also be influenced by
whether the family can meet what it perceives to be its consumption needs. As
technological change has lowered the relative cost of food andfreedup income
for other expenditures over the course of the century, incomes have risen and




Chapter 5 I 183

consumption patterns have changed, resulting perhaps in a perception of
increased consumption needs. In 1950 about 30 percent of a typical family's
expenditures were for food, and about 10 percent were for clothing. By 1997
those percentages had fallen to 14 percent and 5 percent, respectively. But
other expenses have taken up the slack. The typical family now spends a
greater share of its income on housing than in the past, and entirely new
forms of consumption have become standard. Today, about 90 percent of
households have automobiles, up from 59 percent in 1950, and the typical
family has two motor vehicles and two television sets. Consumers have had
the discretionary income to buy such goods as CD players, videocassette
recorders, and personal computers. It is estimated that, in 1997, 35 percent
of households owned a personal computer, 61 percent had a cordless phone,
and 88 percent had a video recorder. Some of these goods that might once
have been thought luxuries have become increasingly difficult for a family to
do without. For example, to the extent that newly created jobs are in the
suburbs rather than the inner cities, a car becomes a near necessity. And
children who lack access to a computer at home may suffer an increasing
educational disadvantage compared with their peers who have computers.
Meanwhile the same health and demographic trends that have increased
longevity also confront many more families with the need to care for their
elderly relatives. Although the elderly at any particular age are healthier
today than in the past, they are likely to require more care over more years, in
part because they are living longer and because medical advances can keep
the very ill alive longer than before. This care often becomes the responsibility of their adult offspring.
Consumption of formal and informal care by the elderly has increased
substantially. From 1987 to 1996 the number of nursing homes increased 20
percent, and the use of home and community-based care is growing rapidly.
The population receiving such care is becoming older and increasingly frail.
The proportion of nursing home residents over age 85 increased from 44
percent in 1987 to 49 percent in 1996, and that of residents with limitations
in three or more standard activities of daily living (a common measure of
frailty) rose from 72 percent to 83 percent over that period. The average cost
of a nursing home is now more than $40,000 per year, and for those
admitted to a nursing home at age 65 or older, the average length of stay is
29 months for women and 23 months for men. Nearly 50 percent of the
costs of long-term care are paid out of pocket by nursing home patients and
their families, and Medicaid bears most of the remaining costs. The implications for family time of increased care for elderly relatives are discussed in the
next section.

184 I Economic Report of the President




Thus, as the typical market basket affordable by most families changes, it
may be appropriate in characterizing the money crunch to expand our
notion of family needs beyond such traditional, basic purchases as food and
clothing to the acquisition of certain standard consumption goods like automobiles and telephones. The crunch is even tighter when the rising costs of
educating children and caring for elderly parents is factored in.
Finally, the changing trends in the labor force participation of family
members have given rise to increasing costs of working outside the home,
such as child care, additional work expenses (for meals in restaurants, dry
cleaning services, and so on), and transportation costs. It is estimated, for
example, that just from 1986 to 1993 direct expenditure on child care rose
23 percent, after adjusting for inflation, for families with a preschool-age
child and a working mother.

Boosting the Financial Resources of Families to Lessen
the Money Crunch
Since 1993, families in each fifth of the income distribution have experienced solid and roughly equal percentage gains in income. In part this balance reflects the strong overall performance of the economy, but it also
reflects a number of specific policies to make work pay for lower income
working families facing a money crunch.

Expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit
In 1993 the President signed into law a major expansion of the Earned
Income Tax Credit (EITC), a refundable credit that is designed to reduce the
overall tax burden of low-income workers. Because it is refundable, workers
can receive the full credit to which they are entitled even if it exceeds the
income tax they owe, and people generally receive the credit as part of their
income tax refund. The EITC is not currently included in the definition of
money income used to compute the official poverty rate. However, calculations based on an alternative income concept that does include the EITC
show that the credit lifted more than 4.3 million Americans out of poverty in
1998—more than double the number in 1993. The EITC lifted more than
2.3 million children out of poverty in 1998. And over 40 percent of the
decline in child poverty (computed using the alternative income concept)
between 1993 and 1998 can be explained by progressive tax relief, especially
the EITC. The President has proposed a major expansion of the EITC in his
fiscal 2001 budget, to make the credit even more effective in rewarding work
for families.




Chapter 5 I 185

Increases in the Minimum Wage
The minimum wage was increased in two steps in 1996 and 1997 from
$4.25 per hour to $5.15 per hour, boosting the wages of 10 million workers.
The combined effects of the minimum wage and the EITC have dramatically increased the returns to work for families with children. For example,
between 1993 and 1998, families with two children and one wage earner
who worked full-time at the minimum wage experienced a 26 percent
($2,700) increase in their real income as a result of these two policies alone.
Research examining the impact of minimum wage increases has shown that
about two-thirds of workers affected by earlier minimum wage increases were
adults—predominantly women and minorities—and that about one-third of
the increase went to families in the lowest tenth of the family earnings
distribution. Thus minimum wage increases can help reduce poverty among
low-wage workers. Given recent tight labor markets, job opportunities are
plentiful, and American families are benefiting from the higher minimum
wage.

Welfare Reform
The welfare reform law signed by the President in 1996 dramatically
changed the Nation s welfare system into one that requires work in exchange
for time-limited assistance. The law contains strong work requirements,
comprehensive enforcement of child support awards, and support for families moving from welfare to work. To assist people making this move and to
support low-income working families, the Administration has addressed a
range of logistical andfinancialchallenges typically faced by such families.
Welfare-to-work grants help move long-term welfare recipients (mainly
mothers) and certain noncustodial parents (mainly fathers) in poor areas into
unsubsidized jobs, enabling them to work and support their families. Recent
efforts have extended these services to a broader group of low-income noncustodial fathers, many of whom may have been wanting to contribute to the
support of their children but lacked the means to do so. To encourage hiring
and retention of long-term welfare recipients, employers are eligible for the
welfare-to-work tax credit equal to 35 percent of the first $10,000 in wages
in the first year of employment, and 50 percent in the second year.
New housing vouchers that subsidize the rents of low-income Americans
are helping families move closer to new jobs, reduce a long commute, or
secure more stable housing; new transportation grants are helping communities and States developflexibletransportation alternatives for welfare recipients and other low-income workers. New policy guidance allows States to
use the more generous welfare rather than food stamp asset tests in
determining food stamp eligibility for those on welfare, making it easier for
low-income working families to own a car and still receive food stamps.
186 I Economic Report of the President




The 1996 welfare reform law invested an additional $4 billion over 6 years
to provide more child care assistance for families moving from welfare to
work and for other low-income parents. (Child care assistance is discussed
further below.) The new State Children's Health Insurance Program provides
funds to help States expand health care coverage of uninsured children, and
new Medicaid rules allow States to expand Medicaid to cover more lowincome families who work, including more two-parent families.
Finally, Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) empower low-income
families to save for a first home, to enroll in postsecondary education, or to
start a new business.
As a result of welfare reform and the strong economy, by June 1999 the
number of welfare recipients nationwide had fallen to 6.9 million, 51 percent
less than in 1993. That number represents 2.5 percent of the total population, the lowest proportion since 1967. All 50 States met the overall work
participation requirements of the welfare reform legislation. Twenty-seven
States were awarded bonus funds for their superior results in reforming
welfare. Reports by the 46 States competing for the bonus indicate that more
than 1.3 million welfare recipients nationwide went to work in the
12-month period from October 1997 through September 1998. Retention
rates are also promising: 80 percent of those who got jobs were still working
3 months later. States reported an average earnings increase of 23 percent for
former welfare recipients, from $2,088 in the first quarter of employment to
$2,571 in the third quarter. Among those remaining on welfare, the
proportion working has nearly quadrupled, from 7 percent in 1992 to
27 percent in 1998.
At least one independent study confirms these conclusions, finding that
almost 70 percent of welfare leavers said they went off welfare because of
increased earnings or a new job. When women move to paying jobs, they
develop the skills needed to produce higher sustainable incomes over their
lifetimes and to reduce the intergenerational cycle of dependency. In addition, the Administrations initiative to reduce teen pregnancy (Box 5-4) plays
a role in breaking the cycle of dependency and increasing the well-being of
families by reducing the number of children born to teen mothers.

Social Security and Medicare
Social Security is a key source of income for most recipients: in 1996 it was
the main source of income for 66 percent of beneficiaries; it represented at
least 90 percent of income for 30 percent of beneficiaries; it was the sole
source of income for 18 percent. Social Security benefits provide 81 percent
of total income for those in the lowest fifth of the income distribution of the
elderly, and they are the largest single source of income for all but the




Chapter 5 I 187

Box 5-4. The National Strategy to Reduce Teen Pregnancy
From 1980 to 1991 the overall birth rate to teens aged 15-19 rose from
53.0 to 62.1 per 1,000. Since then, however, this trend has been improving. Nationwide, this rate declined by 18 percent from 1991 to 1998, and
teen birth rates have fallen in every State and across ethnic and racial
groups. For a subset of this group, girls aged 15-17, the 1998 birth rate
was at its lowest on record. In addition, teen pregnancy rates are at their
lowest since 1976, the earliest year for which data on this group are available. Yet despite these recent improvements, teen pregnancy remains a
problem, since the financial resources and opportunities of unwed teens
and their children are significantly less than those of other families.
Each year more than 900,000 pregnancies occur among American
teenagers. A collection of studies on teen parenthood found that roughly four-fifths of teen mothers end up on welfare. The children of adolescent mothers were found to have poorer health outcomes and were 50
percent more likely to be of low birthweight. In addition, the sons of adolescent mothers were found to be 2.7 times as likely to be incarcerated
as the sons of mothers who delayed pregnancy, and the daughters of
adolescent mothers were one-third more likely to become teen mothers
themselves.
On January 4,1997, the President announced a comprehensive national strategy to reduce teen pregnancy in this country. The new initiative,
led by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), responded
to a call from the President and the Congress for a national strategy to
prevent out-of-wedlock teen pregnancies. It also responded to a directive, under the welfare reform act, to ensure that at least 25 percent of
communities in this country have teen pregnancy prevention programs
in place. Key efforts under this initiative include the following:
• Implementing New Efforts Under Welfare Reform. Under the welfare
reform law signed by the President on August 22, 1996, unmarried
minor parents are required to stay in school and live at home, or in
an adult-supervised setting, in order to receive assistance. The law
encourages the creation of Second Chance Homes, supportive and
supervised living arrangements that provide teen parents with the
skills they need to become good role models and providers for their
children, giving them guidance in parenting and in avoiding repeat
pregnancies.
• Supporting Promising Approaches and Building Partnerships. The
Administration continues to support innovative teen pregnancy prevention strategies tailored to the unique needs of communities.
HHS-funded programs supporting teen pregnancy prevention have
been established in about 34 percent of the 4,752 Census-defined
communities in the United States. In addition, HHS has built partcontinued on next page...

188 I Economic Report of the President




Box 5-4. — continued
nershlps aimed at reducing teen pregnancies with national, State,
and local organizations.
• Disseminating Information on Innovative and Effective Practices.
On October 25, 1999, the Secretary of Health and Human Services
unveiled a comprehensive guide, developed in partnership with the
National Campaign to Reduce Teen Pregnancy, to help communities
and nonprofit organizations establish successful local teen pregnancy prevention programs.
• Improving Data Collection, Research, and Evaluation. The national
strategy is working to improve data collection, research, and evaluation to further understand the magnitude, trends, and causes of
teen pregnancies and births. Efforts are also under way to develop
targeted teen pregnancy prevention strategies and to assess how
well these strategies work.
• Sending a Strong Abstinence Message. The welfare law also
provides $50 million a year for 5 years in new funding for State
abstinence education programs.

highest fifth. Although only 9 percent of aged beneficiaries are poor, an additional 41 percent would be poor based on their non-Social Security income.
Recognizing the importance of Social Security to the elderly, the President
has proposed using the benefits of fiscal discipline and debt reduction to
strengthen Social Security, extending its solvency from 2034 to at least 2050.
Medicare is the main source of health insurance for the elderly and people
with disabilities, insuring nearly 40 million Americans. The elderly population is projected to double in the next 30 years as the baby-boom generation
retires. At the same time the ratio of elderly persons to workers who pay payroll taxes that help fund Medicare will increase. In addition, some Medicare
payments systems and benefits are outdated. On June 29, 1999, the President unveiled his plan to modernize and strengthen the Medicare program to
prepare it for the health, demographic, and financing challenges it will face in
the 21st century. The plan proposes to make Medicare more competitive and
efficient; to modernize and reform Medicare benefits, including adding a
prescription drug benefit; and to make a long-term financing commitment
to the program, and in doing so extend the solvency of the Medicare trust
fund until at least 2025.

Assistance with Long-Term Care
Millions of adults and a growing number of children have long-term care
needs arising from a health condition present at birth or from a chronic illness developed later in life. Moreover, with the number of Americans aged 65




Chapter 5 I 189

or older, and of those 85 or older, both projected to double by 2030, longterm care is a need that will become more pressing in the 21st century.
The fiscal 2001 budget contains, as the centerpiece of the President's
long-term care initiative, a $3,000 tax credit for people with long-term care
needs or their caregivers. The President s initiative contains several features in
addition to the credit. It would provide funding for services that support
family caregivers of older persons; improve equity in Medicaid eligibility for
people in home- and community-based settings; encourage partnerships
between low-income housing for the elderly and Medicaid; and encourage
the purchase of good-quality private long-term care insurance by Federal
employees. This initiative complements the Administration's effort to
improve the quality of care in nursing homes.

Other Policies to Help Families
Millions of families with children have benefited from the $500-per-child
tax credit enacted in 1997, and the 2001 budget includes additional tax relief
measures, including expansion of the child and dependent care tax credit.
The 2001 budget also addresses another financial concern of American families—access to affordable health care coverage—by proposing a 10-year,
$110 billion investment in expanding health insurance coverage.
Tougher enforcement of child support has helped ease the economic burden on single mothers and stresses the responsibility of both parents for the
economic support of their children. In 1998, Federal and State child support
enforcement efforts collected an estimated $14.3 billion from noncustodial
parents, a nearly 80 percent increase since 1992. In 1998, 4.5 million families received child support, an increase of 59 percent since 1992. Finally, a
primary means of reducing the money crunch is to provide more individuals
with the skills and education they need to raise their incomes. The Administration has therefore placed great emphasis on policies to invest in skills, as
discussed in Chapter 4.

The Time Crunch
The historic entry of millions of women into the labor force has resulted in
higher incomes for families and a new sense of career satisfaction for many
women. But it has also resulted in a significant jump in the total hours that
parents spend at work. Around 4,000 hours per year total, or 2,000 hours for
each parent, is common for families where both parents work full-time.
Those families who work that many hours or more—that is, the upper tail of
the hours distribution in Chart 5-8—are most likely to suffer from the time
crunch. The share of married couples in which both spouses work full-time
rose from 32 percent to 48 percent between 1968 and 1998. As the sole
support of their children, single parents working long hours also are likely to
190 I Economic Report of the President




suffer from a time crunch; the share of these parents working full-time rose
from 56 percent to 67 percent from 1968 to 1998.
Thus, although the choice to enter the labor market results in more
material goods for families, these benefits come at the expense of home time.
Evidence that families are feeling a time crunch comes from a 1995 national
survey that asked whether respondents "always feel rushed, even to do the
things you have to do." Thirty-three percent said yes, compared with 24 percent in 1965. The analysis of changes in parents' allocation of time in this
section provides a closer look at how patterns of family care have changed as
women have entered the labor force.

Time Use and Child Care
As women spend more time in paid employment and a larger share of
families are headed by single parents, families have less time to devote to
unpaid activities, including time with children. Between 1969 and 1999, for
example, the total amount of parental time available outside of work fell in
both married-couple and single-parent families (Chart 5-9). This conclusion
comes from analyzing the trend in time reported in the Current Population
Survey (CPS) as spent at work. To construct the time available on a daily
basis, the analysis starts with 48 hours per day for married couples and 24
hours for single parents. It then subtracts the average daily amount of time
spent at work plus 8 hours per parent per day for sleep. Because the proportion

of single-parent families increased over this period, the average amount of
family time available outside of work fell overall by even more than it did for
either family type. Note that this analysis is only about time potentially available to spend with children, because the CPS does not contain information
about how parents actually spend time outside of work.
The best source of information on time use comes from an analysis of timeuse diary surveys conducted from 1965 to 1995. These surveys ask individuals
to keep a daily record of how they spend their time during a designated day.
Although rich in detail, these surveys cover a fairly small number of individuals
and thus cannot be used to examine trends for subgroups of the population. To
build a more comprehensive data base, the 2001 budget includes funding for
the Bureau of Labor Statistics to start regular collection of time-use diaries from
a probability sample large enough to provide data on subgroups.
Existing time-use diaries show that employed women spend about one-third
less time on child care and household tasks than do women who are not in paid
employment. The primary change in time use for women is that their increase
in paid hours has been nearly equally offset by a reduction in time devoted to
housework. Although men have increased their time spent on housework by
about 5 hours per week, this is far less than the 11-hour-per-week reduction by
women. (The study does not, however, report separate data for those who are
parents.) Nevertheless, despite the assistance of husbands and despite the use of
purchased inputs into home care, employed women in the aggregate still have a
third less free time today than nonworking women.
The data display a 32 percent reduction in women's time spent on child care
and household tasks between 1965 and 1995. This decline is mainly driven by
reductions in housework activities. However, data from 1985 (the most recent
year for which a detailed breakdown is available) indicate that working mothers
spend 5 fewer hours per week on child care activities than do nonworking
mothers (6.7 hours versus 12 hours). This suggests that the increase in the
proportion of mothers working has played a role as well. Meanwhile men's time
spent on child care has been constant at roughly 3 hours per week.
Undoubtedly the time crunch is worse for single-parent families (although,
again, existing time-use evidence does not isolate data for this group). These
families typically have lower incomes and thus are less able to purchase substitutes for their time in the home, such as home-based child care, cleaning
services, or labor-saving products and appliances for the home. They also
lack the assistance that a spouse provides. They may instead rely more on care
provided by older relatives.
As a result of improvements in health and longevity, grandparents are
increasingly a resource that parents—whether single or married—can draw
on for help with child care. In a survey of grandparents caring for their
grandchildren in a noncustodial relationship, over 60 percent cited the

192 I Economic Report of the President




employment of the grandchild's parents, the desire to help the grandchild's
parents financially, or both as reasons for providing care. In addition, in a
sample of working mothers aged 19-26 with a youngest child under 5, nearly 25 percent utilized a grandmother as the principal caregiver. As discussed
in the next section, however, responsibilities for taking care of older relatives
may compound the time crunch for many families.

Time Use and Parental Care
In 1997, more than 5 percent of households spent over 20 hours a week in
caregiving for the elderly. And since nearly two-thirds of family caregivers are
working, the need to balance work and family will likely increase in the 21st
century. Caregivers of the elderly who are also in the paid labor force report
making adjustments to work schedules and forgoing promotions, new
assignments, transfers, relocations, and training opportunities. One recent
study estimates that, by 2002, 42 percent of workers will provide some form
of elder care.
Most of the discussion in this chapter has focused on the time and money
costs of raising children and the stresses that these costs impose on families.
Layered on top of this is the generational crunch: the need to stretch
resources further when families have multiple caregiving responsibilities to
consider as they try to maintain a delicate balance between work and family.
With parents living longer, and with their daughters—the traditional
providers of their care—now largely in the paid labor force, the costs of
parental care are likely to become even greater in the 21st century. However,
Social Security and other retirement benefits, as well as the availability of
assisted living facilities, also permit more elderly people to live independently for longer.
The last 10 years have witnessed an explosion of care for the elderly outside of
nursing homes, and this care is largely provided by women. From 1987 to 1997
the number of U.S. households that provided unpaid care to elderly adults more
than tripled, from 7 million to more than 21 million, or from 8 percent to 22
percent of households. To the extent that more elderly adults are living on their
own, much of this care will likely take place in the parents home. The typical
caregiver is a married woman with only a high school diploma and a household
income of about $35,000, and the typical care recipient is most likely her
mother, grandmother, or mother-in-law. However, even as more households are
providing in-home care, they appear to be spending somewhat less time on that
care. Today a typical caregiver spends fewer hours per week giving care. In
addition, the caregiver is less likely to be residing with the recipient, and is more
likely to use paid services than caregivers a decade ago.
The explosion in caregiving responsibility for parents is contributing to the
time crunch that the American family is facing: 43 percent of surveyed




Chapter 5 I 193

caregivers for the elderly say their caregiving has left them with less time for
other family members. These changes surely arise in part because todays
average caregiver is balancing work and family: half of all caregivers are working full-time outside the home. Among employed caregivers, one-fifth had to
give up work at least temporarily, and half reported making changes to work
schedules to accommodate caregiving. Surveys of caregivers underestimate
the demand for parental care, however, because they cannot measure the frequency with which employed potential caregivers choose not to provide care.
In the future, the time and money commitments associated with parental
care may become even more confining, given the trends identified above.
The increase in the labor supply of women has been accompanied by an
increase in their wages and thus the opportunity cost of their time. As
employed women age and as their parents require more care, those higher
wages may make these women increasingly reluctant to curtail their paid
employment—thus they will face an even greater time crunch as they care for
their parents. To the extent that these women have had children later in life,
they may also experience the double generational crunch of caring for both
children and parents simultaneously. And among those women whose children are already adults, many will have grandchildren to care for. During the
21st century, the increasing cost of elderly care will also fall on fewer children, because of the drop in fertility rates of the baby-boom generation and
the rising population of the elderly relative to the working-age population.
This looming increase in the time crunch may result in more substitution
toward formal care, as the greater wealth of the baby-boom generation and
their children may make such care more affordable. However, if the cost of
that care rises relative to prices generally, these same baby-boomers are likely
to experience a tightening money crunch as well.

Increasing the Flexibility of Paid Work to Lessen the
Time Crunch
With a record high share of the population employed, many workers find
themselves struggling to balance work and family. Women have less flexibility to respond to family needs than they once did, and men are increasingly
being called on to take a greater role in child care and other responsibilities.
Recognizing these changes, the Administration has supported a number of
policies to increase flexibility at work and help families address the time
crunch.

The Family and Medical Leave Act
The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 requires employers
with 50 employees or more to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-

194 I Economic Report of the President




protected leave a year to eligible employees under certain defined circumstances.
These include the need to care for a newborn, newly adopted, or foster child; for
a child, spouse, or parent with a serious health condition; or for a serious health
condition of the employee himself or herself, including maternity-related disability. The FMLA also requires employers to continue the employees health
benefits during leave. Employees are eligible to take such leave if they have
worked for a covered employer for at least 1 year and have worked for at least
1,250 hours over the previous 12 months. Since 1993, millions of workers have
taken advantage of the FMLA to spend necessary time with their families.
The experiences of both employers and employees with the FMLA were
documented in national surveys sponsored by the Department of Labor. The
employer survey found that one-third of employers (and two-thirds of
employers in larger worksites) believed that the FMLA had had positive
effects on their employees' ability to care for family members. Most employers also reported that compliance costs were small or negligible and that there
was no noticeable effect on either business or employee performance. The
employee survey found that the majority of those who took family or medical leave found it relatively easy to arrange; few reported concerns about jobrelated consequences of taking leave. This survey also found that employees
with annual family incomes between $20,000 and $30,000 were more likely
to take leave than employees with higher incomes, highlighting the importance of the FMLA to lower income workers.
Today, 92 million workers are covered by the FMLA. It has proved to be a
significant advance in helping a larger cross section of working Americans
meet their medical and family caregiving needs for children and for elderly
parents while maintaining their jobs and their economic security.
The President has proposed expanding the FMLA to cover businesses with
more than 25 employees (currently the threshold is 50 employees). This
would extend coverage to almost 12 million more workers. He has also
proposed requiring employers to allow FMLA-covered workers to take up to
24 hours of leave per year to attend parent-teacher conferences or routine
doctors' appointments.

Work Arrangements That Promote Flexibility
The desire for greater job flexibility is also leading to new work arrangements between workers and their employers regarding when and where paid
work is performed. An increasingly popular work arrangement is "flextime,"
which allows workers to vary the time they begin and end work. In 1997, 28
percent of full-time wage and salary workers had flexible work schedules.
This was up sharply from 15 percent in 1991. The Federal Government has
led by example in instituting flextime, allowing employees greater discretion
in when they work. The President has also proposed a flextime initiative that




Chapter 5 I 195

would allow all workers who get time-and-a-half pay for working overtime to
be compensated in the form of time off for family and medical leave purposes
or vacation instead of in cash.
Another approach to allowing greaterflexibilityon the job is working at
home for pay. This arrangement is used by a small but growing share of
workers. In 1997, for example, 3.3 percent of all wage and salary workers
were working at home for pay, up from 1.9 percent in 1991. Another way
parents share child care is by working different shifts. In order for shift work
to make it easier to combine paid work and child care, however, the choice of
shifts must be the worker's. In 1997, 83 percent of full-time wage and salary
workers were on regular daytime schedules, 4.6 percent were on evening
shifts, 3.9 percent were on employer-arranged irregular schedules, 3.5
percent were on night shifts, and 2.9 percent were on rotating shifts.

Improving Access to High-Quality, Affordable Child Care
Many parents are likely to adjust to an increase in their paid work time by
increasing their use of nonparental child care providers. The availability, cost,
and quality of child care are crucial to the well-being of children and to the
ability of parents to balance the needs of work and family. Primary child care
arrangements for preschool-age children of employed mothers in the fall of
1994 were divided roughly equally among care in the child's home (by a relative or nonrelative), care in another home (by a relative or nonrelative), and
care in an organized child care facility. Since 1985 the trends have been
toward a slight increase in the proportion of children receiving care in their
own homes, relatively fewer children receiving care in another home, and
relatively more children receiving care in an organized facility.
The Administration has consistently emphasized the importance of child
care availability, affordability, and quality. Since 1993, child care funding for
low-income families has more than doubled. The budget for fiscal 2001
supports a $3.3 billion increase in resources for child care, including more
funding for programs benefiting poor and near-poor children and an
expansion of the child and dependent care tax credit. The proposal would
gradually make the credit refundable, so that it would be available to lowincome working families for the first time. And it would increase the amount
of the credit for middle-income families struggling to afford child care. As
discussed in Chapter 4, funding for Head Start has likewise increased substantially during this Administration, and progress continues to be made
toward the President's goal of enrolling 1 million children by 2002.
After-school care for children is another concern of working parents. In
1998, 68 percent of married couples with children were ones in which both
parents were in the labor force, compared with 28 percent in 1970. Today, 28
million school-age children are in either married-couple families where both

196 I Economic Report of the President




parents are employed or single-parent families where the parent works
outside the home; an additional 10 million children are in married-couple
families where only one parent is employed. This has led to strong demand
for quality programs to ensure that children are safe and learning during the
hours when they are not supervised by a parent. In fact, experts estimate that
during a typical week at least 5 million school-age children spend time
unattended at home. This Administration has responded to this situation by
increasing its investment in after-school and summer programs from $40
million in 1998 to $453 million in fiscal 2000. The President has called for
a doubling of this investment in fiscal 2001.

Conclusion
The American family in the 21st century faces a different world and a different set of challenges than the family of 100 years ago. The twin problems
of scarce time and scarce resources are not, of course, new, but their manifestations in our turn-of-the-millennium economy may well be. Thanks in part
to greater participation of women in paid employment, families today enjoy
a much higher standard of living than did families a century ago. But expectations also appear to be different today. Great changes in the economy have
opened up great opportunities as well as great challenges. As people aspire to
take advantage of those opportunities, changes in workplace arrangements
and well-designed Federal policies can help them overcome the challenges.

Opportunity and Challenge in the
Global Economy

What an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man that age was which came to
an end in August, 19141 ...life offered, at a low cost and with the least trouble, conveniences,
comforts, and amenities beyond the compass of the richest and most powerful monarchs of
other ages. The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in
bed, the various products of the whole earth...he could at the same moment and by the
same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any
quarter of the world.... But, most important of all he regarded this state of affairs as normal,
certain, and permanent, except in the direction of further improvement, and any deviation
from it as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable.

—John Maynard Keynes, The Economic Consequences of the Peace
(1919), writing about thepre-World War I economy

F

or centuries, rising prosperity and rising integration of the global economy have gone hand in hand. The United States and much of the rest of
the world have never before been as affluent as today. Nor has economic
globalization—the worldwide integration of national economies through
trade, capitalflows,and operational linkages amongfirms—everbefore been
as broad or as deep. Keyness words in the epigraph describe London at the
beginning of the 20th century, yet they ring even truer for the United States
and many other countries as we look to the 21st. This conjuncture of rising
wealth and expanding international ties is no coincidence. The United States




199

has gained enormously from these linkages, which have helped drive the
unprecedented prosperity of the economy. Indeed, future improvements in
Americans' living standards depend in part on our continued willingness to
embrace international economic integration.
As Chart 6-1 shows, the involvement of several of the worlds richest countries in international trade has grown faster than their output for roughly
three centuries. The one period when trade grew more slowly than output
was from 1913 to 1950—a period that encompassed the Great Depression
and two world wars. Fortunately, despite Keyness characterization of the preWorld War I period as an "extraordinary episode," the rising globalization
and economic buoyancy of that period proved not to be an aberration.
Rather, it was the 1913-50 period that stood out as the extraordinary
episode, one of uncharacteristically weak growth in both output and trade.
During that period, and that period only, trade generally fell relative to gross
domestic product (GDP). After 1950 the world economy resumed its globalizing trend. But it took time to make up the ground lost: in the United
States and elsewhere, the level of trade relative to output has consistently
exceeded early-20th-century levels only in the past few decades.
One reason why prosperity and economic globalization have risen together is that dramatic improvements in technology have contributed to both. As
earlier chapters discuss, technological advances have raised living standards,
enabling each worker to produce more and better goods and services.

200 I Economic Report of the President




Meanwhile innovations in transportation, communications, and information
technology have made international economic integration ever easier.
Quite apart from the impact of technology, openness to the world itself
makes us more prosperous. The freedom of firms to choose from a wider
range of inputs, and of consumers to choose from a wider range of products,
improves efficiency, promotes innovation in technology and management,
encourages the transfer of technology, and otherwise enhances productivity
growth. All these benefits, in turn, lead to higher real incomes and wages.
Through trade, countries can shift resources into those sectors best able to
compete in international markets, and so reap the benefits of specialization
and scale economies. Opening domestic markets to global capital can
improve the efficiency of investment, which can promote economic growth.
Through firms' direct investment in foreign affiliates, countries can adopt
international best practices in production, including managerial, technical,
and marketing know-how.
Given the momentum of the economic and technological forces behind
globalization, its rise may seem inevitable. But policy can play a critical role
in either helping or hindering its advance. The experience of the 20th century reinforces this lesson. International linkages in the United States and elsewhere were fairly well developed at the beginning of the century: as Keynes
observed, rising prosperity and increasing economic integration had come to
seem the natural state of affairs. Yet from 1914 until mid-century, war as well
as mistakes of economic policy thwarted this normalcy. In the trade arena,
governments actively promoted protectionism through high tariff and nontariff barriers, and so inadvertently contributed to the slowed pace of world
growth and development.
For the past half century, in contrast, policy has worked actively to remove
barriers and distortions that impede the market forces underpinning trade
and investment. For example, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) and, more recently, the World Trade Organization (WTO) have
championed trade liberalization. Since the 1970s, most industrial countries
have removed most of their controls on international capital movements, and
many developing countries have greatly relaxed theirs as well. Given the very
real benefits of open markets in both trade and finance, we should continue
to embrace and encourage this trend toward liberalization.
Of course, economic globalization is not an end in itself, but rather a
means to raise living standards. Like other sources of economic growth,
including technological progress, economic integration involves natural
tradeoffs. It provides real benefits by increasing the choices available to
people and firms, but it also raises legitimate concerns. Increased trade
re-sorts each country's resources, directing them toward their most productive uses, but some industries and their workers may find themselves facing




Chapter 6 I 201

sharp competition from other countries. Broader global capital flows can
increase efficiency and speed development, but when these flows reverse
course, they can temporarily upset whole economies.
Sound policy plays an important role in ensuring that the benefits of international economic integration are shared as widely as possible, raising living
standards within and across all countries that take part. Even in an increasingly global economy, each nation controls its own destiny. In large measure,
active participation in international markets for goods, services, and capital
strengthens the case for policies that make sense even without integration.
Among these are policies that encourage a flexible and skilled work force,
provide an adequate social safety net, reward innovation, and ensure that the
financial system is sound and that financial markets are deep.

The Fall and Rise of the Global Economy
The U.S. economy today is more closely integrated with the rest of the
world than at any time in history. Trade and, to a much lesser extent, investment links were well established a century ago, but both deteriorated during
the interwar period. Over the past 50 years, however, international trade and
investment have risen sharply. Today, global ties—through goods and services
trade, through capitalflows,and through integrated production relationships
—are generally broader and deeper than ever before.

The Growing Importance of Trade
Historical statistics on U.S. trade reveal a striking pattern. A period of
rising international economic integration began well before the 20th
century but faltered between the two world wars. Although U.S. tariffs were
relatively high during much of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the United
States tended to participate actively in a generally flourishing world trade.
Internationally, nontariff trade barriers were few. The interwar period that
followed, however, was largely one of rising tariff and nontariff barriers—in
the United States and elsewhere—and disintegration rather than integration.
Since World War II, technological developments and the gradual international liberalization of trade and capital flows, described below, have once
again put integration on the upswing. Chart 6-2 shows that, except briefly
around the time of each world war, the ratio of trade (exports plus imports)
to gross national product (GNP) did not return to turn-of-the-century levels
until the 1970s. Recently, however, this ratio has approached 25 percent, its
highest point in at least a century.

But to look at U.S. trade only in the aggregate would miss much of the
story of this country's integration into the global economy. Important
changes have also occurred within sectors and individual industries. Exports
of both goods and services have risen much faster than production, but each
has followed its own distinct path.
Although typically small relative to aggregate production, U.S. exports of
services—including travel and transportation; royalties and license fees;
telecommunications services; education; and a variety of financial and business, professional, and technical services—have grown dramatically, providing further evidence of the increasing importance of global linkages. (The
United States exports transportation services when, for example, a European
tourist flies a U.S. airline to New York, and imports transportation services
when an American tourist flies a British carrier to London.) U.S. service
providers have almost tripled the export share of their output over the past
five decades. In 1950 only about 2 percent of U.S.-produced services were
exported; in 1998 that share was about 6 percent.
Indeed, growth in exports of services has outpaced growth in exports of
goods. Not coincidentally, services have become a more important part of the
domestic economy over the same period. As a result, services now account
for about 29 percent of U.S. exports (Chart 6-3), up from only 17 percent in
1950 and about 2 percent in 1900.

Although goods production—capturing production in manufacturing,
mining, and agriculture—has come to account for a smaller share of the
economy, it, too, has become more deeply integrated into the global
economy. The share of domestic goods production destined for export
markets has grown from around 9 percent in 1929 to 21 percent in 1998.
However, the shares for some specific industries and products are much
larger. Many high-technology U.S. manufacturing industries, such as
electronics, export 25 percent or more of their total shipments.
Imports, too, foster integration into the global economy. In fact, the United States often imports and exports within the same categories of products.
Capital goods, for example, are the leading category of both U.S. imports
and U.S. exports (Chart 6-3). This two-way trade can also be seen within
specific industries, such as the computer industry. Some of this two-way,
intraindustry trade reflects the globalization of production arrangements.
Anecdotal evidence and recent studies document how production processes
have been increasingly divided up and reallocated, either domestically or
globally. That is, discrete elements of these processes, such as research and
development, design, assembly, and packaging, are performed byfirmsin the
United States and elsewhere, based on countries' relative strengths in
completing different tasks. Part of the growth in trade may also reflect rising
vertical specialization, in which goods are imported, further processed, and
reexported.

204 I Economic Report of the President




Data from the U.S. computer industry (computer systems, hardware, and
peripherals) illustrate the extent of both intraindustry trade and vertical
specialization. According to one recent report, in 1998 an estimated 43 percent of domestic producers' total shipments was exported, and an estimated
58 percent of final and intermediate domestic consumption was imported.
The same report notes that more than 60 percent by value of the hardware in
a typical U.S. personal computer system comes from Asia.
Intraindustry trade may also reflect an interaction of consumers' desire for
variety with economies of scale in production. The automobile industry provides some commonly cited examples. We observe firms in the United States
and the European Union producing and exporting different kinds of luxury
and sport vehicles for niche markets. Because the average cost of production
falls as more cars are produced, firms try to reach as many customers as
possible. This gives them an incentive to seek out markets abroad. And when
many producers in different countries adopt the same strategy, the result is
greater satisfaction of consumers' demand for product selection. Economists
note that consumer tastes for variety help explain trade flows among countries
with similar resource and technology bases.
U.S. firms' trading partners are located around the world, but they tend to
be concentrated in industrial countries and in our closest neighbors. Canada
is the top-ranking trade partner of the United States, accounting in 1998 for
about 21 percent of U.S. merchandise exports and imports combined. Measured on the same basis, the European Union is a very close second, followed
by Japan and then Mexico. In the aggregate, developing countries (excluding
the few that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development) account for about 31 percent of U.S. trade, although the
48 countries designated by the United Nations as least developed account for
a very small share—less than 1 percent.

The Rise of International Capital Flows
Cross-border capital flows have likewise grown to unprecedented levels in
the United States and around the world, reflecting reduced barriers to capital, an increased desire on the part of investors to diversify their portfolios
internationally, and a plethora of new financial instruments and technologies. Cross-border transactions in bonds and equities have exploded in recent
decades, reaching 223 percent of GDP in the United States in 1998, compared with only 9 percent of GDP in 1980. One survey reports that average
daily turnover on world foreign exchange markets was about $1.5 trillion in
April 1998, although not all such turnover necessarily crosses borders.
This turnover has risen from $0.6 trillion in April 1989.
These cross-border figures include substantial trading and retrading of the
same securities, and hence to some extent overstate the degree to which own-




Chapter 6 I 205

ership claims cross borders. For example, a U.S. mutual fund might turn over
its entire portfolio of foreign securities more than once during the course of
a year. Official balance of payments data provide an alternative measure of
gross flows that comes closer to measuring the true change in cross-border
ownership claims. Chart 6-4 shows these data on inflows of capital sent into
the United States by foreigners, and outflows of capital sent from the United
States by U.S. residents. U.S. outflows abroad have been rising; foreign
inflows into the United States have been rising even faster. These flows typically amounted to 1 percent or less of GNP through the 1960s. By contrast,
flows have been much larger recently: from 1995 through 1998, for example,
inflows averaged 7 percent of GNP.
Net capital flows (the difference between inflows and outflows in Chart
6-4), measured relative to GNP, have also reached much higher levels in
recent decades. Indeed, the United States is by far the largest recipient of net
capital inflows in the world, amounting to more than $200 billion in 1998.
The large net capital inflows of the past two decades have led to a profound
change in the net international indebtedness position of the United States.
The United States was a net debtor until the late 1910s and then a net creditor until the late 1980s. At the end of 1998, foreign-owned assets in the United States exceeded U.S.-owned assets abroad by about $1.2 trillion (valued at
current cost), an amount equal to 14 percent of U.S. GNP. A century ago, the
net international investment position of the United States was similar, with
Chart 6-4 Capital Flows Into and Out of the United States Relative to GNP
Capital flows into and out of the United States have soared since the 1960s. Since
the 1980s, inflows from abroad have consistently exceeded outflows.

net indebtedness of about 18 percent of GNP. However, the gross investment
positions were much smaller then. In 1897, for example, U.S. assets abroad
amounted to only 5 percent of U.S. GNP, compared with 56 percent in 1998.
Economists sometimes distinguish among various broad categories of capital flows. The main ones are foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio
investment (such as stocks and bonds), and bank lending. These types of capital flows differ greatly in their volatility—a matter of concern for emerging
market economies, as discussed below. Anecdotal evidence and recent studies
suggest that bank lending and portfolio flows may be the most volatile. FDI,
in contrast, may be less fickle, because these flows arise, in part, from the
internationalization of production processes (Box 6-1). FDI occurs, for
example, when an investor sets up an enterprise in a foreign country or
obtains a large enough share (U.S. statistics, and those of some other countries, set the threshold at 10 percent) in an existing foreign enterprise to
influence managerial decisions. Global FDI outflows accounted for about a
quarter of total international capital outflows between 1990 and 1996. They
grew from an annual average of $181 billion between 1986 and 1991 to
$649 billion in 1998.

Box 6-1. Multinational Corporations and Globalization
Globalization is played out in many arenas and by many actors, an
important one of which is the multinational company (MNC). MNCs
undertake FDI when they establish overseas operations through foreign
affiliates. They also engage extensively in international trade. Worldwide, some 60,000 parent operations of MNCs and their 500,000 foreign
affiliates account for roughly 25 percent of global output, one-third of it
in host countries. In industrial countries, services accounted for 53 percent of all FDI inflows in 1997, and manufacturing for 35 percent. In
developing countries, manufacturing accounted for about 50 percent of
FDI inflows in 1997, and services for 41 percent.
U.S.-based MNCs account for a large share of U.S. production, trade,
and employment. They produce about 19 percent of U.S. GDP through
their parent operations (all these figures refer to nonbank MNCs only).
In 1997 the trade associated with U.S. MNCs accounted for about 63 percent of U.S. goods exports and 40 percent of U.S. goods imports. Over
40 percent of these transactions involved trade between U.S. parent
operations and their foreign affiliates. The parent operations of U.S.
MNCs employed about 20 million workers in the United States in 1997,
roughly the same number as in 1977.
Although foreign affiliates of U.S. MNCs trade with their parent operations, among others, data show that most of their sales are local,




continued on next page...

Chapter 6 I 207

Box 6-1. — continued
occurring within the host country. In 1997, 63 percent of worldwide
sales of goods and 82 percent of worldwide sales of services by foreign
affiliates of U.S. MNCs were local, reflecting in part the importance of
proximity in the delivery of some products. In terms of the gross product of U.S. MNCs' majority-owned foreign affiliates, the United Kingdom is the most important destination for U.S. MNCs, followed by
Canada and Germany. The foreign affiliates of U.S. MNCs employed
about 8 million workers in 1997, up from 7.2 million in 1977.
Just as U.S. MNCs have reached across national borders, so foreignbased MNCs have entered the United States. U.S. affiliates of foreign
companies account for about 6 percent of U.S. private-industry gross
product. In terms of the gross product of foreign MNCs' U.S. affiliates, the
United Kingdom is again the leader, followed by Japan and Germany. In
1997, U.S. affiliates of foreign companies accounted for about 20 percent
of U.S. goods exports and about 30 percent of U.S. goods imports. Also in
1997, U.S. affiliates of foreign companies employed about 5 million workers in the United States, up from only 1.2 million in 1977.

Transactions involving U.S. entities, as either investors or recipients,
account for a large share of global FDI flows. U.S. FDI outflows amounted
to $133 billion in 1998, up from an annual average of $26 billion between
1986 and 1991. Meanwhile, U.S. FDI inflows rose from an annual average
of $49 billion between 1986 and 1991 to $193 billion in 1998. Globally,
most FDI goes to industrialized countries, but developing countries' share of
global FDI inflows is also substantial, totaling about 28 percent in 1998,
although this marked a decline from 37 percent in 1997.

The Forces Behind Globalization
The forces driving globalization include technology and policy. Technological improvements—in transportation, communications, information
technology, and elsewhere—have reduced the costs of doing business internationally, thus lowering significant barriers to trade and investment. These
improvements have also increased the range of possible commercial transactions, particularly in financial markets, and have created venues for new
kinds of transactions, such as electronic commerce.
Policy has also played an active role in reducing barriers to trade and
investment. For example, over the past 50 years, policy measures have sought
to reduce tariff and nontariff trade barriers. More recently, and especially
since the 1970s, many countries have decided to remove restrictions on
208 I Economic Report of the President




capital flows. Coupled with other domestic policies designed to promote
competition among firms, these kinds of market liberalization in trade
and investment have helped reduce costs to consumers and promote
technological innovation.

The Role of Technology
Although our nearest neighbors remain among our most important trading partners—Canada and Mexico together account for about one-third of
our total trade—improvements in technology have reduced the costs of
doing business overseas and made distant markets more accessible.
The cost of moving goods has fallen over time. Studies document substantial reductions in shipping costs in the pre-World War I period, and
some indicators suggest that costs have continued to decline since then. This
decline appears to reflect several factors, including direct declines in some
shipping rates as well as a shift in the mix of traded goods and modes of shipping. One study reports that average ocean freight and port charges on U.S.
trade fell from $95 per short ton in 1920 (measured in 1990 dollars) to $27
in 1960, but then leveled off. Another recent study looks at relatively disaggregated data since the 1950s and finds little evidence of declines in real
ocean shipping rates. But that study does find that air shipment rates have
fallen sharply: worldwide, the cost of airfreight, measured as average revenue
per ton-kilometer, dropped by 78 percent between 1955 and 1996. In
addition, the share of world trade in high-value-to-weight products such as
pharmaceuticals has risen. Reflecting the falling cost of airfreight as well as
the shifting composition of trade, air shipments in 1998 accounted for 28
percent of the value of U.S. international trade—up from 7 percent in 1965
and a negligible share in 1950.
At the same time, the cost of land-based shipping may also have fallen.
Because of the importance of Canada and Mexico as trading partners, about
34 percent of the value of U.S. trade was shipped by land in 1998—up from
about 28 percent in 1965—and even many goods that travel by ocean-going
vessel must be transported to or from the port. Domestic deregulation in the
U.S. transportation industry has contributed to efficiency gains in land transport, and the development of the Interstate Highway System since World War
II also appears to have reduced transport costs. In addition, technological
developments such as containerization have facilitated intermodal transportation and improved the quality of transport services. Containerization allows a
standard-sized container to be hauled by truck or rail and then, if continuing
overseas, loaded by crane directly onto a ship. This technology has reduced
both handling requirements and transit time for deliveries.
Improved communications and information technologies have also
facilitated international commerce. In 1930, for example, a 3-minute phone




Chapter 6 I 209

call from New York to London cost $293 in 1998 dollars. By 1998, one
widely subscribed discount plan charged only 36 cents for a clearer, more
reliable 3-minute call. This decline in communications costs, coupled with
the availability of new technologies, has probably been particularly important
in facilitating services trade. Although market proximity is still an important
factor for many services, firms' ability to provide customer support by
telephone or e-mail at relatively low cost, or to transmit products electronically via the Internet, has reduced its importance in some industries. A
report from the U.S. General Accounting Office notes that technological
innovations linked to computers and satellites have influenced how intermodal freight shipments are handled. Such innovations include bar coding
for verification and tracking, electronic transmission of business data and
documents, and in-vehicle navigation systems that help shippers find the
most direct or least congested routes.
Improvements in information and communications technology have also
underpinned rapid technological change in the financial sector. Recent years
have seen an explosion in the range of financial instruments, which has
contributed to the massive gross flows of financial capital discussed earlier.
For example, advances in computing technology enable traders to implement
complex analytical models (such as models for pricing options), and this in
turn allows financial firms to meet demand for new financial instruments.
Under flexible exchange rate regimes, one source of demand for such instruments is the desire of market participants to remove or insure against the
exchange rate risks they face in trading goods, services, or assets. Swaps,
options, and futures permit them to do so.
In addition, rising financial wealth in many countries has created demand
for instruments that facilitate international portfolio diversification, even as
financial innovation has made it easier to supply these instruments. For
example, international mutual funds—some highly specialized by sector or
region—are more easily available today than ever before, reflecting both the
rise in demand and the ease of supply.
Information and communications technologies have also made it easier to
source inputs globally. For example, Chapter 3 discussed the case of a firm
that specializes in finding suppliers for large custom procurement orders.
After finding qualified suppliers, who may be located anywhere in the world,
the firm coordinates online bids for the order. The process helps overcome
the informational barriers to finding reliable, low-cost suppliers.

The Role of Policy
Given the economic and technological forces behind globalization, its rise
may seem inevitable. Yet governments have taken on a critically important
role in opening markets and removing distortions, thereby allowing market
210 I Economic Report of the President




forces to play themselves out. In the interwar period, in contrast, policy
actively promoted protectionism through high tariff and nontariff barriers.
Indeed, rising protectionism in a number of countries—including the United
States, through the Tariff Act of 1930 (Smoot-Hawley)—made the Great
Depression more severe. Despite efforts by the United States to begin reducing
tariffs at home and abroad in 1934, through the Reciprocal Trade Agreements
Act, world tariffs remained high on average. Since mid-century, however,
policy in the United States and elsewhere has worked actively to reduce trade
barriers that limit or distort the choices available to consumers and firms.
Since the 1970s especially, governments have been reducing barriers to capital
flows as well. As discussed later, policy can also help in dealing with the
inevitable tensions and disruptions of economic integration.
The United States has played a leading role in liberalizing trade internationally, both by reducing its own tariffs and by encouraging others, through
a variety of market-opening initiatives, to follow suit. The multilateral trading system, consisting of the GATT at first, and more recently the W T O , is
at the core of these efforts. Before the creation of the GATT in 1948, trade
barriers—in the United States and elsewhere—were more susceptible to a
range of economic and political factors. Tariff rates, measured as the ratio of
duties to import values, rose noticeably in the United States during the interwar period, partly because of new legislation. But some of the increase
shown in Chart 6-5 reflects the effect of declining import prices in the early
1930s: many tariffs were "specific," in that they were imposed as a nominal
Chart 6-5 Average U.S. Tariff Rates Since 1900

dollar amount per imported quantity, so that when prices fell, effective tariff
rates rose. A recent study shows that the Tariff Act of 1930 raised the tariff
rate on U.S. imports by roughly 20 percent, on average, independent of the
effects of price declines.
Following the creation of the GATT, and through successive rounds of
multilateral negotiations, world trade markets have become more open and
integrated, contributing to the strong economic growth of the second half of
the 20th century. Success in reducing nontariff barriers was uneven throughout this period, but tariffs generally declined. For example, import tariffs on
industrial products in industrial countries have dropped 90 percent over the
last 50 years, from an average of about 40 percent to roughly 4 percent.
Other market-opening initiatives have also contributed to trade, such as the
U.S. "open skies" policy for international civil aviation, which has helped
improve U.S. air carriers' access to passenger and cargo markets around the
world. As Chart 6-1 showed, growth of trade has consistently outpaced
growth of income since 1950.
Policy developments have also contributed to the growth of international
capital flows. Most governments kept at least some controls on capital movements from World War II into the 1970s. Today, by contrast, restrictions on
capital flows have generally been removed in the industrial countries, and
they have been substantially relaxed in many developing economies as well.
Pervasive controls on cross-border capital flows were part of the international
monetary and financial regime adopted at Bretton Woods in 1944. These
controls were partly a response to the severe instability of the international
monetary system during the Great Depression. The industrialized countries
generally began relaxing these controls in the 1950s, and the late 1970s saw
much more widespread liberalization. Technological developments in a sense
contributed to liberalization by making capital controls increasingly difficult
to enforce. And a rising volume of trade conducted under flexible exchange
rates spurred interest in financial transactions to hedge exposure to currency
and commercial risk.
Moreover, recent decades have brought renewed recognition worldwide
that financial markets, like markets for goods and services, generally allocate
resources effectively. This recognition has given impetus to considerable
financial liberalization in developing economies over the past decade. Financial
liberalization has often accompanied other favorable economic policies, such
as macroeconomic stabilization, privatization, trade liberalization, and deregulation. Such structural reforms in a significant number of capital-scarce
developing countries have provided significant investment opportunities,
with high expected rates of return, and this has attracted a surge of foreign
capital. However, this surge does raise some concerns, as discussed later, and
it puts a premium on adopting appropriate domestic macroeconomic
policies and strengthening domestic financial systems.
212 I Economic Report of the President




The Benefits of a Global Economy
The United States approaches globalization from a position of considerable strength. In per capita terms, the United States has been the world s richest major economy since overtaking the United Kingdom early in the 20th
century, and by most measures it remains so today.
Chart 6-6 shows estimates of GDP per capita since 1900. The chart is
plotted on a ratio scale, so that a steeper slope implies a faster growth rate. As
the figure illustrates, the dominant macroeconomic fact for both the United
States and other major economies for more than a century has been that output per person has grown. But this growth has been far from steady. The
1913-50 period, when global economic relations deteriorated and integration receded amid active protectionism and instability in the international
monetary system, recorded the most volatile output growth rates in all four
countries shown in the chart. The post-World War II period of rising globalization, in contrast, has been a time of rapidly rising prosperity.
Throughout much of the postwar period, Germany and Japan grew more
quickly than the United States, somewhat closing the gap in GDP per capita. But this convergence slowed after the early 1970s and had largely ceased
by the end of the 1980s. In 1998, GDP per capita remained considerably
higher in the United States than in the other economies in Chart 6-6. Overall, the record shows that the U.S. economy has thrived in the global marChart 6-6

ketplace. The discussion of the benefits of globalization that follows suggests
that this conjuncture of globalization and prosperity is no mere coincidence.
International economic integration raises living standards by improving
resource allocation, promoting innovation, encouraging technology transfer,
and otherwise enhancing productivity growth. Through trade, countries can
shift resources into their most internationally competitive sectors and reap
the benefits of specialization and scale economies. Their consumers also
enjoy less expensive and more varied products. Opening domestic markets to
global capital can help countries invest more efficiently. FDI can lead to
improved management, better technology and training, and higher wages in
local communities.
However, the same processes that bring about economic growth, including
those that work through trade and investment, can force costly adjustments
for some firms and their workers. An array of U.S. domestic policies, such as
those to assist job search and training, address these issues, as do some elements of international agreements that the United States has entered into.
Both are discussed later.

Globalization and Living Standards
Trade economists have long recognized the benefits of specialization in
production and of access to markets. When a country produces and exports
those goods and services that it can produce relatively inexpensively, and
imports those that are relatively inexpensive to produce abroad, trade
improves standards of living on both sides of the transaction. For example,
the United States can produce financial services at lower cost, relative to
other products that it might produce, than most developing countries can.
Costa Rica, by comparison, can produce coffee at lower cost, relative to other
products, than can most industrialized countries. In this example, the United States would likely benefit from producing and exporting financial services and importing coffee. The reverse is true of Costa Rica. Through freer
trade and specialization, a country's resources can be directed more efficiently to those uses in which they generate the most economic value, thereby
raising income.
Access to larger markets can also reduce costs and increase the returns to
innovation. Producing such goods as automobiles and airplanes requires
building large plants and installing complex and costly equipment. By
adding exports to their domestic sales, manufacturers can lower their unit
costs by extending production runs and spreading overhead costs more
broadly. Moreover, the ability to spread fixed research and development
costs may allow globally competitive firms to be more innovative than those
confined to selling in domestic markets.

214 I Economic Report of the President




Domestic production can expand when firms export, drawing workers
into jobs in the economy's most productive and internationally competitive
sectors. Recent studies find a substantial wage premium—on the order of 15
percent—in U.S. jobs supported by goods exports. Moreover, opening up to
trade means giving consumers and firms greater freedom of choice about
what inputs to purchase and what goods to consume. For consumers, the
availability of less expensive and more varied products increases the real purchasing power of domestic wages. Some of the benefits of market opening are
quantifiable. For example, a study of the costs of protection in the United
States found that tariffs and quantitative import restrictions in place in 1990
cost American consumers about $70 billion. Since 1990, these costs to U.S.
consumers have fallen, as trade barriers have been reduced on some products.
At the same time, import competition creates incentives for U.S. businesses
to price their products more competitively.
Access to international capital markets can also improve living standards.
International capital mobility allows portfolio diversification and improved
risk sharing. It allows investments to take place where they offer the highest
returns, thereby improving global resource allocation. And it allows a country to smooth its consumption by consuming today more than it produces
today, paying for the difference by borrowing abroad. Therefore, global
investment, like trade, yields benefits to both sides of the transaction. Capital goes to those who are best able to make productive use of it, and the suppliers of that capital receive a higher return for a given level of risk than they
could get elsewhere. These benefits may be particularly pronounced in the
case of FDI. Too large a volume of short-term capital flows, by contrast, may
in some cases make an economy more vulnerable to crisis, as discussed later.
Trade and investment activities can be mutually reinforcing. For example,
FDI by U.S. companies can help pave the way for U.S. exports. It may create demand for U.S.-produced inputs, possibly from the parent operations. It
may also offer U.S. companies a foothold in foreign markets from which
they can further expand sales. In many cases, investment in distribution and
other essential services increases a suppliers ability to export into a market.
Trade between firms and their foreign affiliates, so-called intrafirm trade, can
be an efficient means of doing business overseas, particularly when firms
need substantial information about suppliers, clients, or markets abroad in
order to operate effectively. Over a third of U.S. merchandise exports and
about two-fifths of U.S. merchandise imports are estimated to be intrafirm;
worldwide, intrafirm trade's estimated share is about a third. Trade may also
expand capital flows. For example, the growth of trade has created a need for
more trade-related financing and, as noted previously, for tools to hedge risk.




Chapter 6 I 215

Globalization and Growth
Although causality may be hard to establish, simple measures of the correlation between the openness of an economy and its growth suggest a mutually supportive relationship. For example, ample evidence demonstrates that
countries that actively participate in international trade tend to have higher
incomes than those that do not. They also experience more rapid growth and
productivity improvements. Studies also suggest that countries that have
adopted outward-oriented economic policies since the early 1970s experienced significantly higher annual growth of GDP per capita over the next
two decades than countries that remained inward-oriented.
Exposure to foreign competition gives domestic firms an incentive to raise
their productivity—and these gains recur. Once competition is introduced, it
leads to a cycle of productivity improvements and quality enhancements that
continue to benefit the economy indefinitely. Studies of the United States
and Japan find a positive relationship between import growth and productivity growth. Furthermore, evidence suggests that openness can induce
higher average productivity through access to a greater range of intermediate
inputs and, within a given industry, through faster growth of those firms that
achieve the highest productivity.
Increased trade and FDI can also boost productivity growth by improving
the flow of knowledge and the transfer of technology. Traded manufactures,
like all manufactures, embody knowledge and technology and, in the case of
information and communications technology for example, may boost countries' ability to innovate. Besides providing funding, direct investors can
bring international best practices, including managerial, technical, and marketing know-how, to the recipient, which can then spill over into the rest of
the economy. In turn, the direct investors may also benefit from the expertise
of the recipient firms. The flow of knowledge and transfer of technology also
occur through local research and development (R&D). Expenditure on
R&D performed by foreign affiliates in the United States accounted for
about 12 percent of the R&D performed by all U.S. businesses in 1997. The
ratio of R&D expenditure to gross product for these affiliates was 5 percent,
twice the ratio for all U.S. businesses.
For developing countries, evidence suggests that FDI, along with hightechnology trade, can play an important role in their catch-up to the industrial countries. When industrial-country investors build, contribute to, or
acquire production facilities in a developing country, the recipient country
gains not just from expanded production and improved job opportunities,
but also from access to more advanced technologies. Recent studies show
that, in developing countries with a sufficient stock of skilled labor, FDI
from industrial countries can contribute more to growth than does the
country's own domestic R&D.
216 I Economic Report of the President




In short, increased globalization benefits the United States and other
economies. Globalization yields gains from trade, through specialization and
through realization of scale economies in production. And by allowing capital to flow across borders, it lowers the cost of financing investment in the
recipient country, increases the return to saving, and allows for portfolio
diversification in the country providing the funds. Both trade and investment contribute to the flow of knowledge and transfer of technology.

The Challenges of Globalization
The United States has long sought to extend the benefits of trade and
investment as widely as possible, both within and among countries, but significant challenges remain. The United States is committed to expanding
trade and investment opportunities around the world. It is also committed to
putting a human face on the global economy, in part through greater consideration of labor and environmental concerns and more openness in WTO
proceedings. For all the evidence that trade raises living standards, some U.S.
industries and their workers may face difficulties adjusting to more open
markets. Economists attribute only a small share of worker dislocation
(roughly 10 percent or less) to trade, but crafting sound domestic policy to
help ease the transition for those affected poses another important challenge.
The emerging marketfinancialcrises of 1997-99 highlight yet another challenge: the risk that sudden reversals in capital flows can in some cases be
destabilizing. Finally, the growing U.S. trade deficit raises the challenge of
ensuring not only that the United States remains an attractive location for
investment, but also that Americans are saving enough for the future.

Spreading the Benefits of Trade
The United States has sought to open markets, extend the rule of law, and
encourage economic growth internationally through bilateral, regional, and
multilateral trade agreements. The multilateral trading system, consisting
originally of the GATT and more recently the WTO, is at the core of these
efforts. Although its achievements have been considerable, this system
remains a work in progress. The recent difficulty in establishing a mandate
for a new round of WTO negotiations, and the public protest accompanying
the WTO Ministerial in Seattle, give a sense of the challenges that lie ahead.
Many countries continue to maintain high trade barriers, especially in
agriculture and services, but institutional concerns, such as those relating to
the WTO s accessibility and transparency and to its relationships with international labor and environmental organizations, have come increasingly to




Chapter 6 I 217

the fore. Much work also remains to be done to ensure that developing countries—particularly the least developed—enjoy improved market access and
obtain the technical assistance they need to realize the benefits that international trade can afford. At the same time, the United States must also address
legitimate concerns about the adjustment of domestic industries and workers. On balance, trade does raise living standards, but there are those within
an economy who may suffer losses when more-open markets shift resources
from one use to another.

Opening Markets More Fully
The United States gains when it lowers its trade barriers, but it gains most
when other nations also lower theirs. Indeed, as one of the worlds most open
economies, the United States has a particular interest in promoting liberalization abroad. The Uruguay Round, which lasted from 1986 to 1994,
brought agriculture and textiles and clothing more fully into the GATT and
took the first steps toward liberalizing trade in those sectors. It also brought
service trade into the multilateral system by creating the General Agreement
on Trade in Services. A series of post-Uruguay Round negotiations have
yielded additional market access commitments in financial services, basic
telecommunications services, and information technology, opening up new
opportunities in areas where the United States is believed to be highly competitive. Yet room for improvement remains, as many countries continue to
maintain significant tariff and nontariff barriers.
Agriculture provides a stark example. Bound tariff rates (maximum rates to
which countries commit themselves in trade negotiations) on agricultural
products average about 50 percent around the world, compared with less
than 10 percent in the United States. Moreover, even after the European
Union and Japan fully implement their Uruguay Round commitments, they
will be free to provide as much as $78 billion and $35 billion, respectively, in
trade-distorting domestic support to their farmers each year. By comparison,
the United States will be limited to about $19 billion. Partly because of these
policies, average prices for food and related goods are 34 percent higher in
the European Union and 134 percent higher in Japan than in the United
States.
To help meet the challenges of market opening, the United States is seeking additional market access in agriculture, services, and certain industrial
products in the W T O . Notwithstanding the difficulty in establishing a negotiating mandate during the Seattle Ministerial, the W T O s built-in agenda
calls for further negotiations on agriculture and services to have begun by
January 2000. In agriculture the United States has proposed eliminating
export subsidies and reducing tariffs and trade-distorting domestic supports.
In services the United States has sought commitments for more openness in

218 I Economic Report of the President




key sectors such as finance, telecommunications, and construction. In other
areas—chemicals, energy products, environmental products, fish, forest
products, jewelry, medical and scientific equipment, and toys—the United
States has sought accelerated tariff liberalization.
Rapid technological change poses additional challenges, sometimes raising
questions about the nature of trade and product development. The United
States has sought to promote the development and use of new technologies,
such as electronic commerce and biotechnology, in ways that help spread the
benefits of trade. With the strong support of the Congress, this Administration has sought an extension of the moratorium on tariffs on electronic commerce in the W T O . The United States is also seeking to ensure that trade in
agricultural biotechnology products is based on transparent, predictable, and
timely processes.

Strengthening Rules and Institutions
Credibility and predictability are essential components of the trading system. For firms to undertake the investments necessary to serve foreign markets, they need to believe that new barriers will not be raised and that old
ones will not reassert themselves. To rely on foreign suppliers, buyers need to
believe likewise that market access will not be disrupted. Traders need assurance that commitments will be binding and that markets will remain open
even if circumstances change. And the rules of the trading game should
ensure that governments play fair—that they neither seek advantage for
favored interests by subsidizing their producers, nor pass regulations that
unnecessarily distort international trade, nor otherwise circumvent international commitments. In setting these rules and encouraging compliance with
them, the W T O has tried to strike an appropriate balance between the needs
of the trading system and those of sovereign nations. Its agreements do not
preclude the United States or other countries from establishing, maintaining,
and effectively enforcing their own laws, nor do they prevent the United
States from setting and achieving its environmental, labor, health, and safety
standards at the levels it considers appropriate.
The W T O operates not by decree but by consensus among its members.
Through consensus, the W T O has done much to achieve both credibility
and fairness. Its rules allow nations to take antidumping measures, countervailing duty measures, and action against import surges, provided they follow
certain procedures. The United States has used its own WTO-consistent
trade laws to combat unfair foreign practices and to provide safeguards for
domestic producers. The W T O also provides an improved framework for
resolving disputes within the multilateral system. This framework has proved
extremely useful to the United States, which as a complaining party has so far
prevailed in 22 out of 24 cases, having favorably settled 10 without litigation




Chapter 6 I 219

and having won 12 in litigation. And the WTO provides new rules for protecting intellectual property rights. For the United States and many other
countries, such rights convey substantial value. In 1998, for example, U.S.
exports of royalties and license fees amounted to about $37 billion.
By and large, countries participating in the GATT and later the WTO
have adhered to their commitments. The trend toward market liberalization
since World War II, and the maintenance of commitments not to raise barriers even in the face of international financial crises, stand in sharp contrast
to the trade policy experience of the interwar period. The multilateral trading
system has played a critical role in maintaining and expanding economic ties,
helping make the last half century one of historically unprecedented economic growth for the United States and many of its trading partners.
Nevertheless, the rules of the WTO and the ways in which they are
administered can be improved. The dispute settlement process, although
much strengthened, is opaque and sometimes slow. During the Seattle Ministerial, the United States led the call for greater public access and participation. The United States has sought to open the WTO s dispute settlement
procedures to the public and to allow nongovernmental organizations to file
amicus briefs. The drawn-out pace of settlement proceedings has also caused
dissatisfaction. Ordinarily, a case should not take more than a year (15
months if it is appealed), but in practice the dispute settlement process can
continue to drag on even after the WTO has adopted a ruling. For example,
in the case involving the EU banana import regime, the WTO found for the
United States in about 18 months from the point of initial consultation, but
by the time the United States wasfinallyauthorized to suspend trading concessions, nearly 3 years had passed.

Promoting Growth Internationally
The United States has long advocated the use of the multilateral trading
system to promote economic growth internationally, often with considerable
success, but not all countries are well positioned to reap the benefits that
trade can afford. Steps can be taken to help ensure that developing countries,
including the least developed, obtain the market access and technical assistance they need to benefit more fully.
Developing countries have increasingly come to appreciate the value of the
multilateral trading system. The system not only provides them opportunities to trade on the basis of their comparative strengths but also reinforces
market-oriented development strategies where they have been adopted. Originally dominated by the industrial countries, the system has witnessed growing participation as other nations have sought inclusion. Today the WTO
counts 135 members, with over 30 nations, including China, seeking accession (Box 6-2). This allure of the trading system supports the conviction that

220 I Economic Report of the President




international trade is not a zero-sum game: both the United States and its
trading partners reap the benefits.
Developing countries have come to account for an increasingly large share
of world trade, but some have moved ahead more rapidly than others. Developing countries' total trade (exports plus imports) rose at an annual rate of
9.9 percent between 1989 and 1997, exceeding the 7.6 percent growth rate
Box 6-2. China's WTO Accession: Opening Foreign Markets,
Extending the Rule of Law, and Encouraging Growth and
Development
In November 1999 the United States and China concluded a bilateral agreement on China's WTO accession. This agreement, which represents a crucial step in China's accession to the multilateral organization, addresses many of the barriers to trade and investment in China
that now impede the flow of goods, services, and capital. Upon implementation, the agreement would benefit both U.S. and other firms outside of China, by improving access to China's market. China would
benefit as well from wider availability of high-quality foreign products
and from the introduction of best-practice skills by U.S. firms in areas
such as finance and insurance.The agreement would help address distortions in China's economy that have contributed to slowing output
growth there and have reduced the prospects for future growth.
Under the terms of the agreement, China's WTO accession would
continue the remarkable process of economic reform that began there
two decades ago. China's economy has become increasingly marketoriented and increasingly open to trade and foreign investment.
Between 1978 and 1999, China's official statistics indicate that the country's income per capita rose at a rate of more than 8 percent per year,
which, according to the World Bank, has helped raise some 200 million
people out of absolute poverty. (Some have argued that statistical
shortcomings lead to an overstatement of this long-run growth rate,
but even skeptics acknowledge that the results have been impressive.)
Trade has grown even faster than output, with the sum of exports and
imports rising from $21 billion in 1978 to $324 billion in 1998. Over this
period more than $250 billion in FDI entered China.
Despite this substantial progress, China has continued to maintain
significant barriers to foreign trade and investment. These barriers
include high tariffs on many agricultural and industrial products and
other, less quantifiable restrictions. For example, some products may
be imported only by approved foreign trading companies, and foreign
investment is sometimes restricted outside of particular sectors. In
many sectors these barriers have shielded inefficient state-owned

Box 6-2.—continued
enterprises—the core of the former centrally planned economy—from
competition, reducing prospects for China's continued strong growth.
The bilateral agreement directly addresses many of these concerns,
especially as they relate to trade. China has agreed to significant
reductions in tariffs on imports of agricultural and industrial products:
for example, tariffs on U.S. industrial products would decline from a
simple average of 24.6 percent to 9.4 percent, calculated from a 1997
baseline. The bilateral agreement would also address many nontariff
barriers. In agriculture, China would establish large and increasing
tariff-rate quotas on bulk agricultural commodities, limit some state
trading activities, and eliminate export subsidies. (A tariff-rate quota is
one in which imports are allowed above the quota but a higher tariff
applies than within the quota.) China would phase in full trading and
distribution rights for most of its industrial sectors. The agreement
also covers a wide range of trade in services, including banking, insurance, telecommunications, distribution, professional activities, and
other business services. The agreement also contains a special safeguard rule, to protect against surges in China's exports to the United
States, and it specifies a non-market economy methodology to
address dumping.
As a result of these changes, U.S. firms would gain from better
access to a fast-growing market of almost 1.3 billion people, and from
greater certainty about China's economic policies in the future. WTO
accession would commit China to a path of further economic liberalization, which could help lock in its transformation from a centrally
planned to a market-based economy and encourage faster growth.This
commitment can also help strengthen the rule of law in China, providing more certainty for U.S. firms seeking to do business there.
Although the bilateral agreement represents a crucial step toward
China's WTO accession, several important ones remain. For example,
China must still complete bilateral agreements with a number of other
WTO members, as well as multilateral negotiations on its accession
protocol. After that, China must complete its own domestic procedures
for accession.

of trade worldwide. Over this period their share of world trade rose from
29.1 percent to 34.7 percent. Among developing countries, the trade of those
that are WTO members grew slighdy faster, at an annual rate of 10.5 percent. The 48 least developed countries have, as a group, done less well. For
these countries, many of which are also WTO members, trade grew at an
annual rate of only 6.1 percent through 1996.

222 I Economic Report of the President




As these data suggest, not all WTO members are well equipped to use the
trading system effectively. Some of the least developed members lack the necessary domestic institutions and infrastructure to reap the full benefits of
trade. For them, capacity building and technical assistance, coupled with
additional market opening, could help spread those benefits. Through the
WTO, the international community can make more progress in liberalization in certain priority areas, such as agriculture and services. But developing
countries, including the least developed, can also take their own actions. In
addition to participating in multilateral initiatives, they can benefit from
increased unilateral liberalization, as free trade promotes the movement of
labor and capital into their most productive uses, strengthens competitive
forces, facilitates innovation, and raises living standards.
The United States has proposed measures for the WTO to provide developing countries with technical assistance in implementing trade policy. The
United States will also work to give the least developed countries greater
access to global markets, as it is already doing through the U.S. Generalized
System of Preferences (GSP) program. The U.S. GSP program began in
1976, when the United States joined 19 other industrialized countries in
granting tariff preferences to developing countries, to help promote economic growth through expanded international trade. Currendy, over 4,400
products and product categories are eligible under the program for duty-free
entry from designated beneficiaries—over 140 developing countries and territories in total—and another 1,783 products are eligible for duty-free entry
from least developed beneficiaries only. The value of U.S. GSP duty-free
imports in 1998 was $16.3 billion. However, lapses in authorization of the
program, which have occurred several times over the past 5 years, have
tended to detract from its efficacy, by creating uncertainty for investors and
importers.

Addressing Concerns About Adjustment
As markets become more open, some domestic industries will expand
while others may contract. Although globalization provides benefits overall,
the adjustments that businesses and workers in shrinking industries may
undergo can be costly and painful. Although, as noted above, economic studies typically find that trade is a small factor in U.S. job displacement, some
workers may face short-term unemployment, and others may even face permanent wage reductions if they are unable to find comparable jobs in
expanding sectors.
Trade, like other sources of economic growth, therefore presents challenges
at home. But the fact that trade produces additional income means that, in
principle, resources are available to help those who are hurt—either to adapt
by becoming more productive and competitive at what they were already
doing, or to switch activities. One way to help in the transition is to develop




Chapter 6 I 223

programs that directly address the problems of dislocation. Another is to
encourage trade while limiting the pace at which change occurs, as the United States has done by phasing in provisions of the WTO agreements and
applying safeguard measures. Such gradualism may be desirable under certain circumstances, but trying to prevent liberalization altogether would be
counterproductive. Permanent protection inevitably costs more, in terms of
benefits forgone, than it saves. The key lies in maintaining an economy that
is sufficiendy flexible and vibrant to meet the challenges of reaping those
benefits.
To address problems of worker dislocation, regardless of cause, the Administration has developed new programs to assist in job search and training.
These programs add to the assistance already available to displaced workers
through the Federal Trade Adjustment Assistance program. The Workforce
Investment Act of 1998 retains a funding stream for dislocated workers and
promotes customer access to services and information, as well as customer
choice, through a One-Stop delivery system and through Individual Training
Accounts. The Administration is also acting to ensure that Lifetime Learning
tax credits and scholarships are available to assist workers in preparing for
new jobs. Federal job and talent banks are meanwhile providing mechanisms
for helping millions of U.S. workers find new jobs. For example, on a single
day in January 2000, Americas Job Bank listed over 1.5 million jobs.
The WTO agreements and U.S. trade laws also provide a cushion during
periods of adjustment. For example, key features of the Agreement on Agriculture and the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing phase in gradually over
periods of 6 to 10 years. Moreover, the WTO agreements allow countries to
use certain forms of safeguards to protect themselves temporarily against
import surges that seriously injure or threaten to seriously injure a domestic
industry. The United States has invoked its own safeguard provisions three
times since the creation of the WTO, in cases involving corn brooms, wheat
gluten, and lamb meat.

Addressing Concerns About Core Labor Standards and
the Environment
During the Seattle Ministerial, some participants and observers raised
important questions about the relationships between trade and labor and
between trade and the environment. The Administration is committed to
ensuring that the benefits of trade are shared broadly and do not come at the
expense of core labor standards or the environment. Economic evidence, presented below, suggests that trade can support labor and environmental objectives rather than obstruct them.
Over time, the United States has developed strategies to address international labor and environmental considerations through a variety of means.
224 I Economic Report of the President




For example, preferential U.S. trade programs contain criteria for workers'
rights: legislation for the U.S. GSP program states that the President shall not
designate any country a beneficiary developing country if "such country has
not taken or is not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker
rights to workers in the country...." The North American Free Trade Agreement contains side agreements on labor and the environment. At the same
time, the United States has sought to promote core labor standards and environmental goals through multilateral institutions such as the International
Labor Organization and the United Nations Environment Program. During
negotiations in Seattle, the United States proposed to strengthen the W T O s
links to these and other relevant international organizations. The United
States is also seeking to create a working group on trade and labor in the
W T O , to better understand the linkages between them. And just before the
Seattle Ministerial, the President issued an executive order for the United
States to conduct environmental reviews of certain kinds of trade agreements.
Economic evidence suggests that trade can support both labor and environmental objectives, in part through its positive effect on economic growth.
For example, analysis using wage, employment, and income data to study the
relationship between economic development and working conditions in
Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan has found that
these conditions generally improved as the economies developed. Studies of
the relationship between pollution and income per capita are also revealing:
in several cross-country analyses of emissions patterns of air and water
pollutants, emissions seem to increase with income at low incomes and fall
with income at high incomes. As countries become wealthier, they may
eventually become cleaner, perhaps because of increased demand for environmental protection. Recognizing that trade and environmental objectives
can be mutually supportive in even more direct ways, the United States is
seeking to eliminate fishery subsidies that contribute to overfishing and to
eliminate tariffs on environmental goods.
Nevertheless, international trade occurs in the context of domestic policy.
Although sovereign nations bear responsibility for adopting sound domestic
policies, the international community can contribute its expertise. In this
regard, the United States has proposed measures in the W T O to provide technical assistance on implementing trade policy and on strengthening institutions in developing countries responsible for trade, labor, environmental, and
other policies that influence the gains to living standards from trade.

Managing Capital Flows and the Macroeconomy
Globalization raises other challenges as well: flows of goods, services, and
capital can be the source of macroeconomic shocks. To take an extreme
example, the crisis in emerging markets that began in Thailand in 1997




Chapter 6 I 225

demonstrated the potential adverse consequences of volatile capital flows.
The crisis also highlighted the need for developing countries to strengthen
their domesticfinancialsystems and adopt appropriate macroeconomic policies, including consistent monetary and exchange rate policies, to cope with
this volatility. Such policies allow countries to capture more fully the benefits
of an increasingly globalfinancialsystem and to minimize their vulnerability
to crises. Of course, for some very poor countries the challenge is not that
capital flows are too volatile, but that they are insufficient. Recent policy
initiatives, discussed below, aim to distribute the benefits of global capital
flows more broadly.

International Financial Crises and the New Financial Architecture
A particular concern is the potential role of sudden swings in capital flows
in precipitating afinancialcrisis—a phenomenon marked by extreme financial market volatility and macroeconomic instability. An economic crisis
can, of course, occur in a country that is closed to trade and capitalflows,but
adding an international dimension to the crisis can in some cases make the
situation even worse. We have seen how international capital flows provide
important benefits in allocating resources efficiently and promoting growth.
But sometimes capital—especially short-term capital, such as overnight bank
loans—can flow out of a country very quickly. For example, capital might
leave a developing country in response to new information about the country or to a change in industrial-country interest rates. But whatever drives
them, rapid outflows can force a sudden and cosdy adjustment in financial
markets and the real economy.
A series of crises in emerging market economies in the 1990s have brought
these issues to the fore. In Mexico in 1994 and 1995, policy shortcomings,
weakness in Mexico's balance sheet, andfinancialmarket volatility combined
to create a sharp liquidity crunch and a steep fall in output. The crisis that
began in Thailand in 1997 seems to fit the same pattern. That crisis quickly
spread to other Asian developing economies in 1997 before it began to ease
in mid-1998; it then, however, revived and spread to Russia, Brazil, and
several other Latin American countries in 1998 and early 1999.
Many emerging markets had exchange rate regimes that, to a greater or
lesser extent, involved pegging the value of the domestic currency to the dollar while retaining latitude to adjust the pegged rate or even float the currency. For these economies the initial manifestation of the crisis was a sharp fall
in reserves, which forced abandonment of the pegged rate; the currency's
value then fell precipitously. Stock markets also dropped sharply. Severe
declines in output soon followed. For example, annual output growth had
averaged about 7 percent from 1990 to 1996 in the five "front-line" Asian
crisis economies (Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand).

226 I Economic Report of the President




By contrast, in 1998 output fell on average by 7 percent in these economies.
Large swings in capital flows required corresponding adjustments in the current account balances of these five economies, which shifted from combined
deficits of $54 billion in 1996 and $25 billion in 1997 to a combined surplus
of $69 billion in 1998.
Last year's Economic Report of the President discussed the recent emerging
markets crisis at length. The crisis and the virulent contagion that ensued did
not have a single, simple cause. Nevertheless, in some Asian countries, structural weaknesses, particularly in financial intermediation, appear to have
been a key source of vulnerability. Weak financial systems intermediate
resources poorly, so capital is not allocated efficiently. The combination of lax
financial supervision and regulation, a tradition of lending to politically
favored borrowers, and poor corporate governance, led in turn to considerable lending to low-productivity projects. In some cases, domestic and international capital liberalization may have exacerbated the problems caused by
these distortions, by allowing banks and firms to borrow more money at
lower rates in international markets than was advisable.
Insufficiently prudent management of the national balance sheet compounded these weaknesses. Too many countries involved in recent crises were
seeking short-term capital from abroad. In Thailand, for example, the
Bangkok International Banking Facility enabled Thai banks and firms to
borrow heavily abroad in foreign currency at very short maturities, and the
government decided to mortgage its foreign exchange reserves in forward
markets. Fixed but adjustable exchange rates in some countries gave the illusion of currency stability, and low levels of usable reserves created vulnerability to a sudden turn in confidence that ultimately became self-perpetuating.
As the psychology of the market shifted, the opportunity to fix the underlying problems that triggered the crisis without up-ending the economy
drained away.
These weaknesses interacted with an inadequate focus on risk on the part
of banks and investors in industrial countries, which had contributed to the
rapid inflows of capital in the first place. This combination of structural
weaknesses, policy biases that favored risky forms of finance, and an insufficient regard for risk led ultimately to an abrupt collapse in confidence that
spread outward from Asia in 1997, as investors realized the extent of their
exposure. Once confidence was lost, the problems in the affected countries
were compounded by rapid and self-fulfilling outflows of capital.
How can countries and the international financial system retain the benefits of capital flows discussed earlier while making crises both less likely and
less virulent? The debate over the new international financial architecture, as
it has come to be known, seeks to address this question. The Mexican crisis
of 1994-95 sparked the search for policies that could prevent large swings in




Chapter 6 I 227

capital flows, but the emerging markets crisis of 1997-99 gave it particular
urgency. The United States has taken the lead in these efforts.
The quest for a more stable global financial system is important for industrial economies as well as for emerging market economies. After all, the
emerging markets crises had effects on both the real and the financial sector
in the United States and in Europe and Japan. Together with continued
weakness (indeed, outright recession) in Japan in 1997 and 1998, the crises
reduced income growth abroad, which in turn cut U.S. exports. Some sectors
of the economy—agriculture and manufacturing in particular—clearly
suffered from the loss of export markets and from increased import competition. At the same time, weakness in the currencies of the crisis-stricken
countries implied an appreciation of the dollar in both real and nominal
terms, which made foreign products more competitive both abroad and in
the United States. The crises overseas have at times also had significant
repercussions on U.S. financial markets. In the period following Russia's
default on its sovereign debt in August 1998, U.S. asset prices declined and
considerable financial market stress followed.
At certain junctures, the weak external environment and the possibility of
further financial market turmoil posed a clear risk to the continuing strong
performance of the U.S. economy. The downside risks for the United States
did not materialize, however, in part because of the policy response of U.S.
authorities in the fall of 1998 and the financial packages assembled by the
International Monetary Fund. Most Asian emerging market economies
resumed growth in 1999. However, for much of this period the world economy was essentially flying on one engine: the robust performance of the U.S.
economy. Indeed, during this period, the openness of the U.S. market helped
cushion the adverse effects of the crisis on output and employment abroad.
Thus events abroad create important policy challenges at home. For this reason, promoting the new international financial architecture is in Americas
own self-interest.
A consensus is emerging on the broad outlines of this new architecture
(Box 6-3). A central lesson of the crises of the 1990s is that countries largely
shape their own destinies. Hence, building a sound global financial system
requires that individual countries work to ensure that their financial systems
and macroeconomic policies are sound, consistent, and transparent. Improving transparency, for example, requires improved accounting standards and
timely reporting of data. These steps can minimize the information problems
that contribute to swings in capital flows. In addition, the recent crises
demonstrate the critical importance of the choice of exchange rate regime in
reducing a country's vulnerability to crisis. Whatever regime is adopted
should be credible and supported by consistent macroeconomic policies and
robust financial systems.

228 I Economic Report of the President




Box 6-3. The New International Financial Architecture
The international community, under U.S. leadership, has proposed a
set of reforms to strengthen the international financial system. On the
general principle that a market-based system provides the best
prospects for a sound global economy, these reforms seek to improve
crisis prevention and the international community's response to crisis
in ways that allow markets to operate effectively.
Last year's Economic Report of the President described the background behind the major reform proposals and outlined their chief features. Since then, work has continued within the Group of Seven (G-7)
large industrial countries and with key emerging market countries to
explore ways to improve and implement these reforms. The United
States has continued to play a leading role in these efforts. At its June
1999 summit in Cologne, Germany, the G-7 released a report on financial architecture.The report emphasized reforms in six areas:
• Strengthening and reforming the international financial institutions—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank—
and arrangements for international cooperation
• Enhancing the transparency of financial institutions and markets
and promoting best practices, to enable market participants to make
informed judgments about risk and provide greater incentives for
policymakers to implement sound policies
• Strengthening financial regulation in industrialized countries, so that
creditors will act with greater discipline and assess more prudently
the risks associated with their lending
• Strengthening macroeconomic policies and financial systems in
emerging markets, to allow borrowers in emerging markets to benefit fully from integration into the international financial system
• Improving crisis prevention and management and involving the private sector, to ensure that all participants will expect to bear the consequences of the risks they take, and to reduce the risk of financial
market contagion
• Promoting social policies to protect the poor and most vulnerable.
The Administration has pushed forward with this effort in several
ways. It has made the terms of exceptional financing support more
market-based through the creation of the IMF's Supplementary
Reserve Facility and, most recently, its Contingent Credit Line (CCL). It
has also helped countries develop stronger national financial systems,
including through the incentives embodied in the terms of the CCL.

Chapter 6 I 229

Box 6-3. — continued
In addition, to promote dialogue on key economic and financial issues,
a new informal mechanism known as the G-20 (a group of key industrial and emerging market economies that account for more than 80
percent of world GDP) met for the first time in December 1999. This
group will be focusing on how countries can further reduce their
vulnerability to modern capital account crises.

Improvements in national policies are necessary to strengthen the international financial system, but not sufficient. Policies and incentives must also
be appropriate at an international level, as discussed in Box 6-3. These
reforms seek to reduce the incidence and severity of future crises by providing suitable incentives for the effective working of a market-oriented system.
When reversals of capital flows do occur, an important task is to keep the
damage to a minimum. Several actions can help in this regard. First, it
appears clear that countries should avoid policy biases that encourage excessive reliance on short-term, foreign currency-denominated debt, since it is
those flows that can flee most quickly. Second, ensuring that the financial
system is sound can enable a country to cope with capital and exchange rate
movements without excessive damage to financial intermediation.

Debt Relief for Developing Countries
An important goal of the proposed reforms of the international financial
system is to ensure that countries realize the substantial benefits of open markets in trade and investment. However, some of the world s poorest nations
are not benefiting from globalization. Many developing countries have
unsustainable debts and policies that are not conducive to economic growth
and development. Recognizing the need to integrate these countries into the
global economy, the United States has actively pursued several multilateral
and bilateral initiatives to reduce their debt burden.
Most recently, the United States helped forge an international consensus
among the G-7, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and
other creditors to provide broader, faster, and deeper debt relief to many of the
worlds poorest, most heavily indebted nations. Together with previous debt
relief commitments, the June 1999 Cologne Debt Initiative, which expanded
on the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative of 1996, may
reduce these countries' combined nominal debt by as much as $90 billion, in
return for genuine reforms aimed at reducing poverty and encouraging longrun economic growth. The combined external debts of the 33 HIPCs most
likely to benefit from the Cologne Debt Initiative were estimated at $127
billion in 1998, or nearly 120 percent of their combined GNP.
230 I Economic Report of the President




The key objective of the initiative is to strengthen the links among
poverty reduction, debt relief, and sound economic policy so as to foster
development. Countries seeking eligibility for debt relief must meet several
requirements. They must undertake macroeconomic reforms, such as inflation stabilization. They must place increased emphasis on channeling the
benefits of debt relief to poverty reduction, especially in the areas of health
care and education. They must make efforts to improve governance, especially in establishing participatory processes with civil society and ensuring
transparency. In consultation with the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank, eligible countries will design poverty reduction strategies that
allow them to use the savings from debt relief to fight poverty effectively.
Openness has increased opportunity and prosperity in both industrialized
and developing countries. In order to benefit, however, countries must have
policies in place that are conducive to economic growth, and they should not
be held back by unsustainable debts. As the Cologne Debt Initiative encourages growth and stability in return for debt reduction, it will benefit creditors
and debtors alike by creating new opportunities for trade, investment, and
the development of human capital.

The Trade and Current Account Deficits
Throughout the second half of the 1990s, the U.S. trade and current
account deficits rose steadily. In the third quarter of 1999, the current
account deficit (a comprehensive measure that comprises not only the trade
deficit in goods and services but also net income and transfers) reached a
record relative to GDP—even as the U.S. unemployment rate stood at its
lowest level in 30 years. It is worth recalling that the benefits of openness,
including higher real incomes, are realized no matter what the size of the
external deficit. By themselves, external trade and current account deficits are
neither inherently good nor inherently bad. What matter are the reasons for
the deficits. The main reason for the deficits today appears to be the strength
of the U.S. economic expansion relative to the slow or negative growth in
many other countries.
By definition, a trade deficit occurs when a country's domestic spending
exceeds its domestic production. The shortfall is then made up by importing
more goods than are exported. When the United States runs a trade deficit,
foreigners buy less than a dollar's worth of U.S. goods for every dollar they
earn from their export sales to us. The natural question to ask is, What do
foreigners do with the dollars left over after they buy those U.S. goods? In
practice, they typically invest those excess dollars in U.S. assets. The desire of
foreigners to purchase attractive U.S. assets—in essence, to lend us the
money needed to finance a trade deficit—makes the deficit possible. In other
words, there is necessarily a link between the international flow of goods and




Chapter 6 I 231

services and the international flow of financial resources. In fact, one can as
readily argue that the desire of foreigners to acquire attractive U.S. assets is
responsible for the U.S. trade deficit as the reverse.
This link between theflowof goods and services and the flow of financial
resources highlights another way of looking at the trade and current account
deficits. From a national accounting perspective, a country's current account
balance equals the difference between national saving and domestic investment (plus a statistical discrepancy and after minor adjustments). When the
demand for domestic investment in the United States exceeds the pool of
national saving, borrowing from foreigners—a rise in national indebtedness—makes up the difference. Conversely, when saving exceeds investment,
the surplus is invested abroad.
Is it good or bad for a country to get into debt? The answer obviously
depends on what the country does with the money. What matters for future
incomes and living standards is whether the deficit is being used to finance
more consumption or more investment.
In this respect, the deficit in the 1990s differs radically from that in the
1980s. The United States experienced large current account deficits in the
mid-1980s (Chart 6-7), when net domestic investment fell as a share of
GDP, and net national saving fell even faster. By contrast, in the current
expansion the deficit has been associated with rising shares of GDP devoted
to both investment and saving. The deficit s growth indicates that the rise in
national saving, due to reduction of the Federal budget deficit, has not kept
pace with the increase in investment. It signals rising investment rather than
falling saving.
That a falling trade balance can coincide with a robust economy is no
surprise; indeed, both economic theory and empirical observation lead one
to expect such a pattern. A strong economy raises demand for imports and is
generally associated with high demand for investment. As Chart 6-8 shows,
GDP growth in the United States' trading partners as a group fell sharply in
1998, reflecting weaker growth in Europe, recession in Japan, and outright
crisis in emerging markets. By contrast, U.S. growth remained robust. Since
the end of 1997, the U.S. trade deficit has risen from about 1 percent of
GDP (its average throughout the mid-1990s) to about 3 percent. The
dramatic difference between U.S. and foreign growth appears to be the
primary cause of the increase in the deficit, as demand grew more rapidly for
all products, including imports, in the United States than elsewhere. From
the perspective of capital flows, expected returns on investment have been
relatively attractive in the United States. As a result, the United States has
absorbed substantial net inflows of capital. Whether viewed as a phenomenon in the international flow of goods and services or as a phenomenon in
the international flow offinancialresources, the result of these recent devel-

Chapter 6 I 233

opments was that the U.S. trade and current account balances swung much
more sharply into deficit.
Exchange rate movements, reflecting in part the desirability of U.S. assets,
have also contributed to the rising trade deficit by affecting the relative price
of imports and exports. Chart 6-9 shows that, over the past several decades,
the trade deficit has tended to rise when the dollar has strengthened. Between
1995 and 1998 the dollar appreciated, although by less than in the 1980s.
In addition to these factors, some of the recent increase in the trade and
current account deficits (and in the corresponding capital inflows) may
reflect other, more persistent factors. A possible explanation for such a "structural" current account deficit, as well as for some of its recent increase, is
faster U.S. productivity growth, as discussed in Chapter 2. If productivity
growth has risen more in the United States than in other countries, this fact
tends to make the United States a particularly attractive place for investment,
since the expected returns to capital then rise. Capital may then flow into the
United States to finance this higher investment. To the extent this story
applies to the United States today, it again emphasizes the relative strength of
the U.S. economy.
Clearly, then, large trade and current account deficits can easily coincide
with a strong and robust economy, as they do today. Hence, a trade deficit
does not by itself have implications for the overall level of employment. Nevertheless, some sectors of the U.S. economy, such as manufacturing, may be
harmed by increased competition from foreign imports and from reduced

demand for exports. It would be a mistake, however, to simply equate a manufacturing trade deficit with job loss in that sector. The inflows of capital into
the United States that finance the trade deficit have allowed the economy to
operate at higher levels of domestic investment than it could have otherwise.
Higher investment, in turn, helps boost demand for manufacturing output.
Nevertheless, since the onset of the Asian financial crisis, manufacturing
employment does appear to have been adversely affected by the reduced
demand for U.S. exports. Between the first quarter of 1993 and the fourth
quarter of 1997, U.S. manufacturing firms added about 700,000 workers to
their payrolls. However, between the fourth quarter of 1997 and the fourth
quarter of 1999, manufacturing employment fell by about 440,000 workers.
The economy has remained at a high level of employment throughout this
period—and has added more than 20 million new jobs since January
1993—which suggests that many of these displaced workers have found jobs
elsewhere in the economy. As discussed earlier in this chapter, policy may also
be able to help ease the adjustments resulting from trade.
In sum, although some adjustments have been necessary, todays trade and
current account deficits reflect the relative strength of the U.S. economy.
These deficits are essentially a macroeconomic phenomenon, reflecting a
higher rate of domestic investment than of national saving. They have
allowed U.S. firms to continue to invest at high rates even in a high-employment economy.
A vast array of factors affect the level of the deficit, by influencing the decisions of private individuals and firms, so it is very difficult to be precise about
the "appropriate" level of the deficit. Nevertheless, for any given level of the
current account deficit, one must keep several principles in mind.
First, the better are the United States' terms of trade—that is, the higher
the prices we receive for our exports, and the lower the prices we pay for our
imports—the higher Americans' incomes will be. Working to open large foreign markets can stimulate exports and improve the terms of trade. By contrast, closing markets in the United States through protectionist measures is
counterproductive and should play no part in the policy response to the current account deficit. Measures such as higher tariffs and quotas do discourage
imports by making them more expensive, but they also make our economy
less efficient and reduce national income. Besides making Americans poorer,
such protectionist measures would not necessarily have much effect on the
current account balance, because they are unlikely to have much effect on
either saving or investment.
Second, for any given level of the current account deficit, the United States
is better off if it remains open and attractive to foreign investment, provided
these capital flows are channeled into productive uses. Chapter 3 discussed
the role of policy in nurturing innovation, which in turn leads to productive
investment opportunities for the private sector. In addition, it is important to




Chapter 6 I 235

continue prudential regulation of the financial system, to help it remain
sound and keep pace with new technology and deregulation. The strong U.S.
financial system is well positioned to channel capital inflows into profitable
uses, and it is important to maintain that strength.
Although, again, the appropriate level of the current account deficit is difficult to assess, at least two principles are relevant should it prove necessary to
reduce the deficit. First, the United States has an interest in policies that
stimulate foreign growth, since it is better to reduce the current account
deficit through faster growth abroad than through slower growth at home. A
recession at home would obviously be a highly undesirable means of reducing the deficit. The cyclical component of the deficit, caused by declines in
global demand in recent years, should reverse itself as the world economy
recovers. For the future, the new international financial architecture, discussed earlier, should help maintain stronger and more stable foreign growth.
Second, any reductions in the deficit are better achieved through increased
national saving than through reduced domestic investment. If there are
attractive investment opportunities in the United States, we are better off
borrowing from abroad to finance these opportunities than forgoing them.
On the other hand, incomes in this country would be even higher in the
future if these investments were financed through higher national saving.
The United States needs policies that make saving more attractive. Indeed,
the Administration has proposed substantial tax cuts to promote saving,
especially among low- and moderate-income families who currently save relatively little. The United States also needs to maintain prudent fiscal policies.
Here again, the Administrations proposals, which would lead to large and
growing budget surpluses in the decade to come, are highly desirable.
A growth strategy for the United States based on continued prudent fiscal
policy would also extend macroeconomic assistance to the problems faced by
the manufacturing sector. By increasing national saving, such a policy would
allow interest rates to remain lower than they would otherwise be. Lower
interest rates would lead to higher domestic investment, which, in turn,
would boost demand for equipment and construction. For any given level of
investment, increased saving would also result in higher net exports, which
would again raise employment in these sectors.

Conclusion
Over the long term, increasing the standard of living in the United States
requires that Americans embrace change. We should not retreat from the
constant succession of new opportunities that arise in an ever-changing
world economy. The United States has long welcomed the opportunities that

236 I Economic Report of the President




integrating with the world economy provides. Growing international integration has benefited Americans profoundly, contributing to our increasing
prosperity It is clearly in our interest to forge ahead, both promoting and
guiding the process of international economic integration.
Yet at the same time we must confront the very real challenges that arise
from economic globalization. We must find ways to share its benefits as
widely as possible, both at home and abroad. International policy on trade
and capital flows plays an important role in ensuring that we capture the
benefits of international economic integration.
Ultimately, however, our prosperity in the global economy depends primarily on our policies at home. The right policies for this task include those
that encourage aflexibleand skilled work force, that build an economic system in which innovation is rewarded, and that ensure that the U.S. financial
system is sound and deep.

Making Markets Work for the Environment

In 1900, one of the most common environmental problems confronting cities was the
accumulation of horse manure on streets, giving offense to sight and smell and posing a
public health hazard. Although the automobile eventually solved this problem, it caused
others. Economic growth, structural change, and technobgical change over the past century
gave rise to new environmental problems but also provided the income and know-how
needed to address them. Innovative efforts to remedy these problems through market-based
incentives help achieve environmental goals cost-effectively and provide lessons to guide
efforts to solve the worldspotentially most significant environmental challenge in the 21st
century: global climate change.

"T? conomic growth brings abundant benefits but can also unleash a wide array
JJ^of environmental problems. Some, like water pollution, air pollution, and
soil contamination, are by now long-familiar afflictions; others, like changes in
the earths atmosphere and climate, are of more recent onset. All must be dealt
with, or else the very foundation of growth is threatened. Fortunately the same
economic growth, structural change, and technological change that gave rise to
these problems also provide the income and the know-how needed to address
them. An economy that is healthy and thriving is better able to combat
environmental ills. The challenge in addressing environmental problems lies in
harnessing and channeling the power of markets, so that they both deliver
continued economic growth and foster sound environmental practices.

The past century of experience in addressing environmental pollution illustrates that environmental goals must and can be achieved cost-effectively.
Innovative efforts to address environmental problems through market-based
incentives—such as emissions permit trading and emissions charges—can,
when designed appropriately and applied in the appropriate context, achieve
these goals at lower cost than other approaches. Poorly designed environmental markets and regulatory schemes, on the other hand, can squander
valuable resources in the pursuit of environmental goals. Importantly, lessons
learned in one environmental initiative can often be applied to others. In
particular, the lessons already learned from addressing pollution in its various
local manifestations can guide efforts to solve the world s potentially most
significant environmental challenge in the 21st century: global climate
change. The global nature of the problem illustrates the need to provide
innovative incentives to global markets to address the potential damages.

Environmental Problems Since 1900
The nature of environmental pollution has changed during the past 100
years, reflecting, in large part, technological change and the changing
structure of the economy. As fresh innovations allow firms and industries to
reallocate their resources to more productive uses, the by-products of their
production processes also change.

A Brief History of Environmental Problems
In 1900, one of the most common environmental problems confronting
cities was the waste associated with the primary means of transportation, the
horse. People traveling short distances usually rode either on horseback or in
horse-drawn carriages. In densely populated cities, horse manure covered
many streets, not only giving offense to sight and smell but also posing a
public health hazard. The automobile eventually solved this problem but
brought new ones in its wake.
As the century progressed, new environmental problems caught the
publics attention. Before the introduction of filtration in 1889 and chlorination in 1908, outbreaks of typhoid fever from drinking contaminated
water were common. Investments in new treatment technologies addressed
this concern, and by 1958, 83 percent of the U.S. population had access to
filtered or disinfected drinking water. The dust bowl phenomenon of the
1930s illustrated the potential for agriculture to result in serious soil erosion,
as the wind carried away significant amounts of topsoil.

240 I Economic Report of the President




After World War II, faster growth and structural change led to a variety of
new environmental problems. The Donora, Pennsylvania, "killer smog" of
1948 that took 20 lives demonstrated the seriousness of the public health
threat posed by air pollution. The agrochemical revolution greatly increased
agricultural yields, but the roughly threefold increase in pesticide tonnage
between 1964 and 1982 also raised concerns about the effects of these chemicals on the environment and on human and animal health. One of these was
the impact of the pesticide D D T on the bald eagle, as detailed in Rachel
Carson's 1962 book Silent Spring. A burning river in Cleveland and air
pollution so thick that cars drove with headlights on during the day made
manifest the growing water and air quality problems of the 1960s.
Growing attention to many of these problems culminated in Earth Day in
1970. That event helped spur the series of groundbreaking environmental
laws of the 1970s, such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
Endangered Species Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act. In the late 1970s, incidents at Love Canal,
New York, and elsewhere revealed concerns about the use and disposal of
toxic and hazardous substances. The Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) currently has more than 1,200 Superfund sites—areas designated as
most contaminated with hazardous wastes—on its national priority list for
cleanup and remediation. The hole in the atmospheres ozone layer that
appears each spring over Antarctica, first detected during the 1980s, demonstrates the destructive effect of chlorofluorocarbons on this fragile but critical
structure. In the 1990s the scientific community concluded that the balance
of scientific evidence suggested that emissions of greenhouse gases from
human activity have a discernible influence on the global climate.

Environmental Pollution and Development
This sampler of environmental problems in the United States over the past
100 years mirrors the path of the Nations economic development. For example,
early in the century as the economy developed, emissions of sulfur dioxide
(SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) increased at a faster rate than economic
growth. However, in the 1920s and 1930s, emissions relative to gross national
product (GNP) began to fall for both of these air pollutants. In 1997 the U.S.
economy was only one-third as NOx-intensive as it had been in 1900 (that is,
1997 NO X emissions per unit of output were one-third the level of 1900 emissions) and only one-tenth as SO2-intensive as in 1900 (Chart 7-1). Although
these trends may have reflected significant changes in the economy and more
effective emissions control since the 1970s, current levels of NO X and SO 2 emissions still present public health risks in the United States. Much the same has
happened with carbon dioxide (Chart 7-2). The continuing transition of the
U.S. economy away from traditional energy-intensive industries has reduced

carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GNP (Box 7-1). Advances in energy
technology and changes in primary energy sources may have contributed to this
improvement.
Box 7-1. Structural Economic Change and Carbon
Dioxide Emissions
Historically, U.S. carbon dioxide (C02) emissions from energy use
have grown about 2/3 percent for every 1 percent increase in real gross
domestic product (GDP). In general, a variety of factors besides growth
in aggregate output can affect C0 2 emissions.
Structural change.Jhe U.S. economy continues to experience a shift
of its output composition away from traditionally energy-intensive
manufacturing sectors.
Weather. Cold winters increase the demand for heating fuels, and
hot summers increase the demand for electricity for cooling. Because
heating on a cold day is more energy-intensive than cooling on a hot
day, on balance a warmer year tends to reduce energy use.
Energy prices. Sharp energy price increases can stimulate energy
efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions, whereas energy price decreases
can result in higher energy consumption and higher CO2 emissions.
Technological change. Technological improvements can reduce the
consumption of energy necessary to generate a unit of output. Higher
energy prices can accelerate the diffusion of more energy-efficient
technologies, as can government programs aimed at promoting energy
efficiency.
In 1998, U.S. C0 2 emissions from energy use grew 0.4 percent, while
output in non-high-technology industries grew just 2.3 percent—less
than the 4.3 percent increase in aggregate GDP and less than the longterm trend rate of growth of 3.1 percent per year for this group of
industries.This slow emissions growth probably reflected not only the
long-term shift toward high technology and services in the economy
but also weakness in several energy-intensive industries, such as
chemicals and primary metals. Weather, too, played a role in moderating energy use.The winter months of 1998 were 8 percent warmer than
the same months in the previous year. The summer of 1998 was also
warmer than the previous year's, but the increase in emissions from
more summer cooling was less than the reduction in emissions from
less winter heating. Finally, electricity prices changed little, and fossil
fuel prices actually fell, between 1997 and 1998.
A statistical model of how structural change, weather conditions,
and energy prices influenced U.S. CO2 emissions over the 1962-98
period found that these emissions track non-high-technology output
very closely. After accounting for non-high-technology output, weather,

Box 7-1.—continued
and energy prices, the level of 1998 emissions predicted by the model
was very close to (0.5 percent less than) actual 1998 emissions. This
suggests that short-term technological change independent of these
factors was not an important determinant of the 1998 emissions. As the
high-technology component of the economy continues to grow as a
share of the total, CO2 emissions growth should slow further/This
would maintain the long-term trend since the 1920s toward a less CO2intensive economy (Chart 7-2). As of 1996, for example, the economy
was only about one-third as CO2-intensive as the economy of 1900,
possibly reflecting both increased diversity of fuels and change in the
composition of GDP. Although it is less CO2-intensive, growth in U.S.
economic output over this century has resulted in a substantial
increase in CO2 emissions.

Many of the same problems are evident today in countries at various earlier
stages of their economic development than the United States. The challenge for
these countries is to pursue a "cleaner" development path. As they continue
to develop and become wealthier, they will have the opportunity to benefit
from the experience of the United States and other rich countries in addressing the environmental risks that economic activity generates. In some cases
the United States was reactive to environmental problems in the past,
because the scientific understanding of various environmental risks, as well as
the technologies and policies to address them, lagged the need. Further, the
United States lacks a coherent framework for accounting for environmental
quality and natural resource use in tandem with market economic activity.
A recent National Research Council report, for example, calls for a supplement to the national income and product accounts that would include assets
and production activities associated with natural resources and the environment. This information, combined with traditional measures of economic
welfare such as gross domestic product, can provide a more complete picture
of this Nations economic development (Box 7-2).
In contrast to the U.S. experience, those technologies and policies are there to
be adopted almost off the shelf, and that means developing countries can be
proactive, instituting appropriate policies to focus their development along a
path that accounts for the costs of pollution. Appropriate policies may allow
developing countries to leapfrog the more developed ones in environmental
technology, in the way that some already have in communications technology.
Just as some countries have adopted fully digitized wireless phone systems without first having built extensive traditional wired systems, so developing countries
can effectively skip a generation of more pollution-intensive technologies and

244 I Economic Report of the President




Box 7-2. Taking Account of the Environment
A National Research Council (NRC) report released in July 1999 concluded that extending the U.S. national income and product accounts
(NIPAs) to include assets and production activities associated with natural resources and the environment is an essential investment for the
Nation. The report argues that it would be even more valuable to
develop a comprehensive set of environmental and other nonmarket
accounts, although not at the expense of maintaining and improving
the current core national accounts.
The NIPAs were designed to measure production and income that
arise primarily from the market economy. However, much economic
activity takes place outside the market economy. Thus, by omitting
important activities such as nonmarket work, environmental services,
and investment in human capital, the NIPAs provide an incomplete and
potentially misleading picture. Recognizing this, private scholars and
governments have begun to develop methods of extending the
national accounts to measure as much economic activity as is feasible,
whether that activity takes place inside or outside marketplace boundaries. In the United States, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
began intensive work on environmental accounting in 1992, but it was
directed by the Congress in 1994 to suspend further work and seek an
external review of environmental accounting. The NRC report represents that review.
The NRC panel argues that environmental and natural resource
accounts would provide useful data on resource trends and help governments, businesses, and individuals better plan their economic
activities and investments. These accounts would provide valuable
information on the interaction between the environment and the economy; they would help in determining whether the Nation is using its
stocks of natural resources and environmental assets in a sustainable
manner; and they would provide information on the implications of
different regulations, taxes, and consumption patterns.
The NRC panel supports developing a broad set of accounts that
would parallel each of several asset types. These include subsoil
mineral assets such as fossil fuels and metals; renewable and other
natural resources such as forests, agricultural resources, and fisheries;
and environmental assets such as clean air and water. It is acknowledged that the last category poses considerably greater conceptual
and data challenges than the first two. To preserve the integrity of the
well-developed core income and product accounts, the NRC panel
supports the BEA's preference for developing natural resource and
environmental accounts as satellite or supplemental accounts.
Satellite accounts serve the basic purpose of the national accounts in

providing useful information. In addition, and in light of the current
state of knowledge and preliminary nature of the data and methodologies involved, developing satellite accounts allows experimentation and encourages the testing of a wide variety of approaches.

adopt less polluting technologies from the start. Because knowledge and
technology developed in one country can diffuse itself worldwide, economic
development does not have to result in the same stream of environmental
problems that die United States and other industrial countries have suffered
since 1900.

Designing Policies to Address
Environmental Pollution
Private markets by themselves usually do not provide the needed incentive
for producers and consumers to take into account the costs of the environmental pollution they impose on others. For example, a pulp-and-paper mill
will aim to minimize all the inputs it must buy in the market, such as labor
and capital, in the production of a unit of fiber product. But if it is unregulated, the mill has no economic incentive to minimize its water pollution,
because it does not have to pay for the damage that its pollution causes.
Absent appropriate policies that provide an incentive for producers to
account for pollution costs, economic activity produces too much pollution.
Lacking this incentive, the mill also lacks the incentive to invest in research
and development (R&D) into pollution-reducing technologies. Welldesigned policies that create such an incentive in private markets could make
society better off. Of course, an excessively stringent policy might impose a high
cost on society, with little benefit at the margin. The costs of eliminating all
pollution, for example, could be so exorbitant that society would suffer from
having to forgo using those resources on other valuable endeavors, such as education, health care, or product R&D. The task that falls on policymakers, then,
is twofold: they must first set acceptable levels of pollution, and they must then
select and use policy instruments that will achieve these levels efficiently.
Economists have long argued that environmental goals should be set so
that the benefit from the last unit of pollution abatement is equal to the cost
of abating that last unit of pollution. However, environmental goals in
practice do not usually reflect such an explicit weighting of benefits and
costs. Consequently, some environmental policies may have gone too far,

246 I Economic Report of the President




imposing costs of pollution reduction that exceeded the benefits and making
society worse off. Other policies may have not gone far enough, lowering
pollution only to a level where the benefits of more reduction would have
still exceeded the costs. In some cases, benefit-cost analysis is legally
obstructed from guiding environmental policy, because environmental law
prevents regulatory agencies from even considering the costs of reaching the
goal. The Clean Air Act of 1970, for example, mandates that air quality
standards be set "to protect public health" with an "adequate margin of
safety," and the courts have ruled that the EPA Administrator cannot
consider the costs of achieving a clean air standard when setting that
standard.

Traditional Regulatory Approaches to Address
Environmental Pollution
Marked improvements in environmental quality have occurred over the
past century, and especially since 1970. These are due in large part to
technological innovations that have allowed industrial, energy, and
transportation activities to continue while significantly reducing their
impact on the environment. Although these gains are important, the
means of achieving them have often included inflexible mandates that
prescribe specific technologies and result in higher costs than may have
been necessary. As the costs of addressing pollution (which the EPA
estimated at $125 billion a year in 1990) have increased over the past three
decades, attention has come to focus more on the means of achieving
environmental goals.
Traditional regulations focused on setting technology and performance
standards for pollution sources. (Technology standards mandate specific
equipment that sources must use to control emissions. Performance
standards, in contrast, mandate a limit on emissions allowed by each source
but allow the source to choose how best to comply with the limit.)
However, since technology standards mandate the same technologies across
all sources, and performance requirements mandate the same level of
emissions reductions or emissions rates across sources regardless of any
heterogeneity in costs across sources, traditional regulation may not
necessarily result in cost-effective attainment of the environmental
standard in all areas. Only approaches that focus on eliciting emissions
abatement from those activities with the lowest marginal cost of abatement
will result in cost-effective attainment of an environmental standard.




Chapter 7 I 247

Incentive-Based Approaches to Address
Environmental Pollution
Two incentive-based approaches to environmental regulation, tradable
permit systems and emissions charges, have the potential to save substantial
resources in achieving environmental goals, because they promote the costeffective attainment of emissions reductions. Tradable permit systems apply
an aggregate emissions cap or quota to a set of emissions sources. The government then allocates among these sources a number of emissions permits
that equals the cap or quota. Allocation may be by auction, or on the basis of
the sources' historic emissions or desired performance levels, or by some
other approach. Each source must hold enough permits to cover the level of
emissions it chooses. Sources can buy and sell permits from each other, and
in a well-functioning market an equilibrium permit price will evolve that
reflects the value of an additional permit to all sources. Each firm managing
a source then faces the same trade-off: it can either cut back emissions by one
more unit or buy one more permit. Naturally, firms will cut back on emissions if it is cheaper to do so. The outcome will be that each firm equates its
marginal abatement costs to the permit price. And because all sources face
the same permit price, marginal abatement costs will be equalized across all
sources. This minimizes the costs associated with achieving a given goal. (Box
7-3 provides an illustration.)
The emissions charge approach requires that each emissions source pay a
charge based on its level of emissions. Sources will reduce their emissions
until the cost of reducing another unit of emissions is greater than the
charge. Just as in the case of tradable permits, the marginal cost of abatement
is uniform across sources.
Besides promoting cost-effective emissions reduction, tradable permits
and charges can promote technological innovation by stimulating R&D
investment in a wider range of abatement technologies and processes. When
this happens, emissions reductions may ultimately exceed those sought under
either technology or performance standards. Under regimes using tradable
permits or charges, each firm has the incentive to develop technologies and
production processes that reduce emissions regardless of the firms current
emissions level. If, in a tradable permit system, a firm reduces emissions
below what its permits allow, it can sell the unused permits to other firms;
similarly under a charge system, a firm that reduces emissions pays a lower
charge. Under a technology standard, two conditions must be satisfied for a
firm to have an incentive to invest in R&D for new, cheaper abatement technologies: it must believe that the cheaper technologies can achieve the same
level of emissions performance as existing technologies, and it must win
regulatory approval to use the cheaper technologies. Under a performance

Box 7-3. Emissions Trading: An Illustrative Example
Consider a hypothetical example of two neighboring power plants
that emit sulfur dioxide. Suppose that both plants emit 100 units of SO2
each year, so total emissions are 200 units, and a regulatory agency
has set an emissions target of 140 units per year for these two sources.
Under a traditional approach, the regulatory agency could mandate a
known technology (for example, an SO2 scrubber) that would reduce
both plants' emissions to 70 units each. Each plant would need to eliminate 30 units of emissions. Assume that it will cost Utility A $600 to
reduce the 30th unit of emissions, and $9,000 to reduce all 30 units of
emissions, and that it will cost Utility B $300 to reduce its 30th unit, and
$4,500 to reduce all 30 units. The total cost for both plants of reducing
emissions to 140 units per year is thus $13,500.
However, since the costs of reducing emissions vary significantly
between these two plants, a market-based approach can achieve substantial cost savings. If these two plants can engage in emissions trading,
they may find it economic for Utility B, with lower emissions abatement
costs, to reduce its emissions level below 70 units per year, allowing
Utility A to emit more than 70 units per year. Utility B finds that it can
reduce its emissions down to 60 units per year, at which point the 40th
unit of abatement costs $400, and the total cost of reducing all 40 units
is $8,000. Utility A can reduce emissions down to a level of 80 units per
year, at which point the 20th unit of abatement also costs $400, and the
total cost to reduce all 20 units of emissions is $4,000. Utility A would
save resources by purchasing tradable permits for 10 units of emissions at $400 a unit from Utility B, because this is less than it would
pay if it had to undertake emissions reductions to achieve the 70-unit
emissions level. Utility B would earn money by selling 10 tradable permits at $400 a unit, because this is more than what it costs to reduce
emissions. With the sale, the total costs for Utility A are $8,000: $4,000
for emissions abatement and $4,000 for purchasing 10 permits. Total
costs for Utility B are $4,000: $8,000 for emissions abatement minus
$4,000 from the permit sale.The compliance cost for both facilities with
trading would be $12,000, or 11 percent below the cost with the
mandated technology standard ($13,500).

standard, a firm does have the incentive to find a lower cost way of reducing
emissions, but only up to the level of the standard. Some performance standards are so strict that current technologies cannot achieve them. These
"technology-forcing" performance standards, when set several years into the
future, may induce innovation. However, innovative activity is risky: investments in R&D may or may not pay off in new discoveries. If they do not,




Chapter 7 I 249

compliance costs may fall by less than anticipated, and the ambitious
environmental goal may prove extremely costly to meet.
These incentive-based approaches also provide an opportunity for the
government to raise revenue, either through the auctioning of tradable permits or through the system of charges. Such revenue can be used to reduce
existing taxes, thereby delivering additional economic benefits relative to a
traditional regulatory approach (Box 7A).

Important Issues in Designing
Incentive-Based Instruments
Environmental problems come in various forms, some of which may be
better addressed through emissions trading, others through charges, and still
others through other means. By tailoring policy instruments to the characteristics of a given type of environmental pollution and its sources, policymakers
can implement policies at lower cost than with traditional approaches.

Uncertainty About Costs and Benefits
The tradable permit approach imposes a fixed quantity restriction on a
given type of pollution in the aggregate, whereas a charge approach imposes
a specified price on pollution. In a world with perfect information and certainty, these two instruments would have identical effects on emissions abatement and cost. An omniscient regulatory authority could set a charge knowing it would deliver a certain level of emissions, or it could set the quantity of
tradable permits in the knowledge that it would deliver a certain price of
emissions abatement. In the real world, however, uncertainties about costs
and benefits can influence which approach is preferred. For example, if there
are paramount concerns about the environmental effects of a control policy,
a tradable permit approach may be preferred. This could be the case
where a small increase in the level of emissions could result in a large decrease
in benefits. On the other hand, if the costs of achieving a given emissions
level are highly uncertain, the charge approach may be preferred. This could
be the case where estimated abatement costs for a given level of emissions lie
in a wide range. If there are concerns about both costs and benefits, a hybrid
approach could allow for sources to engage in a tradable permit system but
place a ceiling on the permit price (for example, a price at which the government would sell additional permits), to ensure against exorbitant compliance
costs that exceed the marginal benefits.

250 I Economic Report of the President




Box 7-4. Should Regulators Allocate or SellTradable Permits?
The Administration has proposed a domestic greenhouse gas
tradable permit program for 2008-12. Implementing a tradable permit
program would require industries covered by the program to restrict
their greenhouse gas emissions to comply with the Kyoto Protocol
emissions target. Abating greenhouse gas emissions involves costs
associated with investing in new technologies, fuel switching, and
other means of reducing emissions. As the energy sector becomes
more competitive over the next decade, the costs of controlling emissions will be reflected in consumer prices. For example, the Administration's economic analysis of the Kyoto Protocol found that a tradable
permit price of $23 per ton of carbon equivalent would increase energy
prices to consumers by about 5 percent in 2010.
A key question in implementing a tradable permit system is the distribution of permits. For example, the government can allocate (give
away) permits to firms, or it can sell permits to firms through auctions.
So long as the tradable permit market is efficient, the price of energy to
consumers is likely to be the same in either case. Permits will be
scarce, and the price of energy will reflect the cost of buying a permit
or taking abatement measures regardless of how the permits were
originally distributed. Producers who receive free permits will be like
owners of particularly low cost oil wells when oil prices go up: they will
sell at the market price and reap windfall profits. In contrast, an auction
allows the government to capture the value of the permits, because
competition should lead companies to bid away almost the full value
of any potential windfall profits from owning the permits.
Allocating permits to firms would result in handing over assets valued in the tens to hundreds of billions of dollars annually. Because
these firms can pass on most of the cost of reducing emissions to consumers, allocating permits would provide these firms with significant
windfall profits and allow them to enjoy higher profits under climate
policy than without climate policy. On the other hand, if the government sells permits, it will receive revenue in the tens to hundreds of
billions of dollars annually. Although energy firms would make lower
profits under an auction system, the permit revenue could, for example, be recycled back into the economy through tax cuts. Recent
research has found that such revenue recycling could reduce the costs
to society resulting from the use of greenhouse gas permits by up to
about 80 percent.
Allocating permits to energy industries would significantly increase the
value of their equity, whereas selling permits would lower it. An
alternative is to follow a hybrid approach that combines elements of both
allocating and auctioning. Recent research has estimated that allocating




continued on next page...

Chapter 7 I 251

Box 7-4.—continued
roughly 5 to 15 percent of the permits to energy firms while auctioning
the rest would be sufficient to ensure that these firms' average equity
values would be unchanged, all else equal. Furthermore, since most of
the permits would be auctioned, such an approach would still provide
significant revenue to the government.

Heterogeneity in Abatement Benefits
The environmental effects of a unit of pollution may vary across sources.
For example, rural Montana is in attainment with the national standard for
ozone, so the NOX emissions that contribute to ozone concentrations may
not have any significant human health effects. However, Los Angeles is not in
attainment with the standard, so NO X emissions there contribute to ozone
concentrations that do cause human health problems. Further, with prevailing wind patterns, NOX emissions from Montana are not expected to carry
to Southern California and contribute to ozone concentration in Los Angeles. Thus a one-for-one emissions trade between a source in Montana and a
source in Los Angeles would not be appropriate, and a more complex system
that takes account of different environmental effects of emissions in these
two areas would have to be designed. The key attribute of an environmental
problem, then, that facilitates effective trading is sufficient mixing of emissions prior to human exposure. For example, if two sources near each other
emit NOX, and their emissions mix well in the local airshed, the environmental effects of a unit of emissions by either source can be considered
roughly the same. The benefits of emissions abatement will then be roughly
the same regardless of which source undertakes the abatement. In this case a
simple permit trading program would be appropriate, because it would
deliver environmental outcomes comparable to those from a traditional regulatory approach.
Variability in abatement benefits among sources could result in a permit
trading program creating "hot spots," or local areas where emissions concentrate to the detriment of public health and the environment. As trading of
emissions permits proceeds, a set of neighboring emissions sources might
purchase a substantial number of permits and maintain high levels of emissions. Locally high concentrations may not matter for some environmental
pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, because of the global nature of greenhouse gas accumulation and mixing. However, some hazardous air pollutants, such as benzene, do have local effects, and the potential for a hot spot
could arise with a tradable permit system for such emissions.

252 I Economic Report of the President




Heterogeneity in Abatement Costs
If the cost of abating emissions varies substantially across sources, the
potential for cost savings through a trading program is great. It would be
profitable for a firm with a high cost of reducing emissions to make a trade
with a firm with a low cost, at a price somewhere between the two costs.
Large discrepancies in abatement costs—which may relate to differences in
the age of facilities, in previous investments in pollution control technologies, in fuel inputs, or in other respects—provide the economic incentive for
a high volume of trade and can facilitate the development of an emissions
market. However, if the costs of reducing pollution are similar across sources,
a tradable permit system might not deliver substantial cost savings. The
transactions costs of participating in trading (for example, from having to
seek out another firm with which to trade) may overwhelm the cost savings
associated with the trade if the two firms have similar abatement costs, and
this may reduce the incentive to trade. In such a situation, a charge or other
type of regulation may be more appropriate than trading.

Scope of the Emissions Trading Market
The size of a potential emissions market can significantly affect the
volume and cost savings of a tradable permit system. A market with a small
number of emissions sources may experience low trading volumes and
inefficient, monopoly-like behavior—a robust market may never evolve.
A larger set of participants can promote a more active, efficient market.
Several factors can influence the number of participants in a tradable
permit market. First, the monitoring of emissions sources can significantly
influence which sources participate and which do not. If their cost of
monitoring emissions exceeds the gains from trading, small firms will have
no incentive to join the trading program and will likely prefer a traditional
regulatory approach. Continued technological development in monitoring
equipment may help reduce the costs of monitoring and allow for markets
to expand to more sources. However, inability to effectively monitor some
sources may make it more difficult to design well-functioning tradable
permit systems and emissions charges.
Second, additional scientific research on the human health effects of
various types of emissions can influence the size of a market. By taking
advantage of similarities in the effects of different pollutants, tradable
permit markets can be structured to allow for trading across pollutants. For
example, because both NO X and volatile organic compounds contribute to
the formation of ozone, the potential is there to allow for trading across
these gases. However, some of these compounds may also be carcinogenic,




Chapter 7 I 253

so a system of multipollutant trading should also recognize that a given
pollutant might have multiple health effects.
Third, the extent of participation in a permit market may also depend
on the technical capacity within firms to understand and engage in the
trading system. Participating in a tradable permit market requires that a
firm first evaluate its own cost of emissions abatement, then assess its
potential role as either a buyer or a seller in the permit market, and finally
identify potential trading partners and execute the trade. This involves a
different set of managerial skills than does the traditional regulatory
approach, which tends to require primarily an engineering focus. This may
have important implications when considering the application of such
instruments in other countries, where firm managers may have less
experience both with environmental protection rules and with efficient
markets.

Restrictions on Trading
Restrictions on trading eliminate some of the benefits of this approach,
and substantial restrictions can seriously hinder the development of an
efficient market in emissions permits. Restricting a firm's purchases of
tradable permits to a specified fraction of the firm's own abatement raises
the costs of achieving a given environmental standard without delivering
additional environmental benefits.

Liability
Approaches that result in uncertainty regarding the value of tradable
permits also may reduce participation in such markets. For example,
a government may restrict the buyer's use of emissions permits and may
even revoke them at a later date, depending on an ex post evaluation of the
seller's emissions abatement. This increases uncertainty because it
effectively institutes a system of buyer liability. If the seller does not
undertake emissions abatement sufficient to back the permits it has sold,
the sold permits are effectively returned to the seller. Then the seller has
sufficient permits to cover its emissions, but the buyer, having effectively
surrendered its purchased permits to the seller, does not have enough
permits to cover its emissions, and will be found out of compliance. The
buyer effectively becomes liable for the sellers efforts to abate emissions.
The uncertainty that this buyer liability creates may bias firms against
interfirm trading, leading them to focus solely on intrafirm or internal
trading, where the benefits are more limited.

254 I Economic Report of the President




Banking and Borrowing
The severity of some environmental problems is a function of the stock of
pollution as it accumulates over time, whereas for others it is a function of
the flow of pollution during a specific period of time. An example of the first
type is carbon dioxide emissions: these accumulate in the atmosphere, where
they can last for more than 100 years, and it is their total stock that influences global warming. In contrast, ground-level ozone pollution usually
threatens human health most significantly during short episodes of perhaps
several days. In the first case, the long-term effects of pollution over time may
allow for trading to occur across time as well as across space. With stock pollution problems, a unit of pollution in one period may have environmental
effects roughly comparable to a unit of pollution in a subsequent period.
With flow pollution problems, emissions in one period may have significantly different environmental effects from emissions in a later period, and
this limits intertemporal trading.
The flexibility to trade across time—to effectively bank, or save, emissions
permits for future use or to borrow permits from the future for current use—
can also result in significant economic benefits. If environmental standards
are expected to become more stringent in the future, the costs of emissions
may increase significantly over time. Thus a firm may find it profitable to
reduce emissions below the standard early in the program and save its surplus
emissions permits for use later in the program. However, if the costs of a pollution control program are high in the near term because developing new
technologies requires time, it may be profitable for a firm to borrow an emissions permit from the future and use it in the current period. In cases where
total emissions over time, not the flow of emissions, cause the environmental
damage, this flexibility to trade emissions across time can reduce the costs of
achieving a desired environmental goal. Without the opportunity to bank
and borrow, permit prices—even in a well-functioning market—could vary
significantly over time and could even spike in the presence of new or
unexpectedly stringent standards.

Tradable Permits and Charges in Practice
Economists have advocated emissions charges since the 1920s, and tradable permit systems since the 1960s, yet both approaches received limited
application until recently. Among the first applications of permit trading
were the EPAs efforts in the 1970s to provide additional flexibility to firms as
they complied with Clean Air Act regulations. Later applications of trading
to air quality issues have included the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market
in Southern California, the phaseout of lead additives in gasoline, and the




Chapter 7 I 255

sulfur dioxide trading program. The charge approach has been used to
address residential solid waste generation. Although these applications
represent only a subset of incentive-based approaches in the United States,
they illustrate the importance of appropriate policy design in achieving
environmental goals at the lowest possible cost.

Permit Trading: Emissions Trading Policy Under the
Clean Air Act
The Clean Air Act of 1970 directed the EPA to develop ambient air quality standards for common air pollutants. Accordingly, the EPA set standards
to protect public health for ozone, sulfur dioxide, lead, paniculate matter,
nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide. It designated metropolitan areas
that did not comply with these standards as "nonattainment areas" and
established a set of technology and performance standards for a variety of
emissions sources. In the late 1970s, to provide some flexibility in reducing
emissions, the EPA implemented a trading policy consisting of "netting,"
"offsets," "bubbles," and "banking" mechanisms.
Netting allowed a facility that created a new source of emissions to net its
total emissions across all sources within the facility. This effectively promoted
internal "trading" among sources within a facility: the new source could emit
pollutants in excess of its required level if an existing source reduced its
pollution below its required level. Offsets allowed a new source in a nonattainment area to offset its emissions by paying to reduce emissions at
another source in that area. Bubbles created aggregate caps for all existing
sources within a facility. Instead of specific technology standards for each
smokestack, the facility has the flexibility to reduce emissions in any manner
it desires so long as the aggregate emissions are consistent with its cap. In
addition, a facility with emissions below its bubble limit could sell emissions
credits to other firms. Banking allowed facilities to save emissions reductions
that exceeded the current standard for use at a future date. Whereas netting
only occurs with respect to internal trading, the other three mechanisms can
occur through both internal and external trading.
The experience with these mechanisms showed benefits but also demonstrated some design problems that limited the cost savings. A review of these
programs in the late 1980s found that netting generated by far the greatest
economic benefits, with estimates ranging rather broadly from $500 million
to $12 billion. Bubbles generated cost savings on the order of more than
$400 million, and offsets could likewise have generated benefits on the order
of several hundred million dollars. Little banking activity occurred, resulting
in very modest benefits. Nor was there much external trading: only about 10
percent of offsets occurred between two firms, and fewer than 2 percent of

256 I Economic Report of the President




bubbles were between two firms. Compared with estimated Clean Air Act
compliance costs on the order of $500 billion over the 1970-90 period, these
cost savings are very modest.
Several factors may have dampened the volume of external trading and the
subsequent cost savings. First, the ability of firms to engage in trading was
restricted. Firms had to invest in abatement technology before they were
allowed to purchase permits from other sources, and this effectively stunted
the growth of the emissions permit market. Trading ratios greater than one
(for example, where one firm sells 12 permits but the buying firm can only
use 10 of the permits that it purchases) reduced trading. Second, the review
process for trades was costly and created uncertainties about whether the
emissions credits created actual property rights; this uncertainty further lowered their value. The uncertainty that buyer liability creates may have biased
firms in early trading programs toward internal trades. Third, the concept of
trading was novel to many facilities managers, and the lack of appropriate
human capital has been suggested as one reason for the low volume of
external trading.
Trading under these rules in Southern California during the late 1980s
incurred transactions costs as high as 30 percent of the value of the emissions
permits in the transaction. These transactions costs reflected the costs of
negotiations with other parties, an administrative fee, a certification fee, and
costs for documenting the trade and the emissions reduction. If a firm
wanted to bank emissions permits, it had to pay a banking fee as well.
Moreover, the Southern California regulatory authority granted only 60
percent of proposed trades, and this increased uncertainty among potential
participants. Together the extensive fees and the review process dampened
the market for emissions permits.

Permit Trading: RECLAIM
In response to the increasing cost of air quality regulation and the inefficiency of the then-current system of trading rules, in 1994 the Southern California Air Quality Management District began a tradable permit system
known as the Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM). This program covers stationary sources that emit 4 or more tons annually of either
nitrogen oxides or sulfur oxides. Smaller facilities can join the program
voluntarily as well. The program also includes provisions that allow the
retirement of older, more-polluting automobiles to generate emissions credits to be used by stationary sources. At its inception the program included 65
percent of all NO X and 85 percent of all SO X stationary sources (such as electric utilities and petroleum refineries).
RECLAIM has a single major restriction on trading, designed to prevent
hot spots. Geographically, sources are divided into an inland zone and a




Chapter 7 I 257

coastal zone. Trades can occur within a zone, but permits can only be sold
from coastal zones (upwind) to inland zones (downwind), not vice versa.
Without this restriction, a significant set of upwind sources could emit
enough NO X to result in the ozone standard being exceeded locally
downwind.
To facilitate compliance, major sources must install continuous emissions
monitors (CEMs), which provide emissions data to the regulatory authority.
For 1994 through 1997, CEMs in RECLAIM cost approximately $13 million more per year than the monitoring equipment that would have been
required under a traditional regulatory program. This cost was about one
fifth the projected cost savings associated with the program between 1994
and 1999 and comprised a majority of the projected compliance costs borne
by participatingfirms.However, monitoring provides important benefits. By
providing greater certainty about a sources emissions, monitoring may
enhance the integrity of the environmental market and reduce the need for
regulatory supervision of every trade. RECLAIM has been largely successful
in reducing emissions in a cost-effective manner. Annual ozone standard violations in 1998 were roughly two-thirds fewer than in 1980, and half the
number in 1993 (Chart 7-3).
Chart 7-3 South Coast Air Basin Exceedances of Federal Ozone Standard

many days in 1998 as in 1980 and half as many days as in 1993.

Permit Trading: Sulfur Dioxide Trading Program
In the atmosphere, emissions of SO2 transform into sulfates and sulfuric
acid and are transported over large distances. Because 70 percent of all U.S.
SO2 emissions come from electric utilities, and many of these are based in the
eastern half of the United States, the sulfates are usually deposited in the
Northeast. Acidic deposition, also known as acid rain, can acidify lakes,
resulting infishkills; it can reduce the alkalinity of forest soils, thereby harming various tree species; and it can degrade various ecosystem functions. In
addition, SO2 has been linked with several respiratory problems.
To address the acid rain problem, the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments
directed the EPA to design a tradable permit system for SO2. The program
required the 110 highest emitting, primarily coal-fired, power plants (representing 263 units) in the Eastern and Midwestern States to hold, starting in
1995 (phase I), permits sufficient to cover all their SO2 emissions. Starting in
2000 (phase II), all large fossil fuel-fired power plants (approximately 2,000
units) in the eastern half of the United States will have to hold enough SO2
permits to cover their emissions. Most allocations are based on the product of
a common emissions performance standard and historical utilization,
although a small percentage every year (about 3 percent) are auctioned at the
Chicago Board of Trade. Utilities can freely buy and sell permits, and entities
not required to hold permits to cover emissions may also participate in the
SO2 market. Utilities can also bank emissions permits for use in future years.
The SO2 market has enjoyed very active participation and yielded
substantial cost savings. Innovations in scrubber technology as well as the
availability, due to rail deregulation, of low-cost, low-sulfur coal from
Wyoming and Montana have contributed to compliance estimates as low as
half of what had been predicted for the program. The market has
experienced high volume, in part thanks to the role of private brokers. Compared with a traditional regulatory alternative, the fully implemented SO2
market has generated cost savings of up to $1 billion annually. The
heterogeneity of abatement costs for SO2 in the utility industry has been
recognized as one reason why the SO2 market has experienced such heavy
volume and substantial cost savings. The absence of individual trade reviews
by the government and a system of seller liability have also contributed to
high trading volumes. Banking of permits has also occurred to a substantial
degree: total SO2 emissions in 1995 were nearly 40 percent below the
environmental goal because of banking activity (Chart 7-4). These banked
permits will likely be used during phase II, which has tighter annual
emissions limits.

Permit Trading: Phasedown of Leaded Gasoline
Exposure to lead can cause an array of health problems, including a reduction in children's IQ, behavioral disorders, and adult hypertension. Exposure
to lead can occur through a variety of pathways, such as ingestion of leadbased paintflecksand lead-contaminated dust, drinking lead-contaminated
water, and inhalation of airborne lead resulting from the combustion of leadbased gasoline. In the 1970s, vehicle emissions were responsible for approximately three-fourths of total U.S. lead emissions.
To address the risks of lead exposure, in 1982 the EPA implemented an
interrefinery trading program for lead credits. The EPA capped the amount
of lead allowed in all gasoline sold, and this cap declined until the lead content was 10 percent of its previous level. To sell gasoline containing lead, a
refinery had to hold lead credits commensurate with the lead content of the
sold fuel. Refineries could buy and sell lead credits, and the volume of trade
was quite substantial.
During 1983 and 1984, only one refinery did not participate in the trading program. Up to 50 percent of all lead in gasoline was at one time or
another the object of a lead credit transaction between refineries. In addition,
the EPA provided a banking mechanism starting in 1985, and many refineries took advantage of banking until the end of the phasedown program in
1987. The inclusion of banking may have reduced costs up to 20 percent

260 I Economic Report of the President




over alternative schemes without banking. Unlike the experience with air
pollutant emissions trading in the early 1980s, the phasedown of lead
evolved into a fairly efficient market, resulting in an extraordinary reduction
in lead emissions (Chart 7-5). Although this certainly reflects the less intrusive government role in the lead market (individual trades did not require
government approval), the efficiency of the market may also reflect the technical capacity within firms to participate in trading. Firms that already have
experience in trading, such as refineries that engage in intermediate product
markets within the refinery industry, may be more inclined to trade.
However, smaller firms may have been less inclined to trade because they
lacked the technical capacity to evaluate their own costs of removing lead
from gasoline and to assess their potential role in the lead market.

Charges: Unit-Based Pricing of Residential
Solid Waste
Everyday activities generate solid waste. Through direct and indirect consumption, an average individual generates approximately 4 pounds of waste
per day. The generation of waste requires the appropriate disposal at landfills
and incinerators. Its disposal can result in numerous problems, including
water pollution (from landfills), air pollution (from incinerators), and transportation-related problems associated with hauling waste, including noise,
odor, and traffic congestion.




Chapter 7 I 261

To address the problems associated with waste disposal, many communities have implemented waste management programs that include unit-based
pricing of waste collection, in which households pay for disposal services
according to the amount of waste they set out for collection or bring to collection centers. This alternative to traditional methods of paying for trash
collection (through general revenue or a flat annual fee) can provide explicit
information about the cost of waste generation to households. Households
can respond in a number of ways to being charged for each unit of waste they
set out for disposal. For example, they can do more recycling, set aside yard
waste for separate collection, or buy goods with reduced packaging (what is
called source reduction behavior). Some people have worried that unit-based
pricing could also promote illegal dumping and burning, although this has
not been a serious problem in most communities, in part because of
antidumping programs. Under unit-based pricing, collection schemes usually take one of three forms: special bags; tags or stickers attached to waste
receptacles; or subscription cans of varying sizes. Recycling programs and
public education campaigns on viable substitutes for waste disposal often
accompany the introduction of unit-based pricing programs.
By 1998, more than 4,000 communities in 46 States had adopted unitbased pricing schemes for their residential waste collection, covering nearly
one in seven Americans (Table 7-1). Unit-based pricing reduces the amount
of waste collected for disposal relative to a flat-fee system. Increasing the
number of types of recydables covered by a community's recycling program
and introducing a yard waste collection program also appear to reduce the
amount of waste collected for disposal. However, the total amount of waste

generated (waste to landfills and incinerators plus recycling plus yard waste
collection) does not appear to be significantly different under unit-based
pricing from that under a flat-fee system. In other words, unit-based pricing
may promote diversion from landfills to recycling and yard waste collection,
but it does not appear to promote source reduction behavior.
Since the cost of reducing residential waste may not vary significandy
across households, this experience with unit-based pricing may illustrate the
merits of a charge approach. The small gains available through a trading
approach may be swamped by the costs of acquiring information about
potential buyers and sellers and other transactions costs in such a market.
Thus very few trades would occur, resulting in little cost savings. In this case
where control costs are fairly homogeneous, the charge approach appears to
be more appropriate, and in the case of unit-based pricing of solid waste, it
has been fairly successful at reducing waste to landfills and incinerators.

Implications of the U.S. Experience
These trading and emissions charge programs illustrate the potential for
regulatory strategies to achieve environmental goals through approaches that
provide incentives to effectively harness private markets. Of these examples,
some have demonstrated more substantial cost savings than others, but in
none did the market-oriented approach undermine the achievement of the
environmental goal. More cost-effective attainment of environmental goals
depended in large part on the design of markets tailored to the specific characteristics of the environmental problem at hand. In cases where emissions
sources have roughly equivalent environmental effects, where emissions
monitoring is available, and where the cost of reducing emissions varies
across sources, trading can be a powerful tool to address pollution cost-effectively. The rules for the design of trading can ensure that the program
achieves more of its potential cost-effectiveness. Such rules can include reasonable liability rules, banking and borrowing, and appropriate restrictions
on trading, for example to address hot spots. In cases where the costs of
reducing pollution are similar across sources, the charge approach may be
more appropriate, and as we have seen, it has been used in many U.S.
communities to address residential waste generation.
Such incentive-based approaches have also been used in other countries and
in other policy contexts. For example, several European countries employ
charges on air and water pollution. However, many of these programs are
designed more to raise revenue and have minimal effects on emissions because
the charges are set too low to induce much emissions abatement. In Singapore
a traffic congestion pricing system has been in use since 1975 to reduce the
number of vehicles in the central business district. In the United States, tradable
permits have also been used to address such problems as overfishing (Box 7-5).




Chapter 7 I 263

Box 7-5. Individual Quotas for Fisheries Management
Most commercial fisheries are experiencing declining fish stocks
because of too much fishing. To prevent overfishing, some fisheries
have resorted to fixing the total amount of fish that may be caught in a
given year. Fishery managers set this limit, called the total allowable
catch (TAC), low enough to guarantee the sustainability of the fishery,
and they officially end the season once this limit has been reached.
Because fishers know that managers have limited the total catch, their
goal becomes to catch as large a fraction of it as possible. The "derbies" that result as each fishing crew tries to beat the rest of the fleet
can waste significant resources. Fishers respond by overinvesting in
gear and purchasing ever faster, ever larger boats, but these investments only make the derbies more frenetic. The rapid pace has in
some cases significantly shortened the fishing season, needlessly
restricting consumers' access to some fish species during certain
periods and forcing fishers to concentrate their work effort into a
shorter period.
Managers have tried to supplement the TAC with gear and access
restrictions, but a potentially more efficient approach for some fisheries
is to allocate shares of the TAC in the form of individual quotas. Since
each fisher then has a right to a specified share of the TAC in a given
year, each can catch this share in the cheapest manner possible without
having to worry about the behavior of competitors. The incentives to
concentrate production in the early portion of the season and to overinvest in capital disappear. And because the quotas can be traded, the
market provides an incentive for the most efficient operators to catch
the most fish. Less efficient fishers can sell their rights to more efficient
fishers for an amount greater than their expected profit on the catch.
Similarly, the more efficient fishers stand to net more than the profit of
the less efficient ones, and so the individual quotas can be exchanged
in such a way that both are better off.
Individual quotas have been used extensively around the world,
with very promising results. New Zealand first introduced such a program in 1986, and at least seven other countries now employ individual
quotas. Currently three programs operate in the United States, covering fishing for surf clams, ocean quahogs, wreckfish, Alaskan halibut,
and Alaskan sablefish.The Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 placed a
moratorium on the use of individual quotas through October 1, 2000,
and requested a study of the quota approach by the National Research
Council.The NRC panel released its report in April 1999. It recommended
that the Congress lift the 1996 moratorium and allow regional fisheries
to use individual quotas.The report emphasized that the quotas are not
a panacea applicable to all fisheries. But it also concluded that past
continued on next page...

264 I Economic Report of the President




Box 7-5. — continued
experience has repeatedly demonstrated the effectiveness of individual quotas for "matching harvesting and processing capacities to the
resource, slowing the race to fish, providing consumers with a better
product, and reducing wasteful and dangerous fishing."

Applying the Lessons Learned: Global
Climate Change
Perhaps the leading environmental challenge of the 21st century will be to
address the risks associated with global climate change. Climate change
results from the long-term accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The balance of scientific evidence suggests that emissions of greenhouse gases from human activity have a discernible influence on the global
climate. Three characteristics of the climate change challenge create great
potential for emissions trading and similar flexibility mechanisms to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. One is that a very large number of sources emit
greenhouse gas emissions, which stay in the atmosphere for many years, so
that the climatic effect of a unit of emissions is the same no matter where the
emissions come from. A second is that the different types of sources have significantly different abatement costs, especially across countries. The number
of potential participants and this heterogeneity in their abatement costs provide the basis for an active, competitive emissions trading market. Finally,
emissions of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent greenhouse gas resulting
from human activity, are relatively easy to calculate.
Emissions of greenhouse gases occur as a by-product of a variety of activities: fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, rice cultivation, maintenance of
electricity transformers, aluminum manufacturing, and others. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased about 30 percent since
the preindustrial period. Absent new mitigation efforts, that concentration
will likely rise to double the preindustrial concentration by the middle part of
the 21st century. Moreover, greenhouse gases can reside in the atmosphere
for very long periods. Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide may last in the
atmosphere for approximately 100 years, and other greenhouse gases, such as
perfluoromethane and perfluoroethane, can last in the atmosphere tens of
thousands of years. Such an accumulation of greenhouse gases could pose
significant risks, including rising sea levels, more frequent and severe storms,
shifts in agricultural growing conditions, increased range and incidence of
certain diseases, changes in the availability of freshwater supplies, and
damage to ecosystems and biodiversity.




Chapter 7 I 265

A landmark international agreement to address the risks of climate change
was the Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed at the 1992
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Building on this treaty, 160 countries
agreed to the Kyoto Protocol in December 1997. The Kyoto Protocol
established binding greenhouse gas emissions targets for 38 industrialized
countries for the period from 2008 to 2012. The United States agreed to a
target of 7 percent below 1990 emissions levels. To promote cost-effective
attainment of these targets, the agreement also established four flexibility
mechanisms: emissions target bubbles, international emissions trading, Joint
Implementation (JI), and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The
last three of these, if designed and implemented efficiently, could provide the
foundation for a global emissions market. Since greenhouse gas emissions
have the same climatic consequences wherever they occur, the most efficient
way to address the risks of climate change is to reduce emissions wherever
such reductions are cheapest.

Flexibility Mechanisms in the Kyoto Protocol
Emissions target bubbles effectively allow a group of countries to aggregate
their emissions targets into one megatarget and to reallocate emissions to
new targets within this group. For example, all the countries of the European
Union have Kyoto Protocol targets set at 8 percent below their actual 1990
emissions (written herein as 1990 -8). Under the bubble, the EU target
becomes 1990 - 8 , and individual countries within the group have targets
that vary between 1990 - 2 8 and 1990 +27. Thus, those EU countries that
expect to find it easier than others to reduce emissions effectively take on
bubble allocations below their Kyoto Protocol targets, whereas those that
may find the targets more difficult to achieve get bubble allocations in excess
of these targets. The bubble concept allows for countries to engage cooperatively in one set of "political trades" before the commitment period.
However, once all EU countries have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, the
allocations established under the bubble become their new targets.
International emissions trading may occur among all countries with binding
emissions targets. With these targets, each country is allowed to emit a specified
level of emissions: its so-called emissions allowances. Trading occurs when one
country agrees to sell some of its emissions allowances to another country. It can
also occur among firms and other private sector entities that hold emissions
allowances through domestic trading programs. For example, a U.S. firm that
must hold allowances for the U.S. domestic trading program could trade with a
Canadian firm that must hold allowances for a Canadian domestic trading
program. For countries that have opted for a traditional regulatory approach or
a charge approach to controlling emissions, it may still be possible for
international trading to occur between firms and governments.
266 I Economic Report of the President




Like international emissions trading, Joint Implementation may occur
among countries with binding targets. Unlike international trading,
however, JI is focused on projects. A firm in one industrial country may
invest in a project to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in another. If both
countries' governments approve the project, emissions allowances from the
country where the reductions occurred are transferred to the other country in
exchange for the investment.
The Clean Development Mechanism allows industrial and developing
countries to work together to design and implement projects in developing
countries that abate greenhouse gas emissions; however, developing countries
do not need binding emissions targets to participate in the CDM. CDM
projects must be certified on the basis of several criteria. In addition, a portion of the emissions credits generated by the project would support an adaptation fund for low-income countries especially vulnerable to climate change
(adaptation charges) and for administrative costs of the CDM. Industrial
countries can use CDM reductions to meet their emissions targets. The rules
for international emissions trading, JI, and CDM are expected to be finalized
at the next round of climate change negotiations at The Hague later in 2000.
Finally, the protocol allows for emissions allowances to be banked from one
commitment period to the next. A 5-year average commitment period provides
additional flexibility by effectively allowing for the banking and borrowing of
emissions allowances within this period. This opportunity to bank and borrow
can smooth out permit prices, which might otherwise experience large price
swings due to normal annual fluctuations in the weather or the economy.

Cost-Effectiveness of Kyoto Protocol
Flexibility Mechanisms
Although international emissions trading, Joint Implementation, and the
Clean Development Mechanism can all help lower the cost of compliance with
the Kyoto Protocol targets, their cost-effectiveness may vary. An
efficient international emissions trading system would not require case-by-case
reviews of trades; however, JI and CDM might require such review, and CDM
projects would also require independent certification. Further, the adaptation
charges and administrative costs would increase the costs of participating in a
CDM project. The reviews and charges associated with project-based approaches
could be similar to those in the early emissions trading programs under the
Clean Air Act—netting, bubbling, and offsets—which experienced less activity
than would have been expected with less bureaucratic oversight. In addition, the
project orientation of JI and CDM would effectively exclude some cost-saving
efforts. For example, a country pursuing a policy of cutting energy subsidies
might find it impossible to classify this policy as a project under JI or CDM.




Chapter 7 I 267

However, the country could cut energy subsidies and sell unneeded emissions
allowances through the international emissions trading mechanism.
An international emissions market based on trading, JI, and CDM could
allow substantial gains from trade in meeting emissions targets because the cost
of controlling greenhouse gases differs widely from country to country. Countries that have relatively inexpensive ways of controlling greenhouse gases have
incentives to reduce emissions by more than their targets require, because they
can then sell tradable allowances that they will not need. By the same token,
countries facing more expensive emissions abatement measures have incentives
to buy less costly allowances from others. Modeling analyses of the Kyoto Protocol have found that, for the United States, moving from a no-internationaltrading scenario to a scenario of efficient trading among industrial countries
would cut the price of a tradable carbon dioxide permit (a measure of marginal
compliance cost) by half.

Expanding the Scope of Trading to More Countries
Modeling analyses also illustrate the significant potential for additional
cost savings by expanding emissions trading to developing countries. Among
the world s large economies, the cost to a country to abate a given percentage
of its greenhouse gases may vary by more than a factor of 20. If developing
countries adopt binding emissions targets, they can participate in international emissions trading and may gain substantial revenue from selling permits in the international emissions market (Box 7-6). In an efficient global
market, low-cost opportunities to reduce greenhouse gases in developing
countries would attract foreign direct investment in energy and industrial
abatement technologies and for carbon dioxide sequestration activities (such
as planting and managing stands of trees to absorb carbon dioxide). Developing countries could generate billions of dollars in revenue annually
through the sale of emissions allowances to countries with higher abatement
costs. Effectively, the Kyoto Protocol provides the potential for low-cost abating developing countries to create an export industry whose product is emissions abatement. While providing economic and environmental benefits to
developing countries, an efficient global trading system could reduce the
tradable permit price by up to about 90 percent in the United States.

Expanding the Scope of Trading to More
Greenhouse Gases
Expanding the scope of trading could capture even more benefits. Recent
analyses have found that allowing for trading across greenhouse gases can lower
the cost of meeting emissions targets. Greenhouse gases could be traded on the
basis of global warming potentials, which provide a measure of the effect of each
268 I Economic Report of the President




Box 7-6. Expanding the Scope of the Market Through
Developing Country Participation
The Kyoto Protocol stipulates that countries must have a binding emissions target before they may engage in international emissions trading.
Since the Kyoto conference, developing countries have expressed interest
in emissions targets. Consistent with the Framework Convention on
Climate Change, targets for developing countries should help promote
their sustainable development. For them to do so, such targets should
accommodate emissions growth, because some growth in emissions is
an unavoidable consequence of development. Unlike the current targets
in the Kyoto Protocol, which were set below most countries' current emissions levels, such a target for developing countries could be set above
current levels. At the same time, to contribute to the international effort to
address climate change risks, such targets should result in real abatement
of emissions below levels that would otherwise be reached during the
commitment period—that is, below the projected business-as-usual emissions level. This kind of target, often referred to as an emissions growth
target, could provide for continued economic development but with a
lower emissions growth rate.
Such a target could be expressed as some percentage of a base year, in
a fashion similar to current Kyoto Protocol targets, but perhaps with a different base year and/or a percentage greater than 100 percent to account
for expected emissions growth. An emissions target could also take other
forms. It could, for example, be indexed to a country's economic performance (such as GDP) between now and the 2008-12 commitment period.
Such targets could avoid the risk of a crunch arising from faster than projected economic growth between now and the commitment period.
Developing countries would face only the much smaller risk that emissions would be higher than expected, given the economic conditions during the commitment period. Similarly, such targets would also avoid the
risk of inadvertent laxness associated with lower than expected economic growth between now and the commitment period.This indexed target
formulation is reflected in the emissions commitment announced by
Argentina at the climate change negotiations held in Bonn, Germany, in
the fall of 1999.
gas on the climate. For example, a pound of methane contributes 21 times as
much as 1 pound of carbon dioxide to global warming. Thus, reductions in one
kind of gas can substitute for increases in another. Absorption of carbon dioxide
by planting trees and creating other carbon dioxide "sinks" could also serve as a
low-cost substitute for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Some modeling
analyses indicate that efficient intergas trading could reduce costs to the United
States by 25 to 40 percent relative to a policy that only reduces carbon dioxide
to achieve the target.




Chapter 7 I 269

Quantitative Restrictions on Trading
Some countries have argued that trading should be quantitatively restricted to ensure substantial domestic emissions abatement. This is somewhat
analogous to early Clean Air Act trading rules that required firms to undertake significant emissions abatement before they could buy emissions permits
from other firms with lower abatement costs. If this earlier experience is any
guide, these types of restrictions on trading would likely raise the cost of
compliance significantly, result in a less liquid tradable permit market, and
deliver no benefits to the climate over those from a trading system with no
quantitative restrictions. Interestingly, the proposal by the European Union
to establish quantitative limits on international emissions trading, JI, and
CDM would exempt the bubble mechanism, which the European Union has
indicated it will use (Box 7-7).

Liability Rules for Trading
Some countries propose that buyers of emissions permits should be liable
if the seller does not comply with its emissions target. But such a buyers
liability scheme could present significant uncertainty in the market, increase
transactions costs, and risk the further development of the market. The
uncertainty about allowance value (that is, whether allowances can be used
for a country's compliance) is greatest in a new market where there is no track
record for sellers and where market institutions to handle risk have not yet
evolved. This uncertainty may preclude trades and prevent a robust
allowance market from being established. Bearing risk, or acquiring
information to reduce risk, imposes costs on buyers. The imposition of
additional costs for undertaking a trade will make some trades unprofitable,
thereby increasing compliance costs unnecessarily.

Making Trading Across Countries Work
Finally, the efficiency of an international trading system may be influenced
by heterogeneity in domestic abatement programs as well as by lack of
experience with trading. For example, some industrial countries may
undertake traditional regulatory policies such as mandating fuel economy
standards and requiring greenhouse gas performance standards for stationary
sources. Such an approach would not provide explicit information about the
cost of reducing emissions as would a domestic emissions trading program or
a charge program. These countries may find it difficult to assess the nature
and extent of their proper economic role in an international emissions market. Without the explicit cost information revealed in a domestic trading
program, these countries may buy or sell emissions allowances to a degree
that is inconsistent with what is economically optimal. With an efficient
270 I Economic Report of the President




Box 7-7 The EU Bubble Allocation and Restrictions on Kyoto
Protocol Mechanisms
In May 1999 the European Union proposed quantitative restrictions
on international emissions trading, Joint Implementation, and the
Clean Development Mechanism that would limit industrial countries'
opportunities to buy and sell emissions.The buying restrictions would
take the form of two formulas; countries could choose the less binding
of the two. If a country could demonstrate to a review team that
domestic abatement measures produced emissions reductions in
excess of the binding level, the buying cap could be raised such that
purchased allowances equaled verified domestic abatement. The selling restriction also would take the form of a formula, with the opportunity to raise the binding selling cap equal to the amount of verified
domestic emissions abatement.The proposed restrictions do not apply
to the "political trading" under the bubble provision of the Protocol.
In 1998 the European Union announced its bubble allocation under
the Kyoto Protocol. EU members will transfer portions of the group's
assigned emissions targets to other EU countries. In the Kyoto Protocol, all EU countries are assigned targets of 1990 -8; under the bubble
allocation these adjusted targets would range from 1990 -28 to 1990
+27.The United Kingdom's emissions have fallen since 1990 as a result
of liberalizing its electricity sector; Germany's emissions have fallen in
the same period in part because of restructuring related to unification
with eastern Germany.Therefore these two countries accepted bubble
allocations of 1990 -12.5 and 1990 - 2 1 , respectively. Since Ireland, Portugal, and Greece are expected to grow faster than most other EU
countries, they received bubble allocations ranging from 1990 +13 to
1990 +27.
EU data indicate that several of the political transfers under the
bubble allocation would probably not comply with the restrictions
proposed by the European Union itself for the other Kyoto Protocol
mechanisms. Indeed, 10 of the 15 EU countries could violate the EU
proposal to restrict flexibility: 6 could receive transfers in excess of
their binding buying constraints, and 4 could transfer emissions in
excess of their selling constraints. Thus, two-thirds of EU members
might benefit from political trades under the bubble that could
not occur as economic trades under its own proposal to restrict
international emissions trading, Jl, and CDM.

domestic trading program, participating firms would have explicit price-ofabatement information on domestic abatement opportunities to guide their
buying and selling in an international emissions market. Even if some
countries implement domestic trading programs for one or a few industries,
they may still forgo significant cost savings associated with a more




Chapter 7 I 271

comprehensive domestic trading system. Integrating an international
emissions market with private firms and national governments may result in
some efficiency losses. The U.S. experience in other emissions markets
suggests that countries and firms with very little experience at trading may
not be as active participants as others.
To promote an efficient international trading system, the Administration
has proposed a set of rules for trading based on its experiences with various
trading programs. The Administration opposes quantitative restrictions on
trading. The Administration supports a system of seller liability for trading,
coordinated with a strong compliance system. To promote cost-effectiveness
in the trading system, the Administration supports involving interested
private entities in international emissions trading, JI, and the CDM. In
addition, the Administration has proposed a domestic trading system for
greenhouse gases for the 2008-12 commitment period and aims to have this
domestic system integrated with international emissions trading. For the near
term, the Administration has included a hybrid trading and charge system in
its electricity restructuring bill to promote renewable power as a way to
encourage the development of emerging renewable energy technologies
(Box 7-8). In addition, the Administration has promoted the development
and diffusion of more climate-friendly technologies through a variety of
R&D and information programs (Box 7-9).

Box 7-8. The Renewable Portfolio Standard
The generation of electricity can result in an array of environmental
problems, from emissions of air pollutants, to nuclear waste, to damage to aquatic ecosystems. Renewable sources of energy, such as
wind, biomass, solar, and geothermal power, have the potential to
deliver electricity while having a more modest impact on the environment. The Administration's bill to restructure the electricity industry—
the Comprehensive Electricity Competition Act—calls for a renewable
portfolio standard (RPS) to promote the development and use of
renewable electricity.
The RPS would require all retail electricity sellers to cover a certain
percentage of the electricity they generate with nonhydropower renewable sources of electricity; this percentage would rise from its 1997
level of 2.3 percent to 7.5 percent by 2010. A seller could meet this percentage requirement by generating electricity from its own renewable
energy sources or by purchasing tradable renewable electricity credits
from others who generate electricity from such sources. In addition,
the RPS would be governed by a cost cap of 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.
If the cost of generating renewable electricity reached 1.5 cents per kilocontinued on next page..

272 I Economic Report of the President




Box 7-8.—continued
watt-hour above the price of nonrenewable electricity, an electricity
seller could go to the Department of Energy and purchase an RPS credit for 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour instead of incurring the greater costs of
generating more expensive renewable energy. Revenue from these
sales would contribute to a Public Benefits Fund, which is envisioned to
support renewable power R&D, energy efficiency programs, and lowincome assistance.
The combination of a tradable permit system with the cost cap
would allow for considerable flexibility for electricity vendors in meeting the renewable standard. The costs of generating nonhydropower
renewable electricity, especially in quantities more than three times
that of today, are uncertain.The cost cap would provide additional certainty and a form of insurance to electricity sellers as they plan for
investment in new generating technologies. It would also insure their
customers against unexpectedly large electricity price changes.

Box 7-9. Climate Research and Development and
Information Programs
Potential new technologies often do not receive sufficient private
sector investment when investing firms cannot fully capture the
benefits of these technologies. For example, some of the benefits of
improved solar power technology accrue to society at large, in the
form of improved local air quality and reduced carbon dioxide
emissions relative to a fossil fuel power alternative. In such cases,
producers have less economic incentive to invest in carbon-free power
technologies than is socially optimal. Federal support for research and
development in cleaner and more energy-efficient technologies can
address this problem.Through the President's Climate ChangeTechnology Initiative (CCTI), the Administration has invested $2.12 billion over
the past 2 years in clean, energy-efficient technology development and
has proposed to spend $1.43 billion in fiscal 2001.The CCTI has funded
R&D in technologies associated with the four major sources of carbon
dioxide emissions—buildings, industry, transportation, and electric
power—and investments in carbon removal and sequestration.
Complementing these R&D programs, efforts to provide more information about the energy and environmental effects of products can
promote the deployment of more climate-friendly technologies.
Evidence suggests, for example, that better information about the
potential cost savings from improving energy efficiency may increase

Chapter 7 I 273

Box 7-9.—continued
the use of energy-efficient technologies. Lacking this information,
consumers may simply purchase the product with the lowest upfront
cost, all else equal. However, information about the costs of operating
a product over its lifetime may illustrate to the consumer that the
life-cycle costs of the more energy-efficient product could be lower
than those of the product with the cheaper price tag.
The Energy Star Program at the Environmental Protection Agency
provides consumers with information about the energy efficiency of a
wide variety of products through a readily identifiable label. Products
bearing the Energy Star label appeal to consumers interested in both
long-term energy costs and the environmental effects of using energy.
Thus, Energy Star office equipment like computers, which are, on
average, 50 percent more energy efficient, would be especially attractive to these consumers. In addition, the Administration's electricity
restructuring bill includes a labeling provision that requires electricity
generators to provide consumers with information about the environmental characteristics of the electricity provided, such as the fuel
source. Under this bill, consumers who want to purchase "green"
electricity will have the information they need to make such a decision.

Conclusion
Economic activity has long contributed to environmental pollution in one
form or another, but the application of incentive-based approaches to repair the
damage of pollution has only really come into vogue in the United States over
the past 25 years. Experience with tradable emissions permits and emissions
charges illustrates the potential for substantial cost savings in achieving environmental goals, as well as some of the pitfalls in designing these policy tools.
Taking the characteristics of environmental problems properly into account
makes it easier to identify and apply an appropriate regime. Drawing on the
U.S. experience with market-oriented regulatory policies, the Administration
has advocated and secured the inclusion of international emissions trading, Joint
Implementation, and the Clean Development Mechanism in the Kyoto
Protocol as ways to achieve the world s climate goals as cost-effectively as
possible. Future efforts in negotiations to design rules for greenhouse gas
emissions permit trading and to expand the scope of trading will seek to ensure
even greater cost-effectiveness.
Among the challenges that lie ahead include an improved application of these
tools internationally. Besides the United States, many other industrial countries
have employed incentive-based approaches, especially emissions charges, to

274 I Economic Report of the President




address environmental pollution. Other countries, especially developing countries with substantial air and water pollution problems, can learn from the
experience of the United States and other industrial countries and employ these
instruments to achieve better environmental quality with the scarce resources
they have available. Further, as countries begin to recognize and address crossborder environmental problems such as greenhouse gas emissions, the potential
for cooperative use of incentive-based instruments could provide countries
significant cost savings and environmental benefits.

A Century of Change:
New Opportunities for the Future

In January 1901, Colliers Weekly Magazine published this vision of what the future
might look like. The editors envisioned that by the year 2001, Broadway in New York
City would offer modern inventions "carried to the highest point of development," such as
6-hour trans-Atlantic submarine rides, a "Manhattan Air Line" used much like buses for
local transportation, compressedfood tablets for fastfood lunches, and wireless telephones
that could even phone Europe.

T

he 20th century was one of dramatic growth, change, and new opportunity for America. Technological innovation, globalization, and demographic shifts have led to fundamental changes in our economy, creating new
industries, transforming how businesses operate, altering the nature of work,
reshaping the typical family, and changing the scope of environmental problems. The American economy today is more prosperous and more diverse and
offers Americans more possibilities and choices than ever before. But new
challenges have accompanied those changes, and policymakers must continue
to seek ways to harness a n i maximize the benefits for all Americans.




277

Rising to these policy challenges is particularly appropriate as we seek to
sustain the phenomenal economic performance America currently enjoys.
We are on the brink of achieving the longest economic expansion on record.
Perhaps even more important, this expansion has been not just long but
broad and deep as well. Unlike in the last long expansion, all income classes
have shared in the benefits, capturing real, across-the-board income gains. The
unemployment rate is lower than it has been in 30 years, even as core inflation has fallen to its lowest point in 34 years. The poverty rate is the lowest
since 1979. In the past 7 years we have moved from a Federal budget deficit
of $290 billion to a surplus of $124 billion. That has helped keep interest
rates low and freed up capital for investment, which, in turn, has helped productivity rise over the course of this expansion. We are now seeing the payoffs
of a concerted policy strategy of exercising fiscal discipline, of investing in
education, training, and technology, and of opening markets abroad. Indeed,
this expansion so far has defied the odds: it has achieved low unemployment,
low inflation, strong growth, strong investment, rising productivity, and
across-the-board income growth—all simultaneously.
In this Economic Report ofthe President for the year 2000, we have outlined
some of the key economic changes of the past century and analyzed some of
the principal factors driving those changes. We have discussed the new
opportunities and the new challenges that have emerged as the United
States has moved from an agrarian and industrial economy, anchored in the
production of goods, to an increasingly information-driven economy, fueled
by the exchange of services and ideas.

A Look Back
To appreciate how far we have come, it is instructive to look back on what
American life was like in 1900. At the turn of the century, fewer than 10 percent of homes had electricity, and fewer than 2 percent of people had telephones. An automobile was a luxury that only the very wealthy could afford.
Many women still sewed their own clothes and gave birth at home. Because
chlorination had not yet been introduced and water filtration was rare,
typhoid fever, spread by contaminated water, was a common affliction. One
in 10 children died in infancy. Average life expectancy was a mere 47 years.
Fewer than 14 percent of Americans graduated from high school.
The typical family was a two-parent family where the father was the
breadwinner and the mother did not work for pay. Fully 80 percent of American children lived in this kind of family. Fewer than 10 percent lived in single-parent homes. Widowhood was far more common than divorce. The
average household had close to five members, and a fifth of all households
had seven or more.
278 I Economic Report of the President




More than 40 percent of the work force labored in agriculture. Average
income per capita, in 1999 dollars, was about $4,200. Options for women
and minorities in the work force were limited. The overwhelming majority of
women worked at home or on the farm. Only about 20 percent of women
were in the labor force, and those who did work were likely to be unmarried
and in low-paying occupations. Over 90 percent of African American
women worked as either farm laborers or domestic servants. The typical
workweek in manufacturing was about 50 hours, 20 percent longer than the
average today.
In 1900 only 5 percent of factories used electricity as a power source. The
rest still used steam or water power to drive their machines through intricate
arrangements of wheels, belts, and shafts. By far the greater part of the productive economy was involved in making goods. Only about 30 percent of
workers were employed in service industries, and services made up just 2 percent of U.S. exports. Although international trade equaled about 15 percent
of GNP, there was relatively little integration of national economies through
investment and production arrangements.

The American Economy Today
The broad contrasts between America in 1900 and America today are
striking. Some of the most dramatic improvements have been in the area of
public health. Infant mortality dropped by more than 90 percent over the
course of the century. Life expectancy has increased by about 30 years. Diseases such as typhoid, cholera, smallpox, and polio have been dramatically
reduced or even eliminated through improved sanitation and the widespread
use of vaccines.
Average income per capita is now $33,740, more than eight times what it
was at the beginning of the 20th century. Just 3 percent of the labor force
now work on farms. More than 40 percent of total employment is in industries that are intensive users of information technology. And studies project
that the five fastest growing occupations between now and 2008 will be
related to computers. The service sector accounts for 50 percent of the 20
million new jobs created over the last 7 years, and services are now about 29
percent of exports. More than 80 percent of Americans aged 25 and over
have graduated from high school, and almost a quarter have graduated from
college.
The long-standing gender gap in education has disappeared—women are
in fact graduating from high school and college at slightly higher rates than
men. Over 75 percent of women aged 25-44 are in the work force. Women
and minorities are now employed in a broad range of industries and occupations that had previously been closed to them. And although the pay gaps




Conclusion I 279

between men and women, and between whites and minorities, have not yet
disappeared, they have shrunk significantly.
The "typical" family today is much more diverse. Some 28 percent of
children now live in single-parent families, and another 44 percent live in
families where both parents are in the paid labor force. Only 24 percent of
children now live in what used to be the typical model of a breadwinnerfather and homemaker-mother. Meanwhile many other types of family
arrangements, including unmarried-partner households and same-sexpartner households, have become more commonplace.
Today, the vast majority of households have electricity, telephones, and
automobiles. A number of appliances that did not exist 100 years ago are
now considered common, if not essential, household fixtures: televisions,
videocassette recorders, refrigerators, washing machines, wireless phones,
and personal computers, to name a few.
Americas international trade (exports plus imports) now amounts to nearly 25 percent of GNP. Both trade and cross-border investment have been
spurred by a range of new technologies and products that have cut transport
costs and allowed producers and investors continents apart to coordinate
their activities with ever greater ease. A U.S. computer manufacturer can
import components from foreign suppliers or its own overseas facilities.
International mutual funds allow American families to diversify their savings
across both industrial and emerging markets abroad. And with the advent of
e-commerce, consumers around the world can order a wealth of goods that
they might never find at their local shopping centers.

The Drivers of Change and the Challenges Ahead
These dramatic changes have been driven by a number of factors. As this
Report has outlined, among the most important are technology, demographic
change, and globalization. America now faces a number of unique challenges
as we try to maximize the benefits to all Americans of the internationally
integrated, technologically advanced economy in which we now live.

Technology
From electricity to mass production to telecommunications and e-commerce,
technological innovation has been a constant in the American economy, and its
effects have been far-reaching. Entire industries that only a few decades ago did
not even exist, such as the computer industry, are now leading engines of
growth. Between 1995 and 1998, information technology-producing industries
contributed, on average, 35 percent of the Nations real economic growth.
Computers are cited as a principal factor in the recent increase in productivity

280 I Economic Report of the President




growth and are credited with helping keep inflation low. The computer industry itself has achieved dramatic productivity increases: prices of computers have
fallen nearly 30 percent per year on average since 1995. And as companies integrate computers, information, communications technology, and, most recendy,
the Internet and e-commerce into their business practices, there is evidence that
technological innovation is changing the very fabric and structure of industries.
Many economists now posit that we are entering a new, digital economy that
could inaugurate an unprecedented period of sustainable, rapid growth.
Among the challenges posed by the evolving digital economy is maintaining
the economic conditions that will sustain the virtuous cycle of low interest rates,
high investment, increasing productivity, low inflation, and strong growth that
we currendy enjoy. As this Report has noted, fiscal discipline is a key underpinning of these trends. In addition, government policies must foster the competitive dynamic that encourages firms both new and old to introduce innovative
products and services, to lower prices through gains in productivity, and to
expand customer choice and improve customer service. The greater competition
promoted by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, among other developments, has led to explosive investment in communications infrastructure in
recent years. This, in turn, has led to a proliferation of new and increasingly
affordable information and data services. As both consumers and businesses
make increasing use of the Internet and e-commerce, these new tools are beginning to have pervasive effects on how business is conducted—much as the
advent of electricity or mass production did earlier in the century.
The American job market is adapting to change with much the same vigor.
Workers who are well educated and technologically skilled command a substantial wage premium in todays information-driven economy. Information
technology-producing industries have experienced faster than average job
growth in recent years. In 1997 they added 350,000 jobs—a 7.7 percent
increase from 1996—compared with average employment growth in the
broader economy of about 3 percent. Those jobs, moreover, pay a significant
premium: salaries average $53,000, compared with an economy-wide
average of $30,000.
Now is the time to make the right strategic investments in education and
training, so that the American work force will be well prepared to take advantage
of these new opportunities. Government policies that address this task encompass initiatives to improve the quality and standards of schools, to encourage
students to stay in school, and to help schools afford the technology necessary to
teach students the skills needed in the 21st century job market. Programs such
as the E-rate, together with other initiatives in education technology, play a
valuable role in closing the digital divide by ensuring that all students, whatever
their family's income and wherever they live, have access to computers, Internet
connections, and teachers trained in the new technologies.




Conclusion I 281

Demographic Change
Over the course of the century, a number of demographic changes
altered the profile of the typical American family. The massive entry of
women into the work force reflects new opportunities for women but also
places new demands on families. More and more families today are dualearner or single-parent families. Without a parent available full-time to care
for the home and children, these families often face both a time crunch and
a money crunch as they seek to balance the needs of work and family life. To
enable families to reap the maximum benefit from the economic expansion
while still meeting all their members' needs, the Administration has proposed a number of policies tailored to todays diverse families. These include
increases in the minimum wage; expansions of the Earned Income Tax
Credit and the child care tax credit; enactment of the Family Medical Leave
Act; measures that promote more flexible working arrangements; and the
New Market initiative to extend the benefits to areas that have been left
behind. All these are playing critical roles in helping working families get or
stay in the job market, raise their standards of living, continue to reduce
poverty, and provide for their children.
At the same time, the combination of longer life spans and the aging of the
baby boom has given new urgency to the issues surrounding care for older
generations. The graying of the population poses a clear challenge to policymakers to strengthen Social Security and Medicare so that they continue to
meet the changing needs of older Americans, including helping them afford
the prescription drugs that are becoming increasingly important in medical
care.

Globalization
Americas increasing openness to the world, through trade, investment,
and the integration of cross-border business operations, has been yet another
driver of change that has made our economy more prosperous. The freedom
of firms to choose from a wider range of inputs, and of consumers to choose
from a wider range of products, improves efficiency, promotes innovation in
technology and management, encourages the transfer of technology, and otherwise enhances productivity growth. These benefits in turn lead to higher real
incomes and wages. Quite in contrast to the commonly expressed fear that
globalization hurts American workers, our experience in the 20th century has
shown that as we have grown more open to globalization, we have grown
more prosperous, and both workers and consumers in the aggregate have
realized the benefits. Only a small share of worker dislocation has been attributed to trade. Policies that help ease the transition and offer retraining to
those workers play an important role in their adjustment. But we as a Nation

282 I Economic Report of the President




have much to gain from continuing to work for trade liberalization through
the World Trade Organization. We should work, however, to bring more
transparency to the WTO, to make sure that developing countries benefit
from globalization, and to encourage greater consideration of labor and
environmental concerns.
Finally, as our society has become increasingly global in its outlook, and
increasingly scientific in its approach to problems, we have developed a
greater understanding of the environmental challenges facing the planet. At
the beginning of the 20th century, those environmental problems that were
recognized tended to be local in nature, from the horse manure that fouled
city streets to the contamination of drinking water. As the economy grew and
changed, some existing environmental problems got worse while others
appeared for the first time, but that same economic dynamism provided the
resources and the innovation needed to address these problems. We realize
now the need for local attention to certain environmental problems and for
coordinated global attention to global environmental challenges.
We also have a better understanding of how to remedy environmental
problems through market-based approaches to regulation. The experience
with emissions permit trading and emissions charges illustrates how providing economic incentives can promote greaterflexibilityin how industries and
other sources reduce their emissions. Such approaches have resulted in more
cost-effective achievement of environmental goals. Market-based approaches
can also stimulate the development and adoption of new, "cleaner" technologies. Based on our experience and the lessons we have learned in
employing these market-based approaches, we are well positioned to explore
how these approaches can provide the right incentives for countries around
the world to address environmental problems, especially global ones such as
climate change. The whole world can benefit from the exchange of experiences and ideas, just as it benefits from the exchange of goods and services
through wider international trade.

Conclusion
America stands at a unique juncture in its history. We are more prosperous, more technologically sophisticated, and more integrated into the global
economy than ever before. The policy framework that has been in place over
the last 7 years has allowed the growth potential of the private sector to be
realized, and we as a Nation have flourished. Yet great challenges still lie
ahead to ensure that the benefits of this golden age are sustained and shared
as broadly as possible, and that the right investments are made in the future.
Fiscal discipline, to keep interest rates low and fuel continued investment,
will remain fundamental to our policy strategy. Investing in education, health
care, science, and technology will prepare our families and our firms for the




Conclusion I 283

challenges ahead. Opening foreign markets and continuing to lower barriers
to trade will help deepen the global integration that has served us well thus
far. Harnessing market forces for the betterment of the environment will help
sustain the economy's robust growth. The 20th century ended on a note of
great achievement for America, but the century just beginning promises to be
brighter still, provided we undertake prudent policies and make strategic
investments for the future.

Report to the President on the
Activities of the Council of Economic
Advisers During 1999
The Council of Economic Advisers was established by the Employment Act
of 1946 to provide the President with objective economic analysis and advice
on the development and implementation of a wide range of domestic and
international economic policy issues.

The Chairman of the Council
Martin N. Baily, who was a Member of the Council of Economic Advisers
from 1995 to 1996, was appointed Chairman on August 12, 1999. Dr. Baily
replaced Janet L. Yellen, who left the Council to return to the Haas School of
Business at the University of California, Berkeley, where she is the Eugene E.
and Catherine M. Trefethen Professor of Business Administration and a Professor of Economics. Before joining the Council in August, Dr. Baily was a
Principal at McKinsey & Company, Inc., at the McKinsey Global Institute in
Washington. He was also a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution and
Co-Editor of the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Microeconomics.
Dr. Baily is responsible for communicating the Councils views on economic
matters directly to the President through personal discussions and written
reports. He also represents the Council at Cabinet meetings, meetings of the
National Economic Council (NEC), daily White House senior staff meetings,
budget team meetings with the President, and other formal and informal meetings with the President, senior White House staff, and other senior government
officials. Dr. Baily is the Councils chief public spokesperson. He directs the
work of the Council and exercises ultimate responsibility for the work of the
professional staff.

The Members of the Council
Robert Z. Lawrence is a Member of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Dr. Lawrence is on leave from the John E Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard University, where he is the Albert L. Williams Professor of International Trade and Investment at the Center for Business and Government. He




289

previously served as the New Century Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, as Editor of the Brookings Trade Forum, and as a Research Associate at
the National Bureau of Economic Research.
Jeffrey A. Frankel was a Member of the Council of Economic Advisers until
March 1999. Dr. Frankel currently holds the Harpel Chair for Capital
Formation and Growth at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard University. He is also Director of the Program for International
Finance and Macroeconomics at the National Bureau of Economic Research.
The President has nominated Kathryn L. Shaw to succeed Rebecca M.
Blank as a Member of the Council. While awaiting confirmation, Dr. Shaw
has been serving as Senior Economic Advisor. She is on leave from Carnegie
Mellon University, where she is a Professor of Economics at the Graduate
School of Industrial Administration. Dr. Blank was a Member of the
Council of Economic Advisers until July 1999. She is currendy the Henry
Carter Adams Professor of Policy and Dean of the School of Public Policy at
the University of Michigan.
The Chairman and the Members work as a team on most economic policy
issues. Dr. Lawrence is primarily responsible for the Administration's
economic forecast, macroeconomic analysis, international economic issues,
and certain microeconomic issues, including those relating to natural
resources, the environment, and industrial organization. Dr. Shaw has taken
over responsibility for policy analysis relating to the budget and taxation,
labor, retirement security, health care, welfare reform, and child and family
issues. The Chairman and the Members participate in the deliberations of the
NEC, and Dr. Baily is a member of the NEC Principals Committee.

Weekly Economic Briefings
Dr. Baily and the Members continued to prepare the Weekly Economic
Briefing of the President of the United States for the President, the Vice President, and the Presidents other senior economic and policy advisers. The
Council, in cooperation with the Office of the Vice President, prepares a written briefing, which provides analysis of current economic developments,
more extended discussions of a wide range of economic issues and problems,
and summaries of economic developments in different regions and sectors of
the economy.

Macroeconomic Policies
A primary function of the Council is to advise the President on all major
macroeconomic issues and developments. The Council prepares for the President, the Vice President, and the White House senior staff almost daily memoranda that report key economic data and analyze current economic events.

290 I Economic Report of the President




The Council, the Department of the Treasury, and the Office of Management and Budget—the Administrations economic "troika"—are responsible
for producing the economic forecasts that underlie the Administrations budget proposals. The Council, under the leadership of the Chairman and the
Members, initiates the forecasting process twice each year. In preparing these
forecasts, the Council consults with a variety of outside sources, including
leading private sector forecasters.
In 1999 the Council continued to take part in discussions about a range of
budget issues including Medicare reform, discretionary spending priorities,
and the Administrations tax proposals. The Council also participated in the
development of the President s proposal to strengthen Social Security for the
21st century.
The Council also participates in the Working Group on Financial Markets,
an interagency group that monitors developments related to financial markets
and the banking sector. The group includes representatives from the Treasury,
the Federal Reserve, the NEC, and various regulatory agencies. The Council
also participated in a working group studying bankruptcy reform, and in
another on the macroeconomic implications of the year-2000, or Y2K, computer problem.
The Council continued its efforts to improve the public s understanding of
economic issues and of the Administrations economic agenda through regular briefings with the economic and financial press, frequent discussions with
outside economists, and presentations to outside organizations. The Chairman and the Members also regularly exchanged views on the macroeconomy
with the Chairman and Members of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System.

International Economic Policies
The Council continued as an active participant in 1999 in international
economic policymaking through the NEC and the National Security Council, providing both technical and analytical support and policy guidance. The
Council took an active role in developing policies to respond to financial turmoil in Latin America and elsewhere, continuing the role it has taken following the series of emerging market financial crises that began in 1997. The
Council also monitored closely the effects of the Asian crisis on U.S. trade and
actively participated in developing proposals to reform the international
financial architecture.
The Council has played an important role in evaluating and explaining the
case for trade liberalization and U.S. participation in the multilateral trading
system. Its involvement included writing a white paper on Americas Interest in
the World Trade Organization. The Council was also involved in a range of
other international economic issues, including U.S. trade remedy laws




Appendix A I 291

(antidumping, countervailing duties, safeguards, and Section 301 actions)
and sanctions policy. Dr. Lawrence testified before the Trade Deficit Review
Commission of the Senate on the causes and consequences of the U.S. trade
deficit.
Council members regularly met with representatives of the Councils counterpart agencies in foreign countries, as well as with foreign trade ministers,
other government officials, and members of the private sector. The Council
often represents the United States at international meetings and forums, such
as meetings of the Economic Committee of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum.
The Council is a leading participant in the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), the principal forum for economic
cooperation among the high-income industrial countries. The Council heads
the U.S. delegation to the semiannual meetings of the OECD s Economic
Policy Committee. Dr. Baily serves as chairman of that committee. In 1999
Dr. Lawrence participated in the OECD s Working Party 3 on macroeconomic
policy and coordination. Charles F. Stone, Chief Economist at the Council,
participated in the OECD s Working Party 1 meeting on structural issues and
attended the OECDs workshop "Making Work Pay." Dr. Lawrence also
participated in a meeting of subcabinet officials from the United States and
Japan and was a member of the Joint Economic Development Group meeting
with the Israeli government.

Microeconomic Policies
During 1999 the Council was an active participant in a range of microeconomic policy discussions, including discussions on welfare policy, regulation by the Occupational Health and Safety Agency, and statistical policy. The
Council also participated in Administration working groups on Social
Security and Medicare reform and on issues related to parental leave, pension
regulations, long-term care, and private investment in high-poverty areas.
Over the past year the Council has released several research papers on
microeconomic policy issues. In May 1999 the Council released a report
titled Families and the Labor Market, 1969-1999: Analyzing the "Time
Crunch." Its purpose was to further the national discussion on balancing
work and family and to encourage a discussion of policies that could help
strengthen American families. In a report titled The Effects of Welfare Policy
and the Economic Expansion on Welfare Caseloads: An Update, the Council
examined the unprecedented fall in the number of people receiving welfare.
Released in August 1999, the report concluded that the welfare reforms of
1996 accounted for about one-third of the reduction in caseloads from 1996
to 1998. Finally, in December 1999 the Council and the Office of the Chief
Economist at the Department of Labor released a report titled 20 Million
292 I Economic Report of the President




Jobs: January 1993-November 1999. This study documented the strong job
growth of the past 7 years and found evidence that a high proportion of the
new jobs were in industry and occupation categories that pay wages above
the median.
The Council has taken an active role in reviewing and analyzing progress in
the telecommunications industry and other growing sectors of the digital
economy. In February the Council released a white paper titled Progress
Report: Growth and Competition in U.S. Telecommunications, 1993-1998.
The Council has also been active in ongoing interagency discussions involving
the digital economy and has recently assumed a leading role in facilitating
work on the topic. Work in progress includes reviewing and improving data
collection activities to better 2issess the growth of electronic commerce; participation in the new OECD Growth Project initiated at the May 1999 meeting
of the OECD Council at the Ministerial level; and economic analysis of
policy-related costs and barriers to electronic commerce.
The Council has also participated actively in interagency discussions on
regulation and competition policy. On the domestic front, the Council has
been involved in discussions about merger policy, rail policy regarding interconnections, and the performance of agricultural markets. Discussions regarding regulatory reform in the broadcast industry and in the air traffic control
system have also been ongoing, as has the monitoring of issues related to the
privatization of the U.S. Enrichment Corporation. The Council has been
actively involved in several issues relating to international regulation and
competition, including the effects of gray market imports, and has undertaken interagency discussions regarding the role of competition policy in the
World Trade Organization.
The Council was active during 1999 in a range of policy discussions on
natural resources and the environment, including implementation of the
Clean Air Act as it applies to automobiles, petroleum refineries, power plants,
and other pollution sources. Council Members and staff participated in several Administration efforts to assess oil supply issues, including the effects of
oil imports on the U.S. economy and planning for potential Y2K oil supply
disruptions. The Council has also contributed to Administration initiatives on
national forest management.
Continuing the Councils involvement in the analysis of the Administrations global climate change policy, Dr. Yellen testified on two occasions before
Senate and House committees on the economic implications of the Kyoto
Protocol. At a high-level OECD meeting on climate change, Dr. Lawrence
participated in a discussion on developing country participation in the Kyoto
Protocol. The Council has been active in developing and promoting plans for
the international trading of emissions permits and other market mechanisms
to achieve the protocols targets as efficiently as possible. It has also worked




Appendix A I 293

with a number of developing countries to identify opportunities for them to
further contribute to the global effort to address climate change. To advance
these plans, Members and staff consulted with officials from a number of
countries and organizations, including Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Canada,
China, Colombia, the European Union, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, the
OECD, and the Russian Federation. In addition, the Council has evaluated
trends in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions and participated in Administration
efforts to promote energy efficiency in the Federal Government.

General Notes
Detail in these tables may not add to totals because of rounding.
Because of the formula used for calculating real gross domestic product (GDP),
the chained (1996) dollar estimates for the detailed components do not add to the
chained-dollar value of GDP or to any intermediate aggregates. The Department
of Commerce (Bureau of Economic Analysis) no longer publishes chained-dollar
estimates prior to 1987, except for selected series.
Unless otherwise noted, all dollar figures are in current dollars.
Symbols used:
p Preliminary.
...Not available (also, not applicable).
Data in these tables reflect revisions made by the source agencies from February
1999 through late January 2000. In particular, tables containing national income
and product accounts (NIPA) estimates reflect the comprehensive revisions released by the Department of Commerce in October 1999.

Inventories at end of quarter. Quarter-to-quarter change calculated from this table is not the current-dollar change in private inventories
component of GOP. The former is the difference between two inventory stocks, each valued at their respective end-of-quarter prices. The latter is the change in the physical volume of inventories valued at average prices of the quarter. In addition, changes calculated from this
table are at quarterly rates, whereas change in private inventories is stated at annual rates.
2
Inventories of construction establishments are included in "other" nonfarm inventories.
3
Quarterly totals at monthly rates. Final sales of domestic business equals final sales of domestic product less gross product of households and institutions and of general government and includes a small amount of final sales by farms.
Note.—The industry classification of inventories is on an establishment basis. Estimates for nonfarm industries other than manufacturing
and trade for 1986 and earlier periods are based on the 1972 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). Manufacturing estimates for 1981 and
earlier periods and trade estimates for 1966 and earlier periods are based on the 1972 SIC; later estimates for these industries are based on
the 1987 SIC. The resulting discontinuities are small.

Not strictly comparable with earlier data due to population adjustments as follows: Beginning 1953, introduction of 1950 census data
added about 600,000 to population and 350,000 to labor force, total employment, and agricultural employment. Beginning 1960, inclusion of
Alaska and Hawaii added about 500,000 to population, 300,000 to labor force, and 240,000 to nonagricultural employment. Beginning 1962,
introduction of 1960 census data reduced population by about 50,000 and labor force and employment by 200,000. Beginning 1972, introduction of 1970 census data added about 800,000 to civilian noninstitutional population and 333,000 to labor force and employment. A subsequent adjustment based on 1970 census in March 1973 added 60,000 to labor force and to employment. Beginning 1978, changes in sampling and estimation procedures introduced into the household survey added about 250,000 to labor force and to employment. Unemployment
levels and rates were not significantly affected. Beginning 1986, the introduction of revised population controls added about 400,000 to the
civilian population and labor force and 350,000 to civilian employment. Unemployment levels and rates were not significantly affected.
Beginning 1990, the introduction of 1990 census-based population controls, adjusted for the estimated undercount, added about 1.1 million to the civilian population and labor force, 880,000 to civilian employment, and 175,000 to unemployment. The overall unemployment rate
rose by about 0.1 percentage point.
Beginning 1994, data are not strictly comparable with earlier data because of the introduction of a major redesign of the Current Population Survey and collection methodology.
Beginning 1997, 1998, and 1999 data are not strictly comparable due to the introduction of revised population controls. See February
issues Employment and Earnings for details on the effects. Also, for 1998, data reflect the introduction of a new composite estimation procedure for the Current Population Survey.
Note.—labor force data in Tables B-33 through B-42 are based on household interviews and relate to the calendar week including the
12th of the month. For definitions of terms, area samples used, historical comparability of the data, comparability with other series, etc., see
"Employment and Earnings."

CPI-U-X1 is a rental equivalence approach to homeowners' costs for the consumer price index for years prior to 1983, the first year for
which the official index (CPMJ) incorporates such a measure. CPMJ-X1 is rebased to the December 1982 value of the CPI-U (198284=100); thus it is identical with CPI-U data for December 1982 and all subsequent periods. Data prior to 1967 estimated by moving the
series at the same rate as the CPI-U for each year.
2
CPI research series using current methods (CPI-U-RS) introduced in June 1999. Data for 1999 are preliminary.

Since July 19,1975, the daily effective rate is an average of the rates on a given day weighted by the volume of transactions at these
rates. Prior to that date, the daily effective rate was the rate considered most representative of the day's transactions, usually the one at
which most transactions occurred.
7
From October 30,1942, to April 24,1946, a preferential rate of 0.50 percent was in effect for advances secured by Government securities maturing in 1 year or less.

in the old series, "income taxes" refers to Federal income taxes only, as State and local income taxes had already been deducted, in the
new series, no income taxes have been deducted.
2
3 Annual data are average equity for the year (using four end-of-quarter figures).
Beginning 1988, profits before and after income taxes reflect inclusion of minority stockholders' interest in net income before and after
income taxes.
4
Data for 1992 (most significantly 1992:1) reflect the early adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 106 (Employer's
Accounting for Post-Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions) by a large number of companies during the fourth quarter of 1992. Data for
1993:1 also reflect adoption of Statement 106. Corporations must show the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first
quarter of the year in which the change is adopted.
Note.—Data are not necessarily comparable from one period to another due to changes in accounting principles, industry classifications,
sampling procedures, etc. For explanatory notes concerning compilation of the series, see "Quarterly Financial Report for Manufacturing,
Mining, and Trade Corporations," Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census.

areas, regardless of occupation. See also footnote 8. Series discontinued in 1992.
2
Total population of United States including Armed Forces overseas, as of July 1.
3
Includes persons doing farmwork on all farms. These data, published by the Department of Agriculture, differ from those on agricultural
employment by the Department of Labor (see Table B—33) because of differences in the method of approach, in concepts of employment, and
in time of month for which the data are collected.
4
Prior to 1982 this category was termed "family workers" and did not include nonfamily unpaid workers.
5
Acreage harvested plus acreages in fruits, tree nuts, and farm gardens.
6
Fertilizer, lime, and pesticides.
7
Includes purchases of broiler- and egg-type chicks and turkey poults and livestock imports for purposes other than immediate slaughter.
8
Based on new definition of a farm. Under old definition of a farm, farm population (in thousands and as percent of total population) for
1977,1978.1979,1980,1981,1982, and 1983 is 7,806 and 3.6; 8,005 and 3.6; 7,553 and 3.4; 7,241 and 3.2; 7,014 and 3.1; 6,880 and 3.0;
7,029 and 3.0, respectively.
9
Basis for farm employment series was discontinued for 1981 through 1984. Employment is estimated for these years.
Note.—Population includes Alaska and Hawaii beginning 1960.

End-use categories beginning 1978 are not strictly comparable with data for earlier periods. See Survey of Current Business, June 1988.
Note.—Data are on an international transactions basis and exclude military.
In June 1990, end-use categories for goods exports were redefined to include reexports,- beginning with data for 1978, reexports (exports of
foreign goods) are assigned to detailed end-use categories in the same manner as exports of domestic goods.

For unemployment rate, data beginning 1991 are for unified Germany; for prior years, data are for West Germany. For manufacturing
hourly compensation, data are for West Germany only.
2
Civilian unemployment rates, approximating U.S. concepts. Quarterly data for France and Germany should be viewed as less precise indicators of unemployment under U.S. concepts than the annual data.
3
There are breaks in the series for Germany (1983 and 1991), France (1992), Italy (1986,1991, and 1993), and United States (1990 and
1994). Based on the prior series, the rate for Germany was 7.2 percent in 1983, and 4.3 percent in 1991 for West Germany only, the rate for
France was 10.5 in 1992,11.9 in 1993,12.7 in 1994 and 12.3 in 1995, and the rate for Italy was 6.3 percent in 1986 and 6.6 in 1991. The
break in 1993 raised Italy's rate by approximately 1 percentage point. For details on break in series in 1990 and 1994 for United States, see
footnote 5, Table B-33.
4
Hourly compensation in manufacturing, U.S. dollar basis. Data relate to all employed persons (wage and salary earners and the selfemployed) in the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, and United Kingdom, and to ail employees (wage and salary earners) in
Italy. For Canada, France and United Kingdom, compensation adjusted to include changes in employment taxes that are not compensation to
employees, but are labor costs to employers.
