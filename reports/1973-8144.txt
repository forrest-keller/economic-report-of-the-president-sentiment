ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT

To the Congress of the United States:
As predicted, 1972 was a very good year for the American economy.
From the end of 1971 to the end of 1972, total output rose by about
ll/2 percent. This is one of the largest 1-year increases in the past 25 years.
This growth took place in a largely peacetime economy; it was not
achieved by a war-fed, inflationary boom. In fact, real defense spending declined 5 percent during the year. More important is the fact that the
big increase of production in the year just ended was accompanied by a
reduced rate of inflation. Consumer prices increased a little more than
3 percent from 1971 to 1972—a far cry from the runaway inflation
rate of 6 percent that confronted us in 1969.
A year ago, looking ahead to 1972, I said that the great problem was
to get the unemployment rate down from the 6-percent level where it
was in 1971. During 1972 the rate was reduced to a little over 5 percent.
We should get this down further, and expect to do so, but what was
accomplished was gratifying. It is especially significant that the total number of people at work rose by 2.3 million from 1971 to 1972, the largest
1-year increase in 25 years.
Everything was not ideal in 1972—in the economy any more than in
other aspects of our national life. Rising food prices were a major concern. The U.S. balance of trade with other countries did not improve as
we had hoped. But all-in-all it was a very good year.
The economic performance of 1972 owed much to sound and forceful Government policy. The history of this policy goes back before 1972,
and back before the dramatic moves taken on August 15, 1971. It goes
back to the decision made in 1969 to bring to an end the dangerous
inflation that had started in the mid-sixties. The decision was carried out
by slowing down the rise of Federal spending and continuing the temporary tax increase that had been enacted in 1968 and by tightening
monetary conditions. As a result, much of the cause of the inflation was
removed and the rise in the cost of living was moderated. Without these
steps, the subsequent success of price and wage controls would have been
impossible.




Curbing inflation and cutting back on defense production necessarily
involved a downturn in the economy and a rise of unemployment. To
keep this from going too far, fiscal and monetary policy shifted in an
expansive direction in 1970. And to speed up both the decline of inflation and the recovery of the economy, I announced the New Economic
Policy on August 15, 1971. Temporary controls were imposed on prices,
rents, and wages. Taxes were reduced. A little later we moved to stimulate
the economy further by boosting Government expenditures in thefirsthalf
of 1972, mainly by bringing forward expenditures that would have been
made later.
The policies that began in 1969 contributed to the economic progress
so visible in 1972. But Government policies alone did not do the job.
Credit goes largely to a strong private economy and to the private citizens
who cooperated in raising productivity, maintaining industrial peace, and
conforming to the standards of the control system. The Government
helped to create conditions in which private people could adapt to a
growing economy that was far less defense-oriented and much less inflationary. But it was the individual American who made the adaptations.
The immediate economic goals for the domestic economy in 1973
are clear. Output and incomes should expand. Both the unemployment
rate and the rate of inflation should be reduced further, and realistic
confidence must be created that neither need rise again.
The prospects for achieving these goals in 1973 are bright—if we
behave with reasonable prudence and foresight. By all signs a vigorous
economic expansion is underway and will continue during the year.
This will raise output and employment and reduce unemployment. The
problem, as far as can now be foreseen, will be to prevent this expansion
from becoming an inflationary boom.
That is why I put restraining Federal expenditures at the top of the
list of economic policies for 1973. Nothing is easier or more pleasant,
at least for a bureaucracy, than to spend money. But beyond some point,
which our budget plans already reach, everything that the Government
gives out with one hand it must take back with the other, in higher
taxes or more inflation or both. Spending proposals roust be looked at
in this way, by asking whether they are worth either of these costs. Much
Government spending fails this test.
I am proposing a budget with expenditures of $250 billion in the currentfiscalyear—an increase of $18 billion from last year. I am proposing
a $19 billion increase for next year, to $269 billion. Although those
are large totals and large increases, they reflect a sense of responsibility
and discipline. I urgently seek the cooperation of the country and the Congress in staying within my budget proposals.



Only by holding the line on Federal spending will we be able to reduce
the inflation rate further in 1973. Productivity should still be rising
strongly. Inflationary expectations have been subdued. Workers have
been experiencing large gains in their real incomes and so the pressure
to catch up will be less than it was earlier. Anti-inflationary forces are
at work, but it will be necessary to keep our healthy expansion from
becoming an overheated boom.
The system of wage and price controls in effect during 1972 helped
bring about a combination of less inflation and more production. But it
is not the best system for 1973. After intensive consultation with all parts
of the American society we have concluded that controls should be substantially modified. There are several problem areas—food, construction,
and medical care costs—where special efforts at restraint are needed, in
some cases more intense than last year.
In the economy at large there is need to establish more firmly a pattern
of behavior consistent with reasonable price stability. At the same time
our own experience and the experience of other countries demonstrate
that as controls continue, unless they are suitably modified, red tape
multiplies, inequities increase, interferences with production and productivity become more severe, and the possibility is enhanced that prices
will explode when controls are lifted. Therefore, we are modifying the
control system in several ways.
We are setting forth standards of reasonable price and wage behavior
to which we ask business and labor to conform. Private economic units
will be able to determine by themselves whether price or wage increases
are within the standards or not. They will not require advance approval
from the Government. However, the Government will maintain the legal
authority, the practical capacity, and the will to intervene where necessary to stop action that is unreasonably inconsistent with the standards.
I am asking Congress to extend the Economic Stabilization Act for 1 year,
to April 30, 1974, to continue the authority. There should be no doubt
about the fact that the authority will be used where needed.
An essential part of our anti-inflation program must be an increase of
food supplies to restrain increases of food prices and bring about reductions where possible. The combination of natural occurrences holding
down food production in the United States and abroad with rising
consumers' incomes at home caused a sharp increase in food prices last
year. These same forces will be at work in the early part of this year. But
we have taken steps to increase food supplies. Quotas which previously
limited the import of meat have been suspended. Restrictions on the
acreage planted to major field crops have been relaxed. An increased
amount of dried milk is being allowed into the country. Subsidies on



agricultural exports have been eliminated. Grazing of cattle is being permitted on acreage diverted from crop production. We have established
new machinery in the Federal Government to assure that high priority
is given to holding down food prices.
Restraint in budget policy, the new system of cooperative price and
wage controls and special efforts to increase food supplies, coupled with
the productivity and vigor of the private economy, should make 1973
another year in which inflation and unemployment decline and output
rises. But what is at stake in the policies of 1973 is more than economic
performance in 1973. What is at stake is whether we can make 1973 the
prelude to a sustained period of growth and stability in a free economy.
Since 1968 the Government and the economy have been largely absorbed
in the negative task of correcting the destabilizing consequences of the
financing of the Vietnam war. That period is almost over. Now we can
stop putting out fires and turn to building a better economic order.
We must develop more reliable and responsible attitudes and methods
for dealing with the Federal budget, so that it is not perpetually on the
margin of an inflationary explosion. We must prepare for the end of wage
and price controls, and be willing to show the same courage in taking
them off as was shown in imposing them. We must weed out the restrictive
effects of the large number of other economic controls exercised by the
Federal Government, most of them having their origins decades ago, and
many of them interfering with productivity and production. And we must
strengthen the forces of competition in a vigorous free-enterprise economy.
Nowhere is the need to make 1973 a year of economic reform more
apparent than in our international relations. Our actions of August 15,
1971, put the world on the path of negotiation for improvement of the
international economy. Last year we made proposals for the reform of
the international financial system, and these proposals are now the subject of discussion by high-level officials of the member countries of the
International Monetary Fund. This year we expect to enter negotiations
on the subject of trade.
We want the American people to be able to buy those foreign goods
and services that are better, cheaper, or more interesting than our own.
That raises the American standard of living. We want our people
to be able to invest abroad when that is the most profitable thing to do.
But we also want the American people to be able to pay for these purchases and investments in the way that is best for us. That means, first,
that we must be able to pay by selling abroad the things that we produce best, and selling them on the best terms that we can freely obtain.
Second, it means that we must be able to pay in a way that is sustainable




so that we are not confronted with the need for sudden and possibly
painful adjustments.
Existing arrangements are not favorable to us in either respect. We
have been buying from abroad in rapidly increasing amounts, and that
has helped the American people. But our exports, with which we seek
to pay for these imports, have been subject to high barriers, particularly
in the case of our agricultural products. We have not been able to sell
enough to pay for our overseas expenditures, and so we have had to pay
by incurring more and more short-term debts abroad. This is not a situation that can go on indefinitely; its sudden ending could be disruptive.
Therefore we want to bring about those reforms that will permit us to
earn our way.
Our proposals have been, and will be, put forth in the U.S. national
interest. But this is not contrary to the interest of other countries. International competition is shifting from the military and political arenas
to the economic. This is a great advantage, because in economic competition every participant can win—there need be no losers. The effort of
each nation to produce and sell what it can do most efficiently will benefit
others. This is the fundamental belief underlying our proposals for reform
and the fundamental reason for thinking that a satisfactory agreement
will be reached.
*
*
*
*
*
The general prediction is that 1973 will be another very good year for
the American economy. I believe that it can be a great year. It can be a
year in which we reduce unemployment and inflation further and enter
into a sustained period of strong growth, full employment, and price
stability. But 1973 will be a great year only if we manage our fiscal
affairs prudently and do not exceed the increases in Federal expenditures
that I have proposed. This is the practical lesson of the experience from
1965 to 1968, when loose fiscal policy turned a healthy expansion into
a feverish boom followed by a recession. I am determined to live by this
lesson. And I urgently appeal to the Congress to join me in doing so.

January 31, 1973.

CHAPTER 1

The 1972 Record
1 Q H 0 WITNESSED the first full-year results of the innovative set of
X.ZJ I £* economic programs initiated in August 1971 to speed the recovery of the economy, to reduce the rate of inflation, and to reverse the
deteriorating trend in the Nation's external position. There was a rapid acceleration in the rate of growth in real output and a slowdown in the rate of
inflation (Chart 1). Civilian employment rose sharply and the number of
persons unemployed declined. Both real wages and corporate profits increased. Some progress was made on the international front, but it was
greatly overshadowed by developments in the domestic economy.
Last year's economic performance brought with it significant changes in
public attitudes about inflation and in expectations about the course of the
economy. Although hopes were high in early 1972 that the shift in policy
would bring favorable results, uncertainties persisted regarding both the
strength of the economic expansion and the effectiveness of price and wage
controls. These doubts began to abate gradually as evidence grew that
rates of wage and price inflation were indeed declining compared to the
period prior to August 1971. Workers' cooperation in the wage control system was fostered by the realization that real wages were increasing. Strike
activity fell and relative to total time worked was at its lowest point in
almost 10 years. Although increases in food prices were troublesome during
most of 1972, consumers could see a slower rise in the overall cost of living.
Finally, although selling prices were constrained, so were costs, and business
was able to enjoy some rise in profit margins in a setting of rapidly rising
volume. These developments were all parts of a process that was one of the
major objectives of the price-wage control system—the unwinding of inflationary expectations.
Nor was the change in attitudes confined to inflation alone. The rise in
production and employment that became particularly evident by midyear
created a growing mood of confidence among businessmen and consumers,
and this in turn helped to bolster private investment and personal consumption expenditures.
The fact that considerable progress was made during 1972 did not mean
that final goals had been reached. The unemployment rate in December
1972, although down by nearly 1 percentage point from a year earlier, was
still higher than desirable. At the same time, the rate of inflation at the end

of 1972, although lower than it had been before the controls, was still
higher than the ambitious target set by the Administration. The balance of
payments still showed a considerable deficit, and although work on international monetary reform was underway it had only begun. Nonetheless
by the end of 1972 there was a strong sense of optimism about the progress
that had been achieved and the ability to find answers to some of the problems that remained.
DEMAND AND OUTPUT
Last year's expansion in demand and its division between real output and
prices exceeded most expectations held at the start of 1972. The $102 billion
increase in gross national product (GNP) from 1971 to 1972 was close to
the figure projected by the Council, but the 6.5-percent rise in real GNP
was higher than projected, while the 3.0-percent rise in prices was a little
lower. Real growth was the largest and the price rise as measured by the
GNP deflator the smallest since 1966.
All major sectors of demand, except for net exports, contributed to the
rise in overall GNP (Table 1). The very large increase in gross private
domestic investment, the step-up in Federal purchases in the first half of the
year, and the large increase in consumer spending were the principal stimulating forces in the economy. The continued buoyancy of housing demand and
the strength of consumption in the face of overwithholding of personal income taxes were noteworthy developments in 1972.
The policy measures initiated in August 1971 changed both the character
and the pace of the recovery that began at the end of 1970. In its first full
year it was weaker than in comparable periods of past cyclical upswings.
Indeed, that was one of the main reasons for the shift in policy. After the
pronounced acceleration that occurred during 1972 the current expansion
compares very favorably with previous upswings, when changes are taken
from the preceding peak to the eighth quarter after the trough (Chart 2).
BUSINESS FIXED INVESTMENT
Business fixed investment showed considerable strength in 1972—much
more than the Council of Economic Advisers and most forecasters had
anticipated at the start of the year. The comprehensive measure included in
the national income accounts (NIA)—nonresidential fixed investment—
rose 14 percent. The real increase of 10 percent was confined to equipment,
since on this basis nonresidential construction was unchanged. Investment
was bolstered by the general incentives provided by the liberalized depreciation regulations, the job development credit, and the excise tax cuts on
motor vehicles. The strong upsurge in the economy in 1972, the rise in profits
and cash flow, and the ready availability of funds at lower interest rates
than in 1971 also benefited investment. However, last year's buoyant economy and favorable financial setting had their main impact on decisions and

commitments to invest. Because of the lag between the investment decision
and actual investment, a large portion of this impact will manifest itself in
rising outlays in 1973.
At the start of the year the main reason for expecting that the rise in
investment in 1972 would be moderate was the relatively low rate of capacity
utilization, especially in manufacturing. In this sector, investment did not
increase very much. After a 6-percent drop in the preceding year, dollar
outlays were up only 4 percent in 1972, or about as much as the rise in
capital goods prices. The recent behavior of manufacturing investment has
been more or less typical of past business cycles. In the early 1960's, for
example, manufacturing investment did not strengthen to any significant
degree until 1964, the third year of the recovery.
Most of the increase in investment outlays in 1972 was concentrated in
the nonmanufacturing sector, where increases by electric and gas utilities,
communications firms, and the airlines were especially large. In many of
the nonmanufacturing industries investment tends to be rather independent

of the short-run cyclical behavior of the economy. Also, investment by
farmers was up very sharply as a result of rising farm income, and business purchases of items affected by the excise tax cut—such as trucks—rose
substantially.
Investment plans and forward commitments were much stronger than
actual investment spending during 1972. This showed up in many ways.
In November, new orders received by producers of capital goods were 23
percent above the year-earlier figure, and construction contracts for commercial and industrial buildings were up by 20 percent. In manufacturing,
the 19-percent rise in new appropriations for future spending and the 23percent rise in the total value of new investment projects started in the first
3 quarters of 1972 were far greater than the small increase in actual outlays
from 1971 to 1972.
HOUSING
Almost 2.4 million private housing units were started last year, a rise of
approximately one-sixth over the 1971 total. Shipments of mobile homes
also rose considerably. The 1972 housing performance exceeded the Council's
projection of 2.2 million units, which itself was at the high end of the range of
housing forecasts for 1972. Total outlays for residential construction rose by
more than one-fourth to nearly $54 billion.
The rise in starts reflected exceptionally strong demand for housing and
favorable conditions for an increase in mortgage credit. In the single-family
housing market, sales were at a peak, vacancy rates were low, and pressures
on home prices were strong. The demand for apartment units was also high,
although vacancy rates in rental units edged up for the second year in a row.
Last year's rise in housing starts occurred in spite of a decrease in starts
under federally assisted home programs. Some 318,000 private housing units
were started in 1972 under federally subsidized programs, or 13^4 percent
of the total. This compares with 408,000 units, or 20 percent, of total starts in
1971 and 400,000 units, or 28 percent, of total starts in 1970.
Conditions in mortgage markets were extremely favorable for home construction and purchasing in 1972, but the primary driving force was a strong
underlying demand for shelter. Part of this strength was a legacy of
earlier years. The level of new housing construction was relatively
low in the 1960's, particularly in the second half of the decade, when credit
conditions were generally unfavorable for housing. Once credit conditions
began to improve, as they did in 1970, much of the unsatisfied backlog of
demand reasserted itself. At the same time the pace of new household formation has been rising rapidly. New household formation totaled about
1.9 million in 1971 and 1.5 million in 1970 as compared to an average of
1.1 million in the preceding 5 years. Despite the fact that starts rose to new
records in the last 2 years, housing vacancies are still low in relation to those
of the past 15 years (Table 2).

CONSUMER SPENDING

Consumer spending increased by over $56 billion- in 1972. The nominal
increase of 8J4 percent and the real increase of 6 percent were among the
largest recorded in the past 20 years. The general improvement in the economy, rising employment and income, and the slowdown in both inflation
and inflationary expectations all affected the consumer's ability and willingness to spend. Consumers made extensive use of credit to finance their
purchases, particularly of durable goods.
The boom in residential housing brought with it the largest gains in spending on furniture and appliances since 1964. The lower level of automobile
prices in 1972, as a result of the 1971 excise tax cut, was partly responsible
for dealers' sales of 10.9 million new cars. Almost all of the 7-percent rise
over 1971 was accounted for by domestic-type cars.
Underlying last year's buoyant consumer demand was a rise in personal
income of 8.6 percent, well above average for the preceding decade. In 1970
and 1971, when the economy was sluggish, rising transfer payments accounted for a significant share of the income increase. In contrast, most of
the 1972 rise in income reflected larger earned income. But the outstanding
feature of consumer behavior in 1972 was the strength in consumer spending, despite the overwithholding of personal income taxes that began at the
start of the year. Because of overwithholding, the 6.8 percent rise in disposable (after-tax) income was roughly 1 percentage point less than the rise
otherwise associated with an 81/2 -percent rise in personal incomes. Apparently in 1972 consumers largely ignored the temporary effects of overwithholding. In any case, most of the rise in the proportion of personal income




23

going to higher taxes was compensated for by a reduction in the proportion
of income devoted to saving. As Table 3 shows, the ratio of personal outlays
to income was little changed from 1971. The table also shows that the share
of income devoted to personal outlays last year continued relatively low
compared to the 1960's.

THE LABOR MARKET
Two forces dominated the labor market in 1972. First, there was
a large expansion in opportunities for civilian employment. According to
the household survey, civilian employment increased by more than half a
million jobs in each quarter of the year, and for 1972 as a whole there
were 2.3 million more people at work than in 1971. This was the largest
year-to-year percentage change since 1955. At the same time, the civilian
labor force expanded sharply, and not until the middle of the year were
the large employment gains accompanied by noticeable reductions in
unemployment.
THE LABOR FORCE
The year 1972 witnessed a large influx into the civilian labor force, which
expanded by 2.1 million relative to 1971 (Table 4). One factor contributing to this increase was a reduction in the size of the Armed Forces,
which fell by about 400,000 and enlarged the pool of persons available for
civilian work. Returning veterans have a very high propensity to join the
civilian labor force—participation rates for recent veterans averaged more
than 90 percent over the past few years—so that a shift in the size of the
Armed Forces by itself will change the overall civilian participation rate.
However, in 1971, when the size of the Armed Forces also fell by 400,000,
the civilian participation rate dipped. The difference between the 2 years
lies in the increased labor force participation of other groups, notably
women and teenagers.

Chart 3 shows trends in the participation rates of the major age and sex
groups in the civilian labor force. For a number of groups, participation
rates, which had leveled off or declined in 1971, rose in 1972 as the recovery
strengthened. The tendency for women in the 20-24-year age bracket
to enter the labor force had grown steadily throughout the 1960's and into
1970 as more young wives chose either to delay the start of a family in favor
of working or to continue working even after starting a family; the participation rate for this group leveled off in 1971 but resumed its longer-run
growth in 1972. A similar pattern was evident for women in the 25-54-year
age bracket. Participation rates of teenagers, which had risen sharply in
the last half of the 1960's and 1970, dipped in 1971 but rose again in 1972.
The participation rates for young men in the 20-24-year age group have
been particularly affected by changes in the size of the Armed Forces.
Civilian labor force participation for this group had been declining since
the mid-1960's as more and more young men were absorbed into the Armed
Forces and others continued their schooling through the college level. The
participation rates declined through 1968 and, after remaining about level
through 1971, rose in 1972.
Finally, participation rates of men in the prime working-age group (2554) and of all persons 55 or older fell again in 1972. The spread of private
pension plans, the liberalization of both private and public pension plans,
and the improvement in disability benefits are important reasons for the
decreasing trend in participation rates of these groups.
EMPLOYMENT GAINS IN 1972
From the fourth quarter of 1971 to the fourth quarter of 1972, real
output rose 7.7 percent, creating exceptionally strong demands for labor.

Employment expanded sharply according to both of the major employment measures, the household survey and the payroll survey. According to
the latter survey, 2.7 million more persons were at work in nonagricultural
establishments in the fourth quarter of 1972 than in the corresponding
quarter a year earlier (Table 5).
The goods-producing sector, whose employment declined in the first
year of the recovery, made a strong advance in 1972. The sharpest turnaround was in durable goods manufacturing, where employment expanded
in each of the past 5 quarters, following 2 years of contraction. These
strong gains notwithstanding, manufacturing employment in the fourth
quarter of 1972 was still 4 percent below its level at the business cycle peak
in the fourth quarter of 1969, largely because of the reduced level of defenserelated manufacturing. In the private sector, manufacturing and mining
were the only industry divisions for which employment was below levels prevailing in the fourth quarter of 1969.
Employment in the service-producing industries, which had continued
to rise during the recession and in 1971 but at less than the trend rate of
increase, moved up strongly in 1972. State and local governments added
almost 500,000 employees to their payrolls. Although the major part of this
gain is attributable to the increased demand for local government services,
the 1972 rise was augmented by employment financed by the Federal Public
Employment Program. The only service category for which employment
fell over the 4-quarter period was the Federal Government; here, the
decline that began in 1969 continued.

The underlying strength in the labor market is confirmed by recent trends
in the labor turnover data. In manufacturing, the rate of new hires (the
number of new workers hired per 100 employees) had drifted down from
3.8 in the first quarter of 1969 to 2.4 in the first quarter of 1971. Since that
low point the pace of new hires has increased steadily, reaching an average
of 3.7 in October and November of 1972. The quit rate in manufacturing has
also increased recently, indicating that many workers are finding better job
prospects. Correspondingly, layoffs have decreased sharply—from an average of 1.8 per 100 workers in 1970 to half that rate in October and November, the lowest rates since the Korean war. A further indication of the
expansion of employment opportunities is the recent upturn in job vacancies
in manufacturing. The number of unfilled jobs in manufacturing, while still
low in relation to 1969, has increased by nearly 70 percent since the end
of 1971.
The increases in payroll employment were accompanied by gains in hours
worked. Average weekly hours of production workers in manufacturing rose
from 40.1 in the fourth quarter of 1971 to 40.9 in the fourth quarter of 1972,
the highest level since late 1968. For the entire nonfarm sector, where the
average workweek has followed a pronounced downward long-term trend,
average weekly hours lengthened slightly in 1972.
UNEMPLOYMENT
Although unemployment responded relatively slowly to the large output
and employment gains of 1972, there were unmistakable signs of progress.
In the fourth quarter, the number of unemployed adjusted for seasonality
averaged 4.6 million persons, down from the 5.0-million average of 1971
and the first half of 1972. The overall unemployment rate, which had hovered around 6 percent throughout 1971, began moving down in 1972 and
by December had reached 5.1 percent.
Partly because of the upsurge in durable goods output, the improvement
in the unemployment picture over the past 4 quarters was more marked for
adult males than for adult females (Table 6). The unemployment rate for
married men fell to 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter and to 2.4 percent by
December. Although the latter was above the very low rates of the late
1960's, it was less than in any other period since early 1957. The unemployment rate for household heads also declined in 1972, but not so markedly as
the rate for married men. Unemployment among teenagers reached an alltime high in the first quarter of 1972 but has since receded somewhat.
The unemployment rate for nonwhite workers declined over 1972, but
not so rapidly as did the rate for whites. However, the changes in the overall
rates by race obscure widely divergent changes in unemployment for the
different age and sex groups. There were sizable employment gains for
nonwhite adult males, whose unemployment rate declined from 7.9 percent
in the fourth quarter of 1971 to 6.1 percent a year later. This decline
was much larger, both absolutely and relatively, than the decrease from
3.9 percent to 3.3 percent experienced by white adult males. The widening



28

in the gap between white and nonwhite unemployment rates on an
overall basis was apparently attributable to differences in the behavior of
unemployment among teenagers.

Last year witnessed a decisive improvement in the labor market status
of recent veterans. The unemployment rate for Vietnam-era veterans
in the 20-29-year-old age group, which had averaged 8.8 percent in 1971,
declined to 6.1 percent in the final quarter of the year. Moreover, the unemployment rate decline for veterans was faster than for nonveterans in the
20-29 age group, so that by yearend the veteran unemployment rate was
actually below the nonveteran rate, after remaining persistently above it
for the past several years. A number of forces explain these developments.
They reflect the general improvement in economic conditions as well as
specific Government policies directed toward aiding the labor market adjustments of veterans. The stabilization of the size of the Armed Forces
during the course of the year also helped, since it reduced the flow of discharged veterans from 100,000 per month at the start of the year to about
50,000 toward yearend. Moreover, the average age of the Vietnam-era veteran has been rising, and there is a strong inverse relationship between age
and unemployment for veterans and nonveterans alike.

There was also considerable improvement in the distribution of unemployment along geographic lines. This is most readily apparent in the Labor
Department's monthly classification of the unemployment situation in 150
labor market areas. From the end of 1971 to the end of 1972, the number
of areas with "low" unemployment (less than 3.0 percent) almost trebled—
from 6 to 17 areas. Areas with "moderate" unemployment (from 3.0 to 5.9
percent) increased from 84 to 88. On the other hand, there was a sharp
reduction—from 60 to 45—in the number of areas classified in the "substantial" unemployment categories, i.e., 6.0 percent or more.
PRICES AND COSTS
In the period since the August 1971 policies were instituted there has
been a dramatic deceleration in the rate of inflation. This is discussed in
detail in Chapter 2; here we focus mainly on price measures applicable to
the GNP. For example, the implicit price deflator for GNP, which measures the change in prices of all goods and services included in the gross
national product, rose at a rate of 5.2 percent per year in the 3 years ending
in the second quarter of 1971, the last full quarter before the policy shift. Over
the next 6 quarters, the annual rate of increase was down to 2.7 percent.
The GNP deflator is the only measure of price that is consistent with
real GNP; the product of the two equals GNP in current dollars. However,
changes in the deflator reflect shifts in the composition of real GNP as well as
changes in individual prices. Changes in the composition of GNP in 1972
had a downward effect on the rate of inflation as measured by the general
GNP deflator. This compositional effect is eliminated by the Commerce
Department through the construction of an index of GNP prices with fixed
base period weights—the general type of construction used for the consumer
price index (CPI) and wholesale price index (WPI).
On the basis of a GNP price index that uses fixed 1967 weights, the rate of
price increase experienced over the past 6 quarters is 3.6 percent rather than
2.7 percent. Even so, this represents a marked improvement relative to the
period prior to August 1971 (Table 7). For some analytical purposes it is
useful to focus on the private sector, which excludes Government workers
and their pay raises. For the private sector of the economy, the fixed-weight
deflator shows an inflation rate of just over 3 percent since the second quarter of 1971, as against an average increase of 4.7 percent over the 3 preceding years.
Although the rate of inflation slowed last year in most broad sectors of
the economy, farm prices were one important exception. The sharp
rise in farm prices had a significant effect on the overall rate of inflation. If attention is confined to private nonfarm business, as shown in the
last column of Table 7, the deceleration of the price rise is clearly more pronounced than it is for the GNP deflator as a whole or even the private
deflator. In the private nonfarm sector inflation declined from a rate of



30

4.6 percent in the 1968-71 period to 1.7 percent over the past year and a
half.

COMPENSATION, PRODUCTIVITY, AND COSTS
The slowing of price inflation in the private nonfarm economy reflects a
marked deceleration in the rise in unit costs. For labor costs, this was a
result of two factors: a slower rise in hourly compensation and an acceleration of the rise in output per man-hour (Chart 4).
Compensation
Although fiscal and monetary policies moved the economy away from
the conditions of excess demand that persisted into 1969, hourly compensation continued to rise at rates of 7j^ percent or more per annum in early 1971
(Table 8). These large increases occurred not only in the face of generally
slack labor market conditions, but in spite of two associated factors that tend
to reduce the rise in average hourly compensation during such periods.
During an economic slowdown, increases in average hourly compensation
(which includes premium payments for overtime hours) are normally dampened because the proportion of overtime hours usually falls. A second factor is
the changed composition of employment. Some of the relatively highly paid
industries, like durable goods manufacturing, are those most affected by an
economic slowdown, and this restrains the average increase in hourly compensation for the economy as a whole.
Since the second quarter of 1971, just before the start of the stabilization
program, the rise in hourly compensation for all persons in the private nonfarm sector has slowed to an annual rate of about 6 percent. In terms of
quarter-to-quarter changes, the 90-day wage-price freeze restrained the
increase in the fourth quarter of 1971. The sharp step-up in the first quarter

of 1972, when hourly compensation rose at about a 9-percent rate, reflected the bulge after the end of the freeze and the increase in social security
taxes. This was followed by a very small increase of 4.6 percent during the
second quarter. The apparent step-up during the final 2 quarters of 1972
may be more a reflection of the timing of wage increases—which has undoubtedly been affected by the controls program—than of an underlying
acceleration of wage inflation. Over the last 3 quarters of 1972, hourly compensation rose at an average annual rate of 6 percent, which would seem
to be a fair representation of post-bulge experience.

Productivity
Changes in productivity (which is usually measured in terms of real output per hour of work) show cyclical movements around an upward trend.
Longer-term growth in productivity reflects such basic developments as the
rising educational attainment and skill levels of the work force as well as
changes in the quantity and quality of the tools, equipment, and organization with which they work. The short-run variability in productivity is
highly influenced by changes in the industry mix of output and in production
rates. Some of the work force in each unit, such as skilled maintenance personnel, represent relatively fixed overhead inputs, in the sense that they
must be kept on even when the level of production declines. Also, if the
period of slack production is expected to be brief, employers may refrain
from laying off workers. While these adjustments hold down increases in
output per man-hour of paid labor during periods of slack, they also help
to explain why increased output can be had with a substantially less than
proportionate rise in labor inputs during the subsequent recovery phase.
The behavior of productivity during the recovery from the t970 recession
falls neatly into two separate phases, each of which is different from earlier
experiences at comparable stages of expansion. The basis for this disparity



33

appears to be related to the different pattern of ouput growth in this expansion as compared to earlier ones.
Reflecting the slow growth in real output, the rise in productivity during
the first 3 quarters of 1971 was clearly below the experience in previous
recoveries (Table 9 ) . Indeed, the rise was even weaker than the measures in Table 9 show. This is so because productivity in the final
quarter of 1970 was depressed by the lengthy strike at General Motors.
Ifj as seems reasonable, a more representative value of output per man-hour
during the trough quarter was the average of the final quarter of 1970
and the first quarter of 1971—when there was a very substantial amount
of makeup production from the strike—then the growth of productivity
over the first 3 quarters of 1971 was closer to 3 percent than to the 4.4
percent shown in the table. The lower figure is about half the average
growth rate of productivity in the preceding four recoveries.
With the acceleration in the rise of real output since late 1971, productivity has grown very strongly. Starting in late 1971 and throughout 1972,
productivity growth has been much more pronounced than that experienced
during corresponding phases of previous recoveries.
Unit Labor Costs
Because compensation per man-hour and output per man-hour during
the recent slowdown and current recovery have behaved differently from
past cyclical experience, unit labor costs have also traced an unusual pattern
of change (Table 9). In past recoveries, labor costs per unit of output began

to decline around the trough quarter. In contrast, during the early stages
of the recovery from the 1970 recession, the rise in unit labor costs, although
down from earlier rates, remained high. However, because of the acceleration in productivity growth since the third quarter of 1971, and the slowdown in compensation increases, unit labor costs have increased little. During the comparable phase of previous expansions, unit labor costs have
usually risen substantially relative to their behavior during the early recovery phase.
NONFINANCIAL CORPORATIONS
A comprehensive set of figures on output, prices, and costs is available for
the important nonfinancial corporate sector. These data provide a convenient accounting framework for a detailed discussion of prices, costs, and
profits.
In general the behavior of costs and prices in the corporate sector is not
very different from that of the broader private nonfarm sector just reviewed.
From the third quarter of 1971 to the third quarter of 1972, the rate of inflation for nonfinancial corporations slowed to 1.3 percent from the rate of
approximately 4 percent experienced in the 2 preceding years (Table 10).
Over the same period, the rise in unit labor costs, which had already started
to abate the year before, fell to an annual rate of less than 1 percent—a joint
reflection of both a stepping up in the rise in productivity to 5.0 percent per

annum and a slowdown in the rise of hourly compensation to 5.8 percent
per annum. The rise in hourly compensation in 1972 was the smallest yearto-year rise experienced since 1967 and the rise in productivity the highest
since 1965.
All other unit costs combined, which include capital consumption charges,
indirect taxes, and interest, were essentially unchanged from the third quarter of 1971 to the corresponding quarter of 1972. Lower interest costs and
indirect business taxes per unit of output offset an increase in capital consumption costs per unit. Since the percentage increases in aggregate dollar
costs of each of these categories over the past year were about the same
as in the preceding year, the improved behavior in costs per unit was essentially a reflection of the acceleration of the rise in output. Had the liberalized
depreciation regulations not been in effect, capital consumption costs per
unit would have been virtually unchanged during the year instead of rising
2 percent. Profits before taxes would have been correspondingly higher.
It is also interesting to note that the recent decline in interest costs per unit
of output followed a modest increase in the preceding year and dramatic
increases in 1969 and 1970, when interest rates were at their peaks.
Profits per unit of output rose 6.3 percent (before tax and including the
inventory valuation adjustment) over the past year. The most recent rise
followed a 5.8-percent increase the year before and a net decrease of nearly
30 percent over the preceding 2 years. The peak for profits per unit of
output was reached in the fourth quarter of 1965; almost 7 years later
they were still some 25 percent lower.
Rising profit margins and increased physical volume raised total beforetax profits of nonfinancial corporations by 14 percent from 1971 to 1972.
Even so, the rise in corporate profits in the most recent expansion has not
been large compared to experience in previous recoveries. As Table 11
shows, the rise in profits relative to the rise in corporate output (for the
nonfinancial corporate sector) has been smaller over the first 7 quarters

of the present recovery than during corresponding periods of earlier recoveries in all but one instance. Furthermore, the rise in profits in the present
expansion is itself biased upward because profits in the fourth quarter of
1970 (the trough from which the expansion is measured) were depressed
by the General Motors strike.
Profit Shares
Because profits rose more and employee compensation rose a bit less than
the 10-percent overall rise in the gross product of nonfinancial corporations,
the share of profits rose from 10.2 percent in 1971 to 10.6 percent in 1972,
while the share of employee compensation fell from 66.4 to 66.2 percent
(Table 12). A similar shift, which is typical during cyclical upturns, occurred between 1970 and 1971. However, in 1970 the profit share of

corporate output was at its postwar low and the compensation share at its
postwar high. The relative shift that has occurred over the past 2 years in
favor of profits still leaves the profit share lower and the employee compensation share higher than in any postwar year before 1970.
Long-range comparisons of the profits share, including those just
cited, suffer from the fact that over the years depreciation laws and
regulations have undergone many changes that affect the calculation of
profits. This shortcoming can be overcome through the use of uniform
methods of calculating depreciation over time, so that the resultant estimates of profits are not affected by changes in depreciation practices.
The Commerce Department has made such calculations, and the results
are shown in the second column of Table 13. The adjustment raises the
profits share for most of the periods (it is lowered for the 1950-54 period),
but in terms of changes over long periods the picture shown by the unadjusted
numbers (column 1 of Table 13) is not altered in any significant way. Comparisons should properly be made only between periods in comparable stages
of the business cycle; but even if one focuses on a year like 1968, when
economic activity was high and unemployment was very low, it is clear that
the profits share has declined in comparison with earlier periods (Chart 5).
A final adjustment should take account of interest, which is part of the
total return on capital and which has grown in importance over the postWorld War II period, as corporations have placed greater reliance on debt
as opposed to equity financing and as interest rates have risen more rapidly
than the price of corporate output. The share of interest plus adjusted
profits in gross corporate output has also declined over the long run, but that
decline has been milder than for adjusted profits alone.

FARM PRICES AND RURAL INCOMES

Rising domestic and export demand and reduced supplies as a result of
lower net farm production brought sharply higher prices and incomes to
rural families in 1972. Prices received by farmers rose 18 percent from
December 1971 to December 1972.
International events had a significant effect on prices. Reduced food
production in three major countries—Russia, China, and India—expanded
the demand for food grains from U.S. farms. The expansion in demand
brought a quick response in prices of farm commodities, as is typical of
products with a relatively inelastic demand and a very inelastic short-run
production. Because the United States was the only major food-exporting nation with large carryover supplies of wheat and other grains, this country
was in a very favorable position to expand its exports of farm commodities
in 1972. The volume of farm exports increased nearly 14 percent, and
exports of food commodities advanced 17.5 percent.
Changes in domestic economic conditions also improved farm incomes
last year. As nonfarm employment and income rose, demand for income


39

elastic food items strengthened, causing a strain on the available supply
of beef, pork, and certain dairy products. The result was rising farm and
retail prices. Even the removal of restraints on meat imports and the resulting increase in imports of lean meat left domestic meat prices at alltime record levels. Only in the autumn did red meat prices show some
moderation, mainly because of expanded marketings of beef animals and
diversion of purchases to other meats for the holiday periods.
While demand was expanding in 1972, overall net farm output including
food and nonfood commodities remained quite static. Indeed domestic production of food commodities actually dropped 2.2 percent below the previous year, according to preliminary estimates. Unseasonable weather and
storms hit several parts of the country at critical times and cut back fruit
and vegetable production sharply. Pork output reached a low phase in the
production cycle, and beef production rose less than anticipated, partly
because favorable prices caused more stock to be retained for expansion
of herds.
While family income in the nonfarm sector was also rising substantially,
the agricultural gains were so large that farm families improved their relative
position. Net farm income reached $19 billion for the year, up $3 billion, or
18 percent, from 1971 and well above the previous all-time high of $17.1
billion earned in 1947. With only half as many families on farms today as
there were 25 years ago, income per family is much higher.
Along with the sharp improvement in farm income in 1972, rural families
also benefited from the expansion of the general economy. For a large proportion of farm families, the increase in employment and the rise in nonfarm
wages were more important than the change in farm prices, since over half
of all farm families earn the greater part of their income from nonfarm
sources. Most of these farm operations are small, grossing less than $5,000
a year from farm sales. In fact, over 85 percent of the annual income among
this group is earned off the farm, and income improvements from farm
prices or Government farm programs thus directly affect only about 15
percent of their income. This situation is not limited, however, to only the
smallest farms. Even the operators of the largest farms, those classified as
having sales over $40,000, earn about one-fifth of their total income from
off-farm sources.
FISCAL POLICY IN 1972
Fiscal policy was deliberately expansionary in 1972. The stimulus came
from rising expenditures and from the effect of tax reductions instituted in
1971 and 1972. On a national income accounts basis, full-employment
revenues in calendar 1971 exceeded full-employment expenditures by
$1 billion. The corresponding figure for calendar 1972 was a full-employment deficit of $4 billion—a swing of some $5 billion. These estimates understate the size of the swing and of the stimulus provided by fiscal
policy, because 1972 receipts include about $9 billion in overwithheld per


40

sonal income taxes. As discussed below, consumer behavior is probably less
sensitive to the temporary cash effects of overwithholding than it is to a
more permanent change in income. If Federal receipts from overwithholding are entirely excluded, the estimated full-employment deficit in 1972
is $13 billion—a swing of $14 billion from the position in 1971. On net
balance, the stimulus from budget policy in 1972 was somewhere between
$5 billion and $14 billion and probably closer to the higher end of this range.
The policy shift set forth in August 1971 assigned little importance to increased Government spending as such. On the contrary, the program envisaged some cutbacks in Federal employment and a postponement of a Government pay raise. It sought instead to stimulate private spending through
tax incentives for investment, repeal of the excise tax on motor vehicles, and
an acceleration of the scheduled date for personal income tax reductions.
As originally proposed in its two-tier form, the job development tax credit
was expected to have a large and immediate impact on capital goods demand
and output. The excise tax cut was expected to stimulate demand for and
production of motor vehicles. These tax measures, along with the anticipated
change in public sentiment resulting from the policy shift, strengthened the
sluggish recovery that was underway. Industrial production rose after August and the rate of growth in real GNP accelerated in the fourth quarter.
However, the unemployment rate, which had risen to 6 percent around
the beginning of 1971, stayed at that level with only minor variation until the
end of the year. Consequently, in presenting its plans for fiscal 1973 the
Administration indicated that it would take additional steps to stimulate
the economy by raising the level of expenditures during the remaining half
of fiscal 1972. At the same time, the Administration emphasized its intention to restrain the growth in expenditures starting in fiscal 1973. The
Administration's position was that the total stimulus provided would be
sufficient to accelerate the recovery, but that further stimulus might threaten
the anti-inflation program.
FEDERAL EXPENDITURES
According to the budget data presented in January 1972, total expenditures (NIA basis) were projected to rise by $29 billion or 13 percent from
calendar 1971 to calendar 1972, a sharp advance by historical standards.
Actual expenditures rose by 12 percent (Table 14).
Included in this projected rise was an increase of $9 billion in Federal
purchases, which embraced a scheduled $5.2 billion pay increase for military
and civilian personnel and a step-up in real purchases. The latter was an
extension of a turnaround that had begun in the second half of 1971, following the prolonged and steep decline in defense purchases associated with the
process of disengagement in Vietnam. Actual 1972 purchases fell a bit short,
basically in the second half.
In addition to the planned increase in purchases, the budget called for a
rise of one-sixth in other types of outlays. This rise included $5.2 billion for
revenue sharing, and provision for a 5-percent increase and some liberaliza


41

tion of social security benefits at an estimated annual cost of $3^4 billion
starting in the third quarter of 1972. Because revenue sharing legislation was
delayed, the actual transfer of 1972 grant funds was later scheduled to take
place in two instalments payable in December 1972 and in January 1973.
In addition Congress altered the Administration's social security proposal
by providing a 20-percent increase starting in the fourth quarter of 1972 at
an estimated annual cost of $8 billion.

FEDERAL RECEIPTS
Budget changes on the revenue side in last January's budget presentation
reflected the tax proposals of August 1971, as extended and modified by the
Congress, as well as proposals made before August 1971. In addition, the
Administration proposed that the social security taxable earnings base be
raised from $9,000 to $10,200, to take effect at the start of 1972. This increase
was subsequently amended and deferred to 1973 by congressional action
taken in October.
Planned tax reductions affecting revenues in 1972 included some features
already mentioned: the job development tax credit, the repeal of the excise
tax on motor vehicles, and an advance in the effective date of the rise (to
$750) in personal exemptions. Other revenue reductions included a retroactive rise in personal exemptions from $650 to $675, applicable to 1971
incomes, an increase in the minimum standard deduction to $1,300 per
return, and a 1-year speedup in the effective date of a scheduled rise in the
standard deduction from 14 to 15 percent. Revenue-increasing features



42

included a rise from earlier legislation in the taxable social security wage
base from $7,800 to $9,000, the proposed further rise to $10,200, and the
elimination of certain features of the revised depreciation regulations.
The estimated net effect of the proposed tax changes, in themselves, was
to reduce calendar year 1972 revenues by about $4 billion relative to 1971
in NIA terms. Although on this basis tax increases and tax reductions for
individuals appeared to be approximately offsetting, on balance these proposed changes provided some net fiscal stimulus in calendar 1972. Under
the NIA procedures that are used to seasonally adjust contributions for
social insurance, increases in receipts from a rise in the taxable earnings
base begin at the full annual rate in the first quarter, even though the required additional taxes are ordinarily not paid until the second half of the
year.
With these proposed tax changes providing a partial offset to the rise in
revenues expected from the rise in economic activity and incomes,
Federal receipts were expected to show a fairly steady increase during
calendar 1972 and to total $215/ 2 billion. In fact, receipts turned out to be
some $12/ 2 billion higher than anticipated. Part of this difference reflected
a faster rise in tax accruals than had been foreseen for 1972, but the
greater portion derived from the fact that personal income tax receipts
were considerably in excess of projections because of the overwithholding
that began early in 1972.
The origin of overwithholding goes back to 1971, when families with
more than one source of wage and salary income had withholdings that
fell short of their liabilities. The withholding tax table for 1972 was particularly designed to correct the 1971 experience for such families and was
generally meant to allow all taxpayers to bring their withheld taxes closer to
their liabilities. However, under these schedules single individuals and families with only one source of wage or salary income had to claim additional
exemptions if they were to avoid overwithholding. For the most part, singleincome families did not take advantage of the option to adjust their withheld taxes downward. Withholdings have consequently been running considerably in excess of liabilities and will result in substantial refunds in 1973.
How the effect of overwithholding should be treated for purposes of
analysis depends on a prior view of how it affects consumer spending.
According to one view, known as the permanent-income hypothesis, consumer spending is governed largely by consumers' views of their permanent or
longer-run incomes; temporary aberrations in income do not alter spending
significantly. Consequently, overwithholding and the subsequent associated
refunds should not have a large effect on the pattern of consumer spending.
In this view, which has some support on the basis of consumer behavior in
1972, most of the effect of overwithholding and of the subsequent refunds
should be excluded—from the calculation of the full-employment surplus or
deficit, for example—for purposes of analysis. According to another view




43

most consumers govern their spending according to the income immediately
available to them, regardless of whether the income is permanent or temporary. Clearly, a definitive answer must await an examination of how
consumers behave in 1973 after they receive refunds on last year's overwithholding.
THE REQUEST FOR A SPENDING CEILING
The increase in outlays in 1972, especially in the first half of the year,
served the purpose of stimulating the economy: by midyear the expansion,
as expected, had developed a strong momentum of its own. For the period
after mid-1972, the emphasis of budget policy has been on restraining the
growth in expenditures. In June, the Administration requested Congress
to impose a statutory ceiling of $246 billion on unified budget outlays for
fiscal 1973—an amount equal to the original spending total proposed last
January.
The shift of 1972 revenue sharing payments to late calendar year 1972 and
early 1973, and the large increase in social security benefits late in 1972, had a
relatively small effect on the level of spending budgeted for calendar 1972.
However, both changes raised the level of expenditures for fiscal 1973 significantly above the amount originally proposed.
Anticipation of these developments heightened concern about not only
the level and growth of Federal spending but the potential danger to the
anti-inflationary program and the orderliness of the economic expansion.
In September, the Administration repeated its request for a statutory
ceiling on fiscal 1973 outlays, this time at the $250 billion level. Although
both the House and Senate voted favorably on the ceiling—in bills of different form—final congressional approval was not obtained.

STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
State and local government purchases rose by 10 percent from 1971 to
1972, a rise somewhat below that projected by the Council at the start of the
year. The shortfall was partly due to the delay in revenue sharing; but this
factor should not be overstressed, because the relation between Federal grants
and State and local spending is neither direct nor immediate. Initially, at
least, increased Federal grants appear as increases in State and local
surpluses.
The $5.2 billion revenue sharing bill, originally scheduled for the first
quarter of 1972, was passed in October. The first payment for 1972 was
made retroactively in December, when a half-year's instalment of $2.62
billion (recorded in the national income accounts at an annual rate of $10.5
billion in the fourth quarter) was mailed out to States and localities.
The remaining half-year instalment was mailed in January 1973. In April
1973 the payments are scheduled to revert to an annual rate of $6.0 billion payable quarterly.
The beginning of revenue sharing in the fourth quarter has increased the
level of Federal grants and the likelihood that State and local governments



44

will continue to run large surpluses for a time in NIA terms. With the level
of Federal grants now increased by the advent of revenue sharing and with
the growing importance of State and local government spending, the behavior of the revenues and expenditures of State and local governments
assumes much greater importance in the assessment of the effects of Federal
fiscal policy.
FINANCIAL POLICY AND FINANCIAL MARKETS
Although the financial requirements of last year's expansion were considerable, they were generally accommodated in a satisfactory fashion. The
large demand for funds was accompanied by remarkably mild increases in
short-term interest rates. Long-term rates on balance actually declined. The
money supply expanded by 8.2 percent over the year (December to December) , clearly less than the expansion of 10.9 percent in nominal GNP. Housing and mortgage markets enjoyed a record year with a reduced need for
Federal assistance.
MONETARY POLICY
Federal Reserve goals in 1972 were "sustainable real economic growth
and increased employment, abatement of inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments."
Throughout the year Federal Reserve efforts were directed toward establishing financial market conditions conducive to these goals.
Monetary expansion in the fourth quarter of 1971 had been unusually
slow: the seasonally adjusted annual rate of growth (measured from the
final month of the third quarter to the final month of the fourth quarter)
was 1.1 percent. The rate was low historically and below the Federal Reserve's target rate. As a result of this shortfall and the requirements of the ongoing economic expansion, the Federal Reserve moved to increase the rate
of monetary growth in the first quarter of 1972. To help achieve this objective the System acted to ease credit market conditions. At the same time,
in the execution of policy it gave increased emphasis to the growth in bank
reserves by means of a new reserve concept: reserves available to support
private nonbank deposits (RPD's). The adoption of this additional target
for daily operations was taken partly because of the difficulty the System
had experienced in 1971 in controlling the monetary growth rate by influencing the Federal funds rate. While the monetary growth rate remained
the intermediate target for policy, day-to-day operations were carried out
in terms of an RPD guide range as well as money market conditions.
In the first quarter of 1972 the rate of growth in the narrowly defined
money stock rose to 9.6 percent per annum. Since this was a somewhat faster
rate than the Federal Reserve had expected, operating policy sought to
restrain monetary growth and to allow market interest rates to rise.
This posture was maintained through the summer and early autumn; the

45

target for the rise in RPD's was gradually reduced from a range of 9 to 13 percent for March-April to a 3- to 7-percent range for July-August.
In the third quarter, the continuation of strong economic expansion increased the quantity of money demanded and pressed the cost of credit
upward. Since excessive monetary accommodation would have had serious
implications for future inflation, the Federal Reserve sought only "moderate" growth in the monetary aggregates. For the third quarter, RPD's rose
at a 10.3-percent rate, while the monetary growth rate increased to 8.7 percent from 5.4 percent in the second. Short-term market interest rates rose
gradually, as indicated by the increase in the Federal funds rate from an
average of 4.46 percent in June to 4.87 percent in September.
Late in the third quarter and early in the fourth, a policy of somewhat
more restraint was adopted, but the conduct of monetary policy was complicated in the fourth quarter by changes in Federal Reserve Regulations
D and J. These changes restructured reserve requirements according to bank
size and speeded the payment of checks. Both shifts radically altered the
volume of reserves which banks desired and accumulated, and monetary
policy necessarily proceeded cautiously to allow the banking system to adjust to the new regulations without influencing monetary aggregates or
financial markets. Short rates rose further during the quarter, with the rate
for Federal funds increasing to 5.33 percent in December. Nevertheless the
rate of monetary growth accelerated.
One of the advantages of the shift in policy emphasis to an RPD target is
that this procedure improves control over the monetary growth rate and
protects the economy against fluctuations that might take place if only an
interest rate target is used. Although other considerations also affected the
formulation of policy in 1972, the adoption of the new procedures appears
to have had a stabilizing effect on monetary growth. While the money stock
grew by 8.2 percent from December 1971 to December 1972—up from 6.2
percent in 1971 and 5.4 percent in 1970—its behavior was smoother during
1972 than in the 2 preceding years. For example, the quarterly growth rate
ranged from 5.4 to 9.6 percent in 1972 as compared to a range of 1.1 to 11.0
percent in 1971.
Although the monetary growth rate over the course of 1972 was lower
than the corresponding rise in real GNP, it was still the second highest of
the post-World War II period. As is usually the case, assets which are close
substitutes for money grew even faster than the money stock during 1972.
Regular time deposits at banks rose by 13 percent during the year, while
accounts of nonbank thrift institutions increased by 17 percent. Large
negotiable bank certificates of deposits rose by 31 percent for the year. As
in 1971, the rates paid by thrift institutions on deposits were higher relative
to open market rates than was the case in 1969 and 1970, and this was a
factor contributing to heavy deposit inflows.




46

INTEREST RATES
A notable financial development in 1972 was the relatively stable behavior
of interest rates. Long-term interest rates followed a generally downward
course for the year and short-term rates rose moderately, even though many
observers had anticipated that both rates would increase sharply in response
to the credit requirements of a strong economic expansion (Chart 6). The
unusually wide spread between short- and long-term rates that prevailed at
the beginning of 1972 narrowed in the course of the year but remained
historically large at yearend.
Short-term market interest rates declined in January and February and
followed a generally upward path for the remainder of the year, the rise
being interrupted by temporary declines in May and August. Commercial
banks' prime rates, which are generally closely related to market rates, also
rose over the year. The upward pressure on short-term rates reflected the
underlying growth of the economy as a whole and the increasing demands
made on credit markets to support the expansion. The increase in shortterm rates was considerably milder, however, than increases experienced at
the same stage of past economic upturns.
Long-term market rates declined on balance over 1972. They rose through
April but thereafter fluctuated below April peaks on a generally downward
trend. The declining trend of long-term rates at the same time that shortterm rates rose was an interesting feature of 1972. While short and long
rates can move in opposite directions (if, for example, there is a sharp
change in expectations about levels of future interest rates) historically short
and long rates have tended to move in the same direction. Several forces
produced this divergence in 1972.
First, at least two factors probably led investors to be less desirous of holding funds in highly liquid forms: increasing certainty about the strength of
the economic expansion in 1972, and less uncertainty about the effects of
controls on wages and prices.
Second, foreign central banks slowed the pace at which they bought shortterm Treasury securities with the dollars accumulated through their balanceof-payments surpluses. This reduction resulted from both a slowing of the
dollar outflow from the United States and a shift in preferences of foreign
official institutions toward obligations with longer maturities, especially
after it became clear that the flow of dollars back into the United States
following the Smithsonian Agreement in December 1971 was smaller than
had been expected earlier.
Third, the downward revision of expectations of future inflation seems
to have extended to longer horizons in 1972, causing estimates of long rates
to be lowered. (See Chapter 2.) In addition, the levels of real interest rates
expected in the future may have been reduced as it became evident that the
rise in actual rates in 1972 was much milder than had been widely
anticipated.

Mortgage Interest Rates
Mortgage interest rates, which had followed a downward trend in late
1971, continued to decline in early 1972. They reached their lows for the
year in April and moved up slightly thereafter, even though other long rates
continued to edge down. The increases in mortgage rates have been small:
from April to November, the contract rate on conventional mortgages for
new homes rose from 7.38 to 7.50 percent, still below the 7.68-percent level
of October 1971 and well below the rates that prevailed for all of 1970.
Assistance to Mortgage Markets
The mortgage and housing markets in 1972 enjoyed a prosperous year
with considerably less support from Federal agencies than in previous years.
There was less upward pressure on all interest rates than in past years.
Partly as a consequence of this, there was a strong inflow of funds to financial
intermediaries, particularly savings and loan associations and mutual savings
banks. As in 1971, these institutions, which lend the bulk of their funds on
residential mortgages, added to their mortgage holdings on a larger scale
than in previous years.
The program of the Government National Mortgage Association
(GNMA) for reducing discounts on federally insured mortgage loans—the
"tandem plan"—was largely dormant during the year because the decline in market rates lowered those discounts to support levels. However, GNMA continued to develop and expand its 3-year-old mortgage-backed securities program, which is designed to attract new funds for
housing finance by increasing the ability of residential borrowers to compete
in the general capital market. The issuance of GNMA securities increased
to $3.6 billion in 1972, as compared to $3.0 billion in 1971.
The Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) was also a steady
purchaser of FHA- and VA-insured mortgages over the year, although on
a smaller scale than in 1970 and 1971. For 1972, FNMA's net acquisition of
mortgages was $2.0 billion, compared with $4.4 and $2.4 billion in 1970 and
1971, respectively. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation purchased $1.3 billion in conventional and insured mortgages as against $0.8
billion in 1971.
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board also took a number of steps toward
strengthening the ability of savings and loan associations to compete for
funds as a means of increasing the flow of funds into the mortgage market.
These steps included: (1) An increase from $30,000 to $36,000 in the
maximum loan limit on 95-percent conventional loans of Federal associations, (2) an increase from 5 to 10 percent in the fraction of total loans
that Federal associations can hold in the form of mobile home loans, and
(3) approval of the issuance of subordinated debt instruments of 7 years
or longer maturity by savings and loan associations as a new source of funds.
It also proposed regulations for variable rate mortgages for federally chartered associations.

FOURTH QUARTER DEVELOPMENTS
The year 1972 ended with considerable forward momentum in economic
activity. According to preliminary fourth quarter data, GNP rose by $32
billion, or at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 11J/2 percent. The rise in
real terms was 85/2 percent, and the price rise as measured by the GNP
deflator 2% percent. Judging from monthly indicators such as industrial
production, the course of output was strongly upward through the quarter.
All major components, except for Federal purchases of goods and services, contributed to the large fourth-quarter rise in demand. Consumer
spending was exceptionally strong, rising by $17^2 billion. Underlying the
strength of consumer demand was a sharp rise in payrolls, which reflected
rising employment and a longer workweek, notably in the manufacturing
sector. In addition, the increase in earned income was supplemented by
the enlarged payments of social security benefits that had begun in October.
Total retail sales in December were 115/2 percent above the level of
December 1971. Fixed investment also rose substantially in the final quarter,
and it appeared that businessmen were stepping up their rate of inventory
accumulation in order to accommodate the increased volume of sales.
Civilian employment rose by 525,000 during the quarter to a total of 82.8
million in December, about 3 percent above the level of a year earlier. The
unemployment rate declined to 5.1 percent in December, compared to a rate
of 6.0 percent in December 1971. All major age and sex groups were affected
by the decline in unemployment, but the reduction was especially marked for
adult males in the prime working-age bracket.
Price performance was mixed. From September to December the CPI
rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.2 percent, or 2.5 percent excluding food. The WPI showed an extraordinary increase (9.6 percent
annual rate) because of sharp rises in farm and food prices; in contrast,
the rise in wholesale industrial prices was only 2 percent. The pronounced
increases in farm and food prices, which posed a serious threat to the entire
stabilization program, led to new policy initiatives at the start of 1973.

CHAPTER 2

Inflation Control Under the Economic
Stabilization Act
Public Law 92-210, the Economic Stabilization Act Amendments
of 1971, requires that the Economic Report of the President include a
section "describing the actions taken under this title during the preceding
year and giving his assessment of the progress attained in achieving the
purposes of this title." This chapter and the supplement included in
Appendix A of this Report are intended to fulfill that requirement.
There is, however, no intent to represent the description of the control
regulations contained herein as legally binding interpretations.

T

HE UNITED STATES has had general price and wage controls
before, during both World War II and the Korean war. But 1972
marked the first full year in American history that comprehensive wage
and price controls were in effect when the economy was not dominated by
war or its immediate aftermath. Judged by any expectations one could
derive from history, either in the United States or abroad, the system was
successful. Nevertheless, by the end of the year it was plain that although
continuing controls could make a further contribution to economic stabilization, the system would have to be modified. As the year ended the Administration was developing a revision of the system that would make its operation
more effective and at the same time lay the groundwork for its termination.
THE SITUATION IN AUGUST 1971
To understand what is meant by the "success" of the controls one must
go back to the conditions which existed in the summer of 1971. By then
the rate of inflation had declined from its 1969 peak, and output and
employment were expanding. Neither the decline in the inflation rate
nor the expansion of the economy had been as marked as people had hoped
for or as the Administration had forecast. A more rapid expansion and a
further slowdown of inflation in the months ahead were high on the list
of the Nation's goals.




51

The true probabilities for the future behavior of the economy—as distinguished from what people thought might happen—were not known. However there were several reasons why the rate of inflation might still continue
to decline after August 1971. First, prices and wages would be responding,
with a lag, to the slowdown in the economy that had occurred earlier. Second, the prospective recovery of the economy, even according to an optimistic view of its pace, would still leave the economy in a situation of excess
capacity rather than excess demand throughout 1972. Third, more rapid
recovery would accelerate the rise of productivity and hold down the rise
of unit costs.
On the other hand, there were reasons why the inflation rate, which had
been declining since 1969, might not only stop falling but might accelerate.
For one thing, the decline might already have ended. The Economic Report
of 1972 summarized the evidence of the price indexes at mid-1971:
(1) Most of the indexes show a peak rate of increase at some time
in 1969; (2) most of the indexes show a trough at some time in 1970;
(3) in the second quarter of 1971, the last full quarter before the freeze,
we find that the rate of increase is above the trough in all instances
but below the peak in all but one instance—wholesale industrial prices.
That, of course, is a serious exception. Although it does not negate
the improvement shown in the other indexes, the exception was important enough and the other improvements small enough to leave uncertainty about the future decline of inflation.*
By August 1971 the recovery of the economy was in its ninth month.
At that point in earlier recoveries the rate of inflation had begun to accelerate, rather than continue to decelerate. This might have happened again
after August 1971: inflationary expectations and the effort of some workers
to catch up with the cost of living and with the wage increases of other
workers had not been eliminated during the period of economic slowdown.
Such price-raising forces might have been suppressed only to break out
again when the pressure of deficient demand was relaxed. Indeed, as workers
and businessmen became more aware of the continued expansion, especially
expansion produced by Government action, their belief that rapid inflation
was inevitable would be reinforced and might even tend to generate the
feared result.
Although the feared acceleration of inflation was associated with the
prospect of economic expansion, it should be clear that the price rises
then envisaged for the period ahead would not be the direct result of excess
demand. The price and wage increases would not be equilibrating in the
sense that they would be necessary to raise output into balance with demand
and attract workers. Firms would have been willing to produce more at
existing prices, and workers would have been willing to supply their labor
at existing wages, if they could not raise them. But both groups preferred
"^Revision of seasonal factors since the above was written has slightly altered the
wholesale industrial price pattern so that it is now consistent with the other indexes.



52

raising wages and prices, because others had been doing so and because, with
expansion underway, they anticipated that their production costs or living
costs would be rising and that the market would absorb their products or
labor at higher prices or wages. How probable this more pessimistic scenario
was could not be known, but it was not a negligible possibility.
Moreover, even if the more pessimistic outcome was actually unlikely,
there was widespread fear of it, and this fact was itself important. Anxiety
about inflation among consumers was believed to be holding back a revival
of consumer spending. Long-term interest rates had been rising in the spring
and summer of 1971; this may have been a sign of renewed inflationary
expectations. An opinion common in the financial community was that stimulative actions by the Government would intensify the fear of inflation, cause
a more rapid increase of interest rates, and finally hurt rather than help the
economic expansion. Also, the idea that the American inflation was endless
and uncontrollable was undermining confidence in the U.S. dollar and
aggravating the balance-of-payments problem. These fears inhibited the
Government from taking steps to expand the economy.
In this situation then, the purposes of the controls were threefold:
1. To reduce the risk that the rate of inflation would rise again and to
increase the probability of further decline;
2. To reduce the fear that the rate of inflation would rise or not decline
further; and thus,
3. To strengthen forces for expansion in the private economy and free
the Government to follow a more expansive policy.
The controls were to be used to help achieve these goals subject to the
conditions that they:
1. Should not interfere with the expansion of the economy. For example,
they should not discourage private investment.
2. Should not impair the rise of productivity by reducing incentives to
hold down costs or by precipitating strikes.
3. Should be fair in the sense that they should not adversely affect some
groups or individuals and favor others.
4. Should not impose heavy administrative costs either on the Government or on private citizens.
5. Should not create or perpetuate a situation in which termination of
the controls would be highly disruptive.
The controls were part of a larger program, which had the twin objectives of economic expansion and inflation reduction. The broader program
included a fiscal and monetary policy which would initially be strongly
expansive but would become less so as the economy reached higher levels
and as the danger of excess demand became greater. One of the major
concerns of the Administration when it instituted controls was that the
country would come to rely on the controls and feel relieved of the necessity
to exercise restraint in Federal spending when restraint became appropriate.
This concern was related to the belief that controls would not in fact be



53

able to hold down prices and wages when there was a strong excess of demand, and that the effort to do so would result in shortages and distortion
of production.
Another program element, which became more significant as the year
progressed, was the attempt to use the policies of Government to hold prices
down in situations of shortage by promoting expansion of supply. The food
sector provided the leading instance of this approach.
The controls program was intended to be temporary. This was true not
only of the freeze, but also of Phase II and its modifications as they developed
during 1972. Some believe that the United States faces a permanent problem of serious inflation beyond the capacity of prudent fiscal and monetary
policy to control. In contrast, the Administration expected that if the total
package of policies were well managed it would be possible to enter a period
of reasonable price stability without controls. In any case the control system of 1972 was not designed to last forever. If a means of dealing with a
more prolonged problem were needed, it would have to be created especially
for that purpose.
In the following pages of this chapter, after a very brief description of
the program, we review how far its objectives were achieved by the end
of 1972 and, what is much more difficult, to what extent they were in fact
achieved by the program itself.

THE NATURE OF THE PROGRAM
The supplement to this chapter, included in Appendix A, contains a
description of the controls program. Further details may be found in the
Quarterly Reports of the Cost of Living Council and in the regulations
issued by the Council, the Pay Board, and the Price Commission. Here we
summarize only the most salient points.
1. Goals. The goal of policy was to get the rate of inflation, as measured
by the consumer price index (CPI), down to 2-3 percent by the end of
1972. The upper end of the range was considered to be not far below what
might have been optimistically expected without controls; but at the same
time it would represent significant progress from the earlier rate of inflation.
The goal was set in the expectation that food prices would not rise significantly more than other prices.
2. Pay standard. To achieve this goal the Pay Board (initially consisting
of five members each from labor, management, and the general public) set a
basic standard of 5^2 percent for permissible pay increases. This figure was
related to the inflation goal through a "normal" or trend productivity increase of 3 percent, which would yield a 2 l/i -percent increase in unit labor
costs. A number of exceptions, some formulated by the Board and some
imposed by Congress in the Economic Stabilization Act Amendments of 1971,
permitted increases beyond 5 / 2 percent. But the standards only set maximum
limits; they did not set a floor.



54

3. Price standard. The Price Commission specified that prices could
increase above their August 1971 level no more than would be proportional
to the increase of costs over the same period, subject to the further proviso
that, if prices were raised, a firm's profit margin in relation to sales could not
exceed the average rate of the best 2 of the 3 fiscal years preceding August
1971. Again a number of exceptions were made, generally further limiting
permissible price increases.
4. Term limit pricing (TLP). Agreements were worked out individually by the Price Commission with many of the largest companies,
specifying the maximum amount by which they could raise their average
prices during the coming year. Thus the companies were relieved of the
necessity to obtain advance approval for individual price increases and
the Price Commission was relieved of a considerable administrative burden.
The agreement usually specified a maximum amount by which any individual price could be raised. For example, the agreement might provide
that a company's average price could not rise more than 1.8 percent and
that no single price could rise more than 8 percent. The TLP did not relax
the profit-margin limit for the firm.
5. Firm-by-firm control. Price and wage control was exercised on a firmby-firm basis, and on the basis of collective bargaining units. The control
agency did not set ceiling prices at which specified commodities could be
sold by any seller. It did not set ceiling wage rates for particular individuals
or occupations. Instead it laid down rules by which the individual company
could determine its ceiling prices, and these might differ from the ceiling
price at which a different company sold the same commodities. Similarly the
rules limited the average wage increase for the workers covered by a single
company or bargaining unit, and these increases might permit different
pay for the same occupation in different firms. Such a system kept the administrative burden on the Government small and was probably the only
feasible way to make a rapid transition from the freeze to the
more flexible controls of Phase II. On the other hand, the firm-by-firm
approach may have raised the costs of compliance for the private sector.
The variations that the system allowed in different firms' prices for the
same product might have been a source of inefficiency and inequity in a
situation of excess demand, but, under the conditions prevailing in most
industries during 1972, competition tended to bring about uniform prices
despite differences in ceilings.
6. Exemptions. The most important exemption from the controls system
applied to farm products, defined to include timber and unprocessed fishery
products also. The reason for the exemption was that pricing of these
products took place in extremely competitive markets and adjusted quickly
to changing market conditions; repressing price increases by controls would
therefore cause shortages and require rationing. Interest rates were not subject to mandatory controls for the same reason, although voluntary restraint
was sought in raising administered interest rates (mortgage rates, con


55

sumers' credit rates, and the banks' prime lending rate). Imports
and exports were also exempt. The Economic Stabilization Act
exempted wages of low-income workers from control, and the subsequent
definition of this class excluded about 40 percent of all private nonfarm
workers. After the Phase II system had been in operation for some months,
firms, collective bargaining units, and landlords, below certain size limits,
were exempted from control. This removed from control the largest proportion of all economic units in the country, permitting administrative resources to be concentrated on the remaining units, which still accounted for
most of the economic activity and which, by their competition, restrained
price increases in the uncontrolled sector.
7. Administration and reporting. For checking compliance with the price
standards, firms were divided by size into three tiers. The largest, Tier I
firms, were required to notify the Price Commission and obtain approval in
advance of price increases, unless they had a prior term limit pricing agreement. Tier II firms submitted quarterly reports, as did the Tier I firms; but
the Tier II firms were not required to submit advance notification of increases. Tier III firms were not required to submit reports but were expected
to maintain records which would permit auditing of compliance. Somewhat comparable procedures were established for monitoring pay increases.
PRICES AND WAGES DURING THE CONTROLS PERIOD
According to the indexes which provide comprehensive measures of the
movement of prices in the United States, the rate of inflation has declined
significantly during the controls period (Table 15 and Chart 7). Price behavior has been dominated by two facts: The rate of increase of prices other
than farm prices declined markedly compared with the precontrol period;
and the rate of increase of farm prices increased markedly compared with
the precontrol period. The decline in the rate of inflation obviously is therefore smaller in indexes which accord a heavy weight to farm and food prices
than it is in more comprehensive indexes like the consumer price index, the
gross national product (GNP) deflator, the private output deflator, and the
personal consumption expenditure deflator. Only the wholesale price index
(WPI) fails to show this slowdown in the rate of inflation. However, the
WPI reflects the prices of only about half the output produced or purchased
in the United States, and it gives considerably more weight to farm products
than is present in family budgets or in the national economy.
The broad price indexes clearly show the sharp decline of the inflation
rate during the freeze, the rise during the bulge after the freeze, and a decline thereafter to a rate below that of early 1971. The sole exception is
farm products.

Since most nonfarm prices were subject to controls and farm prices were
not, it is theoretically possible that the controls generated pressures which
increased farm prices. This possibility is significant because food prices are an
important part of consumer budgets. However, there is no evidence to indicate that the increase of farm prices was stimulated by the control of
prices in other sectors.
There is, on the contrary, considerable evidence which points to domestic
supply conditions and an increase in foreign demand as the main contributors to the rise in farm prices, and these two factors would have had much
the same effect even in the absence of a controls system. The supply of food
for domestic consumption not only failed to rise but actually declined on a
per capita basis, for two reasons. First, domestic food production declined
because of unfavorable natural conditions, including the earlier corn blight
and bad weather in 1972; hence, despite a rise in imports and a reduction
in carryover stocks, the supply available for domestic use and exports fell.
Second, food exports increased significantly because of bad growing weather

abroad. These exports were facilitated by U.S. arrangements to permit the
financing of grain exports to the U.S.S.R.
An additional factor which retarded the decline of some of the indexes
was the behavior of import prices. Because of the devaluation of the U.S.
dollar and rapid inflation abroad, the dollar prices of imports rose more
rapidly than U.S. prices. As a result, indexes which reflect prices of U.S.
purchases, such as the CPI and the personal consumption expenditure deflator, rose more rapidly than indexes which reflect the prices of U.S. output,
such as the GNP deflator and the private output deflator. This difference in
behavior is reflected in the comparison, near the bottom of Table 15, of
the price deflator for GNP and the price deflator for total U.S. purchases
(GNP plus imports minus exports).
Statistics on wage increases also showed a marked deceleration during the
controls period. Here too there is an initial sharp decline associated with the
freeze, followed by a brief upsurge in the months after the freeze, and then
a settling back to a rate below the level prior to the freeze. Several measures
of wage change are shown in Table 16 and Chart 8.

Additional evidence of the decline of the inflation rate is provided by the
substantial reduction in the size of negotiated increases in collective bargaining agreements covering 1,000 or more workers; the typical wage increase negotiated for the first year of a contract had been 11.8 percent for
the first 9 months of 1971 and 11.9 percent during all of 1970. In contrast,
this first-year increase declined to 7.6 percent for all of Phase II and to an
even more moderate 6.6 percent during the last 3 quarters of 1972. For
manufacturing alone, the first-year increase was 8.1 percent in 1970, 11
percent during the first 9 months of 1971, and 6.9 percent during Phase II.
Construction first-year wage increases, which had averaged 18.1 percent in
the 4 quarters prior to the establishment of the Construction Industry
Stabilization Committee in early 1971, slowed to 12.5 percent during the
first year of the CISC's operation and to 5.8 percent during the last 3
quarters of 1972.
Did Controls Reduce the Inflation Rate?
The fact that the rate of increase of both prices and wages declined during
the controls period does not prove that the controls themselves reduced the
rate of inflation. There are, naturally, two views on this subject: one is that
they were effective and the other is that they were not.
Those who say the controls were not effective rely primarily on the observation that the rate of inflation was declining before the controls began
and that no sharp discontinuity in the decline of the rate of inflation can be
dated from the beginning of the controls. Although a sharp cut in the inflation rate accompanied the freeze, and a bulge followed the relaxation
of the freeze, these can be regarded as only briefly displacing in time the
trend of prices that would otherwise have occurred.




60

The difficulty with this argument lies in the absence of any assurance
that the decline in the inflation rate which had occurred before the freeze
would have continued without it. The controls were imposed largely because there was no such assurance. Some of the reasons for the fear that the
inflation rate would not continue to decline have been given earlier in this
chapter.
The facts are that some price and wage increases were below the permitted amounts and that there have been few if any cases of shortages at
ceiling prices. But the first of these points is not inconsistent with the
controls having held down the average rate of inflation by holding down a
significant number of price and wage increases. And the second point is
consistent with the underlying rationale of the controls, which is that the
price and wage increases to be restrained were not increases necessary to
avert shortages.
The case for the effectiveness of controls rests in part on econometric
study of the relation between the rate of inflation and other variables,
such as unemployment, prior inflation rates, and growth of demand.
The relations derived from past experience are used to project what
the inflation rate would have been in the absence of controls. Since, as has
turned out in several studies, the projected inflation rate was larger than the
rate actually experienced in 1972, the conclusion is that the controls reduced
the inflation rate, and by the amount of the difference. Although these
studies ask the right question—What would the inflation rate have been
without the controls?—the poor record of this technique in predicting the
rate of inflation prior to controls does not inspire confidence in their answer,
and evidence from this source must be regarded as inconclusive.
One interesting set of facts bearing on the effectiveness of the controls system is the distribution by size of wage adjustments in collective bargaining
agreements. The data are shown in Table 17. The reduction from 1970 and
1971 to 1972 in the percentage of workers receiving increases of 10 percent
or more is striking, and it may reflect the curtailment of big increases
by the controls. In 1968, when there were no controls and the average increases were about the same as in 1972, the percentage of very large increases was also much less than in 1970 and 1971. Still, the 1972 distribution
is more compressed than that of 1968, at least in manufacturing: the proportion of very large adjustments was below the 1968 level. The group of
industries negotiating increases in 1972 was different from that in 1968,
however, and this may help explain the difference in the distribution.
We believe it is probable that the controls did reduce the rate of inflation,
but the magnitude of the reduction is uncertain. There are a number of
individual cases in which the controls seem to have restrained price and
wage increases, and it is hard to find cases in which the controls have stimulated increases. The slowdown of wage increases and of the private GNP
deflator is more pronounced during the controls period than before it. But

one cannot be sure that the controls had an effect on the rate of inflation.
Still less can the size of the effect be gauged.
However, this uncertainty does not imply an equal uncertainty about the
value of the controls. As we said at the outset, the controls were intended to
deal with the risk that inflation would again accelerate. To reduce that
risk substantially, as we believe the controls did, was a very significant contribution, but one that would not necessarily show up in a reduction of the
inflation rate below what would most probably have occurred without the
controls.
Reducing Inflationary

Expectations

The goal of policy in 1971 and 1972, as we have pointed out, was not only
to reduce the probable rate of inflation but also to reduce the general fear of
continued or rising inflation and thus to increase confidence in the achievement of price stability. A change in the perception of the U.S. inflation
prdblem has taken place. The controls have made a substantial contribution to this.
There are no completely satisfactory measurements of people's expectations and fears about inflation. But everyone who has examined his
own thinking and the thinking of other people in 1970, 1971, and 1972 can
see that a change has occurred since the controls were imposed, and these
changes are reflected in available public attitude surveys. For example, the



62

proportion of people surveyed in a poll who said they thought there was a
current danger of inflation declined from about 85 percent just before the
freeze to about 60 percent in December 1972. The proportion who said
they feared inflation at that time more than a year earlier fell from 70 percent to about 35 percent. Any other outcome would be strange. For a great
many people the idea that inflation could be reduced by fiscal and monetary
restraint is unreal and abstract. Disbelief on this score was reinforced by the
disappointing contrast between the many forecasts that inflation would
decline markedly in 1970 and 1971 and the actuality. On the other hand,
nothing seems more obvious than that the imposition of controls should curb
inflation. Moreover, the controls had a symbolic value as evidence of the
Government's determination to take whatever steps might be necessary
to check inflation.
Concern about inflation did not, of course, disappear. From time to time
in 1972 it was even fairly acute. Nevertheless, one has only to recall the tone
in which the problem was usually discussed in the summer of 1971 to see
how far we have come.
One of the most striking changes has been in the attitude of the international economic community toward the American inflation; before August
1971 it was the major concern of foreign observers and investors. By the
end of 1972 the American anti-inflation policy had become the marvel of
the rest of the world (Table 18). Largely because of this change the rest
of the world is willing to hold increasing amounts of dollars.

One objective indicator of inflationary expectations is the behavior of
interest rates, particularly those on long-term obligations. When increased
inflation is generally expected in the economy, lenders demand higher



63

interest rates to compensate them for the depreciation of the real values
of their loans. Borrowers are willing to pay higher rates because their
resources are expected to appreciate in nominal terms. Interest rates,
therefore, tend to rise and. fall in direct relation to changes in inflationary
expectations. The expected rate of inflation is, however, by no means the
only factor determining the behavior of interest rates, nor is it easy to
distinguish its effect from the effects of other factors operating at the
same time.
The behavior of interest rates after August 15, 1971 strongly suggests that
inflationary expectations receded abruptly as a result of the imposition of
the Economic Stabilization Program. On August 16 the yield on seasoned
3-5 year Treasury securities fell 40 basis points from August 13 levels,
and the Moody's Aaa long-term bond yield fell 20 basis points. By the end
of August these yields had fallen 75 and 26 basis points, respectively, from
the levels on August 13.
The declines in these yields were very sudden. Because they took place
so quickly, they cannot be explained by any fundamental force except
expectations. Hence a strong presumption exists that people believed the
effects of the freeze would not be completely reversed and that they expected the inflation rate to follow a lower course after August 15 than before.
While long-term interest rates rose early in 1972, they generally followed
a downward path after April, although scattered increases occurred, particularly in September. The declines took place in a period in which the
economy was expanding rapidly, at a pace seldom equaled, and short-term
rates were rising. Both of these forces are normally associated with increases in long-term rates as credit demands increase and expectations of
future short-term rates are revised upward; only twice in the past 26 years
had long-term rates declined over such a long period in such circumstances.
The fact that long-term interest rates declined on balance during 1972
even in the face of strong economic expansion suggests that long-term inflationary expectations which influence such rates were also revised. While
short-term expectations appear to have been quickly revised in 1971 after
the imposition of controls, investors in long-term securities took longer
to become convinced that inflation would remain on a lower path for a
considerable period to come.
The Fairness of Controls
In the development and management of the controls system, a great effort
has been devoted to achieving fairness, both in justice to those directly
affected and because belief that the system is fair is necessary to ensure the
voluntary support without which the system could not function. According to the concept of fairness underlying the controls, the system itself should
not substantially alter the distribution of income that would have occurred
in an expanding, noninflationary economy without controls.
Fairness in the controls system can be understood in small or large terms:
through the impact that controls exert on particular individuals and busi


64

nesses or the effect on such large classes, as wage earners and stockholders.
In particular instances there was undoubtedly some arbitrariness. The regulations were inevitably broad and general; case-by-case handling of inequities was slow. As the year passed, feeling grew that individual treatment
by the system had not always been equitable.
Public discussion and complaint about the fairness of the system have
related chiefly to the larger aggregates, however, especially to the relation
between wages and profits. In these terms it is hard to see that the controls
system has changed the distribution of income. If there has been any change
compared to what would have happened in a strong expansion without controls, it seems to have been favorable to wages. Employees' compensation
rose from 75.1 percent of the national income in the second quarter of 1971
to 75.3 percent in the third quarter of 1972, despite the normal tendency
of the labor share to decline when output expands rapidly. Related to
gross national product, the employee compensation percentages are 61.3
and 61.0, respectively. As is shown in Table 12, Chapter 1, employees' share
of the gross product of nonfinancial corporations declined insignificantly
(from 66.4 percent to 66.1 percent) over the same period. Also shown in
Chapter 1 (Table 11), the rise in profits relative to the rise in GNP has
been much smaller in the current recovery than in earlier business recoveries; a related fact is the modest increase in corporate dividends, which
have risen much less than employee compensation.
It seems quite clear that the share of labor in the national income has
not suffered at the expense of profits during the controls period. Yet it
is also true that real hourly labor compensation (compensation adjusted
for the cost of living) in the private nonfarm sector has not risen as fast
as output per hour in the private nonfarm sector. It is a well-known proposition of economics that if real compensation per hour does not rise as
fast as productivity, labor's share declines. However, this proposition holds
only if the prices used to deflate hourly money compensation and convert
it into real compensation are the prices of the workers' products. In the
present case, prices in the private nonfarm sector rose much less than the
consumer price index because of the large influence of farm prices and
import prices on the latter index. Therefore, real hourly compensation in
terms of the things workers produced rose much more than real compensation in terms of the CPI market basket (and it is the former which is relevant for the proposition about shares). From the second quarter of 1971 to
the fourth quarter of 1972 the purchasing power of the compensation for
an hour of work in the private nonfarm sector rose at an annual rate of 2.8
percent in terms of the items included in the CPI, but at 4.2 percent in
terms of the goods produced in the private nonfarm sector.
In a larger sense, workers gained much more from the controls program
than can be shown by calculations of their proportionate share in the national income. The confidence engendered by the program was an important
ingredient in the economic expansion which greatly increased employment,



65

hours of work, and productivity, and thus the real incomes of workers.
Real weekly earnings of private, nonfarm production workers (adjusted for
the CPI) rose at an annual rate of 3-4 percent from August 1971 to December 1972 compared to 3.0 percent in 1971 prior to the freeze and to an
average of 0.4 percent per year from 1965 to 1970. Total employment, including the Armed Forces (which declined), rose by 3.2 million from the
second quarter of 1971 through the fourth quarter of 1972, and the total
real compensation of employees rose at an annual rate of 5.7 percent.
THE COSTS OF CONTROLS
The actual or potential benefits of price and wage controls in reducing
both the inflation rate and the fear of inflation must be balanced against
their actual and potential costs. Several kinds of costs may be involved;
almost all are difficult or impossible to measure. An impressionistic review
suggests that these costs were probably not large in 1972, relative to the role
that the system played in the national economy, but that they were growing
as the year progressed.
1. Administrative costs. The controls program was designed to be carried
out with a staff of less than 4,000 people. The annual rate of expenditure
of the Cost of Living Council, the Pay Board, the Price Commission, and
related agencies was about $80 million. The cost of administering the program, however, even within the Federal Government, amounted to more
than this. The program was a demand on the time of the President and
of the heads of many Government departments and agencies. This cost
is to be measured in diversion from attention to other problems.
The administrative costs outside the Government were undoubtedly much
larger than those borne by the Government. Many more man-hours were
required to prepare applications and reports than to review them, and to
maintain records than to check them. There is no calculation of what this
cost amounted to in dollars, but it was probably substantial.
By the end of 1972 it appeared that the administrative costs would increase substantially if the program continued without modification. In a
continuing program, companies and workers would insist on more equitable
procedures that they did not demand when the system was considered to be
short-lived, and they would have more recourse to the courts to get their
full rights.
2. Industrial disputes. Previous experience, both in the United States and
elsewhere, suggested the danger that wage and price controls might lead to
exceptionally bitter industrial disputes and loss of time due to strikes. The
disinflationary process would in any case require a slowdown in the rate of
wage increases and thus carried with it the possibility of long strikes. This
possibility might be aggravated if the Government entered the picture by setting standards for maximum pay increases. In such a situation, wage disputes
could become tests of policy and power between Government and labor,



66

each party being unwilling to compromise and local cases threatening to
explode into nationwide stoppages.
Despite the danger, 1972 turned out to be a year of unusual industrial
peace. Time lost through strikes as a proportion of time worked was at its
lowest level in nearly 10 years. This outcome was a consequence of the
public's strong support for the program and the cooperative attitude among
workers and the leaders of organized labor.
3. Effects on productivity. Price control systems tend in greater or less
degree to be cost-plus systems which reduce the incentive to hold down costs
and may even create an incentive in the other direction. The basic price
standard in the 1971-72 controls program had this feature. Prices were generally permitted to be raised in proportion to costs, so that an increase of
costs also permitted an increase of profits. This effect was at least limited
by the requirement, adopted in May, that firms use an historical, industrywide productivity factor in calculating costs, rather than their own actual or
estimated productivity. However, firms would again be in the cost-plus situation if they reached their profit-margin limit, because an increase of costs
would then permit an increase in profits.
Productivity rose sharply in 1972. The cyclical conditions for such a rise
were highly favorable. Any adverse effect that the controls system may have
had on productivity is not visible in the statistics, although this does not
mean such effect was absent or negligible. Nevertheless, even anecdotal evidence of antiproductivity effects is rare. There were probably several reasons for this. Relatively few firms were up to their profit-margin standard
in 1972. Even those which were at the profit^margin limit felt restraint on
cost-raising tendencies because of competition from firms that were not.
Moreover, the expected short life of the controls made businesses especially
wary of falling into managerial practices that would be harmful when controls ended. All of these reasons suggested dangers as the controls continued,
particularly in an economy operating closer to its potential.
4. Effects on investment. The price control system posed certain threats
to the vigorous expansion of business investment. Profits were restrained by
the cost pass-through rules as well as by the profit-margin standard. Furthermore, in the calculation of costs to justify price increases no allowance was
made for the cost of nonborrowed capital. As a consequence, an increase in
equity capital per unit of output would reduce the rate of return on equity,
even though it permitted saving of other costs.
Despite these inhibiting factors, business investment rose substantially in
1972, and reports of business intentions suggest another substantial increase
in 1973. Since investment is undertaken in expectation of a future stream
of profits, the heavy investment of 1972-73 suggests that business viewed
controls as likely to be of relatively brief duration. The restraint on dividend
payments, which increased the internal funds of corporations, may also have
helped to sustain investment growth.




67

5. Distortions and interferences with production and distribution. There
are a number of classic ways in which long-maintained and rigid price controls in the face of excess demand distort the pattern of production and distribution. Low-margin goods disappear from the shelves, black markets and
informal rationing appear, the quality of goods and services is degraded, and
innovations are discouraged. Very little of this distorting effect showed up
during 1972. There were stories, whose significance was difficult to measure,
of a shift toward high-profit lines in the lumber industry, of favoritism in
the allocation of lumber to dealers, and even of lumber production held back
to await the end of controls. Relative prices under the controls induced
production of more gasoline and less fuel oil than would have occurred in
free markets. The ceilings on service fees charged by hospitals may have led
to the provision of an unnecessarily large amount of services.
However, these cases were exceptional. They were kept from becoming
more common by the flexibility of the controls system and by an even more
important factor, the prevalence of unused production capacity during 1972.
WHERE WE STAND
By the end of 1972 the rate of inflation had been clearly reduced
from its level when the freeze took effect. Moreover, what had happened
was not merely a suppression of price increases that would burst out if controls were removed. Although some such increases might occur, a more
durable change had taken place in the conditions underlying wage and price
increases. Expectations of rapid inflation had diminished, and not only because of controls. Confidence in the Administration's determination to pursue a noninflationary fiscal and monetary policy had been strengthened.
An economic background for wage decisions had been established which
was much more conducive to moderation than had prevailed earlier. Although workers had, on the average, been getting large wage increases
in money terms in 1970 and 1971, they felt very little real improvement because of the rapid inflation. Consequently there was a strong push, recognized by employers as well as workers, for even larger wage increases. In
contrast, at the end of 1972 workers had been receiving the same or smaller
hourly wage increases, but the increase in their buying power during the
year had been much larger. This contrast is shown in Table 19, which compares the conditions of 1972 with the conditions of 1969, that is, 1 year before
many of the collective bargaining agreements to be negotiated in 1973 were
last negotiated.
Developments during the controls period have thus improved the position of workers in the aggregate; they should also have particular relevance for employees in those sectors where bargaining activity in 1973 will
be concentrated. In recent years, before the introduction of controls, wages
in the major industries affected by collective bargaining agreements showed
a persistent tendency to fall behind the rest of the economy during the term

of a multiyear agreement and then to catch up through larger increases
when new agreements were negotiated. As the accelerating and high inflation rate has receded, however, a fundamental change has occurred in the
manner in which inflation and long-term contracts have affected the relative
position of unionized workers in the wage structure. Workers covered by
many important contracts expiring in the near future appear either to have
maintained or to have improved their relative position in the wage structure.
Thus the economic performance of 1971 and 1972 gave rise to several
factors favorable to price stability in 1973. At the same time, this performance
did not achieve a final liquidation of the extraordinary inflation problem left
behind by the 1965-68 demand surge. The rise of prices, as measured by the
consumer price index, was above the interim target rate set by the Administration and above the rate that would be considered permanently satisfactory.
Apprehension about the future inflation rate, although much diminished,
remained. Sensitivity to the vestiges of recent inflationary experience
was heightened by the prospect and need for continued expansion and by
the large number of workers who would be involved in new wage settlements in 1973.
A case could therefore be made for continuing the anti-inflationary influence of controls in 1973. But the experience of 1972 also suggested a number of dangers to be avoided. Although the costs of controls in retarding
and distorting economic activity had apparently thus far not been great,
these costs seemed to be rising. They could be much more significant in 1973
as the program aged and as the economy came closer to its potential. The
number of instances of excess demand would multiply, and the relative
price ceilings established by the system would become more potent sources
of distortions. More and more companies would hit their profit-margin




69

ceilings, with adverse consequences for cost control and for investment incentives. More insistence on formal and equitable procedures would arise, litigation would multiply, and administrative costs, public and private, would
increase greatly. Less tolerance of the inevitable delays and red tape of the
system would be forthcoming.
These dangers and difficulties did not mean that continuation of controls
was impossible or undesirable. They did mean that even temporary continuation would require modification of the program. They reinforced the idea
that controls should not be a permanent part of the American economic
system. And they emphasized the need for maintaining general noninflationary economic conditions which would permit the controls to continue for a
while and then to disappear. These considerations were all prominent in the
development of the policy for 1973 which is discussed in Chapter 3.




70

CHAPTER 3

Outlook and Policy
PRINCIPAL QUESTION on the economic outlook for 1973 is
-*• not whether, but how fast, output and employment will expand. For
policy, there are two issues. The first is to find and implement the set of policy
actions which will maximize the likelihood that the economy will move to
its full potential level of output and employment. The second is to do so in
ways that will serve both to eliminate the vestiges of the post-1965 inflation
and to place the economy squarely on a sustainable path of subsequent noninflationary growth.
This is an ambitious set of policy goals, but there is a good prospect of
achieving them, or at least approaching them closely. The year ahead is the
first in a long time in which there is reasonable hope of closing in on full
prosperity without serious inflation and without war.
For this to become a reality rather than just a hope will require full
cooperation from business and labor. It will also require coordinated policy
actions by the Administration, the Congress, and the Federal Reserve System. The economy will be approaching the zone of its potential by the
end of the year. Such an economy requires a disciplined balancing of conflicting short-run interests in order to ensure that the common prosperity, which
benefits all interests, can be sustained without interruption.
The central need is to balance the speed of expansion against its durability, but in the context of 1973 this problem has many other dimensions:
The allocation of output between uses dictated by the Government and
those dictated by the private sector; the balancing of the need for allowing
free operation of market mechanisms for determining individual prices and
wages against the continuing need for restraint on the average level of prices;
the division of emphasis between minimizing unemployment in the short run
and minimizing it more permanently.
GUIDES T O OVERALL ECONOMIC POLICY
The basic mandate for policy set forth in the Employment Act is to
achieve "maximum employment, production, and purchasing power." The
question of the precise meaning of those goals was left unresolved when the
Act was passed in 1946 and has remained open ever since.
In the early 1960's a judgment was put forward that maximum employ-




71

ment for that time would be achieved when 96 percent of the labor force was
employed, which meant 4 percent unemployed. Paralleling this estimate was a
calculation of "maximum output/ 5 usually called potential GNP, which was
conceptually the output that would be realized if the economy were operating
at full employment. Estimates of potential GNP, at constant prices, were
actually derived by assuming that the potential level of output was equal to
the level of actual output in mid-1955, and that it would increase at a trend
rate based on underlying changes in population, the proportion of the population that would be in the labor force, hours of work, and productivity. The
trend rate was adjusted from time to time to reflect changes in the underlying
variables. The benchmark period, mid-1955, was selected because it appeared
to reflect most of the characteristics associated with noninflationary full
employment, including an unemployment rate close to 4 percent (the actual
rate of unemployment for the second and third quarters of 1955 was 4*4
percent).
These estimates of maximum employment and potential output were not
considered to be either immediate or permanent guides to policy. In fact,
policy in the early 1960's recognized that too fast a push to maximum employment or potential output could be dangerous. At the same time the
96 percent employment rate, or 4 percent unemployment rate, was considered
to be an "interim" goal, which might be changed later as a result of improvements in labor markets or other developments.
These judgments applied to conditions expected in the early 1960's. In
retrospect, the standard they suggested seems to have been in the correct
zone: Steady noninflationary expansion did raise the rate of employment
to 95/ 2 percent and the ratio of actual to potential output to 99 percent by
mid-1965, and both rates might have risen somewhat further or could have
at least been sustained without generating inflation, had the normal course
of events not been disrupted by the subsequent rapid rise in defense spending
and the associated budget deficits.
The standards are a less reliable guide to policy for the 1970's than they
were for the 1960's. Large and unpredicted changes have taken place in the
nature, composition and behavior of the labor force, employment and
unemployment, as well as in the length of the workweek. Also the economy
itself has been through the worst and most prolonged period of price and
wage inflation since World War II. These changes have important implications for the guidance of policy.
Given that our knowledge of the interrelation between the levels of output, employment, and prices at "maximum employment" is incomplete, it
would be preferable to think of each objective, not in terms of a single value
but as a range of values. Furthermore, the behavior of the economy in the
near future will be determined not only by whether it is operating below or
above some numerical potential output or below or above some target rate
of employment, but also by the speed and manner with which it approaches
the range of its potential levels. Against the background of recent inflation-




72

ary history it is necessary to give the economy reasonable assurance that
policy will not repeat the fiscal errors which ignited the inflation in the first
place. Too fast a dash for a numerical target of potential would rekindle
inflationary expectations and behavior that might make the potential itself
unattainable, and would make it unsustainable if attained, whereas a more
gradual approach which allows for the sensitivity of wages and prices to
expectations would make the potential not only attainable but sustainable.
The Government can neither precisely predict what maximum employment or maximum production will be nor can it precisely control the level
of actual employment or production. What the outcomes should be and will
be depends upon private behavior—upon the amount of work and production
that people want to do on realistically achievable terms—as well as upon
public policy. The contribution of public policy is to create conditions in
which people can reach their desired employment and production goals
through feasible behavior in the market. One aspect of this contribution is
that the total demand for output in money terms should be sufficient so that
people who want to work can find work without an unrealistically large departure from accustomed and expected patterns of wage behavior.
Specifically, in the current situation we believe these guides mean that the
money value of output should rise at a rate which, with reasonably expectable
price and wage behavior, would reduce the rate of unemployment to the
neighborhood of 4 / 2 percent by the end of 1973. The rise of money gross
national product (GNP) would be about 9 percent from the end of 1972
to the end of 1973. This does not imply that in present circumstances 4*/2
percent is necessarily the floor to the unemployment rate. It does imply a
belief that a more rapid expansion of the economy within 1973 would endanger the further reduction of the inflation rate that is desirable, and would
do so despite the continuing price and wage controls program. However, if,
as a result of cooperation with the controls system or for other reasons, prices
and wages rise less rapidly than is assumed here, the increase in money GNP
suggested for the year would permit output and employment to rise more
and unemployment to fall further.
Policy beyond 1973 will have to be adaptable to developments during
the year. However, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, a sustained
period of uninterrupted expansion would provide the optimal background
for maximizing both employment and price stability. To this end, the
appropriate policy goal in the ensuing period would seem to be a steady
increase of money demand (money GNP) at a rate consonant with the potential growth rate of the economy and reasonable price stability. Again, this
would not imply that the unemployment rate of 4 / 2 percent assumed to
have been reached by the end of 1973 will not decline further. If, with
4J/2 percent unemployment, there is the pressure of an excess supply of




73

labor the average rate of wage and price increase would be lower and the
rise in employment relative to the labor force would be higher, leading to
a further reduction of the unemployment rate.
A further reduction of the unemployment rate in 1974 and beyond to even
lower levels would be assisted by labor market policies, including manpower
programs, which effectively reduce the relatively high level of frictional and
structural unemployment that has typically been experienced in the United
States.
It is worth repeating that the policy goal is a condition in which persons
who want work and seek it realistically on reasonable terms can find employment. The Government must make two kinds of contribution to the achievement of this goal. First, it must maintain reasonable stability in the overall
rate of economic growth so that the efforts of individuals to find work are
not frustrated by erratic changes in the conditions on which work is available. Second, it must seek to eliminate obstacles that prevent willing workers
and willing employers from getting together, insofar as these obstacles can
be overcome without excessive cost. When the condition that persons who
want work can find it through serious search is met, the rate of unemployment as we measure it will not be zero. What it would be we do not know.
Undoubtedly the number would change from time to time. But it is the
condition which is important, not the statistic.
FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY
The path of the economy suggested above calls for slowing down the rise
of money GNP, which was about 11 percent during 1972, to about 9 percent
during 1973 and to a steady rate less than that thereafter. This desired shift
to a slower rate of increase of money GNP would be assisted by a shift of the
budget—from a position in which the unified budget would be in deficit at
full employment to a position in which it would be in balance at full employment. In fact, the strength of the private demand forces in the economy,
described below, argues that this shift in the budget position is essential to
avoid an inflationary pace of expansion. The desired subsequent steadiness
of the rate of increase of money GNP would be assisted by keeping the
budget in a position of balance at full employment, unless there later appears
clear and strong evidence that developments in the private sector call for
greater fiscal stimulus or restraint. Constancy in the relation between fullemployment receipts and expenditures provides approximate constancy in
the Federal contribution to economic expansion. The constancy of the contribution is only approximate because the impact of the budget on the economy depends on its composition and total size as well as on the size of the deficit or surplus. However, constancy of the balance at full employment is the
best single guide to a budget policy that neither pushes the economy above its
desired growth rate nor holds the economy below it. In any case, the rule




74

that expenditures should not exceed the revenues that would be collected at
full employment is essential to bring home the requirement that Government should not spend money for things it is unwilling to ask citizens to pay
for. The circumstances of 1973 are appropriate for getting on to that track.
A gradual slowing down of the expansion of money GNP to a steady rate
consistent with the long-run potential growth rate of the economy and
reasonable price stability is also an appropriate goal for monetary policy.
This is likely to require a slower increase of the supply of money and credit
than was proper when the main objective was to encourage a quickened economic expansion in an environment of substantial unused resources.
There is, as far as we are aware, little explicit disagreement with the
proposition that the budget should be brought into a position of full-employment balance for fiscal year 1974. The threat to the achievement of fullemployment balance is not that the country or the Congress will decide
against it but that congressional procedures will be incapable of carrying
out a policy to do it. Congress, under present practice, makes hundreds of
separate decisions affecting expenditures but does not decide at any point
in the process what total expenditures should be. Lacking the discipline that
would be imposed by recognition of a limit to total spending, Congress tends
regularly to authorize and appropriate too much money, constantly straining the ability of the Executive to keep spending under control.
If the budget is not to be a perpetual menace to economic stability, better
congressional procedures will have to be created for making a deliberate
decision about total spending. That is why the President has urged the
Congress to establish a rigid ceiling on fiscal year 1974 expenditures before it
passes any other spending legislation this year. The President has also urged
the Congress to act on its own initiative to reform its expenditure-deciding
process. In fact the problem is now more recognized in Congress than it has
been for many years and there have been encouraging moves there to deal
with it.
We also need to consider whether the future conduct of fiscal policy could
be improved if Congress were to develop expeditious procedures for
temporary, limited changes in the level of particular taxes. Such changes
could take the form of a temporary, 1-year, positive or negative surcharge
rate on personal and corporate income taxes, or additionally a temporary,
1-year shift in the rate of the investment tax credit. Both suggestions have
been advanced with some regularity over the past two decades, and while
they raise many difficult questions it is also generally agreed that we cannot
be complacent about our existing instruments for the conduct of fiscal policy.
Basic changes in the structure and level of tax rates do and should require extended discussion. At the same time, experience has shown that the
proper conduct of macroeconomic policy may sometimes call for a prompt
and effective shift in the overall balance between the flow of Federal receipts
and expenditures. Temporary and prompt changes in tax rates, which do not




75

alter the basic structure of taxes, may provide an efficient way of accomplishing such required shifts.
Government Expenditures
The shift to full-employment budget balance by 1974 can be accomplished
either by raising tax rates or by restraining the rate at which expenditures
rise. The Administration has a clear preference for the latter.
The conceptual basis for arriving at public expenditure decisions is fairly
straightforward. In general, public expenditure is justified when both of
two conditions are met: If a desired result can be achieved at less cost by
public rather than private spending and if the expenditure yields benefits
which (adjusted for their timing) are greater than their costs, measured by
the value and timing of the alternatives that have to be foregone in order
to finance the outlays required.
In practice, there are formidable difficulties in arriving at sound public
spending decisions. For many expenditures, reliable estimates of benefits and
costs are not available. Many decisions have spending consequences that
stretch years beyond the point at which the decision itself is made; over this
period, circumstances, priorities, costs, and benefits may and do change.
The proper management of public spending therefore requires the continuous reevaluation of prior decisions from which current spending flows as
well as the careful evaluation of new decisions. Furthermore it is instructive
to gain perspective by referring to a rough guide such as the fraction of
total output which flows through the government sector.
The United States has now been through a period of substantial growth
of government expenditures, both absolutely and relative to the size of the
economy. In making a comparison with the size of the economy it is useful
to abstract from fluctuations in the level of actual output around its path
of potential growth. To this end, the data shown in Table 20 relate the
level of government spending and its major components to the level of
potential GNP. Separate figures are shown for the Federal Government
(including grants to the State and local level), the State and local sector
(excluding Federal grants) and for all levels of government combined.
Excluding defense spending, the ratio of government expenditures—
Federal and State and local—to potential GNP rose from 14 percent in
1955 to 23 percent in 1971. Defense spending fluctuated relative to
GNP but was much lower at the end than at the beginning of the period.
During these years, potential GNP, measured in nominal dollars, nearly
tripled.
The share of the Federal portion in total government civilian spending also
rose rapidly between 1955 and 1971. In 1955 Federal civilian spending was
6.6 percent of potential GNP compared to 7.4 percent for State and local
spending. Over the 16-year period the Federal share rose twice as fast
as the State and local share. By 1971 Federal civilian spending was 12.4
percent of potential GNP as against 10.5 percent for the State and local
sector.

For all levels of government, the largest increases were recorded in
spending for education, health, and welfare purposes. Total spending for
such purposes rose from 8.5 percent of potential GNP to 15.9 percent, and
Federal spending rose from 3.7 percent of potential GNP in 1955 (about
$15 billion) to 8.3 percent in 1971 (about $93 billion). A large part of
the rise was in spending connected with social security programs for the
aged and disabled, although other forms of spending for education, health,
and welfare functions also rose rapidly.
The rise in the share of Federal civilian spending in the United States
has accelerated since the mid-1960's along with the large increase in the
number and scope of social programs. Many of these were introduced
without any firm estimate of how effective they would be in solving the
problems to which they were addressed or how much they would cost in
the long run. At the same time there has emerged the need for new social
programs, especially in the field of pollution abatement.
The continued existence of large social problems alongside a greatly
expanded volume of government expenditures designed to correct these
problems is not a strong argument for devoting a still-larger share of the

490-000 O - 73 - 6




77

national output to similar government programs. On the contrary, it is an
argument for close scrutiny of these programs to discover whether they can
be justified by their results. Such a scrutiny, carried out by the Administration, has led to decisions to cut back many programs, even though total
Federal spending, after the cuts, will still be rising by about $20 billion a
year. Making these cutbacks in less effective programs will provide budget
room for consideration of more effective programs later as the growth
of the economy expands the Federal revenue.
PRICE AND WAGE RESTRAINTS IN PHASE III
The purpose of budget and monetary policy is to help the economy achieve
sustainable expansion along the growth path of potential output. One necessary condition for achieving this objective is the avoidance of policy errors
which risk the re-emergence of generalized demand-pull inflation. A second
condition is that the risk of inflation related to cost-push and expectational
factors should also be minimized. Inflationary expectations and behavior
left over from the country's experience since 1966, even though reduced
in 1972 from previous heights, have not been completely eliminated. The selfinterest of both business and labor calls for restraint and hence can be expected to lead to an even more durable winding-down of inflationary patterns
than the economy has already achieved. However, the reciprocal abatement
of the rate of wage and price increases is a delicate and complex process that
can be upset through unrestrained behavior by particular sectors of the pricewage spectrum. To avoid the risk of such disruption, it is necessary to maintain a system of direct wage and price restraints in 1973.
Although temporary continuation of controls in 1973 is necessary, the
condition of the economy and of the controls system have pointed to the
need for substantial changes in the program. Two things are critical. One is
to restrain and, if possible, reverse the rapid rise of food prices. The
second is to moderate the degree of detailed supervision and mandatory enforcement in the system in order to preserve the self-restraint which has been
the essence of the progam.
In 1972 food prices rose much more rapidly than other prices. The reasons for this, and the steps taken to curb the food price increase, are described
in Chapter 2 and its supplement. By the end of 1972 adverse weather conditions had further reduced the food supply in prospect for 1973. Moreover,
it began to appear that these uncontrollable adversities were superimposed on
an agricultural policy which, although less restrictive than it had been, still
leaned too far in the direction of limiting output and stocks relative to the
rising domestic and foreign demand. This was especially true for meat,
where the programs adopted in the early 1960's had made a major change
in the way farmers could use their cropland. Whereas previous programs
had placed limits on actual acres of crops produced, and allowed other
areas of land to be used for livestock grazing or production of minor crops,




78

the new programs utilized a new concept. They restricted the production of
major crops by paying farmers to idle a portion of the acres previously used
in crop production. In return for the payment, the idle acres had to be
planted to soil-conserving crops and could no longer be used for livestock
grazing or other crop production during the most productive part of the
year. This change had the effect of slowing the rate of growth of meat
production after 1965. With strong growth in demand for meat in 1972,
prices rose rapidly.
Arresting the rapid rise in food prices is a key element in the 1973 stabilization program, both because of the direct importance of food in family
budgets and because of the possible link between food prices and moderation of wage increases. Accordingly, the revision of the Phase II program
included major steps to restrain food price increases in addition to what had
been done in 1972.
During January 1973 the Administration took a number of strong measures which will have an important impact on food supplies and food prices,
although with some lag. These include:
1. Suspension for 1973 of mandatory acreage set-aside requirements under
the wheat program.
2. Disposal of Government-owned stocks of grains, except for minimum
reserves, to be completed promptly.
3. Termination of Government loans, effective May 31, 1973, on farmerowned stocks of grains from crops of 1971 or earlier years.
4. Suspension of all remaining export subsidies for foods, applying to
chickens, flour, and lard.
5. Permission for acreage diverted from crop production under Government programs to be used for grazing animals under arrangements to be
agreed upon with the Department of Agriculture.
To help assure that the agricultural policies of Government are consistent with the anti-inflation objective, administrative actions of the Department of Agriculture affecting food supplies and prices will hereafter
be subject to review by the Cost of Living Council (CLC). The CLC
Committee on Food has been set up to discharge this function as well as
to review or initiate other policies and proposals that may affect food prices.
This can lead to a progressive reorientation of agricultural policy to the
needs of the 1970's.
As in Phase II, mandatory controls will be continued on food processing
and distribution. Large food processors will be required to comply with previous regulations, including prenotification and approval of cost-justified
price increases. The limitations on retailers' margins established under the
Phase II system will remain in force, except for mii.or administrative changes.
Pay units in the food processing and retailing industries will remain under
mandatory pay control.




79

Concern with the food price problem in 1972 led the Cost of Living
Council to ask the National Commission on Productivity to undertake a study
on ways to improve productivity and reduce costs in food production and
distribution. The study, which has now been transmitted to the CLC for its
consideration, contains numerous suggestions for both Government and private action. A Food Industry Advisory Committee, drawn from the private
economy, has been established to advise the CLC on matters relating to food
costs and prices. One of its main functions will be to assist in carrying out
recommendations for raising productivity arising from the recently completed study.
Three other sectors of the economy, in addition to food, will receive special attention under Phase III.
(a) Medical care. Mandatory control of prices and wages remains in
force in the health industry. The Cost of Living Council Committee on
Health will review Government activities significantly influencing healthcare expenses. A Health Industry Advisory Committee composed of private
citizens will advise the CLC in this area.
(b) Construction costs. The Construction Industry Stabilization Committee will continue to operate as under Phase II to restrain wage increases
in that industry. Construction prices are subject to reduction if scheduled wage increases are reduced.
(c) Interest and dividends. The Committee on Interest and Dividends
will continue its efforts to obtain voluntary cooperation in holding down
dividend payments and interest rates.
Outside of these particular areas, the main effort of Phase III is to bring
about private action on wages and prices consistent with the goal of
slowing down the inflation rate without imposing unnecessary burdens on
the economy. These burdens, described in Chapter 2 as they related to Phase
II, included administrative costs for the Government and the private sector,
interferences with productivity and production, obstructions to the normal
conduct of business and collective bargaining, weakening of incentives to
investment, and a feeling of inequity on the part of some. Although surprisingly small during 1972, these burdens were becoming more serious and
there was every reason to believe that they would become still more serious
as the control system continued and as the economy moved closer to its
potential.
These costs or burdens of the system were not essential for its basic objective. The objective was not to force prices and wages to conform in every
particular case to precisely defined standards laid down by the Government,
nor to obtain advance approval for every private action. The objective was
a certain average degree of restraint. But prior to August 1971 private decisions had been made for a long time in a highly inflationary atmosphere.
With that background, spontaneous wage and price decisions in 1972 could
have come out a long way from the requirements of price stability, even




80

given a general desire to cooperate in the fight against inflation. Thus the
ability of the Government to monitor private behavior and enforce reasonable compliance with the requirement of price stability had to be developed
and demonstrated. Therefore, the situation of Phase II required prenotification, precise standards, and omnipresent enforcement. The conditions at the
opening of 1973 permitted and—if the system was to survive and succeed—
required a relaxation of these forms of the system. This is the basic philosophy
of Phase III.
The President has established a goal of getting the rate of inflation down
to 2^4 percent or less by the end of 1973. The Cost of Living Council has set
forth standards of price and wage behavior which are consistent with
the achievement of this goal. These standards are essentially the standards
of Phase II, with some modifications on the price side which are noted
below. The CLC has authority to change these standards. In considering
modification of the pay standards the CLC will have the advice of a LaborManagement Advisory Committee composed of leading private citizens.
Compliance with these standards is expected to be initially and generally
voluntary. The program will be self-administering, in the sense that private
parties can calculate the application of the standards in their own cases. The
experience under Phase II, and the regulations and definitions developed
under it, were invaluable in making this possible. Businesses and collective
bargaining units will not be required to notify the Government in advance
of price or wage increases. The largest economic units will be required to
submit quarterly reports to the Cost of Living Council, which will permit
the CLC to assess their behavior relative to the requirements of the antiinflation goal. Moderate-sized economic units will be required to maintain
records for the same purpose. The parts of the economy not required to submit reports or maintain records will be surveyed from statistical and other
information and are expected to follow the same standards.
When the Cost of Living Council believes that there have been, or are
about to be, price or wage increases that are not reasonably consistent with
the objectives of the program it can take action to stop them. Among other
things, it can, if it considers it appropriate, issue an order under the authority of the Economic Stabilization Act setting a ceiling on specific prices or
wages. This order might be temporary, pending a hearing. While the order
is in effect, transgressing it will be a violation of the Act and subject to its
penalties. In determining whether price or wage increases are not reasonably
consistent with the objectives of the program the CLC will be guided by the
standards it has issued.
The Price Commission and the Pay Board will no longer operate in Phase
III, but many of their functions will be performed by Price and Pay Divisions
of the Cost of Living Council. Rent control, which had already been cut down
to cover about 30 percent of rental units, is terminated in Phase III, because
it leads to costly evasions, enforcement is difficult, and housing market condi-




81

tions have significantly improved. The total number of personnel assigned to
the program will be reduced from about 43000 to about 2,000. Relieved of the
necessity to process a large flow of advance notifications, and to administer
rent control, this staff will be adequate to maintain an effective option for the
Government to intervene to assure achievement of the anti-inflation goal.
The President has asked for a 1-year extension of the Economic Stabilization
Act, which would otherwise expire on April 30,1973.
One significant change ha<s been made in the standard for prices. As in
Phase II, prices may be increased only to reflect cost increases. These costbased price increases are then subject to one of two further limits. First, the
average increase in a firm's prices may not exceed 1.5 percent in a year; if
this standard is observed the firm's profit margin will not be limited. Second,
if a firm's average price increase exceeds 1.5 percent that firm may not
exceed its base period profit margin. Thus, a firm is given the opportunity
to exceed its base period profit margin if it does so by increasing productivity,
without raising prices by more than 1.5 percent. The base period for calculation of the allowable profit margin is slightly altered by permitting the inclusion of fiscal years ending after August 15, 1971.
The essence of Phase III is that the Government retains the enforcement
ability and authority necessary to the Nation's anti-inflation objective while
leaving the private sector the maximum possible freedom to pursue productivity, efficiency, and collective bargaining.
THE OUTLOOK FOR 1973
The U.S. economy will expand substantially in 1973. All major components of demand will rise strongly except for residential construction and
Federal purchases. Aggregate demand for goods and services will rise by about
10 percent, from an estimated 1972 level of $1,152 billion to about $1,267
billion in 1973.* The real increase is projected at 6% percent with an implied
increase in the GNP price deflator of 3 percent. This projection of GNP
prices is compatible with the objective that the rate of inflation, as measured
by the consumer price index, be reduced to 2^2 percent or less by the end of
1973. Civilian employment is expected to rise more rapidly than the civilian
labor force, reducing the unemployment rate to the neighborhood of 4 / 2
percent by the end of the year.
The course of the U.S. economy, at least through the first half of 1973,
will be dominated by expansive forces already in place at yearend 1972.
Business investment has developed a strong forward momentum, stimulated
by both the fact and the expectation of expanding orders, sales, and profits.
The ability and willingness of consumers to increase their purchases has been
augmented by the large increase in social security benefits in the fourth
*Given the path of money GNP in 1972, an increase of 10 percent between the
average level in 1972 and the average level in 1973 is consistent with an increase
of 9 percent from the end of 1972 to the end of 1973.




82

quarter of 1972 and their incomes will be augmented again early in 1973 by
Federal pay increases. The financial position of the State and local government sector, stronger than it has been in many years, will be strengthened
further by both current revenue sharing payments and retroactive payments
for 1972.
Given these expansive forces the probability is that the economy will
maintain a very high rate of real growth over the first half of 1973. After
midyear, the economy will be significantly closer to the zone of full potential
output, and it is both probable and desirable that the rate of expansion will
and should abate toward its sustainable long-run path.
The outlook for the major components of expenditure on GNP in 1973
is discussed in the following sections.
Business Fixed Investment
The Council expects the rise in business fixed investment to continue on
its strong upward course and to increase by 14 percent from 1972 to 1973,
about the same as the rise from 1971 to 1972. The last time two successive
annual increases of this magnitude occurred was in the mid-1960's. A substantial part of the earlier increase took place before the rapid buildup of the
war in Vietnam. The foundation for the large increase expected in 1973
has already been laid. The rapid expansion in 1972 has generated increased
requirements for capacity expansion and has also provided business with a
substantial part of the funds required for capital goods purchases: In addition to rising profits, the actual and potential availability of funds has been
augmented by liberalized depreciation provisions, the investment tax credit,
and the restraint on dividend increases, as well as by favorable financial conditions in the markets for debt and equity capital. This year's strong economy
will sustain investment plans that have already been made and, indeed, will
probably lead to their upward revision.
Several indications of forward investment commitments were noted in
Chapter 1. Additional evidence can be found in the strong buildup in unfilled order backlogs held by producers of capital goods, which were 14
percent larger in November 1972 than a year earlier. Recent months have
also seen a pronounced step-up in construction contract awards for factory
building, which had been lagging for several years.
According to the most recent Commerce Department survey, taken in
November and December and published in January, businessmen were
projecting a rise of 13 percent in their plant and equipment expenditures
from 1972 to 1973. The survey also projected a rise of 13/ 2 percent for
manufacturing companies. These results correspond fairly closely with a
similar survey conducted by McGraw-Hill in late October. The manufacturing increases extended to almost all major industries and were especially
large in the durable goods sector. Investment by nonmanufacturing business is expected to continue its steady upward trend for a projected rise of
12% percent, with larger than average increases in spending by public
utilities and mining.



83

The Council's forecast for an overall rise of 14 percent is basically consistent with the rise projected in the anticipations survey for 1973. One reason
for a slightly higher forecast is that investment demand is expected to be
strong in certain sectors not covered by the plant and equipment survey,
notably investment in agriculture, and among professional businesses. A
second reason is that over the postwar period anticipations have tended to
underestimate actual results during periods of strong expansion.
It is interesting to note that experience in 1972 was an exception to the
general rule: Business spent less on new plant and equipment in 1972 than
was projected early in the year by both the Commerce and McGraw-Hill
surveys. It is highly unlikely that the shortfall was due to disappointments in
demand; indeed, capital appropriations, new orders, and contract awards all
increased as 1972 progressed. A possible explanation for the shortfall which
occurred is that construction and equipment costs did not rise as fast as
originally expected, especially for older projects that had been planned
several years previously and had been reactivated after postponement during
the recession.
Inventory Investment
The change in business inventories is expected to total $12^2 billion in
1973, an increase of about $7 billion over last year's level of inventory
accumulation. Considering the strength of the rise in output and sales in
1972, inventory accumulation was relatively low. However, stocks relative
to sales at the beginning of 1972 were still a little high by historical experience. In addition, most sectors experienced few problems with delivery
delays, and under such conditions a major shift in inventory policy was not
likely. The combination of last year's strong upsurge in sales and the moderate rise in stocks has reduced the ratio of stocks to sales for manufacturing
and trade firms combined to its lowest level since 1966. One structural element that will help add to inventory investment this year is the increased
demand—stemming from some of the capital-intensive manufacturing industries—for heavy equipment with long production lead times.
Residential Construction
Residential construction expenditures are expected to rise only slightly
from 1972 to 1973 and to decline somewhat in real terms. Housing starts are
expected to edge down gradually throughout 1973, averaging 2.2 million
units as compared to 2.4 million in 1972. In general the decrease in new
starts will reflect cutbacks in some areas where overbuilding has occurred,
some reduction in the backlog of demand as this is satisfied by the very large
volume of completions expected in 1973, and somewhat less favorable conditions in mortgage markets than prevailed last year. The number of new
nonfarm housing units—public as well as private—to be started under HUD-




84

subsidized programs is expected to exceed the 1972 level somewhat, even
though new commitments under these programs are being discontinued.
The reduction in total starts is not expected to be severe because the underlying demand for housing—buttressed by strong formation of new households and replacement demand—continues to be very high. Furthermore,
while some rise in interest rates may occur as a result of the strong upsurge
in business activity, there is little possibility of the stringent financial conditions that led to shortages of mortgage funds in 1966 and 1969.
Government Purchases
Government purchases are expected to show mixed trends. State and local
purchases are projected to rise by 12 percent, or by somewhat more than
last year's 10 percent rise, due in part to the effects of revenue sharing. Many
States and localities have indicated that spending increases related to revenue sharing receipts will take the form of capital projects, in which case the
full impact of the new program on the economy will be deferred by the longer
lags involved in planning and executing such expenditures. There will also be
tax cuts from existing levels or the avoidance of tax increases that might
otherwise have taken place in the absence of revenue sharing, and also some
debt reduction. All of this may stimulate the economy but not in the form
of higher government purchases.
Federal purchases of goods and services are scheduled to show little change
from 1972 to 1973, which means a decrease in real terms. The year begins
with a Federal pay raise for both military and civilian workers that is
expected to add $2.2 billion a year to Federal payrolls, although part of this
rise is expected to be offset by subsequent reductions in personnel.
Net Exports
Imports of goods and services are likely to exceed exports again in 1973
but the difference is expected to be narrower by about $2j/s> billion than was
the case in 1972. The improving trend in the balance of trade that began in
mid-197 2 should continue through the coming year. Because the growth of
U.S. output from yearend 1972 to yearend 1973 will be slower than it was
in the preceding 4-quarter period, the demand for imports should rise less
rapidly than during 1972. At the same time, economic growth in major
industrial countries abroad is expected to be more rapid during 1973 than
during 1972, and on this account the growth rate of demand for U.S. exports
should show an improvement. Furthermore the slower rise in U.S. costs and
prices relative to those experienced by our trading partners should increase
the relative demand for U.S. products both at home and abroad. Finally, the
positive long-run effect of the December 1971 currency realignment, which
was offset by its perverse short-run effects on the nominal dollar value of our
trade balance last year, can be expected to show up more clearly in 1973.
However, the positive effects outlined above will be reduced by a continuing rise in net fuel imports.




85

Consumer Spending
Consumer spending is expected to rise approximately 9^4 percent in 1973,
exceeding last year's large rise of 8^2 percent. However, the course of consumer demand within 1973 is not likely to be as rapid as it was within 1972.
This difference between year-to-year and within-the-year movements reflects the fact that unlike 1972, the year 1973 starts off from a high base.
For example, retail sales in December after seasonal adjustment were 4J/2
percent above the monthly average for all of 1972; the corresponding figure
a year ago was 2 J/2 percent above the 1971 average.
Personal income is expected to show another large gain from 1972 to
1973, with an expected rise close to that of last year. A large rise in employment and payrolls will be supplemented by the increase in social security
benefits that became effective in the final quarter of 1972 as well as by new
benefits that become effective in 1973.
Personal income is computed after subtracting personal contributions
for social insurance. This year, increased social security tax rates and a
higher taxable earnings base will reduce personal income by about $5 billion. Although the national income accounts record the entire amount of
the tax rise beginning in the first quarter, it is important to note that the
portion due to an increase in the wage base ($1.6 billion at an annual rate)
does not, in actual practice, become effective until later in the calendar year.
Disposable income is expected to show an extremely large rise of 10 percent this year, exceeding the rise in personal income mainly because of the
refunds of the overwithholding of 1972 personal income taxes. These
refunds are expected to give a strong boost to cash income in the
first half of the year, followed by a corresponding slowdown in the growth
of spendable income after midyear. Some impact on consumption is expected from these refunds, but the greater part is assumed to affect personal
saving, as seems to have been the case in 1972. Because of the heavy infusions of income in the first half of 1973, the saving rate in that period is likely
to be very high but it should decrease as the year progresses.
Labor force and unemployment
The unemployment rate is expected to decline to the neighborhood of 4 / 2
percent by the end of 1973. This projection is essentially based on the forecast
that real GNP in 1973 will be about 6% percent higher than it averaged in
1972. The principal uncertainty involved in translating the projection of
output into a projection of the unemployment rate is the growth of the total
labor force (which includes the Armed Forces) over the course of the year.
In the mid-sixties it was widely assumed that the trend rate of growth of
the labor force would rise to about 1 ^4 percent per annum and remain there
through 1980. In fact the growth of the total labor force turned out to be
much higher; over the last half of the 1960's it was close to 2*4 percent per
annum. As a result, the total labor force is now far larger than the level




86

projected in 1965. The extraordinary expansion in participation rates ended
in 1970.
In 1972, in spite of a strong expansion in employment opportunities, the
growth of the total labor force was close to its long-term rate of 1 % percent.
The uncertainty for 1973, and beyond, is whether labor force growth will
remain at this level. There are reasons to believe that it will, and that the
extraordinary increases between 1965 and 1970 represent a one-time phenomenon, caused principally by the following factors:
1. The strong demand for labor due to the Vietnam mobilization and
buildup increased labor force participation rates. In particular it drew large
numbers of women and teenagers into the labor force because so many men
were either in the Armed Forces or remained in college.
2. The fertility rate fell rapidly, causing fewer women to be out of the
labor force looking after young families.
3. Because women generally have a lower median age at marriage than
men there was a temporary excess of women when the first cohorts of the postwar baby boom reached marriageable age in the mid-1960's. Like the fall
in the fertility rate, the "marriage squeeze" induced an abnormal increase
in the labor force.
4. The introduction of 7-day and late night openings by many sectors of
retail trade led to large increases in the availability of part-time work.
These factors do not seem to be still operating on balance to accelerate
participation rates further, and it is therefore likely that labor force growth
will now remain at its long-run trend rate of 1 % percent. If it does, and the
size of the Armed Forces remains close to present levels, the 4J4 percent
unemployment level forecast should be achieved.

As always there are uncertainties. The projection of a 10 percent rise in
money GNP between 1972 and 1973 is within the high side of the fairly
narrow range being forecast by the majority of economic models and economists. The probability that GNP in 1973 will differ from its forecast
value by more than 1 percent is extremely small.
The apparent consensus on money GNP for 1973 is due in part to the
fact that many of the common foreshadowing data used are themselves
stated in terms of expected dollar flows. There is less agreement about how
the nominal increase will be divided between real growth and changes in
the price level—because we have fewer insights on either of these components than we have for the total itself. The Council's projection of a
3 percent change in GNP prices is at the low end of the range now expected
by private forecasters. It is based on three assumptions about the future:
That the limit on federal expenditures proposed by the President for fiscal
1973 and fiscal 1974 will be met; that the rate of rise in food prices will
be less than in 1972; that there will be a high degree of compliance with




87

Phase III standards, enforced as necessary by the Economic Stabilization
Program. None of these is certain but the probability is high that all will be
realized.
Notwithstanding the uncertainties, the economy in 1973 appears to be
moving along a general path which gives it a better chance of reaching
sustainable full employment than it has had in all but one or two years of
the postwar period.

CHAPTER 4

The Economic Role of Women

O

NE OF THE MOST important changes in the American economy in
this century has been the increase in the proportion of women who
work outside the home. This increase is the most striking aspect of the expansion of the role of women in the economy.
The addition of millions of women to the labor force has contributed
substantially to the increase of total output. This is most obvious if we focus
attention on the output that is measured and included in the gross national
product (GNP). But even if we subtract from the contribution of working
women to the GNP the value of the work they would have done at home,
there has been an addition to total output. Most of the benefits of this additional output accrue to the women who produce it, and to their families.
There are, however, also direct benefits to the society at large, including the
taxes paid on the women's earnings.
Concern is sometimes expressed that the increase in women in the labor
force will reduce the employment opportunities for men and raise their
unemployment. There is no reason to think that would happen and there
is no sign that it has happened. The work to be done is not a fixed total.
As more women enter employment and earn incomes they or their families
buy more goods and services which men and women are employed to
produce. A sudden surge of entrants into the labor force might cause difficulties of adjustment and, consequently, unemployment, but the entry of
women into the labor force has not been of that character.
Women work outside the home for the same reasons as men. The basic
reason is to get the income that can be earned by working. Whether—for
either men or women—work is done out of necessity or by choice is a
question of definition. If working out of necessity means working in order
to sustain biologically necessary conditions of life, probably a small proportion of all the hours of work done in the United States, by men or
women, is necessary. If working out of necessity means working in order
to obtain a standard of living which is felt by the worker to be desirable,
probably almost all of the work done by both men and women is necessary.
The Employment Act of 1946 sets forth a goal of "maximum employment." We understand that to mean employment of those who want to
work, without regard to whether their employment is, by some definition,




89

necessary. This goal applies equally to men and to women. The Act also
sets forth a goal of "maximum production." We understand the meaning
of that goal which is relevant to the present context to be that people
should be able to work in the employments in which they will be most
productive. That also applies equally to men and women.
Although the goals apply equally to men and women, some of the obstacles to their achievement apply especially to women. Women have gained
much more access to market employment than they used to have, but they
have not gained full equality within the market in the choice of jobs, opportunities for advancement, and other matters related to employment and
compensation. To some extent the cause of this discrepancy is direct discrimination. But it is also the result of more subtle and complex factors
originating in cultural patterns that have grown up in most societies through
the centuries. In either case, because the possibilities open to women are
restricted, they are not always free to contribute a full measure of earnings
to their families, to develop their talents fully, or to help achieve the national
goal of "maximum production."
ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON THE ECONOMIC ROLE OF
WOMEN
Recognizing the urgency of these problems and the importance of leadership to change the attitudes which underlie them, the President announced
in September the formation of the Advisory Committee on the Economic
Role of Women. The committee will meet periodically with the Chairman
of the Council of Economic Advisers, providing a forum for the interchange
of information, ideas, and points of view. This interchange will increase the
Council's own expertise on the economics of women. Because the function
of the Council of Economic Advisers is to advise the President on a wide
variety of economic issues, its association with the committee will ensure
that the interests of women will be represented in economic policy decisions.
With these goals in mind, in January 1973 the Chairman of the Council
of Economic Advisers asked 21 men and women representing diverse areas
of expertise to serve on the committee. They include officials from the Federal Government agencies whose activities are important to the progress of
women, representatives from business, finance, education, and other private
institutions, and specialists on the economic problems of women from
sociology, psychology, economics, and the law. Among the topics that the
committee will explore are job training and counseling in the schools,
special problems of minority women, problems related to child care,
women's performance at work, the extent of job discrimination, women's
access to credit, and legislative action on taxes and social security that
may have a different effect on women than on men.
Another, more fundamental, issue affecting women in the economy underlies many of the others. The roles played by women and men have been




90

sharply differentiated. It is obvious that only women are capable of childbearing. But along with this biologically determined role, women have by
tradition come to assume primary responsibility for child care and home
management, while men have primary responsibility for the family's financial support. Until very recently this division of labor within the family
has had such general acceptance as to impose limitations on women's
work outside the home. The way in which the economic role of women
evolves thus hinges on the most fundamental societal patterns, and the
extent to which social action can and should influence further change in
these patterns will be one of the most difficult and important questions the
committee must consider.
By way of an introduction to the problem, this chapter looks at jobrelated aspects of the economic role of women. The committee will, of
course, deal with a much broader range of topics.
PARTICIPATION IN THE LABOR FORCE
In 1900 about 20 percent of all women were in the work force (Table 21).
In the succeeding decades this percentage hardly increased, reaching
about 25 percent by 1940. With World War II, however, the movement
rapidly accelerated, and by 1972 the percentage of women 16 years and
older in the work force had risen to 43.8. Single women and women
widowed, divorced, or separated, have always had higher labor force participation rates than married women living with their husbands. By 1950,
the participation of women in the two former groups had already reached
levels close to those of today. Thus, the upward trend in labor force
participation since World War II has been due almost entirely to the

changed behavior of married women (Table 22). The first to respond
were the more mature married women beyond the usual childbearing
years. More recently there has also been a sharp upturn in the labor force
participation of younger married women.
The record for men has tended to run in the opposite direction. A secular reduction in time spent in paid work over most men's lifetimes has
taken place: A man spends more years at school and enters the labor
force later than formerly; he retires earlier, works fewer hours a week, and
has longer vacations. Of course these changes have also affected women,
but for them the increase in years worked has far outweighed the other
work-reducing factors.
In one very important respect, however, the working life patterns of men
and women have not merged. The typical man can expect to be in the
labor force continuously, for an unbroken block of some 40 years between
leaving school and retirement. Of men in the 25-54 year age group, 95.2
percent were in the labor force in 1972. For most women, this continuity
in participation is the exception rather than the rule.

THE HISTORICAL PATTERN
What are the causal factors that induced women to enter the labor force?
One might have expected that the strong increases in husbands' real incomes which occurred during the period would have provided an incentive to women not to enter the labor force. This seeming puzzle is resolved,
however, when one considers that by entering the labor force women did
not leave a life of leisure for work, but rather changed from one kind of



92

work, work at .home, to another kind of work, work in the market. The
incentive for women to make this dramatic occupational change came from
several developments which made paid work outside the home the increasingly more profitable alternative.
Rapidly rising earnings and expanded job opportunities for women
gave a strong impetus to the change. The expansion of job opportunities for women was undoubtedly influenced by the expansion of the
service sector of the economy, where employment increased by 77 percent
from 1950 to 1970, compared to the increase of 26 percent in the goodsproducing industrial sector over the same period. Women have always been
more heavily represented in services than in industry, since the service
sector offers more white-collar employment and provides more opportunities
for part-time work, an especially important feature for women with small
children. On the other hand, the increasing supply of women workers
perhaps itself contributed to the rapid expansion in the service sector.
The increase in women's educational attainments has also helped to raise
the amount they can earn by working. Education may make women more
productive in the home, that is, more efficient housekeepers, consumers, and
mothers, but education appears to increase still more their productivity in
work outside the home. Women with more education earn more, and they
are more likely than less educated women to seek work in the market.
Because life expectancy has increased considerably over the century (and
more for women than for men), and because most women complete their
childbearing at a younger age, women can look forward with more certainty to a longer uninterrupted span of years in the labor force. This lengthening of a woman's expected working life is significant because it increases
her return on her investment in training and education: the greater the
number of years in which to collect the return the greater is the return.
These increases in the income a woman could potentially earn meant
essentially that time spent producing goods and services at home was coming
at a higher and higher cost in terms of the income foregone by not working
in the market. It made sense then to buy available capital equipment (such
as washing machines) which would substitute for some of the housewife's
time and free her to go to work. And changes in technology which lowered
the cost and increased the array of time-saving devices facilitated the
substitution.
The most difficult home responsibility to find a good substitute for is
child care; and, although the labor force participation of women with
children under 6 years has increased from 12 percent in 1950 to 30 percent
in 1971, child-rearing is probably the major factor causing some women to
interrupt and others to curtail their careers.
The long-term decline in the average number of children in the family
has undoubtedly had a strong influence on the proportion of women entering the labor force. Advances in birth control techniques permit parents
not only to reduce the number of births but also to control their timing to


490-000 O - 73 - 7


93

suit a mother's working career. Declines in infant and child mortality may
also have encouraged a reduction in births by increasing the parents' expectation that all their children would survive to adulthood. On the other
hand, reductions in family size may themselves be influenced by the desire
of women to work.
Childbearing has a very noticeable effect on the patterns of women's
labor force participation by age. Based on census data, Chart 9 traces the
lifetime changes in labor force participation by groups of women born at
different times, the earliest group consisting of women born between 1886
and 1895. The chart therefore simulates the actual work history of particular cohorts of women followed longitudinally. According to this chart,
the various forces in the economy that have induced women to work have
generally had a more powerful effect on women beyond the childbearing ages

than on younger groups. Those increases in labor force participation that
have occurred for groups of women reaching the childbearing ages of 20-34
years have been closely associated with declining fertility rates. Thus labor
force participation for the group reaching 25-34 years increased substantially from 1930 to 1940, and again between 1960 and 1970, while there
was a decline between 1940 and 1950 in the participation of those reaching
this age group—the baby boom mothers. Whether the young women now
in their twenties have simply postponed having children and will later drop
out of the labor force or whether many will continue to work, choosing to
have small families or remain childless is, of course, a question of great
interest.
THE WORKING WOMAN TODAY
Although the decisions of individual women to work outside the home
are undoubtedly based on many different factors, there are some economic
factors which seem to be of overriding importance. The necessity to support
oneself or others is one obvious reason and, not surprisingly, adult single
women and women who have been separated from husbands or widowed
are highly likely to work.
The increase in earnings opportunities, which proved to be such a powerful factor influencing the secular growth of women's participation in the
labor force, is a similarly powerful factor influencing the pattern of
women's participation at any given time. Thus, education and other
training which affect the amount a woman can earn are strongly related
to women's work patterns. The importance of education is such that, whether
a woman is single, married or separated, the more education she has, the more
likely she is to work. One striking exception to this pattern is that, among
mothers of children under 6 years old, there is scarcely any relation between
education and labor force participation. Thus, the rearing of children of
preschool age causes all women, regardless of education, to curtail their work
outside the home. However, the drop in participation during this childrearing period is most pronounced for highly educated women who in other
circumstances have much higher participation rates.
Although for most women the childbearing period has been reduced, childbearing still means an interruption of outside work. A longitudinal survey of
the lifelong work experience of women indicates that among all women who
were 30-44 years old in 1967, only 7 percent had worked at least 6 months
out of every year since leaving school. Among married women with children
the proportion was still lower, dropping to 3 percent. By contrast, 30 percent
of childless married women in the same group had worked at least 6 months
out of every year. Information on job tenure collected by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics illustrates much the same phenomenon. As of January 1968,
continuous employment in their current job came to 2.4 years (the median)
for women and 4.8 years for men. Job tenure increases with age for both
men and women. At ages 45 and over the median was 12.7 years for




95

men and 6.6 years for women. Since women tend to change jobs less
frequently than men, their shorter time spent on any given job is the result
of a higher propensity to leave the labor force at least temporarily. In 1964
a survey of women who had dropped out of the labor force in 1962 or 1963
and had not yet reentered was undertaken by the Labor Department in an
effort to find out why they had left. Pregnancy was most frequently cited as
the primary reason—by 74 percent of the 18- to 24-year-olds and 56 percent
of the 25- to 34-year-olds.
Among married women, husband's income does not have a very pronounced effect on work patterns. The median annual income of husbands
with working wives was $8,070 in 1971 compared to $8,330 for husbands
of wives not in the labor force. Only when husbands' incomes reach the
$10,000 and over category does wives' participation decline to any noticeable
extent. However, many other things vary with husbands' incomes, such as
wives' education and age as well as family size. These other factors are sufficiently important to obscure the simple relation between husband's income
and a wife's tendency to work. It should be noted, however, that during a time
of hardship, such as when a husband experiences a prolonged spell of unemployment, wives who usually do not work may be compelled to work.
Thus, the labor force participation of women with unemployed husbands
is generally above that of women with employed husbands.
Although the probability that a black woman will work seems to vary with
education and presence of children in much the same way as it does for all
women, there is one very striking difference: the labor force participation
of black women is higher. Particularly pronounced differences are observed
when the comparison of labor force participation is confined to married
women living with their husbands. In March 1971, about 53 percent
of black wives were in the labor force compared to 40 percent of
white wives. One important reason why this difference prevails may be
that the earnings of black wives are closer to their husbands' than is
the case among white married couples. In 1971 black married women who
worked year-round, full-time earned 73 percent as much as black married
men who worked year-round, full-time. Among whites the percentage was
only 51 percent. Behind these relationships is the fact that black men earn
considerably less than white men, while black women's earnings are much
closer to white women's earnings.
UNEMPLOYMENT
Women have generally experienced more unemployment than men and
this differential has been more pronounced in recent years (Table 23).
However, the source of women's unemployment differs from that of men's,
and this makes a comparison of unemployment differences more complex
than might appear.

Some of the difference arises from the way people are classified in our
unemployment statistics. A person with a job is not classified as unemployed
even though he or she may be searching for another job. However, work at
home is not counted as a job. Thus, a woman who may in a real sense be
clearly employed in the home while she searches for a job, will be counted
as unemployed, unlike the man who searches while on his job.
Most adult men are continuously in the labor force and therefore become
unemployed because they have either quit or lost their jobs (Table 24). For
women, the picture is different: labor force participation is frequently interrupted, sometimes for several years, but sometimes just for several weeks
during the year. Thus, although 59.8 percent of the women 24-54 years
old were in the labor force at one time or another during 1971, only 38.2
percent were in the labor force for 50-52 weeks during the year. This high
rate of labor force turnover generates unemployment, and it is not surprising to find that in both the tight labor market of 1969 and the looser
labor market of 1972 a considerable portion of unemployed women were

In order to know what significance to attach to the observation that the
greater unemployment of women appears to be related to their greater
labor force turnover, it is of course necessary to know more about the causes
of the turnover. Some have stressed that excessive labor force turnover
indicates a poor job market. According to this view, women drop out of the
labor market because lack of opportunities has discouraged them from
continuing the search. Evidence for this point of view is cited from Labor
Department surveys, which indicate that some of those women out of the
labor force are there because they do not believe they could find work. In
1972, 525,000 women or 1.2 percent of those out of the labor force were
reported in this category.
Another school of thought, however, stresses that the labor force turnover of women and the unemployment it generates is largely induced by
factors external to the current labor market, such as the uneven pressures of home responsibilities. Several kinds of evidence support this point
of view. Unemployment among women appears to be related to the nature
of home responsibilities. For example, in 1971 the unemployment rate for
married women with children under 3 years was 11.7 percent, compared
to the rate of 4.5 percent for married women with no children under 18
years. Moreover, on numerous surveys women cite pregnancy, home responsibilities, or husband's relocation as primary reasons for leaving the job
or the labor force.




98

It would of course be interesting to know more about the unemployment
experience of women who do remain continuously in the labor force. Some
evidence from the Labor Department's longitudinal survey indicates that
women who were in the labor force in both 1967 and 1969 had considerably
lower unemployment in 1969 than those who were in the labor force in
1969 but not in 1967. The unemployment rate in 1969 for the group who
were also in the labor force 2 years previously was 2.9 percent, compared
to the rate of 6.9 percent for the women who were in the labor force only
in 1969. However, this was still above the rate of 2.1 percent for men 20
years old and over in 1969, as measured by the household survey.
Although movement in and out of the labor force is probably the most
important factor leading to higher unemployment for women compared to
men, two other factors seem to be important. Women with less time on a
job and in whom the employer had made negligible training investments
are more vulnerable to layoffs. Finally, one additional factor which doubtless contributes to unemployment of married women is the difficulty in
maximizing employment opportunities for both the husband and the wife.
A wife seldom is free to migrate to wherever her own prospects are best.
It is important to emphasize, because the point is often misunderstood,
that to explain the unemployment of women is not to excuse it or belittle
it or to place blame on the women who are unemployed. The unemployment of women who seek work is costly, to themselves, their families, and
the Nation. Our goal should be to reduce this unemployment wherever
that can be done by means which are not themselves more costly. Some
unemployment entails more loss for the workers involved and to the economy as a whole than other; some is more amenable to correction by the
persons directly affected than other unemployment. But these distinctions
do not run along sex lines.
THE WIDENING IN THE REPORTED MALE-FEMALE
UNEMPLOYMENT DIFFERENTIAL
During the 1960's the differential in reported unemployment between
women and men widened. Two factors may help to explain the change.
The first has to do with changes in the unemployment survey questionnaire
introduced in 1967.
Persons are classified as unemployed if they have not worked during the
survey week, were available to work during the survey week, and had made
specific efforts to find a job such as looking in the "want-ads" section of
the newspaper or going to an employment agency. Prior to 1967 the period
of jobseeking efforts was not specified, and it is believed that many respondents interpreted the question narrowly to mean that one had to have looked
for a job in the week just prior to the survey. In 1967 the unemployment
question was changed by specifying 4 weeks preceding the survey as the
point of reference. Data from samples taken on both the old and new




99

basis are available for 1966. In that year the unemployment rate for
women aged 20 years or older was 0.4 percentage points higher on the new
basis than on the old. This increase in the rate for women as a result of
the change in the questionnaire has been interpreted as reflecting the
likelihood that the jobseeking activities of women are more intermittent.
As a result of lengthening the reference period to 4 weeks, persons
who had briefly looked for work but who were not actively seeking work by
the time of the survey week would be added to the unemployed under the
new definition.
Although the reported unemployment of some men may also have been
increased as a result of the effective lengthening of the unemployment reference period, other changes in the questionnaire in 1967, which were evidently
unimportant for women, seemed to reduce the reported unemployment of
men. Indeed these changes were of sufficient importance that the net effect
was to lower the unemployment rate for men 20 years old and over by 0.3
percentage points. The unemployment rate for men was evidently lowered
for two reasons: By a reclassification from unemployed to employed of
persons absent from work because of a vacation or a labor dispute but at
the same time looking for work; and by the fact that persons stating that
they had given up the search for work were no longer counted as
unemployed.
The 1966 samples indicate that as a result of the changes in the unemployment questionnaire, which increased the rate for women and lowered
the rate for men, the reported male-female unemployment differential,
comparing men and women 20 years old and over, increased from 1.3 percentage points to 2.0 percentage points. We cannot, of course, be sure that
effects of the same precise magnitude have persisted ever since the new
definitions were substituted in 1967. However, the definitional change has
undoubtedly contributed to a wider unemployment differential since the
late 19605s.
Another factor contributing to the widening of the unemployment differential may be the rapid increase in the labor force participation of women
during the 1960's, since its effect was to increase the proportion of women
entering or reentering the labor force, with an accompanying increase in
unemployment.
EDUCATION AND THE OCCUPATIONAL DISTRIBUTION
Some of the hesitancy of women to enter or to stay in the labor force is
undoubtedly the result of societally determined factors that restrict the
possibilities open to them. The low representation of women in positions of
responsibility is striking. Despite gradual gains, progress has not been sufficient to alter the picture significantly (Table 26). Exactly how much of this
situation has been imposed on women because of prejudice and how much of
it derives from a voluntary adjustment to a life divided between home responsibilities and work remains obscure. The existence of discriminatory

barriers may discourage women from seeking the training or adopting the
life style it would take to achieve a responsible and highly demanding job.
On the other hand, women who expect to marry and have children and who
also put their role at home first are subject to considerable uncertainty about
their future attachment to the labor force. In the latter case, incentives to
train extensively for a career would be few; and, once such women started
working, the restrictions imposed by home responsibilities could limit their
ability to take a job requiring long hours or the intensive commitment that
most high-status positions demand. At the same time, changes in the accepted social roles of men and women would alter current patterns if they
changed women's expectations about their future in the labor force.
For whatever reasons, from school onward the career orientation of
women differs strikingly from that of men. Most women do not have as
strong a vocational emphasis in their schooling; and for those who do, the
preparation is usually for a stereotyped "female" occupation.
Although the probability of graduating from high school has been somewhat greater for women than for men, it is less probable that a woman will
complete college, and still less that she will enter graduate school. The representation of women consequently declines as they move upward through
the stages of education beyond high school. In 1971, 50 percent of all high
school graduates were women and 45 percent of first-year college students
were women. During 1971 women earned 44 percent of the bachelor's
degrees granted, 40 percent of the master's degrees, and 14 percent of the
doctorates.
Even more striking are the differences in the courses taken. At both the
undergraduate and advanced levels, women are heavily represented in English, languages, and fine arts—the more general cultural fields. They are
poorly represented in disciplines having a strong vocational emphasis and
promising a high pecuniary return. In 1970, 9.3 percent of the baccalaureates in business and 3.9 percent of the master's in business went to women.



101

In the biological sciences, women had a larger share, taking about 30 percent of the bachelor's and master's degrees and 16 percent of the doctorates.
But only 8.5 percent of the M.D.'s and 5.6 percent of the law degrees went
to women. Most of these percentages, low as they are, represent large gains
from the preceding year.
The situation is quite different in the so-called women's occupations. In
1971 women received 74 percent of the B.A.'s and 56 percent of the M.A.'s
given in education. In library science, which is even more firmly dominated
by women, they received 82 percent of all degrees in 1971. And in nursing,
98 percent of all the degrees went to women.
It is not surprising, then, to find that women do not have anything like the
same occupational distribution as men. Even within an educational level,
significant differences remain in the distribution across broad occupational categories (Table 27). Although 77 percent of women college graduates in 1970 were in the professions, mostly as teachers, only 4.8 percent,
compared to 20 percent for men, were classified as managers. At high school
levels, the proportion of women working as skilled craftsmen is minuscule, although a substantial proportion of women are blue-collar workers in
the lower paying operative categories.
The supplement to this chapter, appearing in Appendix A, summarizes in
detail women's representation in occupations more narrowly defined. Although women are found in all occupations, the extent of occupational segregation by sex is large. In broad outline, this situation does not appear to
have undergone any dramatic change between 1950 and 1970, although
there are several examples of large increases in the proportion of women
in less typically "female" occupations (for example busdrivers, bartenders,
and compositors and typesetters).

Casual observation of individual occupations cannot, of course, provide
a comprehensive indication of whether the occupational distributions of
men and women, involving numerous occupations, have moved closer together or further apart. To help answer this question, an index was constructed and calculated for 1960 and 1970 which reflects the difference (for
197 occupations) between the occupational distributions of men and women.
The index displays a small move toward occupational similarity between
1960 and 1970. (See the supplement to this chapter, included in Appendix
A, for a more detailed description of the index.)
Another question of interest is whether the changes in the occupational
distributions of men and women were in the direction of higher economic
status and, if so, how far they went. Some insight into this question is
obtained by calculating an index which reflects what earnings would have
been in 1950, 1960, and 1970, if earnings were the same in all 3 years and
only the occupational distributions changed. Median earnings for yearround, full-time workers in each of 11 broad occupational categories were
used as the constant weights to calculate such an index. The results indicated that the occupational distributions of both men and women shifted
in the direction of higher-earnings occupations from 1950 to 1960 and from
1960 to 1970. However, in the earlier period men moved ahead in this respect
faster than women while in the second period the changes were similar for
both.
EARNINGS
In 1971 annual median earnings for women 14 years old and over were
$2,986, or 40 percent of the median earnings of men. But women work
fewer hours per week and fewer weeks per year. If the comparison is restricted to year-round, full-time workers, women's earnings are 60 percent
of men's, that is, $5,593 compared to $9,399. An additional adjustment for
differences in the average full-time workweek—full-time hours for men were
about 10 percent higher than for women—brings the female-male ratio
to 66 percent in 1971.
Differentials of this order of magnitude appear to have persisted since
1956 (Table 28). Indeed, a slight increase in the differential seems to have
occurred from 1956 to 1969. Part of the source of the increasing differential
was the relatively low rate of growth in the earnings of female clerical workers and female operatives, who in 1970 accounted for 32 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of all women workers. On the other hand, the rate of
growth of earnings of women in the professions was high (a 5.1-percent
annual compound rate between 1955 and 1968) relative to all workers;
more recently it was even high relative to male professionals.

A large differential is also evident when the comparison is restricted to
men and women of the same age and education. As Chart 10 indicates, the
incomes of women do not increase with age in anything like the same way
men's do. Thus the differential widens with age through much of the working life.
One important factor influencing the differential is experience. The lack
of continuity in women's attachment to the labor force means that they will
not have accumulated as much experience as men at a given age. The relatively steeper rise of men's income with age has been attributed to their
greater accumulation of experience, of "human capital" acquired on the job.
Since very few women have participated in the labor force to the same
degree as men, it is difficult to set up direct comparisons between the earnings of men and women with the same lifetime pattern of work. Using data
from the Labor Department's longitudinal study of women, referred to
above, one study was able to compare the earnings of women working different amounts of time throughout their lives with the earnings of men, most
of whom are presumed to work continuously after leaving school. The figures
for men were taken from census data. The women's lifetime work experience
was measured as the percentage of years each had worked since leaving
school. However, a work year was crudely defined as one in which the
women had worked at least 6 months. Thus no adjustment could be made
for whether the years worked had been truly full-time commitments with respect to both hours worked per week and weeks worked per year.

Among the women 30-44 years old in the survey, the gain from continuous
work was apparently very large. If we look only at those women who had
worked year-round, full-time in 1966, the median wage and salary income
for the group who had worked each year since leaving school was $5,618;
for those who had worked less than 50 percent of the years since leaving
school (almost half the group) the median income was $3,655. The median
wage and salary income of men in the same age group who had worked
full-time, year-round in 1966 was $7,529. The men are presumed to have
worked continuously since leaving school. Thus the women who had worked
less than half of the years since leaving school earned only 49 percent as
much as men, while the small group of women who had worked each year
earned 75 percent as much as men. Interestingly, single women who had
worked each year since leaving school earned slightly more than single men.
More sophisticated comparisons, adjusting for additional differences in



105

training, continuity at work, and education, can be made. One recent study
found that the earnings differential was reduced to below 20 percent after
taking account of such differences.
The importance of lifetime accumulated experience in influencing women's earnings suggests one possible explanation for the small decline in the
ratio of women's to men's earnings between 1956 and 1969. Since the labor
force participation of women has been rising rapidly, an increasing proportion of new entrants and of those with few accumulated years in the labor
force could have resulted in a decline in the average experience level of
all women. This drop would in turn temporarily push down the average
level of earnings for all women. Unfortunately the data are not available to
compare the ratio over a period of time between the earnings of women
having a given number of years' experience and the earnings of men.
DIRECT DISCRIMINATION VERSUS ROLE
DIFFERENTIATION
A differential, perhaps on the order of 20 percent, between the earnings
of men and women remains after adjusting for factors such as education,
work experience during the year, and even lifelong work experience. How
much of this differential is due to differences in experience or in performance on the job which could not be measured adequately, and how much to
discrimination? The question is difficult to answer, in part because there are
differences of opinion about what should be classified as discrimination.
Some studies have succeeded in narrowing the male-female differential
well below 20 percent. Indeed, Department of Labor surveys have found that
the differential almost disappears when men's and women's earnings are
compared within detailed job classifications and within the same establishment. In the very narrow sense of equal pay for the same job in the
same plant there may be little difference between women and men. However, in this way the focus of the problem is shifted but not eliminated,
for then we must explain why women have such a different job structure
from men and why they are employed in different types of establishments.
There is clearly prejudice against women engaging in particular activities. Some patients reject women doctors, some clients reject women lawyers, some customers reject automobile saleswomen, and some workers
reject women bosses. Employers also may have formulated discriminatory
attitudes about women, exaggerating the risk of job instability or client
acceptance and therefore excluding women from on-the-job training which
would advance their careers.
In fact, even if employers do estimate correctly the average job turnover
of women, women who are strongly committed to their jobs may suffer from
"statistical discrimination" by being treated as though their own behavior
resembled the average. The extent to which this type of discrimination
occurs depends on how costly it is for employers to distinguish women who




106

will have a strong job commitment from those who will not. Finally, because
some occupations restrict the number of newcomers they take in and because
women move in and out of the labor force more often, more women than
men tend to fall into the newcomer category and to be thus excluded. For
example, restrictive entry policies may have kept women out of the skilled
crafts.
On the other hand, as discussed above, some component of the earnings
differential and of the occupational differential stems from differences in
role orientation which start with differences in education and continue
through marriage, where women generally are expected to assume primary
responsibility for the home and subordinate their own outside work to their
household responsibilities.
It is not now possible to distinguish in a quantitative way between the
discrimination which bars women from jobs solely because of their sex,
and the role differentiation whereby women, either through choice or
necessity, restrict their careers because of the demands of their homes. Some
may label the latter as a pervasive societal discrimination which starts in the
cradle; nonetheless, it is useful to draw the distinction.
One other missing link in our chain of understanding of these problems
is the value of the work done at home by women. One study has found
that women college graduates tend to reduce their outside work when their
children are small more than less educated women, and that they also devote more time to the training of their children. Of course this pattern is
undoubtedly facilitated by the higher income of their husbands. However,
this pattern also results in a considerable sacrifice of earnings, and one may
infer that these women have therefore placed a very high value on the
personal attention they can give their children. Without more information,
it is difficult to evaluate the full extent to which women's capabilities have
actually been underutilized by society.
SPECIAL PROBLEMS
THE FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLD
In 1971, some 6 million families, about 11.5 percent of all families, were
headed by women. These women are widowed, divorced, separated, or
single, and many have responsibilities for the support of children in fatherless families or of other relatives. Close to two-thirds of all female-headed
families include children; the average number of children under 18 years
of age in a female-headed family with children was about 2.3 in 1971, about
the same as in male-headed families with children.
As a result of the division of labor within families, the average woman
who has been married has not had the same labor market experience or
vocationally oriented training as her husband. Unless she has a substantial
alimony or pension, she is likely to face financial difficulties. The median income of female-headed families was $5,116 in 1971, less than half the in


107

come of male-headed families ($10,930). When women who head families
were full-time, year-round workers, the family's median income was
$7,916; but only 32 percent of women heading families were able to be
full-time, year-round workers. And the woman who heads a family and
works has additional expenses of child care and other home care expenses.
The problems faced by the woman who heads a household are particuarly acute if the woman is black, and 27 percent of women heading households are black. For this group, median family income was only $3,645 in
1971. Although, at higher education levels, black women now earn
amounts comparable to white women, those black women who head families are at a disadvantage compared to white women. The median personal
income of white women heading households and working year-round, fulltime was $6,527 in 1971, compared to $5,227 for black women in the same
position.
As a result of the combination of a large number of dependents and the
difficulty of maintaining the dual responsibility of monetary support and
home care, many female-headed families fall below the low-income level.
In 1971, 34 percent of female-headed families were below the low-income
level, compared to 7 percent for male-headed families. Among black households with a female head, 54 percent were below the low-income level. A
large proportion receive public assistance. In 1971, 30 percent of the women
heading households received public assistance payments.
It has been suggested, though not proved, that widespread availability
of public assistance has encouraged husbands to desert their wives or wives
to leave their husbands in families where the husband earns little more
than the amount of welfare benefits his family would be entitled to in his
absence. Remarriage may also be discouraged because the low-income
mother would then lose her entire public stipend, including the child support portion, and without some outside child support a man might be reluctant to marry a woman with several children.
Among the women who are now welfare recipients many are handicapped
by lack of education and training and are not in a position to earn an income that would lift them and their families above poverty levels. A program
established in 1967, the Work Incentive Program, now gives many mothers
currently on welfare, training and placement assistance so that they can
improve their ability to support themselves and their dependents.
THE INCOME TAX
Devising a tax system which is equitable and efficient has always posed
formidable problems, and often the best solution is one involving compromise with one or more of the objectives. The tax treatment of working
wives is one of the more difficult problems. The income tax law as such
treats men and women equally and, indeed, its effects on single men and
single women are the same. However, some of the features of the tax structure, which have been considered desirable for other purposes, have, as a



108

by-product, unequal effects on the second earner of a married couple, who
is usually the wife.
Only income arising from market transactions is taxed. Indeed, there is
no practical way to assign a market value to the unpaid work performed at
home and then subject it to the tax. As a result, the tax system imposes a
general bias in the economy favoring unpaid work at home compared to
paid work in the market. However, the bias and the resulting disincentive
toward market work are particularly relevant for the married woman who
traditionally has done more work at home.
An equity problem also arises from this situation. To use a hypothetical
example, a husband and wife each earning $8,000 would pay the same
income tax as a couple where the husband alone works and earns $16,000,
although the couple with two earners will have the additional expenses
of buying the services which would be produced at home and untaxed if
the wife did not work.
There is the further problem that a married couple may pay more or less
income tax than two single persons whose combined income equals the
couple's, depending upon how the income is divided between the two individuals. This problem reflects a basic ambivalence about whether the appropriate unit of taxation is the individual or the family.
Remedies for the situation are not easy to find. One suggestion has been
to allow working wives to deduct a given percentage of their earnings from
their income for tax purposes. However, this would be unfair to single
persons, who also incur expenses of going to work. A general earned income
credit has also been suggested, but this creates a bias against investments
in capital and in favor of wage income.
As discussed below, the Revenue Act of 1971 has given expanded tax
relief to working wives with children by allowing more liberalized child
care deductions to couples within a given income range. This provision,
however, does not affect couples without children or couples with combined incomes outside the allowable income range.
CHILD CARE
Provision for child care is a cost to working mothers and a major obstacle to the employment of many other mothers who would work outside
the home if they could find satisfactory arrangements for taking care of
their children. As more mothers have taken jobs outside the home, and
more weigh the possibility of doing so, several major questions about child
care have become intense national issues.
One question is whether the Government should pay for part or all of
the cost of child care. This question is usually raised about the Federal
Government, but it could be equally asked about State or local governments.
According to one view of the matter parents have chosen to have children,
which implies a certain allocation of their resources, therefore they have no
reason to burden other taxpayers to look after the children. Another view of

Digitized490-000 O - 73 - 8
for FRASER


the matter is that Government subsidies can be justified and different groups
have cited different reasons. The point has been made that the pressures of
custom result in a bias against the wife going to work while the husband
stays home with the children. A child-care subsidy for working mothers
would help remove any harmful effects of this cultural bias. Another
reason given is that there is a national interest in the proper care of children, who are, of course, the future nation, and that this case justifies Government subsidies. The analogy commonly given is to public education.
Government has given subsidies to families with children but there has
been no consistent philosophy behind them. At the extreme, with respect to
children in very poor families, we have long recognized the need for public
assistance in the form of the program of Aid to Families with Dependent
Children. This program is not specifically addressed to children with working mothers. In fact, until recently it was tilted against helping working
mothers. The Federal Government also provides a form of assistance for
child care through the income tax. With the Revenue Act of 1971, a much
more liberal deduction than had ever been provided was instituted specifically for child-care expenses incurred by working wives. Below a combined
husband-wife income of $18,000, a working wife can now deduct up to
$400 a month for child care expenses. The deduction is scaled downwards
to zero as combined income goes from $18,000 to $27,600. The two groups
not covered are women whose family income is too low to benefit from a
tax deduction and women at the other end of the income scale.
Public discussion of Government support for child care has not clearly
distinguished among several possible objectives:
(a) To reward and assist the care of all small children;
(b) To assist the care of small children whose parents might not
be otherwise able to care for them;
(c) To assist the care of the small children of working mothers;
(d) To assist in the care of small children in a particular way—
through day-care institutions, or at home, etc.
Both the amount of Government support that is desirable, and the form it
should take if it is to be provided, depend on the choice made among these
objectives.
Recently, publicly supported institutional group care, or day care, has
received considerable attention as one approach to helping the working
mother. Some have also stressed day care as a developmental program. It
may be noted that a very small proportion of working women have depended on group day care in an institutional center. A Government-sponsored survey of 1965 found that, among employed mothers of children
under 6, only 6.4 percent depended on school or group care centers. About
47 percent of the women arranged to have their children cared for at home,
often by a relative. The rest mainly arranged for care in someone else's home
(31 percent) or looked after the child while working (15 percent).




110

Some have attributed the low use of day care to a failure of the market
to provide a service that would be utilized if financing were available.
Others have interpreted it as an indication that the true demand for institutional day care is low. Even among more affluent and knowledgeable working mothers who presumably could afford it, dependence on institutional
group care is low. A survey of college graduates found that in 1964, among
those who worked and who had children under 6 years, 9 percent used
group care, which included nursery schools, kindergartens, and day-care
centers. Most (73 percent) arranged for care in their own home.
Whether institutional day care provides the best use of dollars spent on
child care has yet to be established. While this issue has not been resolved,
it is clear that the problems of mothers who want and need to work require
serious attention and a continuing search for new solutions.
GOVERNMENT ACTION
Government has been profoundly concerned with promoting full equality
of opportunity for women within both the public and the private sectors.
Two approaches have been followed. The first involves the use of law
and regulations where they are both applicable and compatible with other
goals of a democratic society.
A number of laws have been passed and Executive Orders issued which
deal with discrimination by employers. Included are the Equal Pay Act
of 1963, requiring employers to compensate men and women in the same
establishment equally for work of equivalent skill and responsibility, and
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination in
hiring, discharging, compensation, and other aspects of employment. Title
VII is administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
(EEOC). The Equal Employment Opportunity Act, signed by the President in 1972, gave the EEOC enforcement power through the courts in sexdiscrimination cases. In December 1971, Order No. 4, under Executive
Order 11246, was extended to women. This Order requires Federal contractors employing more than 50 workers and holding contracts of $50,000
or more to formulate written affirmative action plans, with goals and timetables, to ensure equal opportunities. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination in educational programs or activities
on the basis of sex.
The Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, which was strongly
supported by the President, passed the Senate on March 22, 1972, and has
now been ratified by 22 States. The proposed amendment would provide
that "equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by
the United States or by any State on account of sex," and would authorize
the Congress and the States to enforce the amendment by appropriate legislation. The purpose of the proposed amendment would be to provide constitutional protection against laws and official practices that treat men and
women differently.



Ill

The other approach of Government to providing equality to women has
been through leadership. The Women's Bureau in the Department of Labor
has for 50 years been concerned with the problems of women at work. Recently, several new groups, each concerned with different areas affecting
women, have been formed. The formation of the Advisory Committee on
the Economic Role of Women is one such effort. The Citizen's Advisory Council on the Status of Women is another. The latter is a council
of private citizens appointed by the President, which surveys the social and
political issues of particular interest to women and makes recommendations
for legislation or other suitable social action. In an effort to recruit women
to top-level jobs in the Government, the President in 1971 appointed to the
White House staff a special assistant for this purpose. As a result many
women have been placed in key policy making positions, positions never
before held by women.
It is only in the past few years that the problems women face as a group
have been given the widespread recognition they deserve. There is much to
be learned before we can even ask all the appropriate questions. Many of
the problems involve profound issues of family and social organization. By
listening to diverse groups and to the discussion of the public it is hoped
that Government will be able to find its appropriate role. We believe that
the newly formed Advisory Committee on the Economic Role of Women
will contribute to that process.

CHAPTER 5

The International Economic System
in Transition

T

HE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICY of the United
States had two major objectives in 1972. One was to improve the
U.S. balance of payments, which had reached a record deficit of nearly
$30 billion in 1971. The other was to make progress on reform of the international economic system, affecting monetary, trade, and investment relationships. The existing system has been unable to cope with shifting patterns
of trade and imbalances in international payments which have resulted in
repeated international economic and political tensions.
The groundwork for progress on both fronts had been laid in December
of 1971 when the world's major industrialized countries met at the Smithsonian Institution. For the short term, the participants agreed on a realignment of exchange rates among the major currencies to relieve the existing
disequilibrium in international payments. For the long term, they agreed
to enter into multilateral negotiations on reform of the international economic system.
The overall balance-of-payments position of the United States, while still
far from equilibrium, began to improve in 1972. The improvement, which
was all in the capital account, was largely the result of a sharp reduction
over 1971 in speculative outflows of capital. Domestic economic policies
which curtailed the rate of inflation, the realignment of exchange rates, and
renewed confidence in international monetary relationships all contributed
to this improvement. The trade and current account deficits of the United
States, however, were considerably larger in 1972 than in 1971, although
they levelled off during the year. The year-over-year deterioration in these
accounts stemmed primarily from the rapid growth of the U.S. economy
and a lag in the economic recovery of some of the other major countries.
Progress was also made during 1972 on the longer-term reform objective.
Agreement was reached on a format for international monetary negotiations. Discussions on the characteristics of a revised international monetary
system are now underway, and the United States has set forth a number of
proposals. The major industrialized countries have also agreed to initiate
multilateral trade negotiations in the fall of 1973. Finally, these same
countries have agreed to explore new forms of cooperation on internal
policies which affect trade and investment among nations.

THE U.S. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS IN 1972
As this Report goes to press, official data for the U.S. balance of payments
are available only for the first 3 quarters of 1972. These figures, shown in
Table 29, indicate tKat, at annual rates, Americans imported $76.2 billion
in goods and services during the first 9 months of 1972, while foreigners
purchased $71.2 billion in U.S. goods and services. On balance, therefore,
Americans obtained $4.9 billion more goods and services abroad than they
provided to the rest of the world. In addition, U.S. Government grants and
other types of unilateral transfers to foreigners exceeded similar transfers to
the United States by $3.7 billion, and U.S. investments in long-term assets
abroad exceeded foreign investments in U.S. long-term assets by $1.6 billion.
Moreover, recorded short-term capital movements, nonrecorded transactions,
and allocations of Special Drawing Rights (SDR's) together resulted in a net
outflow of $1.4 billion. Overall, therefore, American balance-of-payments
expenditures exceeded receipts by $11.6 billion. Virtually the whole deficit in
the U.S. balance of payments on the official reserve transactions basis was
financed by increased dollar holdings of foreign central banks.

THE GOODS-AND-SERVICES ACCOUNT IN 1972
For the goods-and-services account, preliminary estimates are available for
the full year 1972. These figures differ slightly from those in Table 29, which
are annual rates based on data for the first 3 quarters. These preliminary estimates indicate that the United States imported about $4j/s> billion more goods
and services than it exported. U.S. imports of goods exceeded exports by
about $7 billion in 1972, while exports of services exceeded imports by
about $25/2 billion. These figures represent a substantial deterioration in
the goods-and-services account from the full year 1971.
On a quarterly basis, net imports increased from $1.2 billion in the first
quarter of 1972 to $1.6 billion in the second quarter and then declined to $900
million in the third quarter and remained at about the same level in the
fourth. When exports and imports are calculated in volume terms by adjusting for price changes, the quarterly decline in net imports begins somewhat
sooner (in the first quarter rather than the second) and is more marked over
the course of the year.
The figures just cited give early indications that the dollar devaluation,
reinforced by a lower rate of inflation in the United States than in other
major industrialized countries in 1972, is beginning to affect U.S.
exports and imports. The fact remains, however, that the U.S. trade deficit
was much larger in 1972 than had been expected after the realignment of
exchange rates. Cyclical developments in the United States and abroad were
a major reason for this disappointment. Nominal gross national product
(GNP) in the United States grew by nearly 10 percent in 1972, compared to 7*4 percent in 1971 and 5 percent in 1970. Thus while changes in
relative prices reduced the attractiveness of foreign goods compared to
domestic goods, the level of imports continued to increase with the rapid
rise in the overall demand for goods in the U.S. economy. At the same time,
a number of major industrial countries experienced lower than normal rates
of growth in 1972, which tended to hold down the increase in their demand
for U.S. goods.
Apart from the effects of these cyclical developments, the response to
any devaluation is generally delayed. First, it takes some time before a
devaluation is reflected in the relative prices obtained by exporters and
paid by importers. In the short run, to protect their market shares, foreign
exporters frequently do not increase their list price in the U.S. market by
the full amount of devaluation. Conversely, foreign importers frequently do
not reduce their list price of U.S. goods in the foreign market by the full
amount of the devaluation.
Second, when the change in relative prices does occur, its initial impact
is likely to be perverse because a devaluation raises the dollar prices of imported goods and services before the volume of exports and imports responds
to the changes in relative prices. In time, the effect of devaluation on real
trade flows is expected to outweigh the change in prices. It is because of this
sequence of events that one expects the trade balance of a devaluing



115

country to improve in real or volume terms before it improves in value
terms, which is what happened in 1972.
In the case of the United States, the trade deficit in 1972 was also affected
by long-run changes in the demand for basic materials. In particular, domestic production of fuels has not kept pace with the growth of the U.S.
economy, and consequently net imports of fuels increased from $1.7 billion
in the first 10 months of 1971 to $2.6 billion in the first 10 months of 1972.
Although U.S. exports of agricultural products have also expanded rapidly,
they have not fully offset this increased demand for fuels. On balance,
long-term changes in trade patterns have tended to make the elimination
of the U.S. balance-of-payments deficit more difficult.
THE CAPITAL ACCOUNT IN 1972
Returning to the balance-of-payments figures in Table 29, the net outflow
of capital from the United States fell from $27.7 billion in 1971 to an annual
rate of $3.7 billion in the first 3 quarters of 1972. This sharp reduction was
due to several factors.
First, the realignment of exchange rates, and the preservation of international monetary cooperation among the major countries, reestablished
confidence in international monetary relationships. Investors had less incentive to hedge against the risk of a change in exchange rates or the imposition
of new restraints on capital transfers, and some investors were induced to
bring back funds transferred abroad in 1971 for hedging purposes.
Second, a tightening of credit conditions in the United States relative
to some major European countries led to a reversal in the flow of interestsensitive funds. In line with this trend, foreign banks placed liquid funds
in the U.S. money market.
Third, the rapid expansion of the U.S. economy created improved investment opportunities in the United States, and sluggish rates of growth
in a number of major foreign countries reduced incentives for U.S. investment in these countries. In particular, the improved economic prospects
in the United States made purchases of U.S. stocks more attractive to
foreigners.
These factors affected both short-term capital movements, which recorded
a net inflow of $0.9 billion at an annual rate in the first 3 quarters of 1972
compared to a net outflow of $10.2 billion in 1971, and long-term capital
flows, which recorded net outflows of $1.6 billion at an annual rate in the
first 3 quarters of 1972 compared to $6.5 billion in 1971.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET DEVELOPMENTS IN 1972
When the supply of a currency exceeds the demand its value tends to drop
in foreign exchange markets, and when the demand exceeds the supply its
value rises. In order to hold currency values in the foreign exchange market within certain limits, governments other than the United States




116

have followed the practice of entering the market as buyers or sellers of
their own currency whenever its value in terms of U.S. dollars falls or
rises beyond a certain range. On the basis of the Smithsonian Agreement
that range was established as a maximum deviation of plus or minus 2%
percent from the announced parity or central rate of that currency vis-a-vis
the dollar; a total of 4 ^ percent.
Movements in the exchange rate between the dollar and the major
foreign currencies can be seen in Table 30. Chart 11 shows the movements
of the currencies of the European Community (EC). The EC countries have
agreed to keep their currencies within a maximum range of 2^4 percent of
each other, which is half the maximum spread allowed between any two
currencies other than the dollar by the Smithsonian Agreement. This narrowed intra-European band of fluctuation is generally known as the "EC
snake in the Smithsonian tunnel."

Changes in reserves of the major countries, as well as changes in U.S.
liabilities to all foreign central banks, are shown in Table 31. Changes in
reserve holdings of foreign central banks reflect primarily their intervention
in the foreign exchange market to keep the value of their currencies within
the agreed margins. Changes in U.S. liabilities to foreign central banks show
the extent to which foreign central banks have acquired claims against the
United States as a result of intervention in the foreign exchange market.

The dollar was under downward pressure and, conversely, most other
currencies were under upward pressure, at the beginning of the year, before
the Smithsonian rates had become fully established, and during the summer,
when a loss of confidence in the established value of the pound sterling
raised questions about the whole Smithsonian structure of exchange rates.
During the spring and the latter part of the year, the dollar strengthened
relative to most other currencies. These movements in the value of the dollar
reflected primarily changes in the degree of confidence in existing exchange
rates. Changes in credit market conditions in the United States relative to
those abroad also played a role.
Two major currencies did not follow the general pattern described above,
the British pound and the Japanese yen. The pound sterling came under
considerable downward pressure toward the end of June, when a number
of factors created considerable doubt regarding the long-term viability of
the British exchange rate established at the Smithsonian. After losing a considerable amount of foreign exchange in preventing the pound from dropping
below the Smithsonian floor, the British authorities allowed the pound to
float downward in response to market pressures. Over the next 6 months
the pound dropped 10 percent below the rate set at the Smithsonian.
The Japanese yen has been under upward pressure since the end of June,
reflecting the sizable surplus in the Japanese balance of payments. Throughout the second half of the year, the Japanese authorities were required to
purchase large amounts of dollars in the foreign exchange market to keep
the value of the yen from rising above the Smithsonian ceiling. During this
period, forward yen rates remained substantially above the Smithsonian ceiling, reflecting market uncertainty over the existing yen parity.
The renewed confidence in existing exchange rates in the latter part of
1972, with the two exceptions just described, had several causes. One was that
the determination of governments to support the Smithsonian rates was reaffirmed in July by a number of major governments. U.S. intervention in
the exchange markets on a limited basis, and the stated willingness of the
United States to take such action when it was desirable as a means of dealing
with speculative pressures, were important symbols of cooperative support
for the Smithsonian Agreement. The fact that the U.S. price performance
in 1972 was better than that of any of its major partner countries, despite
our ra«pid expansion, also contributed to the improvement in confidence
during the second half of the year.
REFORMING THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC SYSTEM
Changes are required in monetary arrangements, in trading arrangements
and in procedures for dealing with policies usually considered to be "domestic" but having a significant impact on international transactions. The United
States has strongly emphasized not only that reform is needed in all three of
these areas but also that the reforms in all three must be considered as part



119

of a single package, since policies adopted in one field may complement or
conflict with policies in the others. However, thinking is now farthest advanced with respect to monetary reform and we devote most of this chapter
to it.
The President has also taken steps to improve the handling of international economic issues within the U.S. Government, to take better account
of the close interconnections of all aspects of international economic policy
with each other and with domestic policy. The recently created Council
on Economic Policy will provide a framework for the unified consideration
of domestic and international economic issues. The Council on International
Economic Policy (CIEP) continues to have responsibilities for foreign economic policy within the framework of the Council on Economic Policy,
and the director of CIEP is a member of the latter group. Other steps to
improve the handling of the economic aspects of foreign relations include
the appointment of a higher ranking official to be responsible for economic
policy in the State Department and the development of more effective
procedures for the National Advisory Council on International Monetary
and Financial Policies, the body which coordinates the foreign lending
policies and activities of the U.S. Government.
THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM
The suspension of the convertibility of the dollar into gold on August 15,
1971, gave public recognition to the fact that the postwar international
monetary arrangements, known as the Bretton Woods system, had become
untenable. Interim arrangements, including the negotiation of a multilateral
realignment of exchange rates at the Smithsonian Institution in December
1971, have been developed, but they do not provide a long-term solution
to the problems which made changes in the rules of the Bretton Woods
system inevitable. The arrangements have greatly facilitated the maintenance of normal international commercial and investment relationships,
but they do not constitute an adequate system of rules for the international
monetary system in the long run.
A stable international monetary system must meet several major requirements if it is to serve as the basis for the continued expansion of world trade
and investment. First, it should be market-oriented. For the sake of both efficiency and equity, the mechanism for balancing each country's total foreign exchange receipts and payments over the long run should function in
such a way as to minimize interference with individual market transactions.
Second, the settlement of payments balances among countries should be
multilateral, so that every country can offset its deficits with some countries
by means of surpluses with others. To fulfill this condition, the system must
provide for the ultimate settlement of claims in terms of commonly accepted
reserve assets. Such a generalized payments system makes possible a far
higher level of international trade and investment transactions than would




120

be feasible if each country had to balance its payments bilaterally with every
other country in a network of barter relationships. Third, the system should
be stable. International commerce frequently entails long-run commitments
and hence requires stable expectations about conditions affecting the future
profitability of international transactions.
In order to meet these requirements the international monetary system
must fulfill certain specific functions. It must provide an effective and
equitable mechanism for adjustment of payments imbalances among countries, so that external payments imbalances are not allowed to persist and
accumulate. It must also provide international monetary reserves in adequate amounts and in forms acceptable to the participants in the system, i.e.,
international liquidity has to be adequate. If the system permits the creation
of too much international money, international inflationary pressures will
be created; if too little international money is created, deflationary pressure
or pressures for restrictions on international transactions will result. Finally,
the system must operate in such a way as to create and maintain confidence
in its continued viability and in the value of the international reserve assets
associated with it.
Characteristics of the Brett on Woods System
The Articles of Agreement which established the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) in the immediate postwar period reflected a heavy emphasis on
the need for stability and confidence in the international monetary system.
The rules embodied in the Articles dealt primarily with such questions as the
conditions under which governments could change their exchange rates, or
borrow from the Fund to cover deficits, or impose exchange restrictions. The
primary objective was to prevent arbitrary actions by governments in these
areas, and in meeting this objective the Articles were highly successful.
Under the Articles of Agreement, governments were obligated to support
their exchange rates at agreed parity levels in either of two ways—by buying
or selling their own currency in the foreign exchange market whenever the
rate rose 1 percent above or fell 1 percent below parity, or by making their
currency convertible into gold or other reserve assets at the request of a
foreign official institution. In practice, all countries but the United States
have supported their currencies by buying or selling them for dollars, while
the United States has maintained the convertibility of dollars into gold or
other reserve assets tied to gold.
The rules permitted changes in a country's parity when its balance of payments was in fundamental disequilibrium. In practice the parities were
changed only infrequently, generally after a prolonged period of disequilibrium in external payments. There was also a widespread belief that, because
of the importance of the United States in world trade and the central role of
the dollar in the international monetary system, the United States could not
change its exchange rate. In any case, since most other countries were pegging
their rates to the dollar in the foreign exchange market, the United States




121

could not be certain that a change in the price of gold would actually result
in a change in the value of the dollar in terms of foreign currencies.
The Articles of Agreement did not address themselves explicitly to the
question of liquidity. The expectation was that, as in the past, newly mined
gold would provide the major source of new official reserves. It was also
implicitly assumed that countries would hold certain currencies as additional reserves. There were no arrangements, however, for reviewing or
influencing the growth of liquidity. The growth of reserves was thus dependent on the vagaries of gold markets and on deficits in the balance of payments of reserve currency countries. In practice, the U.S. deficits provided the
bulk of new reserves for the rest of the world.
The inadequacies of the system with respect to the process of liquidity
creation led to an important step forward with the recent creation of Special Drawing Rights (SDR's), an internationally created obligation of
the International Monetary Fund. With the establishment of SDR's, the
system no longer had to rely on a persistent deficit in the U.S. balance of
payments for the creation of new reserves. The creation of SDR's could
not in itself restore equilibrium to international payments, however, since
provisions for the adjustment of payments imbalances remained inadequate.
The Articles of Agreement were not very explicit about the circumstances
under which countries should take action to remove balance-of-payments
deficits or surpluses. The assumption was that deficit countries would sooner
or later run out of reserves or borrowing facilities and therefore would have
to adjust. However, surplus countries could postpone adjustment as long as
they were willing to accumulate reserves. Since the major deficit country,
the United States, could not adjust its exchange rate without endangering
the operation of the system, and since most of the surplus countries were
persistently reluctant to change their own rates, the disequilibrium in world
payments increased through the latter half of the 1960's until it reached a
breaking point in mid-1971. At that time, the disequilibrium became so large
that speculative pressures caused billions of dollars to be exchanged for foreign currencies within a few days. These currency movements greatly increased U.S. liabilities to foreign official institutions and further reduced
the stock of U.S. reserve assets. This brought to a head a problem which
had been developing for some time: how to maintain convertibility as the
stock of dollars held by foreign official institutions grew and the United
States' own stock of reserve assets, mainly gold, shrank.
On August 15, the President announced a suspension of the convertibility
of the dollar into gold or SDR's. This action withdrew U.S. support from
the old exchange rates between the dollar and other foreign currencies, and
in effect put the dollar on a floating basis. Subsequently, a new set of exchange rates was agreed upon at the Smithsonian Institution, and as part
of that realignment the United States agreed to increase the U.S. official
price of gold from $35 to $38 an ounce. This 8.5-percent increase in the price




122

of gold was signed into law on March 31, 1972. The United States has not
resumed the convertibility of the dollar, but has said that it will undertake
appropriate convertibility obligations in the context of a suitably reformed
international monetary system, provided that the U.S. balance-of-payments
and reserve positions improve sufficiently to make such an undertaking
viable.
Preparations for International Monetary Reform
Some of the major problems to be dealt with in a reform of the international monetary system, as well as a number of approaches to their solution, were examined in a report submitted by the Executive Directors of
the International Monetary Fund to the Board of Governors in August 1972.
At about the same time, the member countries of the International Monetary
Fund agreed to create a committee to conduct negotiations on reform. This
committee, the Committee of Twenty, is patterned after the representational
system used in the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund,
where the membership is broken down into twenty constituencies, each with
a single spokesman to act on behalf of all the countries in the constituency.
Although some of the constituencies are formed by single large countries,
as is true with the United States, most comprise several smaller countries.
The first meeting of this new group was held at the annual session of the
International Monetary Fund in September 1972; this was followed by
several meetings of deputies, who expect to prepare a draft outline of the
main reform proposals in time for the 1973 annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund.
U.S. Ideas on International Monetary Reform
In order to help get the negotiation process underway, the United States
has advanced some general proposals on reform. The U.S. approach is
evolutionary, seeking to build on existing principles and practices where
they have proved useful and have met with international approval. At
the same time, it proposes certain important changes to ensure the viability
of the new system. The primary emphasis is on the creation of an effective
and evenhanded mechanism for the adjustment of payments imbalances
that would place all countries, surplus and deficit alike, under agreed and
broadly symmetrical rules and responsibilities for taking action to restore
equilibrium. In the U.S. view, the most promising approach is a system in
which disproportionate changes in a nation's reserves in either direction
indicate the need for measures to eliminate the payments imbalance. Within
such a system of symmetrical adjustment discipline, the U.S. approach would
allow considerable diversity in the choice of instruments for bringing about
adjustment. One way to widen the choice of adjustment tools would be to
allow increased flexibility of exchange rates.
With respect to international liquidity, the U.S. proposal envisages an
increase in the importance of the SDR and the elimination of various




123

encumbrances which reduce its usefulness as a reserve asset. At the same
time, the U.S. proposal contemplates a gradual diminution of the role played
by gold in the international monetary system. Holdings of foreign currency reserves would be neither banned nor encouraged, but it is expected
that they would become a smaller proportion of total international reserve
assets than they are today.
The Adjustment Process
In developing its proposals the United States has taken into account a
number of realities about the international adjustment process. First, every
government seeks to retain a large degree of discretion in managing its
economy, in order to meet the specific social and economic concerns of
its citizens. Second, the policies of every government are necessarily affected
and constrained by the interaction of its economy with the outside world,
since international trade and investment are increasingly important factors
in the economic prosperity of all countries. The U.S. proposal seeks to
achieve a proper balance between these two conditions by retaining considerable national discretion with respect to the method and timing of adjustment, but by imposing a stronger international discipline to ensure the
achievement of adjustment objectives.
Reserves as objective indicators for adjustment. The U.S. proposal, that
disproportionate changes in reserves in either direction be used as the
primary indicator of the need for balance-of-payments adjustment, is described in detail in Appendix A. In summary, the proposal is that certain
points should be established above and below each country's "base," or
"normal" level of reserves, and that movements in reserves beyond these
points would signal the need for balance-of-payments adjustment.
The U.S. proposal is based on the recognition that countries experiencing
a persistent deterioration in their reserve positions have always had to
devalue their currencies or to take other adjustment measures. The U.S.
proposal would make this discipline symmetrical for both deficit and surplus countries by providing that a disproportionate gain in reserves would
indicate the need for adjustment actions by surplus countries to the same
extent that disproportionate reserve losses now impose pressure on deficit
countries to adjust.
Symmetry in the adjustment process, as provided for in the U.S. proposal,
is desirable for several reasons. Active implementation of adjustment policies,
as opposed to passive acceptance of the domestic consequences of adjustment
by others, frequently entails political costs (as in the case of an exchange
rate change, which governments have commonly considered to be a confession of weakness). And it may sometimes involve economic costs of adjustment as well (when, for example, a deficit country tolerates an increase in unemployment in order to improve the payments balance through demand
restraint). Thus, a balanced distribution of the responsibility for initiating
adjustment is in part a question of equity.



124

Such symmetry also makes the process of international adjustment more
efficient. If countries on both the deficit and the surplus sides of a payments imbalance follow active policies for the restoration of equilibrium the
process is likely to be easier than if the deficit countries try to bring about
adjustment by themselves. Deficit countries would in any case be unable to
restore equilibrium unless surplus countries at least followed policies consistent with a reduction of the net surplus in their payments positions. Such
problems can best be avoided by clarifying the responsibilities of both groups
of countries in bringing about payments adjustment.
The use of reserve criteria also focuses on the close relationship between
the speed of adjustment and the need for liquidity. The less efficient and
prompt the adjustment process, the larger is the global need for reserves;
the smaller and less elastic the total stock of reserves, the more stringent the
demands will be on the adjustment process. In a system where the adjustment process is tied to reserves, the total volume of reserves created can be
related to the sum of countries' individual reserve targets as reflected in the
internationally agreed indicators. If the two are not made consistent, sustained balance-of-payments equilibrium cannot be obtained. Failure to provide the system with adequate reserves puts deflationary pressure on deficit
countries and induces a disruptive competition for scarce reserves. In contrast,
the creation of too large a volume of reserves places the major share of
adjustment pressures on surplus countries and exacerbates tendencies toward
world inflation.
A link between adjustment measures and reserve changes is essential if a
generalized system of convertibility of national currencies into international
reserve assets is to be sustainable. In the long run, convertibility can be maintained only if the adjustment mechanism prevents the development of large
and persistent imbalances which would inevitably prevent a deficit country
from providing conversion of its own currency into primary reserve assets.
Reserve indicators have several other advantages as compared to other
conceivable adjustment guides. They are comprehensive, quickly available,
and relatively unambiguous. Furthermore, they do not discriminate between
one set of transactions and another. They leave the relation between specific
types of transactions to market forces, focusing only on the overall level of
the balance of payments. In a system based on the market principle, it would
be inappropriate to base judgments about the need for adjustment solely on
trade, or the current account, or the capital account.
Adoption of reserve criteria as a primary indicator of the need for adjustment does not imply automaticity. The system would operate in the context of a multilateral review procedure. While excessive reserve changes may
create an increasingly strong presumption that effective adjustment measures are called for, a country could still convince the international community that the signals were wrong and adjustment was not appropriate.
In such a case the reserve indicator could be overriden. Moreover, the use
of reserve indicators would not preclude such supplementary guides as
might be available.

Short-term capital movements may present a problem in managing any
system of adjustment, including one based on reserve indicators. Large movements of such funds in response to differences in interest rates, or the expectation of future changes in exchange rates, could bring about large changes
in reserves. This could signal the need for adjustment actions even though
they might not otherwise be thought appropriate. It should be possible,
however, to identify such cases in the multilateral review and to override the
signal by international agreement. Moreover, the wider margins within
which exchange rates can fluctuate have already provided a useful cushion
against short-term capital movements initiated by interest rate differentials,
and these margins should become more effective in a system where the maintenance of inappropriate parities is avoided.
Greater flexibility in the exchange rate. An important feature of the
U.S. proposals is that they would make exchange rate changes a more useful
internationally acceptable instrument of adjustment. The U.S. suggestions regarding the exchange rate mechanism assume that most countries
will generally choose to continue their practice of maintaining established
values for their currencies. At the same time, the United States recognizes
that the difficulties caused by prolonged maintenance of inappropriate exchange rates can be avoided only if countries adjust their parities more
promptly than was usual in the past.
The U.S. proposal recognizes the current evolution of more flexible
techniques of exchange rate management. For example, despite the fact
that floating a currency—suspending the maintenance of its value by exchange market intervention—is technically a violation of the Bretton
Woods Agreement, a number of important countries have done so. Such
floats may be either transitional, as a way of utilizing market signals in
determining a new rate, or indefinite in their duration. The Canadians have
floated during long intervals for more than two decades, the Germans have
floated twice in recent years, and the British have been floating since mid1972. The U.S. proposal would permit either transitional or indefinite periods of floating, but it would impose standards on countries adopting
floating regimes to guard against their use as instruments for competitive
devaluation.
The United States also proposes that countries which maintain parity
exchange rates adopt wider margins within which the market exchange rate
is allowed to fluctuate. The Smithsonian Agreement temporarily increased
the permissible margins from 1 percent on either side of dollar parity to 2*4
percent above or below dollar parity, implying a maximum spread of 4J4
percent between any two nondollar currencies. A number of countries have
adopted these wider margins. The United States favors the permanent adoption of margins for all currencies,- including the dollar, that are in the same
range as those permitted for nondollar currencies under the Smithsonian
Agreement. Since the dollar currently serves as the chief intervention currency it can never deviate from its parity with any other currency by more



126

than the width of the margin, or 2J4 percent. For any two nondollar currencies, however, the maximum spread is twice the margin, because one
currency could be at the floor while the other currency was at the ceiling.
To do away with this particular asymmetry will require innovations in the
techniques of exchange market intervention, a question which will have to
be addressed in the context of the general reform effort.
A larger zone within which fluctuation can take place without government
intervention implies more opportunity for the operation of market forces
and can facilitate small changes in parities. Wider margins can also lessen
the incentives for short-term capital flows in response to interest rate differentials by increasing the scope for forward premiums or discounts in the
exchange markets, thus neutralizing such differentials.
The desire for symmetry between the margins for the dollar and for other
currencies reflects the view that, whereas the dollar had unique functions and
responsibilities in the old system, its role in the new system should be closer to
that of other important currencies. Under the Bretton Woods system, other
countries maintained or changed the values of their currencies in relation to
the dollar, and the United States was passive. The proposed change would
give the United States more freedom to exercise control ov6r its own exchange rate, not only in influencing the rate within the margins around
parity, but also in changing the parity itself. Of course, under any system this
freedom will be limited by the fact that the United States is so important in
world trade that any change in the value of the dollar would strongly affect
other countries. In addition, the dollar will undoubtedly continue to be an
international medium of exchange, even when no Americans are involved,
and substantial amounts of dollars will still be held abroad in private and
official hands. Therefore, reasonable stability in the value of the dollar will
be desirable. Nonetheless, in a reformed system the dollar should have considerably more flexibility than it did before.
Other techniques of adjustment. Under the U.S. proposal a variety of
mechanisms for restoring payments balance would be available, among them
changes in monetary and fiscal policy. Furthermore, in keeping with the
goal of the international monetary system to encourage a freer flow of resources, surplus countries would be encouraged to remove barriers to imports and capital outflows, while deficit countries would be encouraged to
remove barriers to exports and capital inflows.
Such a choice among adjustment measures is essential, not only to preserve national sovereignty, but also because the nature of the imbalance
may itself suggest a particular form of policy response. Furthermore, the
existence of uncertainty about whether or not adjustment will take the form
of a change in the exchange rate can itself be a stabilizing influence by
holding down speculation in response to reserve changes.
The U.S. proposal would in extreme circumstances permit the imposition
of direct restraints for balance-of-payments purposes. Their use, however,
would be appropriately circumscribed to ensure that controls remained tem


127

porary and caused the least possible distortion in the pattern of trade and
investment. Controls or surcharges on some transactions and not on others
distort economic relationships, and for that reason broad adjustment measures are generally preferable. And where selective measures are used, pricebased barriers such as taxes or surcharges are generally preferable to quantitative barriers such as quotas. Taxes on some transactions and not on others
change relative prices, but they do not insulate such transactions from market
pressures, as quotas do. This view contrasts with the present rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which specifically authorize
quantitative restrictions but not surcharges for balance-of-payments purposes.
The U.S. proposal furthermore reflects the view that controls on capital
transactions for balance-of-payments purposes should not be encouraged and
certainly should not be required in lieu of other measures of adjustment,
nor should they become the means of maintaining an undervalued or overvalued exchange rate. This position is based on a belief that restrictions have
a distorting influence whether they are focused on trade in commodities, in
services, or in assets (the capital account), and that this parallelism should
be recognized in the rules governing the reformed international monetary
system. In contrast, the provisions of the earlier system made a sharp distinction between controls on trade and other current transactions and controls
on capital transactions.
The U.S. proposal assumes that countries would take their responsibilities
seriously and would usually take steps toward adjustment before such steps
became necessary on the basis of the indicators. In the few cases where countries might persist in avoiding adjustment, however, certain international
sanctions would become operative. On the deficit side, for example, failure
to adjust might lead to refusal to provide credit, as under the old system, or
to loss of scheduled SDR allocations. On the surplus side, the international
inducements for adjustment might include the risk of losing scheduled SDR
allocations or a tax on the country's excess reserve holdings. In some situations, other countries might be authorized to impose a surcharge on imports
from the chronic surplus country until effetive measures were taken
to correct the situation. The Bretton Woods Agreement incorporated a provision similar to this last one, the so-called scarce currency clause. However,
because this provision was never invoked, there was no effective form of
international pressure on surplus countries to adjust.
International

Liquidity

The magnitude, composition, and distribution of world liquidity have
undergone substantial changes in recent years. From the end of 1969 to the
end of October 1972, gross international official reserves increased from
$78 billion to $152 billion, or almost 100 percent in 3 years. Part of this
increase was in newly created Special Drawing Rights, but most of it was
in dollars. Gold and reserve positions in the International Monetary Fund
remained at approximately the same level as in 1969. As a result, a significant



128

change occurred in the proportional composition of international reserves.
Gold dropped from 50 percent to 26 percent, reserve positions in the IMF
dropped from 9 percent to 4 percent, foreign exchange rose from 41 percent
to 64 percent, and SDR's, which did not exist in 1969, provided 6 percent
of world reserves.
For the future, the United States supports movement toward increasing reliance on the SDR as the primary source of world reserve growth
and toward progressive reduction in the role of gold as a reserve asset. The
U.S. proposal also assumes that currencies will play a much smaller role in
reserve holdings in the future than they do today. In that connection, proposals for exchanging a portion of reserve currency holdings into a special
issue of SDR's deserve careful study as part of the transition to a new system.
SDR's as the primary international reserve asset. As part of its proposals
for reform, the United States has supported increased importance for
SDR's; they should become the formal unit of account of the system,
to serve as the common reference point for currency rates and as a common measure of the value of reserve assets. Such an arrangement would
offer important advantages, in that it would eliminate several potential
sources of instability—private and official—which have been particularly
troubling for the international monetary system in the past.
First, the system would not be subjected to strains arising from private
demands for the primary reserve asset. The SDR has no commodity uses
and there are no plans, at least at the present time, for allowing the SDR
to be held as a financial asset in private hands. The value of the SDR in
terms of currencies would be determined purely on the basis of considerations
related to the monetary system itself, and not by occurrences in often volatile
commodity markets.
Second, the system would not have to depend on increasing the value of
the SDR for increases in official liquidity. Instead, the SDR was designed to
expand (or contract) international liquidity through changes in the volume
of SDR units outstanding, thus avoiding speculative problems caused by
changes in the value of the basic reserve asset relative to other types of
money.
Third, SDR's would not be subject to the problem of confidence created
by primary reliance on reserve currencies. Under the Bretton Woods system,
the demand for reserve assets was increasingly met by the reserve currencies.
The larger the amount of a currency held by foreign official institutions,
however, the greater the risk that confidence may be undermined by the
accompanying deficit in the balance of payments of the issuing country.
Furthermore, the commitment of the reserve currency country to maintain
convertibility into reserve assets becomes less and less credible as the stock of
its outstanding liquid liabilities increases. The SDR is not subject to these
particular problems of confidence, since the liability is spread among all
participating countries and it is not convertible into other reserve assets. Con-




129

fidence in the SDR is primarily a function of the commitment and willingness
of governments to accept it in settlement of debts.
Certain changes in the nature and the use of the SDR would make it a
more attractive and useful asset. To the extent possible, for instance, SDR's
should be freed from the encumbrances of reconstitution obligations, designation procedures, and holding limits. These special features of the SDR
mechanism were probably necessary when that instrument was a new and
untested asset. In the absence of an effective adjustment mechanism, it was
considered desirable to place limitations on the magnitude of payments
imbalances to be financed through SDR transfers. The need for such special
features would be reduced or eliminated in a reformed system. Moreover,
the elimination of these special provisions would enhance the SDR's practical utility. The rules of the International Monetary Fund should also be
changed to permit SDR's to be used in all IMF transactions now permitting
or requiring gold. SDR's would thus truly become the basic international
money.
The role of reserve currencies. The United States has also proposed that in
a reformed system official holdings of foreign exchange should be neither
banned nor encouraged. Such holdings of national currencies may provide
a useful margin in reserve management, and fluctuations in such holdings
could add some elasticity to the system as a whole in meeting sudden flows
of volatile capital. A system which prohibited nations from holding foreign
exchange other than working balances would be a much more rigid system.
It would provide no short-term flexibility to allow for reserve expansion
over and above SDR allocations when the demand for reserves is abnormally high for brief periods and there are no other immediately available
means for responding to sudden and reversible speculative pressures. In
practice, there would be a much greater danger that such a rigid system
would break down under the normal pressures which can develop in a
liberal world trading and payments order where the level of international
transactions is large in comparison with the level of world reserves. Inability
of the international reserve mechanism to adapt flexibly in periods of strain
could seriously undermine the effort to move toward a more liberal trade and
payments system. At the same time, since countries would commit themselves
to convert foreign official currency holdings into common reserve assets, a
country should be able to place limits on the amount of its currency which
other countries may hold as reserves.
Gold as reserves. The United States believes that the role of gold in the
international monetary system should continue to diminish, and would
support orderly procedures to facilitate that process. A declining role for
gold is fully consistent with the long-term trend of monetary history. Governments long ago recognized the inadequacy of gold as a basis for national
monetary systems, and in recent decades the dependence of the international economy on that metal has diminished sharply. With the physical




130

supply of gold limited; with its commodity uses competing inevitably and
increasingly with its monetary uses; and with residual noncommercial availability in no way related to the liquidity needs of a prosperous and expanding international economy, the world has naturally developed supplements
and substitutes.
The current situation—where speculative pressures on a thin and volatile commodity market have led to a price much higher than the official gold
price—is evidence of the instabilities and tensions inherent in a system
based on gold or other commodities. In 1972 alone, the commodity price
of gold varied between $44 and $70—a difference of 60 percent of the
lower figure. Whatever the established monetary price of gold, it is certain to get out of line with the price tendencies prevailing on the private
market. Care must be taken to avoid exposing the reformed monetary system to that source of instability.
THE INTERNATIONAL TRADING SYSTEM
A new round of multilateral trade negotiations within the framework of
the GATT is scheduled to begin in the fall of 1973. The purpose of these
negotiations will be both to expand the scope for international trade and to
improve the institutional process for resolving international trade disputes.
The world as a whole, including the United States, has benefited substantially from the expansion of trade made possible by previous multilateral reductions of trade barriers. At the same time, conflicts over trade
issues have intensified in recent years. In the approaching trade negotiations,
new ways will have to be found to resolve such conflicts in ways conducive to
the growth of trade.
World trade expanded more than fivefold in the last 20 years, and this
expansion has been accompanied by an equivalent expansion of world
output. The average annual growth in the value of both world trade and
economic output during this period was about 8 percent. While the expansion of trade was only one reason for these output gains, it was undoubtedly
an important source of growth. Trade not only allows each country to produce what is best suited to its capabilities, it also provides competition which
stimulates everyone to produce goods more cheaply and to improve their
quality.
Although the United States is less dependent on trade than most other
nations, the role of trade in the economy has grown. Over the last two
decades, GNP in the United States has increased about three and one-half
times, while trade has increased more than four times. Exports have become
a more significant source of employment and income for those sectors in
which the United States has a comparative advantage, particularly agriculture and high technology manufactures, while imports are becoming more
important as the source both of the raw materials and fuels used by U.S.
industry and of consumer goods whose production requires much use of
relatively unskilled labor.



131

Over the last 5 years, imports of goods by Americans have increased
much faster than foreign purchases of goods made in the United States.
This imbalance has caused difficulties for the United States as well as for
the world economy, and its correction is therefore in the interest of both. It
can be accomplished in part through equilibrating changes in exchange rates
and relatively more effective anti-inflationary measures in the United States,
both of which change relative prices and thus improve the competitiveness
of U.S. goods and services. Much progress has been made on this front in
the past 18 months. Reductions in foreign trade barriers can also contribute
to correction of the payments imbalance. A number of countries, particularly
Japan, took some liberalizing actions in 1972 aimed at alleviating the disequilibrium situation. It is hoped that further actions during 1973 will contribute to this adjustment process.
Aims of Trade Negotiations
The trade negotiations scheduled to begin in the fall of 1973 look to the
longer term. Their goal is to remove the sources of difficulties that have
arisen under present trading arrangements and to provide for the expansion of trade on the basis of mutual advantage and mutual commitment
with reciprocity. However, results from the negotiations in the form of
concrete changes affecting the world trading system are likely to be gradual
and will not begin to take effect for several years.
In approaching these negotiations the United States seeks, as it has since
the end of World War II, a more open and equitable world trading system.
A freer movement of goods, services, and capital throughout the world in
response to market forces is in the U.S. interest for several reasons. To the
extent that trade is undistorted by artificial barriers, our producers can sell
what they make best and our consumers will reap the benefits of efficient
production and competition on a worldwide basis. These benefits to the
United States will not conflict with the interests of other countries. All
countries can expect gains from expanded world trade on a nondiscriminatory basis.
A world trading system that minimizes trade distortions is also one of the
important prerequisites for a smoothly functioning international monetary
system. The more barriers that countries erect to the flow of goods, services,
and capital, the more the adjustment of payments imbalances is focused on
the narrower range of economic activity which remains free to respond to
market forces. The result is to place heavy and uneven burdens of adjustment on particular sectors, often forcing countries to choose between accepting severe economic dislocations and postponing overall adjustment.
Comprehensive trade negotiations are made even more urgent by the accelerated liberalization of trade within the enlarged European Community
and countries associated with it. This development will stimulate growth and
increased trade among countries within Europe, and will make possible ex-




132

pansion of trade with the outside world as well. At the same time, when a
group of countries eliminates trade barriers among themselves while maintaining them against the outside world, the immediate effect is to divert trade
from outside suppliers to suppliers in member countries.
In the process of harmonizing their tariffs with the EC's common external
tariff, the new members of the EC will be increasing some tariffs and reducing
others. Under the rules of the GATT, compensatory tariff reductions must be
offered for any increase in tariffs fixed in previous agreements. In the course
of this year, the United States and others will negotiate with the EC over the
amount of compensation considered adequate. But, such compensation will
not be able to take full account of the new situation that has been created by
the changes in European trading arrangements. Only a negotiated reduction
in the general level of tariffs and nontariff barriers (NTB's) can effectively
reduce the discrimination that results from the removal of trade barriers
within Europe.
The expansion of the EC has also been accompanied by the negotiation
of preferential trade agreements between the members of the European
Community and a large number of other countries in Europe and Africa.
Most of these agreements provide for preferential access for exports of both
parties in each other's markets, thus inherently discriminating against exports
of outsiders. This proliferation of preferential trade agreements threatens to
erode the most-favored-nation (MFN) principle, which provides that all
trade concessions agreed on between two or more countries be extended to
all countries that adhere to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
While the GATT permits formation of free trade areas or customs unions
that involve the elimination of barriers on substantially all internal trade, it
does not permit more limited selective preferential arrangements.
The MFN principle has been the cornerstone of the postwar liberalization
of multilateral trade. By ensuring nondiscrimination in the application of
trade barriers, it minimizes the inefficiency and distortions caused by such
barriers. It also avoids trade diversion and thus injury to third parties
from selective reduction of trade barriers. And finally, it makes possible a
greater trade liberalization in the course of multilateral GATT negotiations
by ensuring that any trade concession negotiated between two or more
countries will be promptly extended to a large number of countries. For
these reasons, it will be important to clarify the obligations assumed by
GATT members with respect to the MFN principle.
In view of the increasing importance of nontariff barriers as tariff barriers are reduced, it is crucial that the movement toward a more open
trading system be comprehensive, encompassing all forms of barriers to
trade. Among the major types of NTB's that distort trade are quantitative
import restrictions, export subsidies, restrictive government procurement
policies, and discriminatory design and performance standards.
Negotiations covering such a wide range of issues will be difficult for a
number of reasons: trade distortions may arise from otherwise legitimate



133

domestic social policies; many of these practices are embedded in domestic
laws; there is no simple basis for measuring reciprocity in tradeoffs between
one type of NTB and another; and the feasible time schedule for concluding negotiations and implementing agreements is likely to vary widely from
one NTB to another. Nonetheless, inclusion of these measures in future trade
negotiations is essential; and considerable preparatory work, both technical
and definitional, has already been done, in the United States as well as in
a number of international groups and organizations.
Further steps toward trade liberalization should also be comprehensive
in the sense that they encompass all economic sectors. From the point of
view of the United States, it is particularly important that such negotiations include agricultural as well as industrial trade. Abundant natural
resources and advanced farm management and technology give this country
a comparative advantage which makes our farm products highly competitive in world markets. Our agricultural exports are estimated to have
reached an all-time high of $9j/£ billion last year. With rationalization of
the agricultural policies and liberalization of the related restrictive import
policies maintained by most industrialized countries, the United States
could realize its full potential for trade in this important sector.
Institutional Reforms
Certain institutional reforms would greatly help the movement toward a
more open and more equitable trading system. The present GATT framework, which has served well for the liberalization of trade, particularly tariff
barriers, now needs to be strengthened and modified. In particular, better
procedures should be found to deal with difficulties and disputes arising out
of changes in trade patterns and trading arrangements among particular
countries.
The failure of institutional arrangements to deal effectively with this range
of problems pokes certain dangers. Countries that cannot find a satisfactory
multilateral solution to their trade difficulties will increasingly be under
pressure to adopt unilateral restrictive measures that make trade less free
and are often discriminatory in their effect. Trade disputes that are not
resolved promptly and in accordance with agreed rules also tend to create
political problems at home that spill over into other areas and affect political and security relations among countries. Such trade disputes can also
prevent the smooth functioning of the international monetary system, both
by distorting economic flows and by undermining confidence in existing economic relationships.
Difficulties have arisen in the past with respect to measures which countries take to cushion the domestic impact of abrupt changes in trade patterns.
Under the existing rules of the GATT, countries can take temporary measures to restrain imports when rapid increases threaten to disrupt domestic
industry. A country imposing such restraints, however, is required to compensate other countries for any loss of trade that may result by making




134

equivalent reductions in other trade barriers. These rules have proved unworkable in practice, and governments have tended to evade them.
In limited instances, the adjustment required by a change in trade patterns may be too large to be accomplished in a short time without excessive
social, personal, and political costs. In such cases temporary restraints on
the pace at which imports increase can provide time for the adjustment of
domestic resources to take place in the most constructive and least painful
way. These safeguards can also make it less likely that some countries will
resist general trade liberalization, fearing that it would cause abrupt dislocations in particularly sensitive industries.
A number of proposals have been put forward for a new safeguard system
which would assure that such measures are taken within the multilateral
framework. If safeguard actions are negotiated on a multilateral basis,
they are not nearly so likely to become a disguised form of protectionism
as they are if they are imposed by individual countries without international standards. Under the proposed system, it would be possible for importing countries to restrain imports temporarily without compensatory reductions of other trade barriers. Such actions would, however, be subject to
commonly accepted criteria, a procedure for international review, and provisions to prevent abuse of the system. The system should also include an
understanding that temporary safeguards must be accompanied by effective
domestic adjustments in the allocation of resources.
These various matters relating to reform of the international trading
system were discussed over a 2-year period by the OECD High Level Group
on Trade and Related Problems, a group of experts representing the major
industrial countries. Its report, issued in the summer of 1972, addresses all the
major issues concerning trade, including tariffs, nontariff barriers, unilateral
safeguards, trade in agricultural products, involvement of the less developed
countries, and East-West trade. Although there were divergences of opinion
on some issues among the group, particularly on agriculture, a high degree
of agreement was found on major substantive issues. The report emphasizes
the desirability of further liberalization of world trade and points to the
economic and political dangers inherent in a return to protectionism.
OTHER ASPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION
The reform of the international monetary and trade systems will have a
global focus, inasmuch as the scope and membership of both the International Monetary Fund and the GATT are worldwide. Not all problems that
arise in international economic relationships can best be solved in a global
framework, however, since many issues that arise are of special interest to
certain groups of countries. In many cases institutional mechanisms have
been created for the purpose of examining common problems or exploring
common approaches, in other cases there exists only a focus for analysis.
The discussion below examines three sets of relationships that cut across
trade and monetary lines. The first is concerned with problems that arise



135

among the industrialized market economies as a result of the high degree of
economic integration among them. The second focuses on the various dimensions of the monetary, trade, investment, and economic assistance relationships between developed and developing economies. The third looks at
the problems that may arise as economic relationships expand between centrally planned economies and the rest of the world.
Domestic Policies Affecting Trade and Investment
International monetary and trade rules are focused on measures affecting the flow of goods and financial assets across national borders. They
do not, on the whole, touch upon internal policy measures which are not
directed to international transactions as such but which nevertheless affect
the international location of economic activity. In an integrated world economy, however, measures taken in one country may have substantial effects
on the allocation of resources in other countries, and conflict among policy
objectives of various countries is therefore possible. These interrelations
have reached a particularly advanced state among the industrialized market
economies. For this reason, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), whose membership comprises most of the industrialized market economies, provides a useful forum for discussions on
questions of internal economic policies, their role in transmitting economic
influences from one country to another, and their relation to international
economic transactions.
A step toward intensified use of the OECD forum for such discussions
was taken recently when the Executive Committee of the Organization met
for the first time at higher political levels than before (Executive Committee New Style) to discuss new fields for possible cooperation. Just how the
focus of this area of international cooperation will be delineated remains to
be worked out, since it is not always possible to distinguish the matters that
clearly belong in the international monetary or trade sphere from those
relating primarily to internal policies. In particular, this latter area overlaps
with nontariff barriers which affect international trade and also with capital
controls related to the monetary adjustment process. Among the questions
likely to fall within the purview of this area, however, are those concerned
with national investment policies, including policies relating to multinational
corporations.
At its recent meeting, the OECD Executive Committee New Style agreed
to explore possible forms of cooperation on national policies affecting investment. Such policies are a particularly sensitive concern of all governments,
representing an area where national interests can conflict. By subsidizing
or otherwise encouraging some industries and not others, governments
can affect the pattern of domestic production and international trade.
Investment policies can thus be used to some extent as substitutes for
trade policy measures. The use of either may distort relative prices and cause
a less than optimal allocation of world resources. Although subsidies and




136

trade restrictions can influence the location of production in similar ways,
subsidies affect adversely the terms of trade of the country giving them,
while trade barriers such as tariffs can shift the terms of trade in favor of
the country which imposes them.
Subsidies are not the only internal policy measure affecting investment,
production, and trade. Other frequently used policy tools are taxes, antitrust
policies, regulatory policies, patent policies, and government procurement
policies. There is a need to explore cooperatively the possibility of limiting
the use of such policies where they severely affect other countries.
Another field of investment policy open to conflict among national interests is the matter of rules governing the ownership of capital, including
land, productive facilities, and financial assets. No nation would readily
surrender the right to implement such rules, but every nation has an interest in protecting its citizens from arbitrary treatment by other governments. Considerable cooperation in this area has already been achieved by
the OECD, in particular in promulgating the Code of Liberalization of Capital Movements. Further progress would increase both efficiency and fairness
in international economic relations.
Another item of common interest in the investment area is the multinational corporation. Multinational corporations transmit capital, technology, and management skills from one country to another. Their ability
to manage resources in an international rather than a national market has
tended to improve the overall efficiency of the world economy. Because their
operations extend beyond the boundaries of any single nation, however, a
number of jurisdictional questions arise, and with increasing frequency these
corporations are believed—rightly or wrongly—to affect a country's ability to
pursue and achieve its domestic economic objectives. Moreover, multinational corporations personalize what would otherwise seem to be impersonal
market forces that transmit the impact of economic decisions from one
country to another. For this reason, these corporations tend to become a
focal point for problems faced by national governments as a consequence
of the growing economic interdependence among nations.
The OECD may also seek to work out cooperative arrangements on such
questions as regional policies, industrial policies, agricultural policies, general adjustment policies, regulations governing financial markets, and principles of taxation.
Industrialized and Developing Economies
One of the important objectives of reform is to create a more stable and
mutually beneficial framework for economic relations between developed
and developing countries. Both groups of countries can benefit from reducing the degree of arbitrariness in national decisions affecting international
trade, investment, and aid. The approaching negotiations provide an opportunity for mutual commitments that will serve the common interest and




137

can facilitate achievement of the commonly accepted goal of reducing the
gldbal gap in economic prosperity.
Developed and developing countries are dependent on each other in many
ways. Developing economies are the source of a substantial proportion of the
raw materials used by the industrialized economies, and increasingly the
source of manufactures involving labor-intensive production methods as well.
On the other hand, industrialized economies are the source of much of the
capital equipment, technology, management skills, and financial capital
needed by the developing countries to increase their production capabilities
and provide the basis for long-term diversification of their economies.
Most developing countries are members of the International Monetary
Fund. They are represented by nine members on the Committee of Twenty,
which is mapping out a reform of the international monetary system. This
participation should help assure that the new rules will work effectively on a
global basis and will give due weight to the needs of the developing
countries.
For developing countries, exports not only provide most of their foreign
exchange, but are also an important means of achieving economies of large
scale production in many industries. In order to increase their opportunities
for trade, the United States supports the general reduction of tariff barriers
in industrial countries to exports of developing countries. The United States
is also actively encouraging the full participation of these countries in the
approaching trade negotiations. The agenda for the negotiations, including
such items as the reduction of nontariff barriers and the imposition of safeguards, covers matters of even greater concern to these countries than tariff
questions. But their influence on the outcome of the negotiations will also be
greater if countries which are not currently members of the GATT are willing to accept the obligations of GATT membership. The commitment to this
framework of rules and obligations would help to ensure developing countries against arbitrary action by others. An obligation to avoid highly complex and discretionary nontariff barriers could also improve the efficiency
of their own planning efforts and facilitate trade with each other, which
has been declining in relative importance for many years.
The efficient transfer of capital from developed to developing countries
is another important objective of a well-functioning international economic
system. Such transfers of capital are desirable because they make available
to developing countries more resources for investment, as well as giving
them access to new production and management techniques. In recent years,
there has been a reduction in the relative importance of bilateral economic
assistance and increased reliance on the multilateral development banks as
channels of public aid. Loans by these institutions have almost doubled in
the 5-year period from 1968 through 1972, and U.S. contributions have also
increased substantially. At the same time, U.S. bilateral economic assistance




138

has declined slightly. Private capital flows from developed to developing
countries have also continued to expand at a rapid rate, nearly doubling
during the 5-year period from 1967 through 1971, the last year for which
data are available. The size of these private flows makes it increasingly desirable to create arrangements which assure developing countries that
such investments contribute to their economic advancement and assure
developed countries that their investments will not be treated arbitrarily.
Such arrangements should include internationally accepted standards and
procedures for the settlement of disputes.
Market and Centrally Planned Economies
Trade and monetary relations between market economies and centrally
planned economies have been carried on outside the framework of the multilateral trade and payments system, generally on the basis of bilateral trade
agreements. These agreements may sometimes specify the quantities and
prices of commodities to be exchanged. More often they are more open-ended,
providing only a set of ground rules for trade contracts negotiated between
individual state trading companies and private firms.
Trade between market and centrally planned economies can be advantageous for both sides, and with a relaxation of political tensions this trade can
be expected to grow significantly. In the past the United States has engaged
in less trade with the centrally planned economies than has western Europe.
Recently, however, the United States has taken a number of steps to expand
its trade with these countries; among such moves have been the signing of
trade agreements with the Soviet Union and Poland and the elimination of
the embargo on bilateral trade with the People's Republic of China.
Trade with the Soviet Union is likely to grow particularly fast. The
Soviet Union has large quantities of raw materials and fuels, many of which
are beginning to be in short supply in the United States. On the other hand,
the Soviet Union has a large import requirement for food and for manufactured products that depend on advanced technology. The United States can
supply both.
The particular characteristics of the centrally planned economies will require the development of special rules as trade between them and the market
economies expands. In trade among market economies, bilateral settlement
of claims has been abandoned in favor of a multilateral settlement
system. Since few of the centrally planned economies are part of this multilateral payments system, special arrangements will have to be made to
assure that settlements of net balances will be effected.
For trade among market economies, rules have also been developed to
prevent excessive disruption of domestic production and trade with third
countries by large and rapid shifts in trade patterns. As trade with the
centrally planned economies grows, it may be necessary to develop similar
rules to prevent sudden disruption not only of economic activity within




139

individual market economies, but also of trade patterns among the market
economies.
Finally, it is important to ensure that commercial disputes are settled
amicably and are not allowed to spread into the political sphere. In trade
among market economies, contracts are usually made between individual
firms, and whatever disputes arise are settled through the respective courts
in a manner that is usually acceptable to both parties. In trade with centrally planned economies, the fact that one of the parties to any trade contracts is the state can create special problems with respect to the settlement
of disputes.
In anticipation of some of the possible problems that a rapid expansion
of trade could give rise to, the recent trade agreement between the United
States and the Soviet Union included these provisions:
1. The creation of a joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. Commercial Commission to resolve difficulties arising at the government level.
2. A procedure for guarding against market disruptions. Under it, after
consultation, the U.S.S.R. will not ship products to the United States which
the U.S. Government has advised will "cause, threaten, or contribute to disruption of its domestic market."
3. An arbitration agreement which encourages the settlement of commercial disputes by arbitration in a country other than the Soviet Union or the
United States under the Arbitration Rules of the Economic Commission
for Europe, a United Nations agency. The U.S.-Soviet trade agreement also
provides for the reciprocal extension of credit facilities, nondiscriminatory
tariff treatment of each other's imports, the establishment of commercial
offices in the two countries, the availability of business facilities, and the
settlement of the World War II lend-lease debt owed the United States by
the U.S.S.R.
*
*
*
*

In advancing proposals for reform, the United States has kept in mind
the necessity of building on commonly accepted principles. Foremost among
these principles is the belief that an open exchange of goods, services, and
capital based on market relationships can benefit all countries. Moreover,
if all countries are to remain committed to freer trade and investment, the
international rules must give everyone a chance to share in the benefits.
Recent experience has shown the need for certain reforms in current rules
and practices. The rules should more explicitly define international standards of conduct and yet provide greater flexibility in the means of discharging these international responsibilities. Also, the various aspects of the
international economic system dealing with monetary, trade and investment
questions should be better related to each other. Lastly, any stable and wellfunctioning international economic system must rest upon sound domestic
policies to promote domestic growth and price stability in the major countries.

SUPPLEMENT TO CHAPTER 2

Description of the 1972 Controls Program
The regulations that spelled out the Economic Stabilization Program
(ESP) in 1972 covered hundreds of pages. Quarterly Reports of the Cost
of Living Council describe the program fully. Here the discussion includes
only the principal elements which explain the general character of the
system.
The system began on August 15, 1971, with an initial freeze affecting
nearly all wages, prices, and rents and lasting 90 days. One of the main purposes of the freeze was to permit the development of a more durable, although
still temporary, program without giving prices and wages a chance to run
away in anticipation of the new program.
The Phase II program was announced on October 7 to succeed the
freeze on November 14, 1971. The initial design of the system and the
modifications to it during 1972 were made in accordance with a few
general themes:
1. The success of the system would depend primarily upon voluntary support. The standards of the program and their application had to be regarded
as fair and reasonable so that the great voluntary support which came forth
when the program began could be preserved. To achieve this result it was
desirable that price and wage controls should not be imposed unilaterally on
the economy by the Government but that representatives of the private sector should participate in the system's development.
2. The system would operate in circumstances where the expansion of
output and employment would be a major national objective. Price and
wage controls should not interfere with that expansion.
3. The controls were intended to be temporary. Some standards and
procedures that, if permanent, could not be tolerated from an equity standpoint would be tolerable and accepted if temporary. Similarly, elements of
the system that, if they were permanent, might have serious adverse economic
effects would be much less harmful if retained for a limited period. The
complexities and refinements of standards and the magnitude of administrative apparatus which might be necessary in a permanent system could
be minimized in a temporary one. However, the temporary system had to
be designed to avoid a price upsurge once the controls were removed or
relaxed.




143

4. The controls were not expected to withstand a strong pressure of
excess demand on inelastic supply of products or labor. The system, in its
standards and administrative mechanism, did not contemplate the elaboration and force that would have been needed to resist excess demand pressure. Moreover, the system was not to be applied in some of the main areas
where increases, if they did occur, would result from demand pressure—
notably farm product prices and market interest rates.
ORGANIZATION OF THE PROGRAM
The program was based on a broad grant of authority originally given
to the President (although not requested by him) when Congress passed
the Economic Stabilization Act in August of 1970. This authority was extended, with a number of qualifications, some of which will be referred
to below, by Public Law 92-210 of December 1971. The renewed authority
would expire on April 30, 1973.
The President delegated his authority under the Act to the Cost of Living
Council (CLC), an interagency committee at Cabinet level chaired by the
Secretary of the Treasury. The CLC in turn delegated authority for major
functions under the Act to a number of committees, composed mainly of
private citizens. The involvement of private citizens was intended to
bring to the program both special expertise and a representation of the
interests of diverse segments of the community. (The structure is depicted
in Chart 12.)
The CLC retained authority to set objectives of the program, to determine its coverage, and to assure general consistency in the operation of
the various segments. It delegated to the Price Commission and to the
Pay Board authority to prescribe standards of permissible prices and employee compensation and to decide on the application of these standards
in particular cases. The Price Commission consisted of seven citizens
including a full-time chairman and was assisted by a staff of about 600. The
Pay Board initially consisted of 15 members, five each from labor, management, and the public. In March 1972 four of the five labor members withdrew, in disagreement with the decision made in the Pacific longshoremen's
case. The Pay Board was then reconstituted to consist of seven members, all
representing the general public although one was a labor leader and one was
from management. By the time this revision of the Board occurred, the tripartite group had already established the basic pay standards and procedures,
which continued to be applied by the new Board and were generally observed by employers and employees. The Chairman of the Pay Board served
full time and the Board had a staff of about 200.
The Construction Industry Stabilization Committee (CISC), a tripartite
body, was established in March 1971 to restrain construction costs,
which had been rising rapidly because of unusually large wage increases.
Although CISC was established prior to the freeze and followed procedures

both the Price Commission and the Pay Board.

The Economic Stabilization Act required that mandatory ceilings be
placed upon interest rates, when necessary, to prevent them from rising at a
rate which would interfere with orderly economic growth. The Cost of
Living Council found that the behavior of interest rates was not such as
to call for mandatory ceilings under the Act. However, as a part of the Phase
II structure, a Committee on Interest and Dividends was established, consisting of the heads of the chief financial agencies in Government and
chaired by the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System. Its role was to enlist voluntary cooperation of lenders and corporations in holding down institutionally determined interest rates and dividends.
The field operation of the stabilization program consisted mainly of providing information on the regulations and checking compliance with them.
These duties, which during the freeze had been assigned to the Office of
Emergency Preparedness, were assigned to a staff from the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) operating under the policy supervision of the Director of the
Cost of Living Council. For the public, the local offices of the IRS were
usually the point of contact with the program.
About 3,000 IRS personnel were assigned to the Economic Stabilization
Program in 1972. Including them, total employment in the program was
about 4,000. In contrast, during World War II, 60,000 people had been employed in controlling prices. During the Korean war the number was about
15,000.
GOALS AND STANDARDS
When Phase II was announced in October 1971, the Cost of Living Council set an interim goal of getting the inflation rate down to 2 to 3 percent
by the end of 1972. Attainment of the goal would be measured mainly by
the consumer price index (CPI), the most familiar of all price indexes. For
a certain class of American consumers, namely urban wage earners and
clerical workers and their families, it is the best available measure of
changes in the average prices they pay for the things they buy, although
this is not true of every consumer.
The goal would be measured in terms of the consumer price index, but
the calculations leading to the idea that the goal was feasible, and to the
control standards by which it was to be achieved, related in the first instance
to the gross national product (GNP) deflator for the priavte economy. The
feasible behavior of the private GNP deflator was derived from estimates of
private compensation per man-hour, output per man-hour, labor costs per
unit of output, and the relation between prices and unit labor costs. Conversion of the estimate into a goal for the CPI rested on the observation that over
extended periods the increases in the CPI and the private GNP price deflator
were not very different. Short-term differences resulted mainly from the behavior of food prices. In the fall of 1971, when the goal was set, food prices
were not expected to rise rapidly in 1972 and cause an exceptional rise in the
CPI relative to the private deflator. As it turned out, the rise in the CPI rela-




146

tive to the rise in the private deflator was greater in 1972 than in all but 1
year since 1950.
Setting 3 percent as the upper end of the target range implied a determination to reduce the rate somewhat below what would have been commonly considered probable in the absence of the controls. A 3-percent inflation rate would be a reduction by half from the peak CPI rate reached
in 1969 and would bring the rate to a level last seen in 1967.
The basic standards set by the Pay Board and the Price Commission were
intended to achieve the goal set by the Cost of Living Council. In fact for
a variety of reasons, including provisions of the Economic Stabilization Act,
as amended, these basic standards were modified in many ways. Some of
these qualifications will be discussed below. Here we confine ourselves to the
logic of the system itself.
The Pay Board set a standard for permissible pay increases of 5J4 percent
per year. The "normal" rate of productivity growth—the trend in output per
man-hour—was considered to be about 3 percent a year. If total labor compensation per hour rose by 5J/2 percent on the average, the normal rise of
labor costs per unit of output would be (approximately) 2J4 percent. The
basic standard for prices was the pass-through of costs—that prices would be
permitted to rise in the same proportion as costs. In the calculation of costs,
however, allowance would be made for the normal rise of productivity.
Application of these two standards together would limit average price increases in the controlled sector to 2j/i percent if the system was closed, that is,
if all costs consisted of labor or purchased supplies whose prices were governed by the same standards. However, if some of the costs of the controlled
sector originated outside that sector and rose by more than 2*/2 percent a
year, the prices of the controlled sector would also rise by more than 2J4
percent. As a practical matter, the controls affected purchases originating
in the domestic, nonfarm, nonfinancial sector of the economy, a sector representing about 90 percent of the total.
It was recognized that productivity would probably rise by more than
the 3-percent trend rate during the expansion of 1971-72. One consequence might be an increase in the share of the value of output going to
profits and other nonlabor shares. However, since the labor share of income
was at or close to a cyclical high point when the control system began, some
movement in that direction seemed appropriate.
Pay standard. The 5 / 2 -percent pay standard was modified in a number
of respects, all of which raised the permissible wage increase:
1. Increases in excess of 5 / 2 percent, scheduled under agreements reached
before November 14, 1971, could go into effect unless specifically disallowed
by the Pay Board. With some exceptions, payments held up during the freeze
were permitted to be made retroactively in the early part of Phase II.
2. Increases in excess of 5^» percent would be allowed in order to correct
a gross inequity in the relation between the pay of one group of employees
and another group with which the first group had a well-established parity.




147

3. During the first year of Phase II, increases beyond 5*/2 percent were
allowed to workers whose pay had increased less than 7 percent a year in
the preceding 3 years.
4. Wage increases would be permitted above the standard if they were
granted as part of an incentive program designed to improve productivity.
5. Congress also specified that certain fringe benefits would not be subject to restraint unless they were "unreasonably inconsistent with the standards for wage, salary, and price increases." To implement this mandate,
the Pay Board decided to permit increases in compensation above 5*/i percent equal to 0.7 percent of compensation when in the form of pension,
profit-sharing, or savings plans, thus raising the standard to 6.2 percent.
Additional increments were allowed for units which had lagged in implementing fringe benefits in the past.
6. The Economic Stabilization Act specifically exempted wages paid to
individuals whose earnings were "substandard" or who could be considered
to be among the "working poor." The Cost of Living Council initially decided that this provision exempted all wages of less than $1.90 an hour.
However, in July a Federal court agreed with the contention of a suing labor
union that the $1.90 figure was inconsistent with the intent of Congress. The
Cost of Living Council then raised the exemption level to $2.75 per hour.
At this level more than 40 percent of the workers in the private nonfarm
sector were estimated to be exempt from coverage.
Price standard. The basic price standard, as already noted, provided that
prices could be increased in the same proportion as allowable costs. There
were, however, a number of qualifications to this standard.
1. In the calculation of costs to justify price increases, the rise in wage
rates was to be discounted by the rise in productivity to permit calculation
of an estimated increase in labor costs per unit of output. The productivity
rise used for this purpose was at first calculated by each firm on the basis
of its own forecast of its own experience. Thus, if the actual productivity increase exceeded or fell short of the calculated rate, the actual cost increases
might be less or more than the costs allowed for price determination. Moreover, beginning in April 1972 the Price Commission required that instead
of using their own estimates, firms should compute their allowable costs by
applying productivity factors calculated by the Price Commission, using
data developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for different industries
on the basis of 1958-69 experience. This created another source of possible discrepancy between a firm's actual costs and the costs used in determining its permissible prices; but the change gave the firm a greater
incentive to improve its productivity.
2. Wholesale and retailing firms were permitted to pass through increased costs of merchandise, but there was no provision for passing through
increases in operating costs. If operating costs rose by a larger percentage
than merchandise costs, the permitted price rise would not be as large in
percentage terms as the total cost increase.



148

3. When a material with a particularly volatile price constituted a large
part of a firm's co3ts, the firm was permitted to raise its price to pass through
an increase in that cost without notifying the Price Commission in advance,
even though the firm's size would otherwise require prenotification. However, if the firm operated under the volatile pricing rule it might raise its
price only by the absolute dollar-and-cents amount of the cost increase, not
by the percentage of the cost increase. It also had to reduce its price correspondingly when the volatile cost declined.
4. Many large, multiproduct firms operated under term limit pricing
(TLP) agreements with the Price Commission. These agreements specified
a maximum percentage by which the firm might raise the average of all its
prices during a period, usually a year. This percentage was arrived at after
consideration of the firm's cost increases, and the arrangement permitted the
firm to raise the price of a particular product without notifying the Price
Commission. Such TLP agreements as negotiated were subject to a maximum limit, which was initially 2.0 percent and was subsequently reduced to
1.8 percent. They also commonly specified a maximum increase permitted
for any single product or product line. Thus a common agreement might
permit a firm to increase the average of all of its prices by 1.5 percent but
not to increase any single price by more than 8 percent; many firms found
this latter rule the most restrictive. The rationale of the TLP system was
that, in exchange for flexibility and relief from red tape, firms would agree
to smaller price increases than they might have been able to justify by costs
on a case-by-case basis.
5. The Price Commission usually did not recognize, for purposes of price
determination, labor cost increases in excess of 5j/i percent, even though
these might have been approved by the Pay Board.
6. Even if otherwise justified, price increases were not permitted where
the firm's profit margin (profits as a percentage of sales) exceeded the
average profit margin of the best 2 of the 3 fiscal years preceding August 15,
1971. The main purpose of this rule was to provide a safeguard against
the unavoidable difficulties of estimating unit costs in advance, or even
checking them after the fact, especially for multiproduct firms. In this situation there might be a tendency for firms to overestimate their costs, and
effective monitoring would be impossible. The profit-margin test provided
a simple means of limiting any slippage resulting from imperfect application of the other tests. It did not apply to a firm which had not raised
its prices above the levels of the base period, usually defined as the 30 days
preceding the freeze of August 15,1971.
THE FIRM-BY-FIRM APPROACH
An important and unusual feature of the 1971-72 price-wage control
system is that the unit of control was the firm, or in some cases the collective bargaining unit, rather than the product or occupation. That is, the




149

Price Commission did not set a price ceiling for each covered product—
men's white button-down shirts of certain specifications, for example—
which applied to all sellers of that product. Instead it laid down rules for
determining the ceiling price of each product sold by a particular firm—or,
where the TLP applied, the average price of all the products sold by that
firm.
This system had the great advantage that each firm could compute its
permissible prices for itself from information available in its own accounts,
aside from the sector productivity factor published by the Price Commission
and the overall TLP terms, which were applicable to a relatively small
number of firms. Firms did not have to wait for price determinations by
the control agency, although the larger firms had to have approval of their
calculations. This do-it-yourself approach to price control was the only way
to get the system into operation quickly and then keep it in operation without a large Government staff to determine the ceilings. Moreover, it gave
recognition to differences among products and firms that the market recognized but that could hardly be taken into account in price-control regulations.
On the other hand, the firm-by-firm approach contained a number of
actual or potential difficulties. Customers and enforcement officers were unable to tell what a firm's ceiling price was without study of the firm's books.
In some cases it froze a price relation among firms which for some transitory
reason existed in the base period but which would be unfair or inefficient
if continued for long. Since, with some exceptions, a firm's ceiling prices
would depend on its own costs, the pressure to hold down costs would be
weakened. If the product in question were scarce, a situation might emerge
in which it carried different prices simultaneously in the market, and which
created problems of fairness and efficiency in allocation. These difficulties
were not expected to become pervasive, however, as long as excess demand
and shortages were not common and as long as the controls were considered
to be temporary. Competition would tend to establish a one-price system,
even if ceiling prices differed among firms; for that reason, and also out of
regard for what would happen when controls ended, companies could not be
complacent about increases in their costs.
The application of the pay standards on a firm-by-firm basis or on the
basis of individual bargaining units could raise similar problems. However,
the factors determining permissible pay increases were more uniform among
firms than the factors determining permissible price increases, and they were
less likely to produce distortions. Moreover, the standards of the Pay Board
made more explicit provision for preserving customary relations among
groups of employees.
COVERAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
The Phase II program was initially very comprehensive in its coverage,
measured either by the number of economic units or by the proportions of



150

the value of output and income to which it applied. During 1972 the number of economic units covered was substantially reduced, but the proportion
of the value of output covered remained large.
The system applied directly to the prices of goods and services, including
residential rents, and to employee compensation, including the compensation of executives. It applied indirectly to profit rates through the control
of the relation between costs and prices and through the profit-margin rule,
and it applied to rental income on residential property in the same way.
Interest rates and dividends were the object of a voluntary restraint program.
The most important exempt sector was agriculture (defined to include
fisheries and forests). Initially farm products were exempt at all stages of
distribution as long as they were unprocessed. Thus lettuce in a retail store
was exempt from price control. In June the exemption was narrowed to
only the first sale at the farm. However, since the percent increase in farm
prices for all types of products could be passed through at the subsequent
stages, this modification amounted to control of the processing and distribution margins rather than control of the farm prices.
Farm product prices were exempted because they did not conform to
the pattern upon which the controls system was based. The theory of the
controls system was that the price increases to which it was directed, both
occurring and in prospect, were not "equilibrating"; that is, they were not
price increases necessary to elicit more production or to distribute a short
supply. In fact, in many cases where supply could be quickly expanded, there
would be more demanded and therefore produced if prices did not rise. These
price increases could therefore be repressed without creating shortages. Farm
prices, however, are determined in highly competitive markets, and they
adjust continually to equate the quantities demanded and supplied. To
repress the price increases in those markets would create shortages and
rather than increase supply would probably reduce it. Similar reasoning
justified exemption of market interest rates, prices of financial assets, and
prices of imports. Prices of exports were exempted because they did not
enter into the price level confronting American consumers.
Pay scales of the Federal Government and prices charged by it were
exempted with the understanding that other means would be used to keep
these wages and prices consistent with the goals of the stabilization program. A number of less important categories were exempted for administrative reasons.
Within the controlled area, firms and bargaining units were divided for
purposes of administration into three categories or tiers on the basis of size
(Table 32). Although the same standards of price and wage behavior
applied on all tiers, the large economic units were subjected to closer surveillance than the smaller ones, but not because the large units were believed
likely to be more "inflationary" than small ones. There were two main reasons
for this decision. First, an administrative staff of a given size could observe
a given volume of economic activity more effectively by watching a few




151

large companies than by watching many small ones. Second, close scrutiny
of a part of the market was believed likely to yield better control than loose
scrutiny of all of it, the reasoning being that the behavior of the closely
watched part would discipline the behavior of the others because of competitive pressures.

The largest firms, those in Tier I, were required to notify the Price Commission in advance and to get approval of any price increase unless they
had previously obtained a term limit pricing agreement or some other
special provision, such as a volatile price rule. The firms in Tier II were not
required to obtain advance approval unless they sought an exception from
the rules; but they were required to file quarterly reports, which were
prescribed by the Price Commission and from which compliance could be
checked. Tier III firms were not required to file reports, but their compliance was open to spot check by the Internal Revenue Service.
The procedures relating to pay were similar to those governing prices.
Small business exemptions. Despite the tier arrangement described above,
it became clear almost as soon as Phase II began that a disproportionate
part of the administrative capacity of the system was being used to provide
information and to process complaints in cases that had little effect on the
inflation problem. The Cost of Living Council decided that it could use
its resources better by concentrating them on the larger economic units,
relying on competition from them to restrain price increases by the smaller
ones. In January retail firms with annual sales of less than $100,000 were
exempted. This action removed from control three-fourths of all retail firms
but only 15 percent of all retail sales. At the same time the Cost of Living
Council exempted from rent controls all apartments or houses whose landlord owned four or fewer units. Apartments renting for $500 or more a
month were also exempted, but on a different ground—namely, that keeping down the rents of luxury apartments was not so urgent a national interest
as to justify the administrative burdens it involved. The effect of these
actions was to exempt from control about 45 percent of all rental units.



152

In May the Cost of Living Council exempted from both price and wage
controls all firms and local government units with 60 or fewer employees—
with certain exceptions. The exceptions were firms in the construction and
health service industries and firms in which more than half of the employees
were affected by a collective bargaining contract which covered more than
60 employees. The selection of 60 as the cutoff point was influenced by the
desire to exempt as many firms as possible but at the same time to keep
a significant fraction of the sales of each industry under control.
Administration and compliance. The relatively small staff of the economic
stabilization agencies had the twofold task of informing the public of the rules
and regulations and of developing procedures for ensuring compliance. The
staff was also responsible for processing inquiries, requests for approval of
price and wage increases, complaints alleging violations, applications for
exceptions and exemptions, and appeals for review of decisions. At the end
of 1972 there had been 3.3 million direct contacts with the public. Of
these 95 percent were inquiries, 58 percent of which referred to rents,
with questions on prices and wages making up the remainder in equal proportions. More than 10,000 prenotifications of price increases by larger Tier I
firms were received, many necessitating detailed Price Commission analyses
and lengthy meetings with company representatives. Notification of many
wage increases negotiated by larger employee units numbering more than
1,000 workers also required review procedures by the Pay Board.
The major burden of responding to inquiries, complaints, and requests
for exceptions fell on the seven regional offices and 360 district and subdistrict offices of the Internal Revenue Service. As the program matured
and guidelines and decision precedents became established, more authority
for decision making was delegated to these field offices, particularly in
administering price and rent controls.
Reliance primarily on voluntary compliance, adopted at the beginning of
the Economic Stabilization Program, was maintained through 1972. The
Internal Revenue Service did, however, conduct numerous investigations
based on citizens' complaints, in addition to the more than 800 investigations
carried out at the direction of ESP officials. Most potential violations were
handled through price rollbacks rather than legal action. Administrative
sanctions ordinarily required firms to refund or reduce prices in amounts
sufficient to offset the dollar amount of the apparent excess profit margin,
or in the amount of revenue derived from the price increases, whichever
was smaller. However, double or treble price reductions and refunds were
sometimes required. In exceptional cases, legal action was initiated. About
300 such actions were undertaken in the first year of Phase II.
SUPPLEMENTARY ANTI-INFLATION MEASURES
As 1972 progressed, rapidly rising prices of food, especially meat, became
a more and more critical problem for the controls program. Partly because
food prices weigh heavily in the public's perception of what is happening



153

to living costs, the higher food prices were threatening to weaken public
confidence in the program.
The control system could not satisfactorily restrain the increase of food
prices. Prices at the farm level were exempted; and although controls were
repeatedly considered during 1972, they were always rejected on the
ground that such controls would cause shortages immediately and discourage
the expansion of supplies for the future.
A large part, about two-thirds, of the value of food is added in processing
and distribution after the products leave the farm. The price or margin at
these stages was controlled; but sometimes the controls left room for increasing margins, and from time to time the Cost of Living Council made special
appeals to food processors and distributors to hold margins down. The Internal Revenue Service also concentrated on assuring compliance with the
controls in food processing and marketing.
However, over the Phase II period, competition, controls, and voluntary
cooperation successfully constrained the margin between food prices at the
farm and food prices at retail. According to Department of Agriculture
estimates, this margin increased by only 0.6 percent from the third quarter
of 1971 to the third quarter of 1972. In the same period the farm price of
domestically produced farm foods increased by 11.7 percent, while retail
food prices increased by 4.9 percent.
Rising food prices, and the inability of price controls to curb them, focused
attention on the range of other measures available to Government which
could restrain the rise of food costs. In general, five measures were applied
which operated to increase supplies, either immediately or in the longer run.
1. In June limitations on the import of meat were suspended for 1972. In
December this suspension was continued into 1973.
2. Government-controlled stocks of meat and grains were reduced.
3. Export subsidies for wheat and rice were discontinued; this action
eliminated an artificial incentive to export that was reducing domestic
supplies.
4. Limits on the planting of wheat, rice, feed grains, and soybeans in 1973
were eased.
5. Import quotas on nonfat dry milk were increased temporarily at the
beginning of 1973.
In addition to foods, two other commodity areas, lumber and hides, registered substantially higher prices despite the controls. In both cases the
Administration tried to curb price increases by special measures. Steps were
taken to increase timber cutting in the national forests and to enforce the
control regulations more strictly on lumber sales. The Department of Commerce imposed a limit on the export of hides in order to increase the domestic
supply, a move that was soon overturned, however, by congressional action.




154

SUPPLEMENT T O CHAPTER 4
In order to answer the question whether the occupational distribution
of women has moved closer to that of men's, an index of occupational
dissimilarity was constructed for 1960 and 1970. The particular measure
of dissimilarity used here is calculated by taking the absolute difference
(for each of 197 occupations) between the percentage of the female experienced civilian labor force in a given occupation and the percentage
of the male experienced civilian labor force in the same occupation, summing these differences across the 197 occupations, and then dividing this
sum by 2. Those persons in the experienced labor force who did not report
their occupation were excluded from the denominator. If men and women
were to have the identical occupational distributions then the value of the
index would be 0. At the other extreme, if men and women were completely
occupationally segregated, so that they were never in the same occupation,
the index would have a value of 1.
The values of the occupational dissimilarity index, calculated as described,
were as follows:
1960
. 629
1970
. 598
The index therefore indicates a very small change in the direction of
increased occupational similarity between 1960 and 1970. The data for
the calculations were taken from the decennial censuses of 1960 and 1970.
In Table 33, women's representation in a group of detailed occupations
is given for 1950, 1960, and 1970.

SUPPLEMENT TO CHAPTER 5
The following memorandum elaborates the United States proposal for
establishing a system in which nations' reserve movements would serve as
quantitative indicators to guide the balance-of-payments adjustment process. The basic U.S. proposal was contained in an address by Secretary of
the Treasury Shultz at the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary
Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, September 26, 1972. The memorandum was made available to the Deputies
of the Committee of Twenty in November 1972.
THE U.S. PROPOSALS FOR USING RESERVES AS AN INDICATOR
OF THE NEED FOR BALANCE-OF-PAYMENTS ADJUSTMENT
I. INTRODUCTION
1. There appears to be general agreement that a reformed international
monetary system should promote prompter and more effective adjustment
of balance-of-payments disequilibria. The U.S. proposals are based on the
premise that each country will be willing to work within the context of a
system that provides strong, equitable and balanced incentives to achieve
and maintain external balance.
2. In the U.S. view, the most promising approach is a system in which
disproportionate changes in a nation's reserves in either direction serve as
objective indicators that balance-of-payments adjustment measures are
needed. We visualize a system in which disproportionately large gains in
reserves for a particular country indicate the need for adjustment measures
to eliminate a balance-of-payments surplus, just as, in any system of convertibility into reserve assets, disproportionately large losses of reserves indicate the need for adjustment to eliminate a balance-of-payments deficit. A
variety of adjustment instruments would be acceptable. The purpose of this
paper is to develop the logic of this approach.
3. The international monetary system in past years has failed to provide
adequate inducements to achieve and maintain balance-of-payments equilibrium, defined as a situation in which external payments are in reasonable
balance at normal levels of employment and economic activity, and without
inappropriate utilization of controls. This failure was reflected in both large
and persistent imbalances, and in recent years in some tendency toward increased use of controls. Deficit countries could often maintain disequilibria




160

for a considerable period through measures distorting trade, capital flows, or
the internal economy; they were usually permitted or even encouraged to
borrow extensively. (In the case of the United States, this "borrowing" in
large part took the form of increased holdings by foreign monetary authorities of U.S. dollar obligations.) Surplus countries, able to accumulate reserves more or less indefinitely, felt under even less pressure to adjust, and an
increasingly common response has been controls on the inward flow of
capital.
4. Viewed from the perspective of a single country—particularly a country in a relatively advanced stage of development—balance-of-payments surpluses have been considered a more comfortable and more desirable state
of affairs than deficit or balance. A surplus country could avoid the politically embarrassing adjustment actions which a deficit country might be
forced to take. A strong trading position was frequently considered a vehicle
for domestic economic expansion and maintenance of full employment. A
persistently strong currency and large reserves might be felt to provide useful
protection against unexpected external influences, and even to symbolize
prudent economic management. Prior to the introduction of the SDR
scheme, the system depended on balance-of-payments disequilibrium for
growth in reserves—growth in global reserves over time could be accomplished only as other countries ran surpluses offset by U.S. deficits,
financed through an expansion of U.S. liabilities.
5. Some of these incentives to run surpluses were recognized in the discussion leading up to Bretton Woods, and they were reflected in the strictures
placed on competitive devaluation. Nevertheless, while overt competitive devaluations have not been important, many countries still more or less consciously have aimed for payments surpluses and adapted their economic
policy instruments to that end. At the very least, surpluses were tolerated
while deficits were a source of concern and action. There was nothing in the
system to assure compatibility of nations' balance-of-payments objectives—
nothing to assure that the surpluses which many countries sought would be
offset by targeted deficits in equal amounts on the part of other countries.
6. Within this general context, there were systematic tendencies for surpluses and deficits to fall in a particular pattern. From the viewpoint of the
United States, as the largest unit in the world economic system and in
important ways in the least flexible position, these pressures toward surplus
and currency undervaluation by others have had their counterpart in a
persistent deficit in its own accounts. It was long felt inappropriate, in the
light of the disturbing implications for stability in world financial markets,
for the United States to initiate exchange rate action to correct this deficit.
When the imbalance increased substantially and such action was undertaken, the resistance by its trading partners seemed to confirm their reluctance to lose a surplus position, as well as to demonstrate the difficulty of
achieving the needed adjustment in the absence of agreed criteria for reconciling balance-of-payments objectives. From the viewpoint of some other



161

countries, the mechanism that permitted the chronic U.S. deficit and their
surpluses to persist—namely, the tendency for that imbalance to be financed,
in part, by increased dollar holdings of other countries—indicated that the
United States was not subject to the usual constraints of a deficit country.
In concept, the introduction of the SDR successfully freed the system of
the need for continuous U.S. deficits to meet reserve needs. But by itself
that reform was not sufficient to change the basic bias in the system.
7. While the system operated satisfactorily for a number of years—in
fact it may have been preferable to any realistic alternative—it was a system of continuous imbalance, of protracted disequilibrium. From the viewpoint of both the U.S. and other nations, the results were increasingly
unsatisfactory, creating major stresses that undermined stability. The system failed, in the end, because it depended on a measure of broad equilibrium for sustained, satisfactory operation, yet failed to induce the
adjustments required to achieve equilibrium. The actions taken by the
United States on August 15, 1971, signaled the untenability of the previously
existing arrangements. The interim arrangements developed since that time,
including the Smithsonian Agreement of December 1971, do not provide a
long-term solution to these problems.
8. The U.S. proposals for a future system are designed to encourage
equilibrium by promoting needed adjustments actively, rather than simply
prohibiting unwarranted moves; and to apply equivalent incentives for
adjustment evenhandedly to all nations. The proposals are evolutionary, in
the sense that they would build on certain areas of widespread agreement
incorporated in past arrangements: the SDR, convertibility, the prohibition
on competitive devaluation, and emphasis on the need for international
financial arrangements to support liberal trade and payments. They would
differ from the past in building these and other elements of the system into
arrangements for actively promoting adjustment, reconciling balance-of-payments objectives, and overcoming the systematic bias toward surpluses.
II. THE NEED FOR OBJECTIVE CRITERIA
9. The U.S. proposals take as a point of departure that the stability and
durability of a new monetary system will be crucially dependent on finding
an equitable and effective means of promoting the adjustment of external
imbalances.
10. In approaching that objective, we believe success is dependent upon
finding an appropriate blend among three possible approaches, each of
which contains some advantages, but none of which is satisfactory by itself.
The three approaches are:
a) national discretion—a degree of which is essential in a world of
sovereign nations and desirable in allowing maximum practicable
freedom of action among individual countries, but which, relied on
alone, assures neither equilibrium nor an equitable sharing of adjustment responsibilities;



162

b) discretionary authority of a central institution—which can bring
to bear the influence and collective wisdom of the entire world
community on particular adjustment problems, but which can
lead to endless debate, indecision, or unbalanced decisions in a
potentially politically charged atmosphere, and which requires at
least the appearance of ceding more authority to an international
body than nations will yield at this stage of international development;
c) objective criteria—which can be helpful in establishing measurements for indicating adjustment needs for various nations and
various situations on a standardized basis, but which do not unerringly point to appropriate adjustments or permit needed discretion by national authorites.
11. The U.S. proposal aims at a balance among these approaches—to
utilize the advantages of each, while avoiding the disadvantages which
might result from excessive or singleminded reliance on any of the three.
We propose that objective criteria be established to note and locate the
existence of an undesirable degree of balance-of-payments disequilibrium,
and to create a strong presumption that effective adjustment policies should
be implemented. But we would leave to the country concerned substantial
discretion in determining the composition of those adjustment policies. And
international consultations would be utilized to determine the applicability
of the criteria to particular situations and to consider exceptional cases in
which the rules might be overridden.
12. Use of objective indicators as an important element of the adjustment
mechanism appears essential on grounds of efficacy and equity. Adjustment decisions are frequently difficult for any government, and there is a
tendency to postpone and avoid such decisions until long after the time
when adjustment policies should have been adopted. Equally, international
groups are reluctant to deal promptly with difficult and politically sensitive
adjustment questions. Without objective indicators there is a danger that
needed actions will not be taken. It is much better to get advance agreement
in principle that when certain internationally agreed indicators, recognized as being objective, signal adjustment is needed, there will be a strong
presumption that appropriate measures will be adopted—but recognizing
there might be valid reasons for overriding the indicators in exceptional
cases. Such an approach is much more likely to result in equal treatment
for all nations: it would call for comparable adjustment inducements for
all countries—whether large or small, developed or developing, reserve
currency country or not—to eliminate payments disequilibria, whether surplus or deficit.
III. ADJUSTMENT, RESERVES, AND CONVERTIBILITY
13. The U.S. proposals assume that most nations will want to maintain
established values for their exchange rates—par values or central rates—



163

in conjunction with a generalized system of convertibility of national currencies into international reserve assets. In a system of established exchange
values and convertibility, there is a close relationship between balance-ofpayments disequilibria and reserve changes. Accordingly, in our view the
single most valid indicator that a country is in actual or emerging disequilibrium—as well as the most readily available, the most comprehensive, and
the least ambiguous—is a persistent movement of its reserves in one direction or another.
14. To be viable, a convertibility system must be capable of satisfying the
sum of individual countries' normal needs for and secular growth in reserves. Nations individually, either explicitly through formulation of overt
balance-of-payments objectives, or more implicitly through their behavior,
express an effective demand for reserves. Unless the international monetary
system is capable of meeting these national demands in the aggregate and
changing the level of reserves to meet changes in such needs over time, a
satisfactory reconciliation of national balance-of-payments aims, and therefore sustained balance-of-payments equilibrium, cannot be assured. For if
reserves are not adequate to these demands in the aggregate, nations are incapable by definition of reaching their desired reserve positions simultaneously. A decision to provide the system with too few reserves induces—and
sanctions—a destabilizing and ultimately fruitless competition for scarce
reserves. Creation of too many reserves pushes too great a share of the adjustment pressures onto surplus countries and facilitates world inflation.
15. A critical defect of the system in the past was that while it tried to
promise unlimited convertibility, and while fundamentally it required a broad
measure of balance-of-payments equilibrium for sustained operation, it did
not provide the supply of acceptable reserve assets or the discipline on adjustment policies necessary to achieve these objectives. A basic feature of
the U.S. proposal is that nations must, through the process of negotiation,
reach a collective decision on the appropriate normal stock and rate of increase of reserves, and be prepared to accept the consequences of that decision in terms of their own individual reserve positions and their own
freedom of action to run surpluses or deficits.
16. It would be essential in the proposed system that countries regard their
balance-of-payments disequilibria, whether surplus or deficit, as a source of
concern before the agreed indicators came into play. In other words, countries would not be expected to ignore imbalances blithely until their disequilibria had become so extreme as to prompt strong international concern
through the indicator mechanism. Reserve fluctuations would signal emerging disequilibria; movement to outer indicators signalling strong international concern would occur only when countries failed to make the appropriate responses as the disequilibria built up.
17. Convertibility itself cannot promote adequate or equitable adjustment. Convertibility is in that sense an asymmetrical tool, operating only
on deficit countries. In the framework of the U.S. proposal, the inherent



164

link of convertibility to reserve fluctuations would result in broadly symmetrical pressures upon surplus and deficit nations.
18. In short, the logic of the U.S. proposals is that a) better balance-ofpayments adjustment is required and is essential to the maintenance of a
convertibility system; b) such an adjustment process, in turn, requires recognition by both surplus and deficit countries of their obligations and responsibilities to take action; c) in that context, objective indicators of the need
for adjustment are essential; d) a broad equality between the availabiliy of,
and demands for, reserves in the system must be satisfied; and e) all of these
needs can be brought together, in the context of a system of established exchange rates supported by convertibility, by the use of reserve movements
as the main indicator of the need for adjustment.
IV. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT/RESERVE/CONVERTIBILITY SYSTEM
19. These principles could be incorporated into several alternative operational frameworks. Such alternative formulations could, for example, (a)
emphasize the use of net or gross reserves as the basis for measuring fluctuations in reserves; (b) focus attention largely on changes in resei yes from an
existing starting level or on an appropriate distribution of individual countries5 reserves in relation to some "objective" standard; and (c) provide for
either relatively narrow or relatively wide ranges of fluctuation in reserves
before international disciplines come into play. While the underlying principles and logic of the various approaches would be broadly similar, the particular formulation chosen would determine the speed, force and manner
with which the adjustment pressures would operate. For its part, the United
States wishes to continue to examine the advantages and disadvantages of
the alternatives with care, and would welcome the contribution toward this
effort that others can make.
20. The use of fluctuations in countries' reserves as the main indicator of
adjustment need requires a judgment about a "base" level and trend of reserves for each country. Abstracting from transitional problems (noted
later), these "base levels" could be established in several different ways. For
instance, the distributional pattern of national quotas in the IMF (allowing
for any agreed revisions in the future) might represent one approach toward
determining a broadly acceptable distribution of reserves in normal circumstances. Another approach would be to give heavy weight to the actual
level of reserves at the start of the system for the majority of countries, relying on separate negotiations for those countries whose reserves at the start
of the system were judged to be seriously excessive or inadequate. Countries'
"base levels," in any case, would be expected to rise over time, consistent
with collective decisions about world SDR creation. The manner in which
"base levels" should be calculated would clearly be a matter for careful ne-




165

gotiation. What is necessary is that some pattern be accepted that is generally
satisfactory.
21. Use of reserve fluctuations to achieve an evenhanded stimulus to adjustment will require a broad consistency between the total of established
"base levels" for individual countries and the actual supply of reserves in the
system as a whole. Conceptually, in a system which did not provide for reserve currencies, this need could be met simply by assuring that the aggregate of gold, SDR's and IMF positions—that is, "primary reserves"—equaled
the aggregate of countries' "base levels" of reserves. If in such a system aggregate "base levels" were above total primary reserves, a destabilizing and
potentially deflationary competition for reserves could result; if "base levels"
were below the total of primary assets, too large a share of adjustment pressures would be shifted toward surplus countries and world inflation might be
facilitated.
22. In practice, we assume that some nations will wish to hold foreign
exchange in their reserves and should be permitted to do so. Some nations
will want flexibility of reserve management, and the system as a whole will
benefit from an ability to respond flexibly to sudden and reversible increases
in the need for liquidity during periods of strain related to speculative or
other factors. Thus, in structuring the proposed system consideration will
need to be given to the complication introduced by the existence of a possibly fluctuating margin of foreign exchange holdings. In a convertibility
system, foreign exchange holdings are potential claims on primary reserves.
Consequently, a stable system must provide enough primary reserves in
relation to the whole to meet reasonable demands for conversion of these
potential convertibility claims and/or must limit demands for conversion
by individual countries that would otherwise claim an excessive proportion
of the available supply of primary reserves.
23. There are a number of complementary approaches which could reconcile the existence of foreign exchange holdings in reserves with the
stability and evenhanded working of a system of reserve indicators. One
approach would be to equate the aggregate of "base levels" with the total
of primary reserves and provide limits on the disproportionate accumulation of primary reserves by a country above its base level. Some assurance
against excessive claims for primary reserves growing out of past accumulation of foreign exchange could also be provided by arrangements providing
for bilateral or multilateral funding of existing foreign exchange reserves to
the extent the holder wished to fund such balances, or by a facility for
exchange of such balances—initially or over time—into SDR's. These aspects of the question should receive careful study, but are not further considered here.
24. Under a reserve-indicator system, certain points would be established
above and below each country's base level to guide the adjustment process
and to assure even-handed convertibility disciplines. Such points would be
set according to uniform procedures for each country, and could be de


166

scribed as follows, again abstracting from special arrangements that would
be appropriate during a transitional period. (See Chart 13.)
a) A "low point" would be set at some point below the "base level."
In concept, this might approximate a level of reserves considered
to be close to the minimum level ordinarily necessary to maintain
confidence and to guard against extreme emergencies. If a country's
reserves fell below its "low point" for a period of time, definite
adjustment pressures would be anticipated and acceptable adjustment measures would be expected. In the absence of adequate policies over a specified period, international sanctions—for example,
refusal to provide credit, or loss of scheduled SDR allocations—
might become effective. Such sanctions would be avoided only if
the IMF, through approval of a satisfactory program of adjustment, made a finding that sanctions were not warranted. Negotiated credits to deficit countries would ordinarily be permitted—
but excessive or prolonged borrowing to circumvent the indicators
would not be allowed.
b) A "lower warning point" would be set at a point between a country's
"base level" and the "low point." Small devaluations would be freely
permitted a country at any time its reserves were below its base
level. Proposals for larger devaluations would always require IMF
approval; such proposals would not ordinarily be looked upon with
favor unless a country's reserves had fallen below its "lower warning
point."
c) An "outer point" would be established above a country's "base
level." As a country moved toward its "outer point," it would be
expected to apply adjustment measures of progressive intensity. If
reserves rose to the "outer point," remained at or above that level
for a specified period, and an adequate program of adjustment were
not in place, international action to induce adjustment would take
effect. For example, the IMF might authorize other countries to
impose general import taxes or surcharges against the country concerned, there might be a loss of scheduled SDR allocations, or there
might be a tax on the country's excess reserve holdings with proceeds to go to development assistance. Such sanctions could be
avoided, or postponed, only if the IMF made a positive finding they
were not warranted, on the basis of an agreed program of adjustment—involving, for example, major moves toward liberalization of
import restrictions, removal of any controls on the outward flow
of capital, provision of concessional untied aid, or revaluation.
Standards should be developed for judging the adequacy of such
programs and their consistency with progress toward a liberal world
economic order. If reserve gains persisted despite the agreed program, authorization for sanctions would, after a further period, take

effect. In any event, the IMF would review the country's position
periodically, and make such recommendations and authorizations
as it deemed appropriate.
d) An "upper warning point" would be set between the "base level"
and the "outer point," analogous to the lower warning point, representing an international judgment that adjustment is called for. The
IMF would be expected to report on the country's balance-of-payments position and prospects, and revaluation or other adjustment
measures would be anticipated.
e) Depending on the volume of total reserves relative to primary reserves in the system, this "upper warning point" might coincide with
a "convertibility point" representing the maximum accumulation
of primary reserves for each country that would be justified, consistent with the level of aggregate primary reserves in the entire system, for the convertibility mechanism to operate equitably with
respect to both deficit and surplus countries. Both to provide an
incentive for adjustment, and to prevent countries from placing further convertibility pressures on others, a country reaching such a




168

"convertibility point" would be unable to acquire additional primary reserves, through either purchase or SDR allocation.
25. A reserve-indicator system such as the one sketched above should be
supplemented and elaborated by consultative procedures within the IMF
concerning adjustment programs and problems. For such procedures to be
effective, national policy officials at a politically responsive level should be
drawn into the process. Such IMF review could take into account supplementary criteria in considering the nature and magnitude of any need for
adjustment.
26. Countries would not be expected to delay adjustment action until
they had reached the indicator points. The purpose of a reserve-indicator
system is to provide strong incentives for countries to act in limited steps,
using a variety of tools suited to their circumstances before their situation
becomes so urgent as to involve international concern and action. Moreover,
while countries would at given points be brought under overt international
pressure for adjustment, they would still have a range of policy options at
their disposal. The range of "acceptable adjustment measures" for the system would, however, be limited to those consistent with market mechanisms
and a liberal world trade and payments order. Exchange rate changes are
not seen as the only, or necessarily the most desirable, means of adjustment
in all cases.
27. Even though the aim of the system is to promote equilibrium, some
scope for fluctuation in reserves is obviously necessary and desirable. No
workable system can or should try to assure lock-step economic performance
from 124 nations differing greatly in size, stage of development, and economic circumstance. Through the process of negotiation, an international
consensus should be reached in defining the indicator points so as to get
"enough" elbow room for some fluctuation in reserves to meet transitory
payments imbalances, but not "so much" that adjustment is inappropriately
delayed.
28. The reserve-indicator system should be designed to permit countries
maximum flexibility to the extent compatible with maintaining the system's
basic principles:
a) As noted, a small devaluation without requirement for approval
might be permitted at any time a country's reserves were below base
level. Small revaluations might be permitted at any time. While in
practice, situations would seldom, if ever, arise for withholding
international approval from larger revaluations, restraint will continue to be necessary to guard against competitive devaluation.
b) A country could opt for a transitional float, under agreed rules, in
lieu of a discrete exchange rate change. If it intended to reestablish and maintain a central value for its currency within a given
period, a reserve-deficient country could be permitted, under suitable guidelines, to increase its reserves toward its base level. If a
country's reserves were above its base level at the time of initia


169

tion of the transitional float, it would not be permitted further
reserve accumulation.
c) A country could depart from the regime of established parities to
float for a period of indefinite duration but only if it adhered to
internationally agreed standards that would assure the consistency
of its actions with the basic requirements of a cooperative order.
These standards would relate, for example, to movements in its
reserves, its intervention policies, elimination of controls on the
inward flow of capital, avoidance of restrictive trade controls imposed for balance-of-payments purposes and elimination of any
existing extraordinary balance-of-payments measures. Exchange rate
systems nominally establishing a central or par value but envisaging
very frequent changes such as those now in force in some less developed countries, could be integrated with this rule.
d) Any group of countries in the process of forming a monetary
union—with an implicit high degree of political and economic integration—could choose to operate as a unit. In this instance, the
relevant criteria would be applied to the unit as a whole, which
would be expected to speak with one voice in international forums.
The reserve norms for the unit would have to be recalculated to
reflect external trade and appropriate treatment of intra-unit assets.
e) On a selective basis, consideration should be given to special arrangements for exclusion from reserves, and thus from measurements of adjustment need, of an "investment fund" of foreign
securities or other foreign assets held by official agencies. Such funds
might be appropriate for selected countries that wanted to hold
over a prolonged period of time within official accounts (or with
official inducements), foreign assets for long-term investment purposes. Such countries could be asked to observe certain criteria with
respect to term, size and nature of the holdings. Oil producing
countries with relatively large external assets would be candidates
for such arrangements.
f) Negotiated official credits (including IMF credits) should be permitted. Satisfactory procedures for the recording of such credits under the reserve-indicator system would need to be devised.
g) In general, the system should neither ban nor encourage official
holdings of foreign exchange. However, in the context of the proposed system, such holdings would presumably not loom so large
relatively as in recent years. Each country should have the right to
place limits on the further accumulation of its own currency of
issue by official institutions in any other individual country or group
of countries. Each country that chose to permit foreign official
holdings of its currency must provide reasonable and normal investment facilities for those holdings.




170

29. The United States proposal neither gives special rights to nor imposes
special obligations on any country or group of countries. It assumes a monetary system in which all countries are treated equally. All would have the
same freedom to use the full exchange rate margins permitted in the system.
All would have the same rights to allow their currencies to float, transitionally or indefinitely, under the same internationally agreed rules of
behavior and surveillance. All maintaining established values for their currencies would have the same obligation to assure convertibility of their
currencies—meaning that officially held balances of foreign currencies could
be freely presented to the issuing country for conversion into primary reserve
assets, with the choice among SDR's, reserve positions in the IMF and gold
to be made by the issuing country.
V. TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
30. At the present time there is a highly unbalanced pattern of reserves
and balance-of-^payments positions among the major industrial nations. Unquestionably there would be a need for special transitional arrangements to
put into being the system proposed by the United States. Various approaches
for dealing with these problems can be developed. For example, proposals
that have been put forward for funding, consolidating or otherwise dealing
with foreign exchange balances which holding countries may regard as excess may be particularly relevant. The U.S. has an open mind on particular
arrangements that might be proposed. We merely want to note that some
generally acceptable transitional arrangements are necessary. This transitional problem is not unique to the proposed system. Any monetary system
based upon concepts of equilibrium and convertibility will require special
measures to deal with transitional problems.
VI. SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSALS
31. Three questions which might be raised about the operational feasibility of the U.S. proposal are discussed below. These questions could arise
under any system based on reserves as an indicator of adjustment need.
Indeed, we should note comparable problems will arise, perhaps in a different form, in any par value-convertibility system, and often in more severe
form.
32. The first question is: Is it possible to define reserves so as to assure
they are useful and accurate criteria?
33. Based on reserves as the key indicator of disequilibrium and the need
for adjustment, the system proposed by the U.S. depends on clear and
reliable definitions of what constitutes both primary and total reserves, to
assure that they give the appropriate signals in a given situation and to
assure that the rules cannot be easily circumvented by artificial reserve transactions or concealment of reserves.
34. Primary reserves are more easily defined. They would consist of
SDR's, reserve positions in the IMF, and monetary gold. There would be



171

a precise and known amount of primary reserves for each nation and for the
system as a whole.
35. Primary reserves would, of course, be widely transferred among
nations for settlement purposes. Primary reserves might also be borrowed
and lent. In order to assure the consistency of the aggregate level of primary
reserves in the system with the operation of the system, appropriate rules
would need to be devised to assure against double counting of primary reserves. For example, it might be agreed that lending and borrowing should
not increase the calculated primary reserves of the borrower, nor reduce
those of the lender.
36. Definition and measurement of reserves other than primary reserves
have in the past been more complicated and more ambiguous. Possibilities
for evading the adjustment rules might arise unless there were agreement on
a suitably broad definition of what constitutes reserves. An appropriate approach to this problem would be to start from a very broad definition of
reserves—all official claims on foreigners, liquid or non-liquid, whether held
by or on behalf of the monetary authorities or by other government agencies. Exceptions would be made as appropriate. Long-term aid loans, for
example, and normal export credits would presumably be omitted; approved
"investment funds," as described above, would be excluded—though care
must be taken that such funds not be used as a subterfuge for reserve increases. At any rate, with experience in operating the system, technical discussions would probably help to refine the definitions, so as to reduce the
risks of window-dressing and make the system function as effectively as
possible.
37. The second question is: How do we deal with problems of heavy speculative capital flows?
38. Speculative problems will be a factor in any system—indeed, they
proved to be a critically important factor in the Bretton Woods system. The
system proposed by the U.S. actually contains a number of features which
should reduce the problem of speculation, as compared both with the
past and with other approaches to reform of which we are aware.
39. The proposal aims at a system which fosters balance, and prompt adjustments to restore equilibrium, through a variety of adjustment measures.
Thus, the persistent payments imbalances which in the past were a major
factor in generating massive speculative capital movements would be eliminated or sharply diminished.
40. With the system based broadly on the concept of equilibrium, it cannot be overemphasized that national behavior which is truly in the spirit
of this concept must help to assure that crisis points are not reached. The
existence of the various indicator points on reserve movements does provide
limits on disequilibria, and it is possible that movement close to those
limits could stimulate some speculative activity, just as very large reserve
gains or losses trigger speculative activity in the present system. But for
fully satisfactory operation of the system, countries should endeavor to




172

adjust their positions as the disequilibria emerge, and well before they
reach the extremes, both because of the consequences involved in reaching the limits, and because they have accepted external balance as a practical,
operative balance-of-payments objective. If a country persists in avoiding
adjustment, it will eventually—and appropriately—be subject to the disciplines of the system, including speculative pressures. Much as in the past
system, adjustment of some kind becomes unavoidable when disequilibria
become extreme. What is missing in "the past and present systems, and what
the proposed system attempts to provide, is a real incentive for needed
adjustment to occur before it is forced by crisis.
41. Also, the proposal has to be looked at in the context of a system of
adequately wide exchange rate bands, which would be expected to reduce
the prospect for large capital flows significantly.
42. Nonetheless, even with an improved adjustment system there could
still be some question of whether false signals could result from speculative
capital flows. The answer is that the proposed system contains several
important "safety valves." First, there are areas, or zones, within which
reserves can move in response to speculative or other pressures without
bringing overt international requirements for adjustment measures. Second,
there is a time factor envisaged at both the "low point" and the "outer point"
which would provide scope for speculative or other flows to occur and reverse
themselves, without bringing strong international action to induce adjustment. (This factor could also play an important role in inhibiting speculative
movements themselves.) Third, if a nation were pushed across its "outer
point" by, say, a heavy inflow of speculative capital, and remained above
that point, it need not necessarily appreciate its exchange rate—the requirement is for any "acceptable" adjustment program. Fourth, if the reserve
increment were due to capital inflows based on unfounded speculation
on an exchange rate change—and the IMF agreed that basic adjustment
was not needed—a program dealing exclusively with that problem in an
internationally acceptable manner would presumably satisfy the international
community. The international community could vote to override the reserve
indicators in a case where the signals are judged to be obviously wrong.
43. In discussing these "safety valves," however, it should be remembered
that signals are not necessarily "wrong" simply because speculative capital
flows arise—such flows may indicate a genuine need for adjustment measures. The system cannot enable nations to avoid needed adjustments simply
by blaming their problems on speculation.
44. The third question is: Aren't reserve indicators retrospective and insufficiently refined, pointing to past maladjustments rather than present or
future needs and unable to take account of the composition of the balance of
payments?
45. Reserves are more comprehensive, more reliable and more quickly
available indicators than other criteria of external balance. While reserves
may be distorted in the short run, no other single series provides a superior

u

basis for analysis. In a convertibility system, reserve data are necessarily indicative of disequilibrium in the adjustment process; this has always been understood in terms of inducements to adjust for deficit countries—and the
concept applies with equal logic to adjustment needs of surplus countries.
While other data may provide useful information affecting international
judgments of adjustment need, such data should be supplementary.
46. It would, of course, be helpful to have reliable indicators of future
economic performance. But we don't. It would be useful to know each nation's balance-of-payments position for the next year or two or three—but
the present state of the art does not provide data of such reliability that
governments can place primary reliance on them in formulating policies for
the future. Nor are governments likely to agree on any given assessment of
prospects. Attempts to rely on such projections can lead to endless disputes.
One has only to recall the discussions prior to the Smithsonian Agreement, of
prospective cyclically adjusted current account balances, to realize the opportunities for disagreement.
47. The U.S. proposal does envisage that such "supplementary criteria"
as are available should be used to assist the reserve indicators in pointing to
adjustment needs. In particular, some countries may have objectives with
respect to certain elements in their balance of payments, such as for the current account. And these elements in some cases may be considered more
stable. Since inconsistent objectives in that respect could inhibit the process
of balance-of-payments adjustment, attention to current account results and
objectives could be useful. However, in the end we will require a consistency
in the total balance-of-payments results (as reflected in reserve movements)
and primary attention to one sector of the balance of payments, however important, would not be consistent with this requirement.

ECONOMIC POLICY MAKING AND THE COUNCIL OF
ECONOMIC ADVISERS
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COUNCIL
The central responsibility of the Council is to contribute economic analysis to the solution of public policy problems that warrant the attention of the
Executive Office of the President. In the Employment Act of 1946, which
created the Council, the primary goal mandated by the Congress was "to
promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power." The
Council's major responsibility continues to be to provide the President with
analysis and recommendations directed toward reaching that goal. The
Council furnishes the President with regular reports on current economic
conditions and forecasts of the economic outlook. Economic studies contribute information for Presidential decisions on appropriate policies to
achieve greater price stability, to expand employment and economic growth,
and to reach balance in the Nation's external payments position. In 1972
particular emphasis was placed on the proper evolution of aggregate demand
management, the operation and evaluation of the price-wage control system of the Economic Stabilization Program, and the formulation of proposals for international economic reform.
The Council's role has broadened far beyond the primary goal of macroeconomic policy set forth in the Employment Act. Under the act, the Council
is also given responsibility "to appraise the various programs and activities
of the Federal Government." Experience has demonstrated that economic
analysis can be useful in dealing with many issues other than employment and
price stability. As the Council has become increasingly involved in a broader
range of subjects, its direct advisory role to the President has been expanded
to include advisory work with many departments, agencies, and offices in the
executive branch. Members of the Council's staff maintain close working relations with other agencies and assist in evaluating current programs and
developing new ones.
The Council's activities in 1972 covered a wide range of economic issues.
The Council participated in areas of emerging prominence, including the
evaluation of science policies, the development of programs to improve environmental quality, studies of productivity in the food sector, and an intensive review of the Nation's energy problems. Contributions were made to
the analysis of changes in tax regulations, social security benefits and financing, Federal credit programs and regulation of financial markets, as well as
to the formulation of agricultural programs, review of the timber supply
situation, and the evaluation of housing programs. The Council continued
to analyze the problems of certain regulated industries, particularly transportation, and examined several aspects of national growth policy. Work in
the area of human resources included a review of manpower programs and
the study of a variety of issues in health and education. In many instances
the Council provided leadership to interagency studies in these fields.



180

The problems and policies of international trade and investment continue to be a major concern of the Council. The Council helps formulate
the Administration's position on overall international trade policy, and it
also works on the resolution of specific trade problems. In 1972 the Council
contributed to decisions on meat imports, preparations for upcoming trade
legislation and negotiations, and studies of the impact of direct foreign investment and the transfer of technology abroad.
The Council also provided liaison with the President's Advisory Panel on
Timber and the Environment. The Panel is expected to submit its report
and recommendations to the President in early 1973.
In September the President announced that he had requested the Chairman to organize an Advisory Committee on the Economic Role of Women.
The Committee's purpose is to expand knowledge of the role of women in
the economy, to highlight problem areas, and to ensure that the economic
interests of women are considered in the formation of economic policy. The
first meeting of the Committee is planned for early 1973.
Early each year the President submits the Economic Report of the President to the Congress as required by the Employment Act. The Council
assumes major responsibility for preparation of this Report which, together
with the Annual Report of the Council of Economic Advisers, reviews the
progress of the economy over the past year and outlines the Administration's policies and programs to achieve the goals of the act.
POLICY COORDINATION
Much of the Council's work is performed through joint activities with
other agencies of the executive branch. The "Troika" system is the main
working group that monitors the overall performance of the economy, examines the economic outlook, and analyzes stabilization policies. It ensures
close working relationships between officials of the Treasury, the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB), and the Council. A group of senior staff
economists from all three agencies, known as T-3, conducts studies which
are submitted to a second tier composed of a Council Member, the
economist for OMB, and the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy. This group, called T-2, reviews the analysis and clears it for
consideration by the Troika, which includes the Chairman of the Council,
the Director of OMB, and the Secretary of the Treasury. The Troika meets
on a regular schedule every 2 weeks. When problems or concerns are such
that the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System joins the Troika, the group is referred to as the "Quadriad." Both the
Troika and the Quadriad meet from time to time with the President.
During 1972 the Council worked closely with the Cost of Living Council, which supervises the Economic Stabilization Program. Mr. Stein is Vice
Chairman of this group, Mrs. Whitman serves on its planning committee,
and senior staff economists are members of its senior review group and
various informal working groups.



181

The Council is active in several areas of work coordinated by the Council
on International Economic Policy and the Domestic Council. The Chairman also served as a member df the National Commission on Productivity,
the Regulations and Purchasing Review Board, the Property Review Board,
the Oil Policy Committee, the Joint Board on Fuel Supply and Transport,
and the Defense Programs Review Committee.
In addition to these relatively formal groups that provide for coordination of economic analysis and policy, the Council and the professional staff
served as members of approximately 30 other interagency working groups,
including several on the quality of Federal economic statistics.
In November 1972 the President announced a new Council on Economic
Policy, which will be chaired by George P. Shultz, the Secretary of the
Treasury. The Council of Economic Advisers will be a member of the
new Council and will participate actively in many of the working groups
that will be the main vehicle through which the new Council will function.
The Chairman and Council Members appeared before the Joint Economic
Committee (JEC) of the Congress four times during 1972. The JEC, like
the Council, was created by the Employment Act of 1946. The act requires
the JEC "to make a continuing study of matters relating to the Economic
Report" and to submit its own report and recommendations to the House
and Senate. The Council testified on the Economic Report before the JEC
on February 7 and appeared again on July 24 in connection with the
midyear review of the economy. In addition, the Chairman presented testimony with Mrs. Whitman to the JEC regarding the Economic Stabilization
Program (April 14); and he presented testimony with Mr. Solomon during
the hearings on unemployment problems (October 26). Mr. Stein also
testified before two other congressional committees in 1972: before the
House Ways and Means Committee on June 6 and September 19 in connection with raising the Federal debt ceiling and before the House Appropriations Committee on January 27 concerning the Federal budget. Mr.
Solomon testified on the relation between the Federal budget and the
economy before the Senate Appropriations Committee and the House Ways
and Means Committee on February 1.
The Council maintained an active role in the growing international
dialogue on economic policy. The Chairman heads the U.S. delegation to
the Economic Policy Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. He also serves as Vice Chairman of the
Committee. Council Members and senior staff economists attended meetings
of several different working parties of the Committee during the year. Mr.
Solomon and Mrs. Whitman head the U.S. delegations to Working Party II
on economic growth and resource allocation and Working Party IV on inflation, respectively. A new activity was initiated in March when Mr. Solomon
and two members of the staff met in Tokyo with officials of the Japanese
Economic Planning Agency to discuss economic issues of common interest.
In September a six-member delegation from Japan came to Washington



182

to continue the informal discussions. This exchange proved to be productive, and plans are being made to continue it in 1973. The Council was also
host to a delegation from the Economic Council of Romania in March
1972. The delegation was headed by Manea Manescu, Chairman of the
Economic Council and one of Romania's Vice Presidents.
PUBLIC INFORMATION
The annual Economic Report is the principal medium through which the
Council informs the public of its work and its views. It is also an important
vehicle for presenting and explaining the Administration's overall economic
policy, both domestic and international. Distribution of Reports in recent
years has averaged about 50,000 copies. The Council also assumes primary
responsibility for the monthly Economic Indicators, a publication prepared
by the Council's Statistical Office, under the supervision of Frances James.
The Joint Economic Committee issues Indicators, which has a distribution
of approximately 10,000 copies.
Information is also provided to the public through the speeches and
participation in seminars and panels by the Chairman, the Members, and
the senior staff economists throughout the year. The Council held frequent
press conferences during 1972 to comment on important economic statistics
shortly after they were released. Each year the Council answers numerous
requests from the press and provides economic information in response to
inquiries from individual citizens. In addition, the Council and staff schedule visits from business, academic, and other groups and individuals as
often as they can without interfering with other responsibilities.
ORGANIZATION AND STAFF OF THE COUNCIL
OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN
The Chairman is officially charged with reporting the Council's views to
the President under authority of the Employment Act, as amended in 1953
by Reorganization Plan No. 9. He performs this duty through direct consultations with the President, regular memoranda on the economy, and written
submissions on special issues that arise. The Chairman represents the Council at meetings of the Cabinet and in many other formal and informal contacts with Government officials.
COUNCIL MEMBERS
Together the two Council Members are responsible for all subject matter
covered by the Council, including direct supervision of the work of the
professional staff. Members represent the Council at a wide variety of
meetings and assume major responsibility for the Council's involvement in
many activities. One of the Council Members automatically becomes Acting
Chairman whenever the Chairman is absent from Washington.




183

In practice, the small size of the Council's staff permits the Chairman
and Council Members to work as a team in most circumstances. There is,
however, an informal division of subject matter between them. Mr. Solomon's areas in 1972 included domestic economic and financial conditions
and outlook; fiscal policy and monetary policy; manpower programs; taxation and social security; energy; defense; housing; and national growth
policy.
Mrs. Whitman is responsible for the analysis of international economic
developments and policy. Other areas under her supervision include price
and wage developments, particularly the Economic Stabilization Program;
human resource programs; industry studies, including agriculture and transportation; environmental programs; and issues related to regulated
industries.
PROFESSIONAL STAFF
At the end of 1972 the professional staff consisted of 13 senior staff economists, two statisticians, and eight members of the junior research staff. Members of the professional staff were responsible for economic analyses and
policy recommendations in major subject areas involving the Council's interests and responsibilities. In addition, staff economists carried out many
different Council and interagency assignments requiring a broad application of their general knowledge and analytical skills.
The professional staff and their special fields at the end of the year were:

Frances M. James, Senior Staff Statistician, continued to be in charge
of the Council's Statistical Office. Miss James has major responsibility for
managing the Council's economic and statistical information system. She
supervises the publication of Economic Indicators and the preparation of
tables and charts for the Economic Report and for a wide variety of meetings
throughout the year. She also handles the fact checking of memoranda,
testimony, and speeches. Catherine H. Furlong, Dorothy Bagovich, V. Madge
McMahon, and Natalie V. Rentfro assist Miss James.
The Council conducts a student intern program, employing a limited
number of promising graduate and undergraduate students of economics
for temporary periods, particularly during the summer months. Interns who
served during 1972 wfere Irwin L. Collier, Jr. (Yale University), Robert S.
Dohner (Harvard University), Eric B. Herr (Indiana University), Susan C.
Nelson (Princeton University), William P. Starnes (Rice University), Mary
E. Sullivan (University of Minnesota), and Michelle J. White (Princeton
University).
Each year the Council obtains the consulting services of several economists.
Consultants who provided services during 1972 included Alan Greenspan
(Townsend-Greenspan & Co.), Hendrik S. Houthakker (Harvard University) , Stephen P. Magee (University of Chicago), Thomas G. Moore (Michigan State University), and G. Paul Wonnacott (University of Maryland).
James R. Golden (U.S. Military Academy) was a member of the professional
staff during the summer.
In preparing the Economic Report, the Council relied upon the editorial
assistance of Rosannah C. Steinhoff.
SUPPORTING STAFF
The Administrative Office provides administrative support for the entire
Council staff including preparation and analysis of the Council's budget;
procurement of equipment and supplies; processing of legislative referrals;
distribution of Council speeches, reports, and congressional testimony; and
responding to correspondence and inquiries from the general public. James H.
Ayres served as Administrative Officer, assisted by Nancy F. Skidmore, Elizabeth A. Kaminski, Margaret L. Snyder, Bettye T. Siegel, and D. Carolyn



185

Fletcher. The duplicating, mail, and messenger department was operated by
James W. Gatling, Frank G. Norman, and Kharl A. Williams.
Tne secretarial staff for the Chairman and Council Members consisted of
Joyce A. Pilkerton, Mary Catherine Fibich, Alice H. Williams, Mayme Burnett, and Patricia A. Lee. Secretaries for the professional staff included
Cheryl L. Green, Dorothy L. Green, Bessie M. Lafakis, Jean P. Noll, Julie L.
Ohner, Earnestine Reid, Linda A. Reilly, and Lillie M. Sturniolo.
DEPARTURES
The Council's professional staff is drawn primarily from universities and
research institutions, and these economists normally serve for 1 or 2 years.
Senior staff economists who resigned during the year were Eric A. Hanushek
(U.S. Air Force Academy), Alan K. McAdams (Cornell University), Edward J. Mitchell (Cornell University), J. Carter Murphy (Southern
Methodist University), Mark J. Riedy (Federal Home Loan Bank Board),
Frank C. Ripley (Data Resources, Inc.), Bernard Saffran (Swarthmore
College), and James R. Wetzel (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System). A. Gilbert Heebner also resigned from the position of Special
Assistant to the Chairman to return to the Philadelphia National Bank.
Junior economists who resigned in 1972 were Ray ton Gerald, William R.
Keeton, and H. Kemble Stokes, Jr. Other resignations included Daisy S.
Babione, secretary; Evelyn D. DeZerne, research assistant; Karen J. MacFarland, secretary; Joanne M. Vinyard, research assistant; and A. Keith
Miles of the Administrative Office. Laura B. Hoffman, secretary, and
Eleanor A. McStay, secretary, retired from Federal service during 1972.

i Not seasonally adjusted.
•Data beginning with 1972 not strictly comparable with prior data because of adjustment to 1970 Census data, which
added 787,000 to the noninstitutional population, 333,000 to the civilian labor force, and 301,000 to civilian employment.
For further details, see "Employment and Earnings," February 1972.
Note.—Labor force data in Tables C-24 through C-27 are based on household interviews and relate to the calendar
week including the 12th of the month. For definitions of terms, area samples used, historical comparability of the data,
comparability with other series, etc., see "Employment and Earnings."
Seasonally adjusted data in this table have been revised and do not agree with those published beginning February
1972. They are subject to correction when the annual official revision of the series is published.

Note.—Data in Tables C-29 through C-31 are based on reports from employing establishments and relate to full- and
part-time wage and salary workers in nonagricultural establishments who worked during, or received pay for, any part of
the pay period which includes the 12th of the month.
Not comparable with labor force data (Tables C-24 through C-27), which include proprietors, self-employed persons,
domestic servants, and unpaid family workers, and which count persons as employed when they are not at work because
of industrial disputes, bad weather, etc.
For description and details of the various establishment data, see "Employment and Earnings."

* Excludes agricultural business; real estate operators; medical, legal, educational, and cultural service; and nonprofit
organizations. These figures do not agree precisely with the nonresidential fixed investment data in the gross national
product estimates, mainly because those data include investment by farmers, professionals, institutions, and real estate
firms, and certain outlays charged to current account.

Data are for last Wednesday of month (except June 30 and December 31 call dates).
Adjusted to exclude all interbank loans beginning 1948 and domestic bank loans only beginning January 1959.
Beginning January 1959, loans and investments are reported gross, without valuation reserves deducted, rather than
net of valuation reserves, as in earlier periods.
* Effective June 1966, balances accumulated for payment of personal loans (about $1.1 billion) are excluded from loans
at all commercial banks, and certain certificates of CCC and Export-Import Bank totaling about $1 billion are included in
other securities rather than in loans.
* Beginning June 1969, data include all bank-premises subsidiaries and other significant majority-owned domestic
subsidiaries; earlier data include commercial banks only.
« Beginning June 1971, Farmers Home Administration insured notes totaling about $0.7 billion are classified as other
securities rather than as loans.
7
Excludes $0.4 billion due to loan reclassification.

Note.—Year-end data through 1969 are based on "Statistics of Income" (Treasury Department), covering virtually
all corporations in the United States. "Statistics of Income" data may not be strictly comparable from year to year because
of changes in the tax laws, basis for filing returns, and processing of data for compilation purposes. All other figures shown
are estimates based on data compiled from many different sources, including data on corporations registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Estimate.
Note.—International reserves is comprised of monetary authorities' holdings of gold. Special Drawing Rights and
Reserve Positions in the International Monetary Fund, and convertible foreign exchange. Beginning December 1971
gold is valued at 38 U.S. dollars per ounce and foreign exchange balances are expressed in dollars at the cross rates reflecting parities and central rates agreed on December 17, 1971 and subsequently. Data cover all countries except
U.S.S.R., other Eastern European countries, Mainland China, and Cuba (after 1960).
Beginning 1959, when most of the major currencies of the world became convertible, data exclude known holdings of
inconvertible currencies, balances under payments agreements, and the bilateral claims arising from liquidation of the
European Payments Union.
