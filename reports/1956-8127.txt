LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL
THE WHITE HOUSE,

January 24, 1956.
To the Congress of the United States:
I am herewith presenting my Economic Report, as required by Section
3 (a) of the Employment Act of 1946.
In preparing this Report, I have had the assistance and advice of the
Council of Economic Advisers. I have also had the advice of the heads
of executive departments and independent agencies.
Since my Report is long, I present below, largely in the words of the
Report itself, what I regard as its highlights.
Recent Economic Achievements
Full employment, rising incomes, and a stable dollar have been cherished goals of our society. The practical attainment of these ideals during
1955 was the year's great economic achievement.
The past year has brought fresh witness to the basic strength and resiliency of our economy. We have broken through to new and higher ground,
and have reached the threshold of a 400 billion dollar economy.
Whether we observe economic activity at the stage of production, or
employment, or income disbursement, or consumer spending, we find evidence of progress and prosperity. The Nation's expanding income is being
shared widely. Employment and wages are at record levels. Both investment and consumer spending are going forward at a good pace. Some
groups of people have not, however, enjoyed a full measure of prosperity,
and we must keep that fact before us as we build for the future.
The Role of Government
The mainspring of our economy is to be found in the qualities of the
American people. Given free institutions and a favorable physical environment, an expanding economy is the natural fruit of the enterprise of such
a people.
Today, we believe as strongly in economic progress through free and
competitive enterprise as our fathers did, and we resent as they did any
unnecessary intrusion of Government into private affairs. But we have
also come to believe that progress need not proceed as irregularly as in
the past, and that the Federal Government has the capacity to moderate economic fluctuations without becoming a dominant factor in our
economy.




in

Our governmental policies have concentrated on building an economic
environment that favors an orderly expansion of private activities. The
Federal Government has not sought to maintain good times by expanding
our already huge governmental outlays or by permitting the value of money
to depreciate.
The Administration has sought, in cooperation with the Congress, to
discharge its responsibility through a series of closely related policies. First,
by removing direct controls over prices and wages, which had outlived
their usefulness. Second, by preserving an actively competitive environment and assisting new and small businesses. Third, by curtailing
governmental activities that could be handled as well or better by private
enterprise. Fourth, by restricting public expenditures, and yet adding to
the country's defensive strength and its stock of public assets, especially
highways, hospitals, and educational facilities. Fifth, by lightening the
burden of taxes imposed on individuals and businesses. Sixth, by extending the ties of trade and investment with other nations of the Free World.
Seventh, by tempering the impact of unemployment, old age, illness, and
blighted neighborhoods on people, yet not impairing self-reliance. Eighth,
by extending the automatic workings of our fiscal system that tend to offset or
cushion changes in income arising from changes in economic activity.
Ninth, by attacking fundamental causes of weakness in the farm situation.
Tenth, by acting promptly and resolutely when either recessionary or
inflationary influences in the general economy became evident.
To help keep our surging economy in a healthy condition the Government in 1955 held the tax line. The Federal Reserve System shifted from
a policy of active credit ease to one of moderate restraint. These policies
contributed in large degree to the achievement and maintenance of prosperity without price inflation.
Extending Prosperity
A period of general prosperity, such as we have recently been experiencing,
presents a challenge to an intelligent citizenry. We must find ways and
means of extending prosperity to the less flourishing sectors of our economy.
The position of farmers in our dynamic economy has aroused deep concern. It is imperative that we strengthen farm programs on the basis of
a realistic appraisal of the present situation.
The persisting decline in farm prices and incomes reflects a continuing
imbalance between farm output and its ultimate disposition. The imbalance and resulting huge surpluses are to be traced largely to the technological revolution in American agriculture, changing domestic demands for
farm products, the expansion of agricultural production abroad, and the
repeated extension of wartime price-support levels long after the end of
World War II.
Many parts of our agricultural policy are working well and require only
moderate changes. Together with the nine-point program built around




IV

the Soil Bank put forward in the recent Message on Agriculture, they constitute a many-sided attack on the ills that beset agriculture. There is
no easy cure for persisting surplus conditions. The programs now recommended, if framed wisely and adopted promptly, will promote the welfare
of farmers and the Nation.
The basic cause of low incomes is low productivity, irregular employment,
or both. The Government can do a great deal to help people who have
been left behind in the onrush of progress by undertaking special programs
for raising their productivity.
One of the largest groups of low-income families is in rural areas, mostly
on farms too small for efficient operation. The Rural Development Program is a soundly conceived approach to helping these farm families raise
their productivity and thereby improve their economic status. Legislation
is needed which will permit the program to be expanded in line with recommendations made last year.
To cope with chronic unemployment which has persisted in some communities, despite the attainment of practically full employment in the
Nation at large, a new Area Assistance Program is recommended.
Vocational rehabilitation, widened coverage of the Federal Old-Age and
Survivors Insurance Program, and housing needs of older people are fields
in which advances should be made.
Relatively few people are as yet protected by insurance against catastrophic illness. The pooling of risks by private carriers, or if need be
through a Federal program, would help meet this problem.
A joint Federal-State program for indemnifying flood victims on losses
to real property, business inventories,, and household effects should be
authorized.
Building for Future Prosperity
Lasting prosperity of the Nation depends far more on what individuals
do for themselves than on what the Federal Government does or can do
for them. The rate of our economic advance in the years ahead will
depend largely on our ability as a people to preserve an environment that
rewards individual initiative and encourages enterprise, innovation, and
investment.
Government can contribute to the strengthening of competitive enterprise
through monetary, fiscal, and housekeeping policies that promote high and
rising levels of economic activity; by helping small and medium-sized businesses overcome impediments to their expansion; and by vigorous measures
for preventing monopolistic practices and combinations.
For the present fiscal year a balanced budget is in prospect. Once a
budgetary surplus comes definitely into sight and economic conditions continue to be favorable, we should begin reducing our huge public debt. Such
an act of fiscal integrity would signify with unmistakable clarity that our
democracy is capable of self-discipline.




To help meet the pressing need for more schoolrooms, the Congress is
urged to authorize a program of Federal aid for school construction which,
over a five-year period, could be expected to stimulate the States and
localities to sufficiently greater efforts to remove the accumulated shortages.
The country urgently needs a modernized interstate highway system to
relieve existing congestion, to provide for the expected growth of motor
vehicle traffic, to strengthen the Nation's defenses, to reduce the toll of
human life exacted each year in highway accidents, and to promote
economic development.
The development of consumer instalment credit has been highly beneficial
to our economy. However, it sometimes accentuates movements in the buying of consumer durable goods. Although present conditions do not call
for the use of any authority to regulate the terms of instalment credit, this is
a good time for the Congress and the Executive Branch to study the problem.
Sound policies to promote the expansion of the international flow of
goods, capital, enterprise, and technology will powerfully advance our
national security and economic welfare, and help to build a stronger and
more unified community of free nations.
Early passage of legislation authorizing membership of the United States
in the Organization for Trade Cooperation and providing for further customs simplification is of high importance.
Conclusion
Foresight has helped our Nation make great strides in recent years toward
a balanced and sustained prosperity. We have succeeded in expanding the
scope of free enterprise, and yet increased the sense of security that people
need in a highly industrialized age.
Taking recent developments all together, it is reasonable to expect that
high levels of production, employment, and income will be broadly sustained
during the coming year, and that underlying conditions will remain favorable to further economic growth.
Great opportunities lie ahead for American businessmen, consumers,
workers, farmers, and investors. The recommendations of this Report
should be helpful in the realization of these opportunities.

Recent Economic Achievements

T

EN MOMENTOUS YEARS have elapsed since passage of the Employment Act. Opinions may differ concerning the economic policies
that have been pursued in this critical period in national and world
affairs. Yet there is broad agreement that the American economy has
met severe tests with considerable success, and that the Employment Act
has provided sound guidance and serviceable procedures for promoting
economic growth and stability. The past year brought fresh witness to
the basic strength and resiliency of our economy, its expansive power, and
its contribution to improving the living of Americans. As we look to the
future, there is ground for confidence that our economic progress will
continue despite occasional strains and setbacks, that means of easing
strains and moderating setbacks are at hand, and that the good times we are
now generally experiencing will be extended to sectors of the economy which
have lagged in the advance of prosperity.
I. N E W LEVELS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

Our economy has broken through to new and higher ground, which
the charts and tables of this Report delineate. We have reached the threshold of a 400 billion dollar economy, and the recent advance has been
accomplished without the specious aid of price inflation.
The rapidity of recent progress is seen most clearly in aggregate measures
of economic activity that allow for seasonal variations. The most comprehensive of these measures is the gross national product—that is, the dollar
value of the Nation's total output of commodities and services. In the second quarter of 1954 our national product was being turned out at an annual
rate of 358 billion dollars. A year later it was 385 billion, or about 7^4 percent larger. At present it is 397 billion, if not higher. The level of activity in
1953, when the rate of output was 369 billion dollars at its highest, is well
behind us.
Another comprehensive measure of economic activity is civilian employment—that is, the number of men and women, outside the Armed Forces,
who work in their own businesses or are employed by others. At the peak
of the economic expansion which culminated in July 1953, about 62.5 million men and women were at work. A year later, employment was reduced
to 61 million. Since then employment has risen rather steadily, passing

the 62 million mark in April 1955 and reaching 64.6 million in December.
Here too, even the best levels of 1953 have been surpassed.
Still another comprehensive measure of economic activity is the amount
of income disbursed to people by private industry and government. In
the second quarter of 1953, incomes were flowing to individuals at an annual
rate of slightly over 290 billion dollars. A year later, despite some contraction in economic activity, incomes were a half billion higher. The recent
expansion has brought income disbursements to an annual rate of 318 billion
dollars. This increase in dollar income during the past two to three years
has constituted a genuine addition to buying power, since average prices in
consumer markets have been virtually steady while taxes have been lower.
Moreover, the Nation's expanding income has been shared widely. For
example, the average weekly wage of manufacturing workers, exclusive of
the clerical and supervisory forces, was $79.90 last December, in contrast to
$71.50 eighteen months earlier. Farm operators on the whole have lagged
behind other groups, though many farm people are sharing in the increase of
employment opportunities off the farm. Labor income—that is, the sum of
wages, salaries, social security benefits, and related payments—amounted to
75.0 percent of the total disbursement of individual incomes during 1954.
Last year this fraction reached 75.4 percent, which is as high as it has ever
been. The share of proprietors fell correspondingly, with the brunt of the
decline borne by farm proprietors. The share of investors remained
unchanged.
With incomes generally improving, the spending of people has mounted.

nary outlays on consumption, increased from an annual rate of 248 billion
dollars in the second quarter of 1954 to 274 billion in the final quarter
of 1955. Consumers have benefited not only from the growth of the
economy, but also from the extensive shift of resources to civilian uses
that the close of hostilities in Korea and continued governmental economies made possible. While the annual rate of the Nation's total output
has increased about 28 billion dollars since the spring of 1953, the rate
of expenditure in the consumer sector has increased a full 30 billion. Thus,

television sets, and the thousand-and-one articles and services that flow
directly to consumers and enrich the everyday lives of people. At the
same time, the provision of new and improved tools of production, on
which future advances in our living standards depend, has gone forward
on an extensive scale.
Thus, whether we observe economic activity at the stage of production,
or employment, or income disbursement, or consumer spending, we find
evidence of progress and prosperity. Employment and wages are at record
levels. Profits are satisfactory in most industries. Both investment and
consumer spending are going forward at a good pace. Some groups of
people have not, however, enjoyed a full measure of prosperity, and we
shall need to keep that fact before us as we build for the future.
II. EXPANSION THROUGH FREE ENTERPRISE

Many factors have been quietly adding to the strength of our economy,
and the current expansion is fundamentally an expression of their cumulating force. Among these factors are the unexpectedly large upsurge of
population in the past decade, the continued growth of scientific knowledge,
the onrush of technology, the rapid obsolescence of what is sometimes regarded as fixed capital, the recent development of long-range investment
planning by industry, the improved control over inventories, the intensified
pace of business competition, the wide diffusion of well-being among people,
their insistent and growing desire to earn more and live better, the development of mass markets to match mass production, the rebuilding of Western
Europe, the general recognition of government's responsibility in helping to
maintain a stable prosperity, and the growing understanding that public
policy must protect economic incentives if enterprise, innovation, and investment are to flourish. All these factors are and probably will continue to be
basic to our progress, but several of them are especially noteworthy in the
current situation.
The recent expansion of our economy has occurred in an environment
of growing production and trade in the Free World. Western Europe, in
particular, has gained a level of economic well-being hitherto unknown on
the Continent. Production and incomes have been rising rapidly. Unemployment has virtually disappeared in Great Britain, and is low everywhere except in Italy. Barriers to trade and currency movements have
been reduced. Private enterprise and competitive markets are again
widely respected. These improvements in conditions abroad have reinforced our prosperity at home.
The Federal Government has played a constructive part in the prosperity
that the American people are now experiencing so widely. It has not,
however, sought to maintain good times by expanding our already huge
governmental outlays or by permitting the value of money to depreciate.
Recognizing that these alluring short cuts to a high level of economic

activity have all too often brought disaster to nations, our governmental
policies have concentrated on building an economic environment that favors
an orderly expansion of private activities.
The demands of modern life and the continuing threat of Communist
aggression require a much higher level of taxes and a larger role of Government in economic affairs than suited earlier generations. This very fact
imposes a responsibility on the Government to pursue policies that will
help to keep the private economy strong and growing. The Administration
has sought, in cooperation with the Congress, to discharge its responsibility
through a series of closely related policies. First, by removing direct controls over prices and wages, which had outlived their usefulness. Second,
by preserving an actively competitive environment and assisting new and
small businesses. Third, by curtailing governmental activities that could
be handled as well or better by private enterprise. Fourth, by restricting
public expenditures, and yet adding to the country's defensive strength and
its stock of public assets, especially highways, hospitals, and educational
facilities. Fifth, by lightening the burden of taxes imposed on individuals
and businesses. Sixth, by extending the ties of trade and investment with
other nations of the Free World. Seventh, by tempering the impact of
unemployment, old age, illness, and blighted neighborhoods on people, yet
not impairing self-reliance. Eighth, by extending the automatic workings of
our fiscal system that tend to offset or cushion changes in income arising from
changes in economic activity. Ninth, by attacking fundamental causes of
weakness in the farm situation. Tenth, by acting promptly and resolutely
when either recessionary or inflationary influences in the general economy
became evident.
By recognizing the vital importance in our times both of free enterprise
and of a sense of economic security, these directions of governmental policy
have served to enlarge the horizons of businessmen, workers, investors, and
consumers, and have stimulated people to bolder economic actions and
undertakings. This, in essence, has been the Government's role in the
recent expansion.
The expansion itself has been carried through by private citizens, who
freely applied their energies and resources to bettering themselves, their
families, and their communities. Between the second quarter of 1954 and
the last quarter of 1955, the annual rate of Federal spending on goods and
services was reduced by about 3 billion dollars. In the meantime, the rate
of consumer spending, apart from new homes, increased by 22 billion dollars,
the rate of residential construction 3 billion, the rate of business investment
13 billion, while the rate of State and local spending rose another 4 billion.
If we go back to 1953, the reduced reliance of our economy on Federal
expenditures becomes still clearer. Between the second quarter of that year
and the final quarter of 1955, the annual rate of Federal spending on goods
and services declined by 15 billion dollars, while spending by the rest of the
economic community increased by 43 billion. Thus, in the short span of

two and a half years a substantial transformation of our economy has
occurred. On an increasing scale, Americans have taken the initiative to
make jobs for one another, instead of waiting for the Federal Government
to do it for them.
This is the well-tested process that has brought enduring results throughout our history. Americans have long been noted for a combination of
characteristics that make for economic growth. These include a strong
devotion to family life; a deep-seated, widespread urge to improve one's
position, his possessions, and his children's opportunities; a drive to work
and save to these ends; steady working habits; an ambition to excel; and the
cherishing of freedom, independence, and individual initiative. To achieve
what we regard as a more abundant life, we are willing to work, plan, venture,
spend, and save, far beyond the limits that mere subsistence or comfortable
existence would require. The mainspring of our economy consists in these
qualities of the American people. Given free institutions and a favorable
physical environment, an expanding economy is the natural fruit of the
enterprise of such a people.
III.

ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN MODERATING ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS

It is essential to recognize, however, that the very qualities of Americans
which largely account for the expansive power of our economy also make
the process of growth irregular. The flow of money against goods need
not match precisely the rate at which goods leave workshops for markets.
Hence, an imbalance between production and sales is occasionally bound
to occur and give rise to inventory adjustments, which in turn may lead
to reduced spending for consumption and capital expansion. Moreover,
the confidence that generates prosperity may turn into overconfidence and
set off an inflationary boom, just as the normal caution that preserves balanced growth may degenerate into pessimism and lead to depression.
Experience with these tendencies over many years has gradually led the
American people to broaden their concept of government. Today, we
believe as strongly in economic progress through free and competitive
enterprise as our fathers did, and we resent as they did any unnecessary
intrusion of Government into private affairs. But we have also come to
believe that progress need not proceed as irregularly as in the past, and that
the Federal Government has the capacity to moderate economic fluctuations
without becoming a dominant factor in our economy.
Although governmental efforts to curb inflationary or recessionary
influences have not always proved successful, knowledge of how business
fluctuations arise and of ways of dealing with them is steadily improving.
The events of the past three years have been heartening. We have seen
that our economy can continue to grow with a minimum of instability of
employment and without any appreciable change in the value of money.
We have seen that wise and timely actions by the Government can help
sustain a healthy expansion of economic activity and prevent it from turning




10

into an inflationary boom; that soundly conceived and well-timed governmental policies, aided by private stabilizing influences, can prevent a minor
contraction from turning into a spiraling depression; and that neither direct
controls over prices and wages, nor huge public spending programs, are
needed to achieve a reasonably stable prosperity. The recent success of
governmental policies in moderating economic fluctuations, and even more
in indicating that this goal may be reached in ways that enlarge the scope of
individual enterprise, carries a promise of great significance for our own
future and that of other nations.
IV.

T H E CHALLENGE OF PROSPERITY

The underlying goal of Americans is better living in all of its aspects, not
merely indefinite increase in per capita income and possessions. The
cherished intangible components include improved health of mind and
body; more wholesome family life; availability of useful work, full-time
or part-time; lessened drudgery, severity, and monotony of labor; more
leisure and increased opportunities for learning; greater opportunity for
all and lessening of indefensible disparities; and larger protection against
the hazards of life. Gains in all of these respects profoundly improve
the quality of living, to which we attach high importance. The notable
advances registered in the past have been in part a by-product of our economic progress, but in part also a response to major innovations by private
groups and all levels of our Government.
A period of general prosperity, such as we have recently been experiencing,
presents a challenge to an intelligent citizenry. How may the good times
be maintained and extended into the future? How may our greater material wealth help us to improve the quality of living? How may conditions
be developed that will help the less prosperous groups to join in the economic advance? These are difficult questions, but no thoughtful individual
can escape them. Nor can the Federal Government do so, in view of its
heavy responsibilities under the Employment Act and the Nation's leadership in the Free World. Later chapters will recount how the Government
has grappled with these issues during the past year, and how the Administration proposes to deal with them over the coming months. But a few
general observations are pertinent here.
To meet the challenge of prosperity, we must above all things avoid
complacency. The continuance of general prosperity cannot be taken
for granted. In a high-level economy like ours, neither the threat of inflation nor the threat of recession can ever be very distant. We live in a
world in which economic changes, both domestic and foreign, are continuous and many. If our economy is to advance firmly on the narrow road
that separates recession from inflation, the Federal Government must pursue
monetary, fiscal, and housekeeping policies with skill and circumspection.
We must be alert to changes in economic conditions and be ready to adapt




II

our policies promptly to them. The only rigid rule that we can afford
to admit to our minds is the principle that the best way to fight a recession
is to try to prevent it from occurring. That principle has of late ruled, and it
must continue to rule, our economic policies.
We must also take every practicable step to strengthen the foundations of
future prosperity. The incentives to work, to save, to invest, and to venture
must be protected and enhanced. Monopolistic tendencies must be
curbed whenever they appear. Sound improvement of our systems of
social insurance must be continued. The encouragement of home ownership and the clearance of slums must be extended. Maladjustments in
agriculture that find expression in overproduction and reduced farm
incomes must be corrected. Those communities which, even in
these good times, continue to be burdened with extensive unemployment
must be aided. Remaining pockets of relative poverty, urban as well
as rural, must be reduced. Provision for schools, highways, and medical
facilities must be substantially increased. Action in these vital areas has
lagged sadly behind our accumulating needs. If economic growth is not
to be seriously retarded in the future, we must—with due regard to the
need for staying within the limits of Federal revenues—strive to make
up for the neglects of the past.
Finally, we must never lose sight of the fact that the prosperity of our
country is heavily dependent upon the international economic and political environment and upon what we do in cooperation with other nations
to improve that environment. Unstable markets, balance of payments
crises, and economic fluctuations abroad can seriously complicate the task
of maintaining stability at home. Moreover, the continued growth of
our production is in no small degree dependent upon an expanding resource
base in friendly countries and upon an expanding world market for the
products of our factories, farms, and mines. A program for maximum
growth in America requires, therefore, intensified efforts to reduce barriers to
the international flow of goods, capital, and business enterprise, as well
as the maintenance of active cooperation with other nations in dealing
with problems which hamper their progress.

Chapter 2

Prosperity With General Price Stability

T

HE EXPANSION of the economy continued without pause throughout the past year. Virtually every month new records were
achieved in production, employment, trade, and income, only to be exceeded again a month or two later. The average level of consumer prices,
on the other hand, remained quite steady. Full employment, rising incomes, and a stable dollar have been cherished goals of our society. The
practical attainment of these ideals during 1955 was the year's great economic achievement. To derive from recent experiences useful guidance
for the future, we must first analyze the processes that led to that achievement. The diversities of fortune in our vast economy will receive full
attention later in this Report.
I. How

THE PROCESS OF EXPANSION CUMULATED

With governmental policies fostering a mood of widespread confidence,
the general economic readjustment that followed the close of hostilities
in Korea proved brief and mild. Prompt and extensive easing of credit
conditions, prompt and sizable tax reductions for both individuals and
businesses, improved housekeeping policies on the part of government, and a
broad program for reinforcing the floor of security for individuals, all helped
to pave the way for a resumption of economic growth. But the basic drive
of the expansion came from private citizens, who were willing to risk accumulated savings on many new tools of production, to borrow as well as
to save, to work longer hours and in increasing numbers, and to spend
freely on new homes and current consumption in order to meet the better
their aspirations for good living. Foreign economic conditions, especially
in Western Europe, also favored domestic expansion. Our commercial exports, which during most of 1954 ran well above the levels of the preceding
year, spurted in the closing months of the year to a still higher level.
Already in the fall and winter of 1953, some signs of emerging recovery
became visible. Stock prices, which are an imperfect but nevertheless
significant indicator of business sentiment, began rising in September and
approached the year's highest values before the year ended. In December,
the new orders for durable goods received by manufacturers began a slow
recovery from their brief but sharp decline of preceding months. The




following month contracts for commercial construction commenced a sustained advance, reinforcing the continued rise of housing starts. Liabilities involved in business failures, which had increased sharply during 1953, reached their peak in February 1954, then moved to lower
levels. In the same month, bank debits outside New York City, which
have long provided economic observers with a rough clue to the circulation of money in commercial and industrial markets, resumed their advance.
In the meantime, interest rates on loans of both short and long maturities, which had been falling for some months, kept on their downward
course, and credit became more readily available to businessmen, homeowners, and consumers.
These early improvements in financial markets and in the preparatory
stages of investment spread quickly to other parts of the economic system.
The slow but continued rise in the Nation's disposable personal income,
which kept defying the contraction of output and employment, also made
its influence felt. So too did the high level of exports, which reflected the
resurgence of the economy of Western Europe. In December 1953 the
decline in the production of nondurable manufactures came to a halt.
In February 1954 retail sales resumed their advance. In April the decline
of the average workweek in manufacturing ceased. Business inventories,
which had been exerting strong downward pressure on economic activity,
continued to decline. However, their rate of decline diminished materially, so that a larger part of people's increasing purchases was met by
current production instead of withdrawals from warehouses or dealers'
shelves. Federal outlays on goods and services accelerated their downward course, but the rest of the economy was in a mood to absorb the
substantial resources released by the Federal Government. Between the
first and second quarters of 1954, consumer expenditures increased, and
so too did private investment in fixed capital, foreign investment, and
State and local expenditures. In response to these developments, total
production stopped declining early in 1954, then held to a sidewise course
for several months, while the realignment of orders, sales, and inventories smoothed the path for a fresh advance.
About mid-1954, with the drop in Federal expenditure abating, the continued surge of private spending tipped the economic balance definitely on
the side of expansion. Between July and September the output of durable
manufactures as a class, mineral production, and nonagricultural employment resumed their advance. By then the recovery had already gathered
sufficient strength to launch both total production and total employment on
a new expansion. Imports soon began rising again, as they usually do when
economic activity increases. The economic contraction, one of the very
briefest and mildest in the entire history of business fluctuations, was over.
It had lasted about 12 months during which total output declined 3 to 4
percent, while employment declined 2J4 percent and personal incomes after
taxes actually increased.

In succeeding months, while activity in some parts of the economy remained dull, the scope of the expansion became progressively wider. The
decline of business inventories stopped in October 1954, and a gradual
process of rebuilding stocks to meet the larger requirements of manufacturers and distributors got under way. The increase of industrial production was gentle at the start. But it rapidly gained momentum once the
newly designed automobiles, which were destined to capture the public's
fancy and pocketbooks, began rolling off the assembly lines in the fall of
1954. A spectacular advance of automobile production and rapid expansion
of homebuilding stimulated expansion in the steel, lumber, glass, and a
host of other industries over the entire country. Allowing for seasonal
factors, automobile production increased 59 percent and housing starts 17
percent between August 1954 and January 1955; total industrial production
increased 7 percent.
Before long even industries which had been hard-pressed for years, such
as the railroads, coal mining, and textiles, felt the impulse of increasing
activity all around them. The output of consumer soft goods industries,
which generally increased throughout 1954, rose more rapidly in the first
half of 1955. The like was true of commercial construction, except that
the acceleration was greater and continued longer. Outlays on industrial
plant, machinery, and equipment, which kept declining until the early
months of 1955, joined the expansion in the spring. Total business expenditures on plant and equipment increased sharply after the first quarter of
1955, rising 20 percent by the end of the year. The major impetus of
expansion thus shifted increasingly from the automobile and homebuilding
industries to business construction and the machinery and equipment
trades. In the course of this process the expansion became more widely
diffused and better balanced, and a groundwork was laid for continued
growth of productivity in the future.
As industrial activity grew, part-time operations diminished and the
resort to overtime increased. The average length of the workweek in
manufacturing rose, crossed the 40-hour mark in November 1954, and still
kept rising. Between June 1954 and June 1955 the average length of the
workweek increased 1.6 hours in metal mining, 5.8 hours in bituminous
coal mining, 0.9 hour on the railroads, 1.2 hours in durable manufactures,
and 1.0 hour in nondurable manufactures. The numbers employed rose
slowly in the initial stages of the expansion, since many businesses found
that they could handle moderate increases in output with the employees
on hand. However, after the turn of the year, as the advance of production
continued and spread outward, jobs expanded swiftly. Between the last
quarters of 1954 and 1955, employment increased by over 3 million. Meanwhile, unemployment declined despite the tremendous numbers, especially
of women and young people, who were attracted into the labor market by
high wages and widening opportunities. By mid-1955 unemployment at
large was well below 4 percent of the labor force. The unemployment rate




among married men living with their families, who form the hard core of
the labor force, fell below 2 percent.
In the initial stages of the expansion both wage rates and prices, on the
whole, moved little. Since increases in production ordinarily did not
require proportionate increases in labor input, labor costs per unit of
output declined on the average. With unit profit margins widening at the
very time when the volume of sales was increasing, profits rose rapidly. But
shortly after the turn of the year, unit labor costs stabilized, then began
rising. The increase of overtime at premium rates of pay, higher wage rates
and fringe benefits, greater resort by business firms to older and less efficient
units of equipment in order to meet the pressing requirements of their
customers, and the growing difficulties in finding suitable workers, all served
to increase unit labor costs. Their advance became marked around the
middle of 1955 and in turn exerted persistent and increasing pressure on
both profit margins and prices. Favored by the state of demand, the average of industrial prices in wholesale markets, which had increased only about
1 percent between August 1954 and June 1955, rose 3y2 percent in the next
six months. The rise in aggregate profits tapered off after the first quarter
of 1955, but profits generally continued to improve. With varying shifts
of pace, both wages and profits therefore reflected the advance of prosperity
and favored its continuance, but only if due restraint were exercised by both
business and labor.
Not only did the flow of incomes to individuals from production rise,
but the rate of rise increased. Corporations paid out larger dividends to
their stockholders and at the same time increased still more rapidly the earnings retained for reinvestment. Interest payments increased. So also did
the income of proprietors, except of farm operators whose record output during 1955 added to the excessive supply of agricultural commodities. Much
the largest increase, both in dollars and relative to the whole, occurred
in labor income. Taken altogether, the annual rate of disbursement to
individuals from production increased by 6.8 billion dollars between the
second quarter of 1954 and the first quarter of 1955. The disposable personal income—that is, income after taxes—increased a little more. In
these months the restraints on the growth of disposable income, which are
ordinarily exercised during an economic expansion through a rise in income
tax payments and a decline of unemployment compensation, were more than
offset by the effects of the tax and social security legislation of 1954. After
the first quarter of 1955, the normal fiscal restraints on the growth of disposable income became operative again; but in the meanwhile, personal income
from production increased rapidly and disposable income was able to grow
at a much higher rate than before.
In these circumstances substantial increases of consumer spending could
be expected and actually occurred. The rise in consumer spending was not,
however, a passive accompaniment of rising incomes. On the contrary,
it was a highly dynamic factor in the process of economic expansion. Gon-

1955

sumers were of a mind to buy better things and increase their spending.
This pervasive attitude, combined with the willingness of women and young
people to take on jobs so that their families might better approximate the
plane of living they wished to attain, has been an outstanding feature of
recent experience. These factors were basic, and they were reinforced by
aggressive selling efforts of businessmen, who sought out customers more
energetically than had become customary in recent years, and offered liberal
credit terms and often bargain prices as well. Consumer spending increased
in all directions, but credit purchases of expensive items, notably of the
1955 automobile models, increased with special rapidity. Between the first
and third quarters of 1954, the annual rate of disposable personal income
rose by 1.4 billion dollars; the expansion in the rate of consumer spending
was much larger, 5.7 billion. Over the next year disposable income increased
17.2 billion, and the increase of consumer spending was again larger—17.8
billion. Reflecting these developments, net personal savings out of current
income diminished both in dollars and in relation to income. Personal
savings, which constituted 8.3 percent of disposable personal income in the
first quarter of 1954, fell to about 6 percent by the first quarter of 1955 and
remained at that level through the third quarter.
Consumers made huge commitments for new homes, besides spending
freely on current consumption. The confidence in the economic future
so dramatically displayed by them was likewise felt and displayed by
businessmen and investors. Favored by easy mortgage terms, homebuilding grew rapidly throughout 1954 and the early months of 1955. Expenditures on residential construction increased 26 percent between November
1953 and November 1954, then rose another 16 percent by mid-1955.
When they declined somewhat later in the year, expenditures on business
construction and producers' equipment kept on increasing. The reason
was that soon after the turn of 1955 the expansion of business capital
outlays had spread from the commercial sector to practically the entire
range of industry. With sales rising, profits improving, depreciation
reserves increasing, and more and more shortages of facilities emerging or
impending, established firms were both willing and able to risk increasingly
large sums on the expansion or modernization of plant and equipment.
Meanwhile, the formation of new firms proceeded at a high rate and they
added to the demands on the construction, machinery, and equipment
industries. Between the first and final quarters of 1955, the annual rate
of business expenditures on new plant and equipment rose from 25.6 billion
dollars to 30.9 billion. Manufacturers of durable goods and of nondurables, commercial establishments, mining concerns, and public utility
enterprises, all participated in the expansion of investment. Even railroads, whose low earnings had previously forced a sharp reduction of
capital outlays, raised the annual rate of such outlays from 740 million
dollars to 1,150 million.




The financial markets both reflected the growing exuberance of the economy and added to it. Prices of common stocks fluttered at times, but their
trend continued upward and outstripped the rise in corporate profits. The
rise in stock prices facilitated corporate financing by equity issues, which had
seriously lagged in recent years. At the same time it kindled the financial
imagination of some people, fostered favorable expectations, and stimulated
the use of credit for speculative trading in securities. The revaluation of
risks became general, and was reflected in shrinking differentials between
yields of corporate securities and the yields of Federal issues. Plans for
business and bank mergers multiplied, and an appreciable number were
executed. Borrowing expanded rapidly, especially on the part of consumers. To finance the larger scale of their operations, corporations also
borrowed more heavily during 1955 than in the previous year. However,
a significant part of the increase in corporate obligations represented borrowing by sales finance companies to meet the growing demand for consumer
loans.
Much of the newly created mortgage debt, especially in the case of
veterans' new home purchases, was marked during 1954 and the early
months of 1955 by a pronounced lengthening of maturities and reduction
of downpayments. A similar tendency became prominent in automobile
instalment loans early in 1955, and to some degree occurred also in other
markets. The changes in credit terms helped to widen the dollar gap
between new borrowings and repayments. Although repayments increased,
newly extended credits increased more rapidly, so that the outstanding debt
tended to grow at a high and increasing rate. Consumer instalment
debt, which had remained steady during the greater part of 1954 and
increased only slightly toward the close of the year, rose about 5 ^ billion
dollars during 1955. The home mortgage debt, which increased by 9.7
billion dollars in 1954, rose by 13.4 billion in 1955. At the end of the year
the total debt of individuals, including noncorporate businesses, stood 15
percent higher than at the beginning. However, monthly payments on the
loans proceeded on schedule, and delinquencies were not only very low
but even lower than in past years.
The huge demand for credit by consumers and business firms was augmented by governmental requirements despite the larger tax revenues
that accompanied the expansion of the economy. The Federal budget
moved toward a balance during 1955 but did not yet reach it. In the States
and localities, considerable support developed both for raising taxes and for
increasing debt to finance essential public improvements, such as roads,
bridges, schools, water systems, and sewerage plants. The total governmental debt grew during 1955, although its rise was only a small fraction
of the increase in private debt. The net borrowing by the Federal Treasury
during the year was 2 billion dollars, while the States and localities added
about 5 billion to their debt.




The surging demands for credit could be met from only two sources,
first, an expansion of the money supply, second, current or past savings.
Between mid-1954 and the end of May 1955 the money supply—that is, the
sum of demand deposits and currency outside banks—increased by 5 billion
dollars. This increase occurred while there was still considerable slack in
the economy, and it facilitated the growth of production, employment, and
real incomes. But by the late spring of 1955 the expanding demand for
the products of industry, swollen by heavy borrowings, was already pressing
hard against the Nation's industrial capacity. Shortages of steel, nickel,
copper, paperboard, cement, plumbing fixtures, some types of lumber, and
other materials developed. Unemployment was low, overtime extensive,
and many types of skilled labor scarce. Wages and prices were beginning
to stir. Accommodation of the pressing demands of borrowers by any substantial increase in the money supply would, in these circumstances, have
served to raise prices rather than increase production.
Interest rates reflected the growing demand for credit in the face of
a more slowly growing supply of loan capital. They began rising gradually in the principal money centers toward the end of 1954, then rose
more rapidly as the excess reserves of commercial banks kept declining
and their borrowings at Federal Reserve Banks increasing. Beyond meeting seasonal requirements, there was little increase in the money supply
between May 1955 and the end of the year. Borrowing continued on an
extensive scale, but it was largely confined to the loan funds available
from the savings of individuals, businesses, and the various private and
governmental trust funds. This process of confining credit to available
savings, which is a protection against inflation in the future, was obscured
by the continued and rapid increase of loans by commercial banks. These
loans were made possible principally by the sale of government securities;
in other words, the buyers of government securities indirectly provided the
funds that financed borrowers from banks. The process of confining credit
to available savings was much plainer in the case of mortgage-lending
institutions, many of whom found that their supply of savings available
for mortgage loans was smaller than the amounts they needed to accommodate customers. Interbank borrowings smoothed these and other necessary
financial adjustments, and so too did higher interest rates, more selective
screening of credit demands by lenders, and reduced credit commitments
by financial institutions.
Despite elements of strain in the money and capital markets, the demand for commodities and services continued to grow as the year advanced.
Their supply also kept growing, although many businesses encountered
obstacles in increasing production—in certain cases because their available
plant was already operating at or close to capacity, in others because some
essential materials or skilled labor were in short supply, in still others because
credit had become harder to obtain. Orders received by business firms
generally multiplied faster than sales, backlogs grew, and delivery periods




27

lengthened. Despite the growing pressure of demand on the Nation's
physical resources, production as a whole continued to increase, albeit at
a reduced rate. And despite the boom atmosphere that to some degree
accompanied these developments, the over-all level of prices in both
consumer and wholesale markets did not change appreciably. The index
of consumer prices, which stood at 115.2 in July 1954, moved to 114.3 in
January 1955 and 114.7 in December 1955. The index of wholesale prices
moved from 110.4 in July 1954 to 110.1 the following January and 111.3
in December 1955. When the year ended the scope of the expansion had
narrowed and its pace had slackened. The Nation had practically reached
full employment, and was accommodating itself to a necessarily slower rate of
advance.
II. GOVERNMENTAL POLICY IN A TIME OF EXPANSION

The preceding sketch of recent economic experience is amplified in
Appendix B and documented by the charts and tables in this Report.
But even this brief summary has sufficed to suggest how the unfolding of
prosperity generated a degree of exuberance which, if left to itself, could
have led to widespread increases in prices, speculative buying, new price
increases, and eventual economic recession. The Federal Government,
keenly aware of its responsibilities under the Employment Act, moved resolutely to prevent such developments.
That conditions in 1955 might require a different emphasis in economic
policy was foreshadowed in last year's Economic Report. It noted that
in the course of resolving old problems, expansion "often brings new ones
in its train." It called attention to the danger of excesses in periods of
expansion, particularly in activities which involve the discounting of a long
future, as in the case of home purchases or the pricing of corporate shares.
It warned that "continued economic recovery must not be jeopardized by
overemphasis of speculative activity." And it urged concentration of governmental policy on facilitating long-term growth, rather than on measures
for imparting an immediate upward thrust to the economy.
Thus, the Government was prepared for the problems that confronted
our economy in the year just ended, and policies to restrain undue expansion
were evolved to meet threats to stability as they emerged. It is well to
recall that the expansion which got under way in the late summer of 1954
started from a high level of economic activity. Since the Nation's financial
and commercial markets reflected that fact, as well as the promise of a
still better future, the Government deemed it prudent to restrain incipient
inflationary tendencies even at an early stage of the expansion. As a
Nation, we are committed to the principle that our economy of free and
competitive enterprise must continue to grow. But we do not wish to
realize this objective at the price of inflation, which not only creates inequities, but is likely, sooner or later, to be followed by depression. On the
other hand, it is necessary to exercise great care that a policy of avoiding




28

inflation does not interfere with attaining a satisfactory rate of economic
growth. Premature measures and restraints which are too potent may bring
on or hasten the very reactions that the restraining policies are intended to
prevent, just as excessively delayed action would fail of its purpose.
Moreover, market forces themselves tend to correct many maladjustments,
and governmental policy must take account of the direction and strength
of these forces. The rise in interest rates during 1955, for example, was to
a significant degree a result of market developments, tending to restore
balance between the vigorous demand for investment funds and the limited
supply of savings available for investment. In such a situation it is essential
to appraise with care the speed and strength of market adjustments so that
they, together with the governmental measures that are being contemplated,
may exercise an effective yet not overpowering corrective influence. This
type of appraisal is often difficult and it is always subject to the fallibility
of human judgment. The following review of recent monetary and fiscal
policies will show how the Government went about the delicate task of preventing inflation without impeding economic growth.
III.

ADJUSTMENT OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES TO THE
NEEDS OF THE ECONOMY

The first departure from the vigorous expansionary policies pursued
during much of 1953 and 1954 occurred toward the end of the latter year.
As we have seen, economic expansion was well under way by the late summer
of 1954. This development was accompanied by a brisk demand for
credit, which the commercial banks and other financial institutions were
able to meet as a result of the ample lending power that the policy of active
credit ease, which then prevailed, had helped to create and maintain.
Although conditions in the latter part of 1954 did not call for a policy
of restraint, a mild change in the degree of credit ease seemed desirable in
the light of the unfolding economic situation. Accordingly, the Federal
Reserve System restricted its purchases of government securities in December 1954. This action made it necessary for commercial banks to increase
their borrowings to meet the unusually large increase in year-end currency
and credit demands. It also placed the monetary authorities in a better
position to move toward a policy of restraint if economic conditions should
warrant it. The move exemplified one of the advantages of general monetary and credit policies: they can be adjusted gradually, and if need be
promptly reversed, to meet changing economic conditions.
Holding the Tax Line
As the year 1955 opened, the economic expansion was proceeding vigorously on a widening front. In keeping with this fact, the Administration
recommended in January a budget which brought expenditures and receipts of the Federal Government into balance, on a cash basis, over the
coming year. This required a tight rein on expenditures and the avoidance

of drains on revenue through any reduction of tax rates. Consequently, the
Congress was urged to postpone the tax reductions which were scheduled
to take effect on April 1, 1955.
Without such affirmative action, Federal taxes would have decreased
by approximately 3 billion dollars in a full year. The corporate tax rate
would have declined 5 percentage points, involving a loss to the Treasury of
about 2 billion dollars. The revenue from excise taxes would have been
cut by approximately 1 billion dollars. These tax reductions did not seem
appropriate at a time when aggregate economic activity was at a high
level and expanding rapidly, while the budget was still unbalanced. However desirable tax adjustments may be to facilitate the long-run expansion of the economy, it is imprudent to initiate them when the budget shows
a deficit and when they may interfere with the objective of maintaining
balanced economic growth.
Although a bill to reduce individual income taxes was passed by the
House, the Congress in the end accepted the President's tax program.
The recommendation to defer the scheduled tax reductions was adopted
on March 30, 1955.
Containing the Rise in Stock Market Credit
The proposal of early January to hold the tax line was preceded by a step
that dealt with specific credit excesses. A few days earlier, the Federal
Reserve authorities had acted to restrain the use of credit in the stock
market, where speculative tendencies had become clearly evident.
The rise in stock prices, which began in September 1953 and continued
almost without interruption through 1954, was accompanied by a significant increase in the amount of credit used for financing stock purchases.
Customers' debit balances with member firms of the New York Stock
Exchange rose over 700 million dollars in 1954 or almost 45 percent, and
more than three-quarters of the rise was concentrated in the last six months
of the year. Loans by banks to individuals for purchasing or carrying
stocks also increased. The volume of security trading on margin had
grown noticeably during 1954.
Experience provides ample evidence that excesses in the stock market
can be transmitted quickly to other markets and eventually create economic
trouble. It is important to prevent such developments. Hence, the
Federal Reserve authorities moved in January to restrain the use of
credit in security speculation, by increasing margin requirements on loans
for the purchase of securities from 50 to 60 percent. Since the borrowing
from brokers and banks, in connection with security transactions of individuals, continued to increase fairly rapidly in the next three months, margin
requirements were again raised in April—this time to 70 percent. Stock
prices, especially of the largest and best known industrials, continued upward
through much of the rest of the year, but the rate of increase of stock
market credit declined substantially soon after this second action was taken.




From Active Credit Ease to Moderate Restraints
Besides taking steps to contain stock market excesses, the general credit
policy of the Federal Reserve System was modified early in 1955 in the
direction of restraint. In January and February, the Reserve Banks reduced
their holdings of government securities by about 1.3 billion dollars. This
reduction was designed to absorb funds that normally become available to
commercial banks as a result of the seasonal return of currency and the
seasonal decline in loans. But in view of the continuing strong demand for
bank credit, the sales and redemptions by the Reserve Banks had the effect
of tightening the reserves of their members. The commercial banks responded by selling securities to meet the growing demand for loans.
Simultaneously, they increased their borrowings from the Reserve Banks.
The Treasury also adjusted its financing programs to the change in
economic conditions. Treasury financing in 1954 was carried out with
short- and intermediate-term securities, many of which were bought by commercial banks and served to increase the money supply. In early 1955 there
was no longer much reason for avoiding competition with other borrowers in
the long-term capital market. Nor was there any special need to stimulate
the expansion of the money supply. Hence the Treasury issued almost 2
billion dollars of 3 percent, 40-year bonds in February. Besides absorbing
funds from the long-term market, the new issue helped to meet the needs of
long-term investors, such as pensions and trust funds, insurance companies,
and endowment funds. An additional 800 million dollars of these long-term
bonds were issued later.
The policy of restraint of early 1955 was extended as the expansion of
credit continued. Loans to business firms, automobile purchasers, and
homeowners—the three groups which provided the major impetus to economic expansion—rose sharply during the spring. Business loans of commercial banks, which normally decline in the first half of the year, increased
by 2 billion dollars in the first six months of 1955. The outstanding instalment debt of consumers expanded nearly 2 billion dollars in the second
quarter, the largest increase on record over so brief a period. The value of
home mortgage loans recorded during the first six months of 1955 exceeded
recordings in the corresponding period of 1954 by a third, if not more.
Although interest rates stiffened, other credit terms, such as the required
downpayment and length of maturity, became more liberal, particularly
for automobile and home purchases. In view of these credit and business
developments, the Federal Reserve discount rate was raised in April
from 1J4 to 154 percent. This action brought the discount rate in line
with the market level of short-term rates and made borrowings from the
Reserve Banks more costly.
During the summer, employment reached a new peak of about 65 million.
Although pockets of unemployment persisted in some local areas, unemployment generally was close to a practical minimum. Total output broke all
previous records. Upward pressures on wages and prices became more

intense. New collective bargaining agreements in major industries called
for substantial wage increases, which in some cases were followed by substantial price advances. Shortages of steel, copper, aluminum, and of a
variety of building materials developed or became more acute. The credit
expansion supporting the high level of demand in practically all sectors of
the economy reached a pace which, if continued for long, would threaten
the stability of the economy.
To help avert this threat the Federal Reserve Banks reduced their holdings
of government securities on a considerable scale between late July and midSeptember. The effect of this policy was to put added pressure on bank
reserves at a time when the demand for loans was piling up. To bolster
their reserve position and continue lending, the commercial banks further reduced their own holdings of government securities and also increased their
borrowing at the Reserve Banks. But when they borrowed money, they had
to pay a higher price for it. Early in August, the discount rate was increased
by one Reserve Bank to 2% percent and by the others to 2 percent. By midSeptember, discount rates were raised to 2*4 percent by all Reserve Banks.
The pace of economic expansion slowed down somewhat during the fall,
but incomes continued to increase and demand remained at a high level.
When stock prices declined in late September and early October, a note
of uncertainty crept into the thinking of some people. Within a few weeks,
however, the averages of stock prices returned to their prior peaks. It
became evident that business firms were laying plans for further increases
in investment outlays, and that business and consumer demands for credit
showed few signs of slackening. In view of this situation, the monetary
authorities maintained pressure on the reserves of commercial banks.
Although the Reserve Banks purchased a sizable amount of government
securities toward the end of September and the following weeks, the amount
fell short of meeting the seasonal requirements of commercial banks before
the Christmas season. In November, the discount rate was raised to 2/2
percent—the fourth increase of the year. In December, the reserve position
of the banks eased somewhat, but pressure in the credit markets continued.
As the pressure on bank reserves increased during the year, the commercial banks took care of their customers' requirements by huge sales of
government securities and by borrowing at the Reserve Banks. However,
increasing tightness in the credit markets in time led both the commercial
banks and other financial institutions to screen their loans more carefully.
Mortgage money, in particular, became less plentiful. Simultaneously,
the increased cost of borrowing moderated the demand for long-term credit
by some borrowers. This effect became noticeable during the summer,
when a number of State and local governments and turnpike authorities
deferred their scheduled financing. The restricted supply of loan funds
made its influence felt also in the short-term credit market, though to a
smaller degree. The net result was some restraint of private and public




35

expenditures, which was salutary in an environment in which excessive
demand could well have resulted in sharply rising prices.
Consumer Credit Policies
To supplement the general monetary policy of reducing the ease of
borrowing, specific actions were taken during the spring and summer in
two areas which, in addition to the stock market, caused some concern.
One of these areas was consumer credit.
Most of the expansion of consumer credit occurred in connection with
automobile loans, which in the early months of 1955 were being made on
increasingly liberal terms. In the case of new car purchases, instalment contracts with maturities as long as 30 and 36 months became more prevalent.
Downpayments of less than a third became fairly common, and they were
sometimes nominal because of the tendency to overvalue trade-ins. The
frequent combination of low downpayments and lengthy maturities meant
that the outstanding debt on many instalment contracts exceeded the market
value of the car for appreciable periods. In the case of used cars, downpayments also declined, though there was little change in maturities.
The authority of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
to establish maximum terms on consumer credit had ceased in 1952. Consequently, apart from general monetary policies, the means of influencing
consumer credit were limited to what could be accomplished by moral
suasion and bank supervision. Government officials met repeatedly with
representatives of financial institutions and noted the hazards that may
attach to excessively liberal credit terms. In July the Federal bank supervisory authorities—that is, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal
Reserve Board, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation—added a
section on consumer credit to their regular examination reports, with a
view to providing a better basis for evaluating the quality of consumer
loans extended by banks. Partly in response to these measures, but mainly
in response to the general tightening of the money market, many lenders
put a halt to further liberalization of terms and some began to stiffen terms.
However, maturities and downpayments generally remained liberal by
contrast with those of prior years.
Housing Credit Policies
Several steps were taken by the Government to help cope also with the
threat of overexpansion of housing credit. We have already noted the
great upsurge in residential construction between the fall of 1954 and the
spring of 1955. This was stimulated by increasingly easy credit during
1954, and the eagerness of financial institutions to acquire, and make forward commitments for, mortgage loans at a time when rates of return on
other investments were less attractive. The demand for new housing
generally remained strong during this period. Nevertheless, by the spring
of 1955 a surplus of housing became evident in some scattered localities.

1955

Easy mortgage credit manifested itself most conspicuously in the terms
offered on government-guaranteed loans for veterans, although it was by
no means limited to this segment of the market. In the spring of 1955,
mortgage loans with maturities of 26 to 30 years represented nearly twothirds of the total number of veterans' loans on new homes, compared with
about one-third a year earlier. The like was true of no-downpayment
mortgages. The extensive and growing resort to mortgages requiring no
downpayment raised the serious question whether such loans were in the
best interest of many of the veterans attracted into home purchase, and
whether the sale of homes on increasingly easy terms could be maintained
without deterioration of credit standards and unsettling effects on home
building activity in the future.
In addition, strains in the mortgage market began to be evident in the
spring and summer of 1955. Finding it difficult to handle the record
volume of mortgage loans and commitments, mortgage lenders resorted
increasingly to short-term credit. Savings and loan associations stepped up
sharply their borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Banks. Other mortgage lenders arranged for temporary financing by "warehousing" large
amounts of mortgages with commercial banks—a development which led the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York to advise caution in the extension of this
type of credit. Advances by Home Loan Banks to savings and loan associations, together with mortgage "warehousing" loans by commercial banks in
major cities, increased by 1.3 billion dollars between August 1954 and
August 1955.
The strains on the financial system were paralleled by pressures on the
resources available to the construction industry. Building materials, such
as cement, steel, copper and brass products, gypsum board, hardwood flooring, even bricks and nails, were reported in short supply in more
and more areas. Wages were rising generally. The price of land for residential developments was increasing rapidly, as were prices of building
materials.
In view of these developments, the Federal Housing Administration and
the Veterans Administration issued regulations in late April, which required
the home purchaser who obtained a mortgage underwritten by the Government to pay legal, recording, and related fees in cash. The inclusion
of such costs in mortgage loans was one of the unsound, though not widespread, practices that had developed under competitive pressures. At
about the same time, the field offices of both agencies were instructed to
intensify their surveys of local housing markets, and to take coordinated
steps to restrain Federal underwriting of mortgages in localities where
housing surpluses were found to exist. In July both agencies reduced from
30 to 25 years the maximum maturity of mortgages that could henceforth
be insured or guaranteed by the Government. Simultaneously, the minimum downpayment on homes bought under the veterans' program was
raised from zero to 2 percent of the purchase price, while minimum down-

payments on homes purchased under the program of the Federal Housing
Administration were increased correspondingly. In line with these measures, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board took steps in the summer and
fall to restrain the rapid growth of lending by the Home Loan Banks.
All these steps were parts of a general and concerted credit policy. Housing loans insured or guaranteed by the Federal Government now represent over two-fifths of the entire home mortgage debt. For this reason,
if for no other, the Government has a direct responsibility in helping to
maintain a sound housing and mortgage market. It has a corresponding
duty to use its own programs wisely, so as to promote stable economic
growth as well as progress toward better housing. The objective of stable
growth is clearly in the national interest. It is also in the long-term interest
of those who have so greatly benefited from the Federal housing programs—
the millions of consumers with a stake in their homes, jobs, and debt
obligations, the hundreds of thousands of workmen in the construction
industry, and the thousands of enterprises engaged in home building and
mortgage lending.
Adjusting the Stockpiling Program
After the basic decision of January to hold the tax line, monetary
and credit policies were largely relied on to keep the excesses that tend
to arise during prosperity from cumulating. However, the Government's
housekeeping operations were also managed so as to relieve the pressures
of an expanding economy. Among other things, the stockpiling program
was adjusted during the past year, within the limits permitted by law, to
avoid undue hardship to the civilian economy. Quantities of copper,
aluminum, and nickel under contract for delivery to the Government were
diverted to industrial use, and in the case of copper some holdings outside
the stockpile were sold for essential industrial uses. It was possible to
do this without injury to the defense program because of the substantial
progress that had previously been made in stockpile accumulations. Also,
the expansion of capacity in some major industries, notably of aluminum,
is now contributing to domestic mobilization potentials and is decreasing
correspondingly the need for stockpiles.
IV.

EFFECTIVENESS OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES

Monetary and fiscal policies influence different activities in varying
degree, and these effects have varying time dimensions. Thus, financial
developments during 1955 reflected not only the restraints placed on
borrowing in that year, but also the credit ease of the preceding year. In
addition, they mirrored the strength of credit demands accompanying the
rapid business expansion of 1955 as well as the efforts to moderate these
demands. Final evidence of the effectiveness of recent governmental policies must therefore be sought in the economic annals that are yet to come




40

as well as those for 1955. Even now, however, it can be said with confidence that the early recognition of a need for monetary and fiscal caution,
and the gradual but persistent application of a policy of restraint during
the greater part of 1955, contributed in no small degree to the achievement
and maintenance of prosperity without price inflation.
The vigorous expansion of economic activity during 1955 was accompanied by little change in the average level of wholesale or consumer
prices. To be sure, the substantial stability of the price level reflected in
some degree the opposite movements of industrial and farm prices in
wholesale markets. However, the increase even in the average level of
industrial prices was not large for a period of high prosperity. Because
the over-all change in prices was small, speculative accumulation of business
inventories, such as has often led to economic recession in the past, was
largely avoided last year. And since consumer prices remained virtually
stable, higher earnings due to increased basic rates of pay and longer or
more regular hours of work were not dissipated, but resulted in rapidly
rising real incomes for wage earners. The advances occurred in a general
atmosphere of industrial peace.
Although we have not entirely escaped the financial excesses that commonly develop in a time of economic exuberance, the policies of restraint
pursued by the Government helped to moderate the growth of debt and
to protect its quality. A balanced Federal budget is now definitely within

reach. There has been little change in the amount of stock market credit
outstanding since last June, and its quality has improved. The tendency
toward increasingly liberal terms on consumer instalment loans has been
arrested. Mortgage lending is proceeding on a more prudent basis. For
some months now, the expansion of borrowing has in the aggregate been
largely restricted to the loan funds made available from past or current
savings. Because the creation of new money has been kept down, the
recurring problem of preventing inflation should be less difficult in the
future.




42

While the monetary and fiscal restraints of last year contributed significantly to economic stability, they did not interfere with the attainment of a
very high rate of economic growth. Expansion continued throughout the
year, and the rate of growth slowed down only when output began pressing
against the ceiling of physical resources. On the whole, then, the performance of the economy in the year just ended indicates considerable success
of the Government's stabilizing efforts, just as the annals of 1954 demonstrated that the Government helped to overcome the forces of economic
contraction and facilitate recovery.
In some ways, the lesson of 1955 is perhaps the more significant one.
Success in preventing depression depends in large part upon a willingness to
avoid the excesses that can so easily develop during prosperity and upon
skill in doing this. Governmental measures of monetary and fiscal restraint
are not as readily accepted as are measures of economic stimulation. The
manufacturer who sees an opportunity to expand his activities by borrowing
cannot always understand why his bank is so short of funds that he must put
up with a smaller loan than he requested. Nor can the homebuilder or merchant or consumer. Nor, for that matter, can the banker. To each participant in the economic process a shortage of credit may appear as a restriction
on his own opportunities. But the basic shortage under conditions of high
prosperity is on the side of physical resources, not on the side of money or
credit. If credit on easy terms were available to everyone at a time when the
economy is already working close to capacity, the consequence would be a
scramble for limited resources and a cumulative bidding up of prices. If
taxes were simultaneously reduced, this inflationary process would only be
speeded up. A government that sought to prolong prosperity by such
devices would be taking a road that all too often has ended in disaster.
Prompt and resolute governmental action to contain undue expansion
requires courage and a willingness to focus on the less apparent and the
longer-term interests of the economy. The fact that the Government during 1955 acted in this fashion, and the degree to which people accepted
and approved the program of fiscal and monetary restraints as the better
part of wisdom, testify to our increasing maturity as a Nation in dealing
with the problem of economic instability. Another challenge to meeting
the objectives of the Employment Act was met as the first decade of
operations under this novel legislation came to a close.
V. T H E CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION

Once an economy operates close to full capacity, further expansion of
economic activity is bound to proceed at a slower rate. At such a time,
moreover, crosscurrents multiply and become more prominent. As was to




43

be expected, the scope of the economic expansion has narrowed in recent
months and its pace has slackened. Declines have lately been under way in
housing starts, automobile production, and other activities, but they are
being amply offset by increases elsewhere. The flow of orders to business
firms remains high and, in the aggregate, continues to exceed current production and sales. Many shortages, particularly of metals, persist. In
short, the rapid expansion of six or twelve months back has given way to a
tamer movement, but the underlying trend still appears to be upward.
The economy is starting the new year from a strong financial as well as a
strong industrial position. Although stock prices are substantially higher
than a year or two ago, credit is not a very large factor in today's stock market. Although consumers have recently added heavily to their debts, they
also have added substantially to their liquid assets and earning power. The
current liabilities of business firms have risen, but their current assets have
risen still more. Agricultural inventories are very high, but they are largely
held by the Government and their disposal will not be permitted to disrupt
markets. The recent expansion of industrial production has been accompanied by an increase in business inventories, but a preponderant part of the
increase has been in goods locked up in the productive process. Apart from
the automobile industry, which is now bringing its production into better
adjustment with market demand, there is little evidence in the business world
of excess or speculative inventory holdings. Taking recent years as a
standard, the current ratio of inventories to sales is generally low for both
manufacturers and distributors. The increase of inventory investment in
the fourth quarter of 1955, which stands out prominently in the most recent
statistical summary of the gross national product, is largely attributable
to automobiles and does not have a more general significance.
As just noted, housing starts have recently been declining. Such indicators as we have of proposed home construction are also pointing downward.
These movements largely reflect the limited supply of mortgage money in the
recent past, rather than a slackening demand for new homes. Basic conditions of the home-building industry are, on the whole, satisfactory. In
good part because of the governmental steps taken during 1955 to avoid
overbuilding, local housing surpluses are now fewer than last spring. In
the Nation as a whole, the vacancies currently available are only about
2.3 percent of the total stock of dwellings. Although that figure is somewhat higher than in recent years, vacancies still fall short of the reserves
that people need in order to shift their housing accommodations without
excessive delays.
The demand for new dwellings remains strong, and there are some signs
also of improvement in the conditions affecting their supply. Shortages
of building materials have been reduced somewhat in recent weeks. More-

over, the condition of the mortgage market is beginning to improve. Quotations on government-underwritten mortgages have stabilized of late. Commitments by life insurance companies for making home mortgages seem to
have turned up. By last December, the savings and loan associations had
already succeeded in bringing their commitments into reasonable adjustment
with their inflows of cash, and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board therefore
relaxed the restraints on borrowing from the Home Loan Banks. More
recently, in view of the adjustments that have already taken place in the
home-building and home-financing industries, the maximum permissible
term of governmentally underwritten mortgages has been restored to 30
years. All these developments favor a good rate of residential building

during 1956, although it seems unlikely that the exceptionally high volume
of the past year will be attained.
On the other hand, business investment has been rising vigorously in
recent months, and the indications are that the increase will be extended
in the months immediately ahead. Orders for machine tools, freight cars,
engines and turbines, and durable goods generally have been expanding.
The excess of orders over sales of durable goods in the past twelve months
has built up a large backlog of unfilled orders. New business incorporations

have been proceeding at a high rate. When allowance is made for the
erratic movements intrinsic in monthly records, it is clear that construction
contracts for commercial and industrial structures have been moving to
higher levels. Surveys of business plans for capital spending, many of
which represent firm commitments for 1956, likewise suggest a rising
volume of business outlays on plant and equipment. In view of the investments that are projected or already under way, the outlook for business
capital expenditures in coming months is good.
The prospective high volume of private investment in fixed capital—
that is, business investment in plant and equipment together with residential
construction—is likely to be supplemented over coming months by further expansion of State and local spending. The pressures for local improvements
are continuing to mount over the country, and the scale on which construction contracts are proceeding strengthens the expectation of a higher
rate of State and local outlays. Federal expenditure on goods and services
may also move a little higher over coming months.
The basis for judging other parts of the economy is less clear at present.
However, foreign trade probably will continue at a high level, at least over
the months immediately ahead. How soon and in what degree the decline
of farm incomes and farm spending is checked will largely depend on how
promptly the Congress acts on the Administration's newly proposed farm
program. The future course of consumer spending is always shrouded in
uncertainty, but it is well to note that retail sales last quarter were at their
highest level of the year, and that retail sales in December—quite apart
from the normal seasonal bulge—were at the highest level of the quarter.
Thus, the trend of aggregate consumer spending continues to be upward,
despite the recent decline of expenditures on durables. If it is unlikely
that consumers will buy automobiles in 1956 at last year's extraordinary
rate, they may spend more freely on home improvements, home furnishings,
and nondurables. The urge to maintain and improve living standards is
so strong nowadays that continuation of a high level of consumer spending
can be reasonably anticipated.
Under current conditions, the economic growth of our Nation is limited
by industrial capacity and accretions to the labor force. When the economy
has reached so high a level its near-term course is inevitably surrounded by
a margin of uncertainty, and minor movements can occur without involving
a change in general trend. Taking recent developments all together, it is
reasonable to expect that high levels of production, employment, and income
will be broadly sustained during the coming year, and that underlying conditions will remain favorable to further economic growth.
The clearest lesson of recent economic history is the need for alertness
to economic change and for prompt adaptation of economic policies to




49

changing business conditions. It is important to avoid complacency
and to bear in mind the uncertainties that always surround the future.
But it is no less important to recognize that the opportunities which lie
ahead for American businessmen, consumers, workers, farmers, and investors
are much greater than the uncertainties. The basic objective of governmental policy in the economic sphere during the coming year should be to
help in the realization of these opportunities. The following chapters present for the consideration of the Congress a program to help widen the scope
of our current prosperity and to help extend it into the future.




5°

Chapter 3

Broadening the Scope of Prosperity

T

HE PRECEDING CHAPTER has focused on the Nation's success in
attaining general prosperity without price inflation during the year
just ended. But the economic life of a dynamic people is full of crosscurrents. No matter how rapidly the economy as a whole may be advancing, there are always some industries and areas that are standing still or
even declining. Progress of technology is by its nature uneven; new
products and new firms continually disrupt economic routine; shifts of demand keep occurring and recurring; foreign developments have widely
divergent effects on domestic industry; and the weather itself is sometimes
the arbiter over the lives and fortunes of people. These factors and many
others like them diversify the economic life of a Nation. If our economy
is to continue growing, it will have to remain fluid and resilient, and broadly
responsive to market forces. The general welfare may, however, be greatly
enhanced by fostering conditions under which adjustments can be accomplished with a minimum of hardship or difficulty.
It is precisely because good times have spread so widely among the American people that we should give serious thought to ways and means of
extending prosperity to the less flourishing sectors of our economy. Many
branches of agriculture have failed to participate fully in the Nation's
prosperity. Unemployment has persisted in some urban communities despite the attainment of full employment, in a practical sense, in the Nation
at large. Even in these highly prosperous times a relatively small yet significant number of American families have, for one reason or another, incomes that are much too low. We must try to extend the magnificent performance of our economy. The first and most pressing problem requiring the
attention of the Congress is the continued decline of agricultural incomes.
I. PROMOTING AGRICULTURAL READJUSTMENTS

American agriculture is a highly varied part of the national economy.
The commercial farms—where the income of the operator's family depends
primarily on the sale of farm products—vary greatly in size, in degree of
specialization, in productive efficiency, and in financial return. In addition,
there are many part-time and residential farms. The Nation has a stake
in the welfare of all agriculture and all farm people. National programs
must take account of the divergent problems of the different groups.

The commercial farmers who produce the bulk of our farm output are
ingenious, adaptive, and progressive. They take advantage of the rich
flow of technical knowledge, materials, and machinery made available by
research and industrial development. Their farms are better equipped
and better managed than they have ever been. Operator-owned family
farms continue to predominate, and the acreage and capital per farm are
increasing. Farm wage rates have risen as the high level of industrial
activity in the postwar decade has drawn into more remunerative nonfarm
occupations many low-income farmers, sharecroppers, and hired hands.
Farm people are taking advantage of opportunities for off-farm employment, full-time or part-time, which yields important supplements to their
income; and their living has improved far above prewar levels. Since January 1955 farmers have participated in our national system of Old-Age and
Survivors Insurance. Continuing large increases in population, coupled
with high and rising levels of national income and employment, have
maintained a strong domestic demand for farm products in recent years.
Nevertheless, the economic condition of agriculture is not satisfactory,
and the position of farmers in our dynamic economy has aroused deep
concern. Experience varies widely from year to year in different farming
sections and enterprises, and from farm to farm. Yet gross and net incomes
from farming have been declining since 1951, in sharp contrast to improving
rewards in industry, commerce, and finance. Readjustment to peacetime
conditions of demand and production has not been fully achieved. It is
imperative that we strengthen farm programs on the basis of a realistic
appraisal of the present situation.
Farmers responded magnificently to wartime and postwar challenges
to produce abundantly, and generally enjoyed great prosperity in the 1940's.
Farm incomes rose to new highs after World War II as a result of price
inflation, high domestic demand, and extraordinary exports largely
financed by grants and loans from the Government. Substantial declines
in farm prices and incomes in 1948 and 1949 were due mainly to subsidence
of this abnormal export demand, record crop production in 1948, and
some contraction in the domestic economy. The outbreak of the Korean
conflict and fears of a return of wartime shortages stimulated increases
in both the domestic and foreign demand for agricultural products. This,
coupled with renewed inflation, raised farm prices and gross incomes to new
peaks in 1951. The containment of hostilities led to a fall in abnormal
demands for stocks, and there was a sharp decline of agricultural exports
in 1952-53. Enlarged supplies of meats and dairy products in 1953, as
well as temporarily reduced consumer demand for the latter, also contributed to the decline in farm prices and incomes from their exceptional
1951 peaks. The further declines in 1954 and 1955 were associated with
a general enlargement of production and stocks.
The decline in gross farm income since 1951 has been accompanied by
an even sharper decline in net income. Farm production expenses in in-




53

creasing degree consist of machinery, fertilizer, and other items purchased
from the nonfarm economy. Prices of these items have declined little in
recent years, and in many cases have risen as nonfarm demands for steel,
gasoline, and other products continued to increase. Thus, farmers have
been subjected to a "cost-price squeeze." Although the market conditions
that prevailed during and immediately after the war could not be expected
to continue indefinitely, the protracted decline and current low levels of
income, in a period of generally good times, are of increasing concern.
On certain points the evidence is clear. Commercial farmers have been
producing and are geared to produce more than could be commercially
disposed of at supported prices. Government restrictions on acreage of
several crops, notably wheat and cotton, have insufficiently curtailed production of these crops and have led to expansion of others. Huge carryovers have piled up, far beyond liberal estimates of desirable reserves.
Government holdings acquired under price-support programs have kept
rising, in spite of intensive and effective efforts to dispose of surpluses.
The persisting decline in farm prices and incomes reflects a continuing
imbalance between farm output and its ultimate disposition. The imbalance is to be traced largely to the technological revolution in American
agriculture, changing domestic demands for farm products, the expansion
of agricultural production abroad, and the repeated extension of wartime
price support levels long after the end of World War II.
The most recent upsurge in our agricultural technology began in the late
1930's. It has taken many forms, such as better varieties of seeds, improved
breeds of livestock, more and better machinery, increasing use of fertilizer,
improved feeding practices, extension of electrification, and more effective
controls of weeds, insects, and plant and animal diseases. Favorable prices,
higher incomes, and the steadily improving asset position of farmers during
the war made it possible to adopt the new technology at a rapid pace between
1940 and 1945. After the war the broad uptrend in farm output continued,
and there is no sign that the current phase of the technological revolution
has run its course. The index of total farm output rose 20 percent during
1939-45, 4 percent in 1945-50, and 12 percent in 1950-55; new records
were set in each of the past five years. The latest increases have far
exceeded the expectations of competent specialists. In output per acre,
per livestock unit, per farm worker, and per man-hour, remarkable advances
have been registered.
Demand has not risen enough to absorb all of the enlarged farm
output. Indeed, technological developments on and off farms have
of themselves reduced the demand for several important farm
products. Notable examples are the nearly complete replacement of
horses and mules by automotive equipment in farm and nonfarm uses,
and of horsefeed by motor fuel; inroads of synthetic fibers, paper, and other




54

products on the consumption of cotton and wool; and the adverse effect on
the demand for fats and oils from increasing displacement of soap by detergents. Apart from such changes, as incomes rise the demand for farm
products tends to increase at a rate below the rate of increase in disposable
personal income. Per capita consumption of food in 1955 was only 3 percent higher than in 1947-49, whereas per capita disposable income in
constant dollars was 15 percent higher. Retail food sales have risen with
population and incomes, but much of the increase in consumer expenditure has gone for additional services associated with processing and distribution rather than to enlarge the per capita demand for raw foodstuffs.
For some products, such as wheat and potatoes, rising personal incomes
entail a decrease in demand as consumers shift to more highly preferred
foods. And per capita consumption of meat, poultry, and most dairy
products has of late been so high that further increases encounter greater
competition from other desired goods and services.
Notable gains by the economies of Western Europe and many other
parts of the world since 1948 might have been expected to enlarge normal
export markets for American farm products. Several factors have severely
limited the extent to which this has occurred. Agriculture abroad gradually recovered from wartime destruction and disorganization. Under the
stimulus of national measures aimed at self-sufficiency, enlarged exports,
and protection to farmers, the output of major crops—wheat, cotton, rice,
sugar, and others—has sharply increased. Even several of the low-income
countries have greatly expanded their production of foodstuffs and
fibers. As increased supplies have brought world prices down, the levels
of price supports in this country have tended to price our products out of
world markets.
The tendency to surplus production in the United States was strongly
reinforced by legislative and administrative actions in 1952. An Act of
July 17, 1952 extended price supports on the six "basic" crops at 90 percent
of parity through 1954-55, and postponed until 1956 the application of
"modernized parity" formulas. By administrative decisions in 1952,
acreage allotments and marketing quotas were not applied to wheat for
harvest in the following year, price supports for dairy products were maintained, and the support prices of many nonbasic commodities were raised.
These measures imposed heavy burdens on this Administration. Farm
output rose to a new high in the very year when the abnormal demands
arising from the Korean conflict disappeared. Large portions of the
1953 output of supported crops and dairy products, including one-third
of the farm marketings of basic crops, had to be acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). The stimulus to overproduction of
basic crops continued in 1954-55. From mid-1952 to mid-1955, when
prices of all six basic crops were supported at 90 percent of old parities, CCC
inventories and commitments for these commodities rose from 1.2 billion
dollars to 6.0 billion.




55

As soon as previous regulations could be terminated, this Administration
took steps to cope with the growing surpluses, under discretion permitted
by the Agricultural Act of 1949. The price-support level for dairy products
was reduced on April 1, 1954 to 75 percent of parity, with the aim of reducing surplus stocks, encouraging consumption, and thus improving the position of dairy farmers. Price supports were lowered for flaxseed, soybeans,
and dry beans harvested in 1954 and for feed grains and cottonseed harvested in 1955, so that these products might compete more effectively in
the markets for which they are produced. Acreage allotments and marketing quotas were authorized for 1954 crops of wheat, cotton, tobacco,
and peanuts. To avoid extreme acreage reductions in one year, the
Congress determined that the full reductions should not be applied to
cotton and wheat until 1955.
The Congress incorporated major Administration proposals in the Agricultural Act of 1954, which was designed to strengthen the foundations
of agriculture and to yield beneficial results over the years. This Act
authorized the first departure from price supports on basic crops at 90
percent of parity, which had been inaugurated in 1942 to stimulate production to meet war needs. It provided for flexibility in these price supports, eventually within the range of 90 to 75 percent of modernized parities.
Thus far, however, 90 percent supports have continued to apply on cotton,
tobacco, and peanuts; and despite the adjustment in price supports on
wheat and rice for harvest in 1955, these products have not moved freely
into domestic use or export. The attainment of a balance between production and market demand has been severely handicapped by the huge
stocks accumulated under provisions of earlier legislation, and also by the
failure of acreage allotments to bring about corresponding reductions in
farm output.
Cotton acreage allotments in 1954 and 1955 were set at the minimums
permitted by law, with the object of reducing production to 10 million
bales in 1955. Actually, because of remarkably increased yields, the 1954
crop exceeded the production goal by 15 percent, and the 1955 crop by
nearly 50 percent. Wheat yields have not risen as rapidly, but the amounts
produced on the minimum acreage allotment permitted by law (55 million
acres) have continued to exceed domestic and export needs. Similar
results have been experienced with other basic commodities. Hence carryovers of these commodities and feed grains have risen in 1952-55. For
most commodities, moreover, the proportion of total carry-overs held by
the CCC has been increasing; on June 30, 1955 about 97 percent of the
wheat carry-over was in its hands.
The production-control programs that have been operated for basic
commodities, which account for about one-fourth of the total income from
farm marketings, have indirectly contributed to lower incomes for the producers of other important commodities. Farmers with acreage diverted
from basic crops have deemed it more profitable to produce feed grains or




56

other crops, even at lowered support prices, than to let this part of their
land lie idle. Many have expanded their hog and beef cattle numbers to
use the additional feed thus produced, adding further to the expansion
induced by relatively favorable livestock prices in earlier years. Dairy
feeding rates have also been increased. These factors have been largely
responsible for lower prices of beef cattle and sharply lower prices of hogs
in 1955, and a continued increase in production of dairy products.
Unrealistic supports have not merely overstimulated production of several
basic farm products in this country and abroad; they have also impeded
normal flow into feed use and export. Feed use of wheat is no larger than
in former periods of scarcity, while food use has been virtually constant for
many years, and seed use has dropped as acreage has been restricted. Practically all our wheat and flour exports now move only under direct subsidy or
under special export programs. In fiscal year 1955 the average subsidy
on wheat exported under the International Wheat Agreement was about
75 cents per bushel. In December 1955 American wheats were selling on
domestic markets around 65 cents per bushel above equivalent export prices.
Our cotton is steadily losing ground in competition with synthetic fibers
and paper, and is rapidly losing export markets to foreign producers who
have stepped up their production at prices made remunerative by American
price supports. In 1954-55 over 40 percent of our cotton exports were
moved under special programs, including Export-Import Bank loans. In
the current marketing year the disparity between prices of American and
foreign cottons is much wider than hitherto, and commercial exports are
running extremely low. In short, cotton growers now face the threat of
a drastic, permanent shrinkage of their commercial markets. Tobacco
exports are holding up well, despite expansion of foreign production, but
increasing proportions are moved under special export programs. Since
1953 commercial exports of American rice have declined radically, and
outlets for surplus rice in CGG hands are found with great difficulty either
at home or abroad.
With additional authority granted by the Congress during the past two
years, the Administration has made great efforts to dispose of surplus accumulations at home and abroad, as well as to enlarge the domestic use of
livestock products that tend to be in surplus. The Agricultural Act of 1954
authorized the GCC to use 50 million dollars annually to increase the
consumption of milk by school children, and to make available to the Armed
Services dairy products acquired in price-support operations. The Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 gave the CCG
additional authority to use surplus agricultural commodities in barter
transactions, and for famine relief or other emergencies in friendly countries.
It also authorized in Title I the sale of these products to friendly nations
for foreign currencies. In mid-1955 the authorization to reimburse the
CCC for losses on sales under Title I was increased from the original 700
million dollars to 1,500 million dollars for the three fiscal years 1955-57.




57

In fiscal 1955, exports sold for foreign currencies totaled 345 million dollars;
exports bartered for strategic and other materials amounted to 125 million
dollars; and shipments under grant programs of the International Cooperation Administration totaled 381 million dollars. The moderate rise in our
total agricultural exports from the low of 1952-53 is more than accounted
for by subsidized sales, sales for foreign currencies, sacrifice sales, and
donations.
Recent administrative actions have helped in other ways to alleviate
temporary market surpluses and to reduce CCG stocks. Examples are
(1) liberal donations for school-lunch programs, to charitable institutions,
and—with the aid of private philanthropic organizations—to needy people
overseas; (2) payment of export subsidies on certain citrus fruits; (3) in
view of the large 1955 crops, payments to divert white potatoes to starch and
feed use, and the purchase of sweet potatoes for use in school lunches; (4)
inauguration in the fall of 1955 of a program of purchase of pork products
and lard; and (5) gradual sale of CGC holdings of wool on competitive bids
beginning in November 1955.
The Administration is intensifying its efforts in these directions. Yet
experience shows that there are limits to expanding the noncommercial
disposal of farm products. Beyond some point, commercial sales are merely
displaced, without increasing total consumption. At home, the displacement may be of the same or competing commodities; abroad, our own commercial exports or those of friendly nations may be displaced. Moreover, domestic producers in an importing country, even if its people are
ill-fed and ill-clothed, may feel adversely affected. The difficulties are
greatest with our largest surpluses, those of cotton and wheat. Extreme
care is necessary to avoid disrupting world markets and damaging the
delicate fabric of our foreign relations.
Increasingly vigorous surplus disposals have achieved substantial reductions in CCG stocks of some commodities and retarded the increase of
others. Surplus disposals of agricultural commodities by the CCC have
risen from 520 million dollars in fiscal year 1953 to 1,424 million in
fiscal 1954, and 2,115 million in fiscal 1955. The realized losses on such
disposals account for much of the increase in total costs of "programs
primarily for stabilization of farm prices and income" which were 330
million dollars in fiscal 1953, 963 million in fiscal 1954, and about 1,300
million in fiscal 1955. Meanwhile, total CCC inventories and commitments rose from 1.4 billion dollars in mid-1952 to over 7.0 billion in mid1955. Chiefly because of huge feed grain supplies and extraordinarily high
cotton yields, CCC stocks in 1956 will probably be still higher.
The Federal Government has thus assumed heavy financial burdens on
behalf of agriculture during the past three years. Increasing proportions
of gross and net farm income have come from the public Treasury. In
spite of this, farm income has declined and many fanners have continued
to be subject to tight restrictions. In considerable part, these are conse-




58

quences of price supports that are out of line with market conditions, and
of production restraints that do not work well.
It is clear that price supports at 90 percent of parity for basic commodities,
after thorough test, have failed in recent years to maintain farm prices
and farm income. They have delayed realistic adjustment of farm output
to altered domestic and export demands. They have indeed cushioned
declines of prices for producers of supported commodities; but, contrary
to intentions, they have prolonged the period and extended the scope of
declines in farm prices and incomes. To go back to high, rigid price supports, as some have urged, would only make the situation worse.
The position we have reached clearly requires further revision in agricultural programs that will lead toward the goals of a stable and prosperous
agriculture, with production in balance with market demand, at costs
and prices that permit good farmers to earn remunerative returns
with substantial freedom in managing their enterprises. In view of the
size of stocks accumulated, and the persistent tendency to annual additions, these high goals cannot be reached at once, but we must move
energetically toward them.
Present agricultural conditions call for an attack on several fronts.
Surplus stocks must be reduced. Annual surpluses of important products
must be cut at their source, and soil conservation must be extended on land
now contributing to such surpluses. Additional voluntary reductions in
crop acreage must be induced by payments to offset the consequent loss of
income from farming. Various modifications in commodity programs and
a relaxation of present restrictions on farmers, where feasible, are required.
Stress should be laid on enlarging outlets for farm products, on means of
reducing production costs, and on ways of helping farm people to earn more
income.
The special Message on Agriculture of January 9, 1956 therefore recommended a number of measures to promote economic readjustments in
agriculture. Chief among these is the two-part Soil Bank Program designed to reduce current output of farm products, particularly of those
commodities in greatest surplus. Also included are proposals to speed
surplus disposal, broaden outlets for farm products, reduce farm production costs, improve farm credit facilities, and expand agricultural research.
The Message recommended that the Congress consider a program for
stimulating voluntary additional reductions in the acreage planted to wheat,
cotton, corn, and rice. Under the proposed Acreage Reserve Program,
growers of these crops will be asked to reduce plantings below their allotments in return for negotiable certificates entitling them to cash or to
specified quantities of the commodity from CCC stocks. Thus, surplus
stocks can be used to meet portions of current market demand without
reducing the net farm income of the growers. Under existing conditions
special problems arise in connection with corn. If, therefore, the Congress should choose not to authorize the Acreage Reserve Program for




59

corn, an alternative might be considered, namely, to eliminate acreage
allotments and put corn price supports on a discretionary basis comparable
with other feed grains. This course might also be considered with respect
to rice, on which both acreage and marketing controls are in effect.
The proposed Conservation Reserve Program—the second part of the
Soil Bank—is designed to alleviate the declines in income of producers of
cultivated crops and livestock that have resulted from the increased
supplies of feed grains and other crops grown on "diverted acres." All
farmers will be offered the opportunity to withdraw some cropland from
current production. To achieve this reduction in acreage and to assure
the conservation of this land for future use as needed, the Federal Government will provide financial assistance to farmers in establishing the appropriate protective cover, and will also make annual payments related to the
length of time needed to establish the new use of the land. It is anticipated
that this program will reduce the acreage planted to feed grains, thus
restricting the expansion of livestock production.
To insure that the increased acreage in protective uses will not lead to
expansion of forage-consuming livestock, it has been recommended that
grazing be prohibited on the land put into the Acreage Reserve and, for a
specified period, on land retired from crop production under the Conservation Reserve Program.
The Soil Bank Program will of course be operative in the Great Plains
States. It should be supplemented there by a special Great Plains Program, which has been developed through intensive studies and cooperative
efforts of Federal, State, and local interests. In portions of ten Western
States between the Corn Belt and the Rocky Mountains, high prices during and after World War II drew into hazardous crop production, notably
wheat, much land that should be in permanent grass. To speed the return
to sounder land use and better-balanced farm practices in this area, additional legislation is being proposed.
The Rural Development Program was initiated in 1955 as a long-run
cooperative undertaking to help farm families in a low-income range to
improve their earning power. Most of these farmers do not contribute
appreciably to farm marketings or benefit from price supports. Some are
small-scale commercial farmers who come under price-support programs,
especially for cotton and tobacco, but their incomes have been low even
when farm prices have been highest. While the Rural Development Program cannot yield substantial results quickly, it is of high importance as a
means of developing agriculture's human resources, as explained further
below.
Many parts of our agricultural policy are working well and require only
moderate changes. These together with the new measures now put forward, as set forth in the recent Message on Agriculture and the Budget
Message, constitute a many-sided attack on the ills that beset agriculture
in spite of, and in part because of, its great productive strength. There




60

is n* sure and easy cure for persisting surplus conditions. We must continue to be on guard lest measures designed to help do harm instead, and
we must be ready to adjust our programs as experience may dictate. The
programs now recommended, if framed wisely and adopted promptly, will
promote the welfare of farmers and the Nation.
II. HELPING LOCAL COMMUNITIES REDUCE UNEMPLOYMENT

Just as the recent decline of agricultural income requires the attention
of the Federal Government, so too does the problem of substantial unemployment which has persisted in some urban communities despite the attainment of practically full employment in the Nation at large. Local unemployment often proves stubborn when it stems from special causes, such as a
dwindling market for the products in which a community has specialized,
the removal of one or more of its key firms to other places, a lag in the technology of its principal industry, or the depletion of a natural resource on
which the local economy is based. As noted in last year's Economic Report,
"such 'structural* or 'spot' unemployment may remain even when the Nation's economy practically reaches full employment." The expansion of
general economic activity during the past year has indeed sharply reduced
the number of areas suffering from chronic unemployment, but it has not
eliminated the problem any more than have previous expansions in our
history or in that of other industrialized nations.
The fate of distressed communities is a matter of national as well as local
concern. At present, numerous private groups, as well as State and local
agencies, are assisting communities troubled with serious unemployment
in working out practical solutions. The Federal Government has also
actively interested itself in the problem. As far as feasible, government
contracts are being placed with firms in labor surplus areas. An inducement has been given to the location of defense production facilities in such
areas by allowing tax amortization benefits beyond those granted elsewhere.
Also, the Office of Area Development in the Department of Commerce has
been enlarged, so that it could better serve local needs. Although these
programs have proved helpful, experience demonstrates that bolder measures are needed. To this end, a new Area Assistance Program is recommended for aiding communities that have experienced persistent and
substantial unemployment.
The program is designed around four major principles. First, Federal
assistance should aim at helping communities to help themselves. Major
responsibility in planning and financing the economic redevelopment of
their communities must remain with local citizens. Second, the program
should aim at lasting improvement of job opportunities by the establishment or expansion of productive industries. Projects that generate only
temporary employment do not help a community solve its basic problems
and may even worsen its predicament. Third, Federal assistance should




61

be contingent on the active participation of governmental authorities who
are close to the troubled community; that is, the State or local government or a community-sponsored development or credit corporation must
provide part of any financial assistance required for specific projects.
Fourth, Federal aid must not be extended to a community if the proposed
project will create unemployment in some other area.
In line with these principles, a new unit—Area Assistance Administration—is proposed in the Department of Commerce, to be headed by
an Administrator and to be aided by an Advisory Board consisting of the
Secretary of Commerce as Chairman, the Secretaries of Labor, Agriculture, Treasury, and Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Administrators of the Housing and Home Finance Agency and the Small Business
Administration. The Area Assistance Administration will provide technical assistance to communities or larger areas, either directly or through
grants, for studying their resources and preparing practical plans for
industrial development. It will also extend capital improvement loans
for projects that promise to improve a community's long-run economic
outlook but for which financing cannot be obtained on reasonable terms
from private sources. The loans should be made in participation with
the State or local government, acting either directly or through a proper
community agency. The Federal loan should not exceed, say, 25 percent
of the cost of the project, while the State or local share must not fall short
of, say, 15 percent. This loan program should be confined to communities that have had an unemployment rate of around 8 percent or more
during the greater part of the preceding two years. But the loans should
be available for a wide range of projects, such as the construction of industrial facilities, the purchase and alteration of existing facilities, or
the consolidation and development of tracts for industrial sites.
Areas suffering from chronic unemployment could also be helped to
develop their economic base by changes in certain programs currently
administered by the Housing and Home Finance Agency. Congress should
authorize the Housing and Home Finance Administrator to give priority
to applications received from areas of substantial and persistent unemployment for Federal aid in financing needed public facilities under Title II
of the Housing Amendments of 1955. Also, Title I of the Housing Act
of 1949 should be amended to make benefits under the Urban Renewal
Program available for industrial redevelopment of business sections in these
areas.
Besides undertaking the functions of technical assistance and of lending
for capital improvements, the Area Assistance Administration will need to
concern itself with aiding communities in making effective use of the numerous Federal programs already available to local economies, such as the
inter-area placement service of the United States Employment Service and
its State affiliates, the lending program of the Small Business Administration, and the program of vocational education of the Department of Health,




6a

Education, and Welfare. Only by properly coordinating its own functions
with related activities of other agencies, including those of the States and
localities, will the projected Area Assistance Administration be able to
realize the great promise of reducing pockets of chronic unemployment
without unduly heavy costs to the Federal Government or undue interference in local affairs.
To put the new program of community assistance into effect, it has been
recommended that a revolving loan fund of 50 million dollars be established
for the Area Assistance Administration, and that an adequate appropriation
be made to cover its technical assistance program. The latter program
should not be confined to areas of chronic unemployment. On the contrary, its scope should be wide and designed to aid both urban and rural
communities in developing balanced and progressive economies. Attention should also be given to skill improvement programs. All these are
activities in which State universities and other local institutions can be very
helpful, and they deserve encouragement.
III. LIFTING INCOMES BY RAISING PRODUCTIVITY

The wide diffusion of expanding incomes in the United States is the outstanding social achievement of our time. As tens of millions move steadily
from one rung of the income ladder to the next and higher rung, disparities
of income are lessened. The ownership of a good home and automobile by an American family is now the rule rather than the exception.
Opportunities for cultural as well as material improvement have become
larger. The past year has brought additional and widespread advances
in general well-being. Nevertheless, too many families and individuals
still have to get along on incomes that are inadequate by American standards. The situation keeps changing, and the dimensions of present-day
poverty are not reliably measured. Yet there can be no better time than
the present, when the Nation as a whole is enjoying unprecedented prosperity, to make a special effort to improve the economic status of the least
fortunate among us.
The causes of low incomes are many. Special measures—both private
and governmental—are needed to cope with some of them, such as protracted illness, and they are considered later. But the basic cause of low
incomes has always been low productivity, irregular employment, or both.
By pursuing policies that foster a high level of employment, extensive investment in new and more efficient tools of production, the improvement of
general education, and the extension of research and development, the
Government makes the largest contribution of which it is capable to the
lifting of low incomes. When jobs are readily available and the productivity of labor is rising, as has been notably the case in recent years, the most
powerful forces of all are already at work for lifting low incomes. The
Government can, however, still do a great deal to help people who have

been left behind in the onrush of progress, by undertaking special programs
for raising their productivity. It is highly important that efforts in this
direction be extended.
One of the largest groups of low-income families is in rural areas, mostly
on farms too small for efficient operation. It includes many part-time
farmers. These low-income farm families are widely distributed, but a
large proportion live in the South. The Department of Agriculture
explored this problem in a detailed report, Development of Agriculture's
Human Resources, presented in April 1955. Subsequently, a special Message to the Congress urged the prompt launching of a long-range rural
development program aimed at helping these families improve their
economic status, and requested a special appropriation for the purpose.
Under the leadership of the Department of Agriculture, the Rural
Development Program was inaugurated in June 1955. The program rests
on two basic principles. First, lasting improvement can be achieved only
by increasing the productive capacities of individuals and by enlarging the
economic base of rural communities. Second, cooperation of Federal and
State agencies, as well as of local and private groups, is essential for success.
By the end of 1955, pilot operations had been started under State and local
leadership in 30 counties and local trade areas in 12 States. The selected
areas vary widely in type of farming, economic resources and potentials,
extent of industry, and other respects. Thus, the local programs being
developed will vary over a wide range, and should yield invaluable
experience as the whole program is expanded.
Numerous constructive activities are already under way. Improvements
are being made in the facilities for general education and for vocational
training. Improved health and nutrition are being promoted. Members of farm families are being helped to make fuller use of State employment counselling and placement services. Farm, business, and civic
groups, working cooperatively with Federal and State officials, are attempting to bring more industry into low-income rural areas and to develop
better-rounded rural economies. The Federal Government is assisting in
still other ways. The Farmers Home Administration has allocated funds
for loans to small farmers in pilot areas where additional capital, unavailable through private sources, is needed to make farm improvements that
promise to raise productivity. The Soil Conservation Service and the
Forest Service are assisting the pilot programs in their respective fields of
competence. The Agricultural Research Service is attempting to determine how small farmers may most successfully conduct their farm operations. All Federal activities connected with the Rural Development
Program are being coordinated by an interagency committee, and the
Federal Extension staff is assisting the State Extension Services in guiding
the pilot operations.
The Rural Development Program is a soundly conceived and basic approach toward solving a highly important social and economic problem.




66

This promising program requires greater Federal support. The Congress is
urged to enact legislation which will permit the Federal Government's contribution to the program to be expanded, in line with recommendations
previously made.
As a result of the White House Conference on Education, the need for
improving our scheme of elementary and secondary education is better
understood across the Nation. But we must also seek to improve the effectiveness of adult and vocational education in both urban and rural areas.
Well-directed programs of vocational training can help people, those in
the middle or advanced ages of life as well as young men and women, to
become more skilled workers and earn larger incomes. The major part
of the extensive facilities now available for this type of education is supplied
by State and local governments. The Federal Government should continue its program of grants to aid and stimulate the States in this important
work.
Vocational rehabilitation provides a means by which specialized treatment and education help disabled individuals to improve their incomes.
Over 600,000 veterans, who became disabled during World War II and
the Korean conflict, have received special training under a program of
the Veterans Administration. Also, the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare administers a
program of grants-in-aid to the States, designed to restore handicapped
men and women to lives of usefulness and independence. Since 1950 about
60,000 persons have been rehabilitated annually. As a result of legislation
in 1954, the States now have an opportunity to expand this vital activity.
It is hoped that the States will enlarge their programs of vocational rehabilitation accordingly, so that the productivity of their disabled citizens may be
increased. It is also hoped that the acceptance of these rehabilitated workers in useful employment will continue to grow through the activities of the
President's Committee on Employment of the Physically Handicapped and
associated efforts.
Despite all that may be done through education and other means to
raise the productivity of individuals and thereby improve their economic
status, some will continue to receive low incomes. Minimum wage laws
do not deal with the fundamental causes of low incomes. Accordingly,
this condition can be corrected only to a limited extent by such laws.
However, as pointed out in the last Economic Report, minimum wage
laws can assist the comparatively small number of workers who are at
the fringes of competitive labor markets. Last year's Report therefore
urged the Congress to increase the minimum wage from 75 cents to 90
cents an hour. It also pointed out that the lowest paid workers are currently excluded from the protection of the minimum wage, that its coverage
is no less important than its amount, and that an effort should therefore
be made by the Congress and the States to bring additional workers under
cover of the law. Some advances were made by the States during 1955,




67

and it is hoped that this progress will continue. The Congress also raised
the minimum, but did not act on coverage. By setting the minimum at
one dollar per hour instead of 90 cents, it has become more difficult to
widen the coverage without causing serious economic disturbance in certain areas and fields of activity. Yet the need for an extension of coverage
remains, and the Congress is again requested to proceed as far as is practical
in this direction.
IV.

IMPROVING THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF OLDER PERSONS

Families headed by older individuals account for a large proportion of the families with low incomes. To a considerable extent,
therefore, the task of lifting low incomes consists in raising the productivity of older persons, facilitating their access to employment, and
strengthening the private and public programs that contribute to their economic security. This aspect of the low-income problem will become
increasingly important as the number of older persons and their proportion
in the adult population increase. For that reason an Interdepartmental
Working Group on Aging is concerning itself now with policies favoring
the employment of older persons, including those who have yet to reach
retirement age, and with the consideration of their needs in programs for
education, rehabilitation, housing, health, and recreation. A broad study of
employment-hiring practices, of the productivity of older workers, of counselling methods, and other aspects of this important subject is under way in
the Department of Labor.
The Federal Government has already taken significant steps to improve
the economic status of older persons, both before and after retirement age.
To enlarge their access to employment, the Federal-State Employment
Services give special attention to older workers in job placement. In 1954
about 10 million additional workers were brought into the system of Old
Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI). At the same time the benefits were
raised, and the law was modified to encourage retired persons to
engage in some remunerative work. At present about 9 out of every 10
workers are covered or are eligible for coverage under this insurance system,
which helps sustain the independence and dignity of people in their declining
years. About two-fifths of all persons 65 years or older are now receiving
OASI benefits and this proportion will increase. As a result, fewer persons
will be obliged to seek public assistance. Contributing to the same end
are the pensions available to elderly veterans who have nonservice-connected
disabilities and receive limited incomes.
Business firms have also made great strides in providing retirement benefits
for their employees. Private employee pension plans now cover some 13 million persons. The number of retired workers drawing benefits under these
plans has been estimated at about 800,000, about twice the number of beneficiaries four years ago.




68

Additional measures, both private and governmental, are needed to
advance the status of the elderly. One is the further extension of the
coverage of OASI to self-employed groups and other workers not yet included. Since the Federal Government employs many in the latter group,
it should grant the basic protection of OASI to its personnel, and make
suitable adjustments in present retirement programs. It would also be
helpful if business firms reviewed their pension programs with a view to
making the vesting privileges more liberal and to adjusting the conditions
for retirement so that older persons who remain vigorous and highly productive can remain longer in useful work. As a safeguard for our rapidly
increasing private pension funds, it would be desirable to require Federal
registration of these plans and reports on their administration and finances.
Private welfare funds should be handled in similar fashion, and the Congress
is requested to enact legislation toward both purposes.
Another need of many elderly persons is greater protection against the
economic hardships of illness. This need of retired workers should be
borne in mind, as far as practicable, in employer-sponsored health insurance
programs. Also, the extension of commercial prepaid health insurance
plans to older people requires encouragement. Reinsurance through pooling
of risks by private carriers, or if need be through a Federal program, would
be a constructive step in this connection.
The problem of adequate housing for the elderly requires special consideration. It would be desirable to give preference to older persons and their
immediate families in admission to Federally assisted public housing projects. States and municipalities should consider adopting a similar policy.
The National Housing Act should be amended to authorize insurance under
especially favorable mortgage terms for apartment projects built by nonprofit organizations for occupancy by elderly persons. Favorable mortgage
insurance terms should also be accorded other multiunit rental projects
designed for at least partial occupancy by the elderly. Finally, provision
should be made to permit third parties, which could be either organizations
or individuals, to guarantee monthly interest and amortization payments
in behalf of older persons buying a home under a Federally insured
mortgage.
V. COPING W I T H PERSONAL HARDSHIPS

In considering the problems of agriculture, of chronic "spot" unemployment, of low-income families, and of elderly persons, we have seen
that it is possible to design constructive programs to improve the economic
status of people who have not participated fully in the advance of prosperity, and that it is not necessary to rely exclusively on the Federal Government in doing so. We now turn to other economic difficulties, those
which sometimes bring financial ruin or a loss of security to individuals




and families. Sound ways of mitigating such hardships can be found, and
we should go about this task with determination.
The severity of the floods that occurred last year in the Northeast and the
Far West has emphasized again the need for protection against the human
and economic losses resulting from such catastrophes. Many private groups
and individuals, as well as the Federal, State, and local governments,
offered prompt and generous assistance to the communities and citizens
struck by disaster. Nevertheless, needs of this type should be reduced in
the future, and when they arise should be met more systematically. Toward
these ends it is recommended, first, that the Federal Government accelerate work on practical flood control projects, and second, that it provide
reinsurance for private carriers offering flood insurance. We must not
stop, however, with the second measure since private carriers, lacking a
firm actuarial basis, may be unable to offer the desired protection on the
scale that is needed. To provide against this contingency, a joint FederalState program for indemnifying flood victims on losses to real property,
business inventories, and household effects should be authorized. The
necessary costs can be met partly by premiums paid by private citizens
desiring flood protection, and partly by Federal and State contributions.
As experience under the proposed program accumulates, private carriers
may be able to offer policies at costs which will render unnecessary the
continued operation of a government-supported indemnity plan.
Reduced economic circumstances of people are frequently associated
with misfortunes which carry with them financial costs that exceed the
resources of even provident folk. Prominent among the causes of such
personal hardship is severe and protracted sickness, sometimes requiring
long hospitalization. The cost of providing for catastrophic illness through
regular insurance payments would be modest, but insufficient progress has
as yet been made with this type of insurance despite the remarkable spread
of voluntary health insurance plans. Very recently, some business firms
have begun to provide broadened health insurance for their employees, and
this development deserves every encouragement. Also, private insuring
organizations should be encouraged to extend voluntary health prepayment
plans in two directions, first, to cover catastrophic illness, second, to cover
persons not now being reached through usual group enrollment methods.
Permissive legislation for private pooling of risks or Federal reinsurance may
be needed for this purpose.
Our oldest form of social insurance is workmen's compensation, now
universally accepted as a fair means for relieving the financial burden on
individuals of industrial injuries and occupationally connected diseases.
With the encouragement of the Department of Labor, 42 State legislatures
acted in 1955 to strengthen their legislation on workmen's compensation.
In 35 States these legislative changes brought an improvement in benefit




70

provisions. The States are urged to extend this great advance by making
further necessary improvements. At the same time, to meet more adequately the industrial hazards faced by workers under Federal jurisdiction, the Congress is urged to increase the benefits available under
the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, as recommended last year. But we must keep in mind that compensation and rehabilitation, despite their obvious importance, are poor substitutes for the prevention of occupational injuries and diseases. Much progress has been
made in this field, but efforts to improve occupational safety and hygiene
should be intensified; they deserve the fullest support of the Government,
employers, employees, and labor unions.
Loss of income as a result of temporary disability that is not workconnected, no less than unemployment caused by economic factors or by
work-connected disability, causes serious drains on family resources. Many
private firms have voluntarily sought to protect their employees against
this hazard, and four States now require that they do so. Legislation to
provide nonoccupational temporary disability insurance for workers in the
District of Columbia was recommended in the State of the Union Message.
The Congress is requested to require District employers to provide the needed
insurance either directly or through private carriers, on a basis that would
divide the costs of the stipulated benefits between the employer and his
employees. The States are also urged to consider the neglected problem
of loss of income through nonoccupational temporary disability.
The personal and family hardships that arise from loss of employment
have been considerably alleviated by the Federal-State system of unemployment insurance. Important improvements have been made in this system
in the last two years but further progress is needed. We return to this
problem later in the Report.
There is also a need for attending constructively to some human difficulties that arise in the process of carrying out urban renewal programs.
The scope of this activity, which promises so much for the future of our
cities, is increasing. Since renewal programs involve the demolition of
large areas, many urban families inescapably lose their homes in the process.
Large numbers of them find satisfactory housing elsewhere; but in view of
the part that the Government plays in urban renewal, it should where
necessary assist the displaced families. To meet this need largely through
private enterprise, the Congress was requested in 1954 to establish a program of Federal loan insurance which would have made home mortgage
credit on exceptionally favorable terms available to individuals displaced
from their homes by urban renewal or other public projects. The program
enacted by the Congress fell short of the Administration's proposal and has
so far made little contribution to the solution of the problem. It is recommended that the Congress amend the present law, so that it will conform
more closely to the recommendations previously made.




Chapter 4

Building for Future Prosperity

I

T IS FITTING and proper, as the preceding Chapter has urged, that
we make the extension of prosperity to lagging sectors our peculiar
concern at this favorable juncture of the Nation's history. In the measure
that we succeed in drawing into the stream of progress the less flourishing
parts of the economy, to that extent shall we strengthen the base of future
prosperity as well as enhance the general welfare. But as we go about
the task of extending the scope of prosperity, it is essential that we never
lose sight of the fundamental objective of extending prosperity itself into
the future. We must always keep before us two great truths: First, lasting
prosperity of the Nation depends far more on what individuals do for
themselves than on what the Federal Government does or can do for
them. Second, the rate of our economic advance in the years ahead will
depend largely on our ability as a people to preserve an environment that
rewards individual initiative and encourages enterprise, innovation, and
investment.
A Government that earnestly seeks to build for the Nation's long-range
prosperity has clear-cut responsibilities. It should administer the public
finances with a keen sense of awareness of the impact that the Government's huge operations have on the economy. It should safeguard competition and firmly resist any outcroppings of monopoly. It should encourage home ownership, better homes, and sound neighborhoods. It
should lead the States and localities in a mutual endeavor to fill the
Nation's vast needs for public facilities on which the growth of the private
economy so largely depends. It should foster education, science, technology, and creative research. It should constantly strive to strengthen our ties
of trade, investment, and enterprise with other nations of the Free World.
And it should improve the defenses of our economy against the threat of
both inflation and recession. These objectives are worthy of our best efforts
in the year that lies ahead.
I. PRESERVING SOUND FEDERAL FINANCES

Sound management of the Government's fiscal affairs requires the observance of certain fundamental principles. First, the budget should provide
adequately for the Nation's security and other urgent needs. Second, all
governmental operations should be conducted with prudence and economy.




72

Third, sufficient revenues should be raised to meet the Government's outlays, if not every individual year, then surely over a term of very few years.
Fourth, the cost of government should be distributed fairly among taxpayers. Fifth, revenues should be raised in ways that interfere as little as
possible with incentives to work, to venture, or to invest. Sixth, the public
debt should be managed so as to contribute to stable economic growth.
A brief review of how these principles have recently been applied will
help to indicate the fiscal policy that in current circumstances will best
serve the Nation's interests.
The past three years have been marked by substantial achievements in
bringing Federal expenditures and revenues into balance. Budget expenditures were reduced from 74.3 billion dollars in fiscal year 1953 to 64.6 billion in 1955, a drop of 9.7 billion. A slight further reduction is estimated
for fiscal year 1956. These economies and a rising national income have
made it possible to reduce taxes and yet move decisively toward a balanced
budget. In fiscal year 1955 the budgetary deficit amounted to 4.2 billion
dollars, compared with a deficit of 9.4 billion in 1953. For the present
fiscal year, a balanced administrative budget is in prospect. The showing
of the consolidated cash budget, which includes transactions of the various
trust funds, will be more favorable still. It may be reasonably expected
that the cash budget will register a surplus of over 2 billion dollars for the
current fiscal year.
In formulating its fiscal policies, the Administration has given careful
consideration to the effects of taxation and governmental finances on the
general economy. The record is clear and instructive. In the spring of
1953, when inflation was still a real danger, a Message to the Congress
recommended that the excess profits tax, which was then in effect, be
extended six months beyond its expiration date of June 30, 1953. The
decision to extend this burdensome and unpopular tax was taken because
it would have been imprudent to increase the deficit and the public debt
under the conditions prevailing at the time. In September 1953, when it
became clear that the inflationary threat had passed and that government
expenditures were being reduced, the Administration announced that,
besides relinquishing the excess profits tax, it would not recommend any
postponement of the reduction of individual income taxes scheduled for
January 1, 1954.
Early in 1954, when a mild economic contraction was under way, extensive changes in the tax structure were proposed to promote economic
growth. The Congress responded by liberalizing depreciation allowances,
by extending the period over which business losses could be carried back
in computing the income tax, by permitting more liberal treatment of
research and development as a current expense, by reducing the double
taxation of dividend income, and by lowering excise taxes. In addition,
several inequities in the personal income tax were corrected, in line with
recommendations. Taken altogether the tax reductions that were carried

through during 1954 amounted to 7.4 billion dollars on a full-year basis.
Allowing for the increase in social security contributions which became
effective January 1, 1954, there was still a saving to individuals and businesses of 6.1 billion dollars. This huge reduction in taxes was a powerful
aid in bolstering consumer purchasing power and investment incentives at
a time when output and employment were tending to decline.
By the end of 1954, the business hesitation that had prevailed at the
beginning of the year largely disappeared. Output, employment, and
incomes were again rising impressively, but the Federal budget remained
out of balance. In these circumstances, as explained earlier in this Report,
it was desirable to postpone the reduction in the corporate income tax and
in certain excise taxes that was scheduled for April 1, 1955. Congress
adopted the Administration's recommendations, and the timely application
of this fiscal restraint contributed materially not only to the balanced budget
that is now in prospect, but also to the attainment of prosperity without
inflation during the year.
The Treasury's management of the public debt has also been carried out
with an eye to the needs of the economy. By skillful planning and timing,
its debt operations have been coordinated with monetary and fiscal policies
and have helped to reinforce them. Despite variations in economic and
financial conditions, the Treasury has made good progress in lengthening
its outstanding maturities. Since January 1953, the Treasury's marketable
debt running for more than five years has been increased by about 9 billion
dollars. Simultaneously, the debt maturing or callable within one year
has been reduced by 13 billion. As a result of this readjustment of maturities, the Treasury's operations are less exposed to the hazard of market
fluctuations. Its needs in turn are less of a disturbing factor in the money
market, thus giving the Federal Reserve System greater freedom in monetary
operations.
The broad principles that have successfully guided our fiscal policy in
recent years should continue to govern our actions. The demands on the
Federal budget are very heavy and some of them—notably, the national
security programs—are becoming even larger. In addition, new programs
are needed to assist agriculture, to aid school construction, to promote
development in scattered urban communities that have been experiencing
chronic unemployment, to establish a flood indemnity program, and for
other essential purposes. Only a higher level of tax revenues in fiscal
year 1957, combined with rigid economies in managing governmental
operations, will permit a modest enlargement of essential Federal expenditures within the framework of a balanced budget.
Present tax levels are very high and they impose a heavy burden on
individuals and business concerns. But in view of existing economic conditions and present budget estimates, an early reduction of taxes cannot
now be justified. To add further to our public debt in order to win for
ourselves a reduction in taxes, which in the current state of high prosperity




75

might chiefly serve to raise prices, would be irresponsible. In times like
these we should bend our thoughts to the desirability of debt reduction,
and not concentrate exclusively on the desirability of tax reduction. Once
a budgetary surplus comes definitely into sight and economic conditions
continue to be favorable, we should begin reducing our huge public debt.
Such an act of fiscal integrity would signify with unmistakable clarity that
our democracy is capable of self-discipline. It would add to the confidence
that people need to have in their Government, if they are to plan boldly
for their own and their children's economic future.
Two measures are recommended for early action by the Congress. First,
the reductions in excises and in the corporate income tax that are now
scheduled for April 1, 1956 should be postponed again. Second, legislation
allowing a temporary increase in the statutory debt limit should be continued. This legislation is needed because of the seasonal disparities between expenditures and income, the limited cash balances with which
Treasury operations are now being conducted, and the small gap between
the outstanding debt and the temporary statutory limit of 281 billion dollars.
II. FOSTERING COMPETITIVE ENTERPRISE

One of the basic tenets of this Administration is that competitive markets
are a more efficient instrument than governmental directives for organizing
production and consumption. Another is that a free and competitive
economy promotes industrial versatility, innovation, and investment to a
greater degree and with more assurance of continuity than can be attained
in an intricately regulated or cartelized economy. These fundamental
beliefs are deeply rooted in our Nation's history, and they have been confirmed once again by the experience of the last three years. The relative
ease and rapidity with which our economy adjusted to the reduction in
military expenditures following the end of the Korean conflict, and the
vigorous expansion that ensued in 1955, reflect the creative powers of an
enterprise system subject to a minimum of restraints and operating in an
atmosphere of confidence. The fostering of competitive enterprise, so
heavily stressed in the Employment Act, is and must remain one of the
leading objectives of policy.
In considering what government can do to maintain competitive markets,
it is well to remember that an open economic system is more an expression
of the character and will of a people than the result of any specific acts of
government. Yet there are ways in which government can usefully
contribute to the strengthening of competitive enterprise.
First, and most important, is the maintenance of monetary, fiscal, and
housekeeping policies that promote high and rising levels of economic
activity. The rate at which new businesses are established is highest when
prospects for profit are favorable. Good times also stimulate business




growth, and this is particularly important for small and medium-sized concerns. The widening of economic opportunities which occurs during prosperity is, therefore, a powerful and pervasive encouragement to independent,
competitive endeavor. This is illustrated by the experience of the first six
months in 1955, when new business formations were 11 percent above the
first six months of 1954, while business discontinuances were 7 percent below.
The net increase in the business population was 45,000, compared with
11,000 in 1954 and 27,000 in 1953. When the economy is contracting, the
shrinking of markets may temporarily intensify business rivalries, but their
longer-range effect is to discourage enterprise. The will, no less than the
capacity, to compete is weakened by declining business and its harvest of
disappointments. Thus, good times do much to strengthen competition;
in turn, strong competitive markets are a major force in generating prosperity
and distributing its fruits widely.
Second, government can strengthen competitive markets by helping small
and medium-sized businesses overcome impediments to their expansion. In
our modern economy, with its heavy capital requirements, high taxes, and
emphasis on national markets, small concerns are subject to serious handicaps in many lines of endeavor. Yet the continuance of small and mediumsized businesses, and their ability to prosper and grow, are vital to the
Nation's welfare. As stated in last year's Economic Report, "our economy is
strong and progressive because it contains, in addition to its five million farm
enterprises, four million independent centers of business decision—each
potentially free to experiment with new ideas, new men, new methods, and
new products." When the Government helps smaller concerns to overcome
some of the hindrances to their growth, it is acting in the interests of the
whole economy.
The Government is now aiding small businesses in numerous ways. The
Small Business Administration, which was established to assist them, makes
loans—whenever possible in participation with private lenders—for
periods that are usually longer than those commonly available from private
lending agencies. It provides counsel on technical processes, managerial
problems, and new product lines, and helps to channel government contracts to small enterprises. During 1955 significant improvements were
made in procurement procedures, so that a larger portion of Federal contracts may go to these enterprises. The maximum size of loans by the Small
Business Administration was also raised last year.
Other governmental programs are helpful to small business firms. The
Office of Technical Services in the Department of Commerce disseminates
information derived from government and government-sponsored research.
It also publishes lists and abstracts of government-owned patents, currently
exceeding 5,000 in number, which are available for license on a nonexclusive, royalty-free basis. Several other units in the Department of Commerce
provide technical, managerial, marketing, and other aids. While these programs are helpful to the business community generally, they are of special




77

advantage to small firms, which cannot hire the services of technical, managerial, and financial experts as readily as the larger firms.
The maintenance of healthy, competitive markets requires that Federal
policies for promoting economic expansion and for aiding small and
medium-sized businesses be supplemented by vigorous measures for preventing monopolistic practices and combinations. One of the clearest
lessons of business history is that tendencies toward monopoly are always
present in some degree and that constant vigilance is needed to assure
ascendancy of competitive conditions. Strict enforcement of the antitrust
laws is our primary weapon for thwarting any impairment of competition.
In the summer of 1953, the Attorney General appointed a National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws, composed of leading experts on the
subject. The Report of this Committee has served most usefully as a basis
for study of needed legislative changes. Two of last year's enactments
embody revisions paralleling those suggested by the Committee's Report.
One raised maximum penalties under the Sherman Act from $5,000 to
$50,000; the other gave the Federal Government the right to sue for damages sustained by it as a result of antitrust violations. Further improvements in the antitrust laws are likely to draw heavily on the results of the
Committee's deliberations.
Meanwhile, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission are vigorously enforcing these laws. In 1955 the number of proceedings instituted against corporate mergers was larger than in all previous years
since 1950, when the antimerger amendment to the Clayton Act was passed.
During the year numerous legal actions against price-fixing and marketsharing practices were successfully carried out. Various orders were issued,
prohibiting price discriminations that were unfairly injurious to small competitors. Orders against the practice of exclusive dealing served to open
to smaller manufacturers distribution outlets previously closed by dominant
competitors. Also, numerous suits dissolving group boycotts helped to
keep the channels of trade open to independent entry and action.
Nevertheless, mergers have become more numerous of late and an eye,
at once vigilant and discriminating, must be kept on such developments.
Many mergers have a solid economic justification and serve the general
interest by increasing competition; others have neutral effects; while still
others place obstacles in the path of effective competition. Over the years
Americans have wisely viewed excessive business concentration, or any
other undue concentration of economic power, with uneasiness. To serve
the basic American desire for an economy in which business opportunities
are increasing and in which economic control is widely diffused, it is desirable to strengthen our antitrust laws and provide larger appropriations for
their enforcement.
Toward this end, the following revisions of antitrust legislation are
recommended. First, all firms of significant size that are engaging in
interstate commerce and plan to merge should be required to give advance




78

notice of the proposed merger to the antitrust agencies, and to supply the
information needed to assess its probable impact on competition. Second,
Federal regulation should be extended to all mergers of banking institutions.
Combined with the requirement for advance notice, this extension of the
law would give the Government an opportunity to prevent mergers that are
likely to result in undue restraint of banking competition. Third, Federal
approval should be required for the acquisition of banks by holding companies. Fourth, the Clayton Act should be amended to make explicit the
Federal Government's authority to take action in merger transactions in
which either party is engaged in interstate commerce. Fifth, it should also
be amended so as to make the cease-and-desist orders of the Federal Trade
Commission final when issued, unless appealed to the Courts. Sixth, when
civil rather than criminal proceedings are contemplated, the Attorney General should be empowered to issue a civil investigative demand, compelling
the production of documents before the filing of a complaint, and without
having to invoke grand jury proceedings.
Finally, the Congress should give serious study to the Report of the
Presidential Advisory Committee on Transport Policy and Organization.
A fundamental premise of that Report is that the railroad industry no
longer has the monopoly power that it had toward the end of the nineteenth
century, when the Interstate Commerce Act was passed, but instead largely
operates under competitive conditions. The central proposals of the
Report therefore seek to diminish the detailed administrative regulations
that have grown up over the years, and to give common carriers greater
freedom to compete. The time is surely ripe for a re-examination of the
intricate regulations of the transportation industry, with a view to opening
up the industry to more freely competitive effort. But in framing any
legislation, it will be necessary to retain adequate safeguards of the interests
of the shipping public and competing carriers.
III. EXTENDING HOME OWNERSHIP AND IMPROVING NEIGHBORHOODS

Additions to the Nation's stock of housing are required by the growth
of population, changes in its makeup, migration from rural to urban areas,
and gradual deterioration of older homes and apartments. The mainspring of recent residential construction, however, has been the desire for
home ownership and the demand for better homes and neighborhoods as
essential elements in the higher levels of living that people seek to attain.
Progress in these directions has been significantly aided by the Federal
Government as well as the States and localities, but it has depended primarily—as it should—on decisions and actions by individual citizens, the
building industry, and private financial institutions.
The main objectives of the Administration's housing policies have been
to facilitate home ownership, to promote a high and reasonably stable
rate of home building, and to improve the quality of existing homes and
neighborhoods. These objectives have been carried out through many




79

instrumentalities, the most important being the program of mortgage
loan insurance by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the program of mortgage loan guaranty by the Veterans Administration (VA),
and programs for slum clearance and urban renewal. In developing these
Federal activities the fullest cooperation has been sought of private interests and local governments.
More and better housing is essential to raising the levels of family
living. Also, the manner in which home construction and improvement
is achieved and the rate at which these activities proceed have a vital
bearing on the prosperity and stability of the entire economy. The results of recent experience are gratifying. They appear in the high rate
at which new homes have been built, in the spread of home ownership, in
the improvement of urban neighborhoods, and in the general avoidance of
housing surpluses which can only bring trouble to the building industry and
the economy at large.
In the past three years more than 3/2 million nonfarm housing units
have been built. They embody high standards of comfort, commodiousness,
and suitability for healthy, safe, and convenient living. About 50 percent
of the new housing units were built under FHA and VA programs. Total
expenditures on new home construction, even in terms of constant dollars,
have far exceeded those of any earlier three-year period. This achievement of the home building and financing industries gives dramatic proof
of what can be accomplished through private enterprise and with private
capital.
The spread of home ownership has been likewise remarkable. Before
World War II, the percentage of nonfarm dwelling units occupied by the
owner reached 46 in 1930 and fell to 41 in 1940. After the war the percentage rose to 53 in 1950 and is now 57 or higher. This achievement is
probably unique among highly urbanized, industrial nations. Widespread
home ownership yields prized benefits to individual families. It also encourages active interest in civic affairs and pride in community development.
A nation in which so many millions of families have growing investments
in their homes and neighborhoods is likely to be governed by a high sense
of responsibility.
Results are also beginning to be realized from the measures taken to
encourage home improvements and to rehabilitate parts of our cities and
towns that had been allowed to degenerate into slums or near-slums. The
Housing Act of 1954, following a recommendation by the President's Advisory Committee on Housing, initiated an urban renewal program under
which Federal grants are made to cities and towns for the conservation and
rehabilitation of neighborhoods, as well as for slum clearance projects provided under earlier laws. The Federal Government also offers grants to small
communities and to metropolitan areas and regions for urban planning.
These moves are bearing fruit. Toward the end of 1955, more than 200
urban renewal projects in 165 locations had been approved for final plan-




80

ning or execution. They will ultimately provide new housing for 70,000
families. City blocks cleared of slums, and construction projects on previously blighted sites, are visible in an increasing number of places.
Also important for the future, as well as for the recent past, are the steps
taken in 1954 to make Federal programs for the insurance of housing loans
more effective. FHA terms for mortgage insurance on existing properties
were liberalized to facilitate the movement of families to better accommodations. Insurance of mortgages on properties in urban renewal areas was
permitted in order to hasten redevelopment. The maximum insurable
mortgage amounts for owner-occupied, rental, and cooperative housing,
which had remained unchanged for years, were finally brought into adjustment with postwar building costs. Funds for home improvement were
made more readily available by permitting FHA to insure supplementary
loans under an open-end mortgage. Consumer protection was improved
by requiring builders who do their financing with Federally underwritten
mortgages to deliver warranties to home purchasers. Malpractices under
the FHA home repair and modernization program were brought under
control by limiting the eligibility for loan insurance to improvements that
add to the basic utility of homes, and by requiring lenders to assume 10
percent of any loss on insured loans.
Of late, considerable effort has also been devoted to encouraging the use
of private capital where public funds would otherwise be required. A new
charter was drawn for the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA),
which provides for the eventual retirement of its government capital. Steps
were taken to restrict the use of FNMA as a primary source of mortgage
funds, although its authority to assist special housing programs was continued. A Voluntary Home Mortgage Credit Program was established
under the auspices of the Housing and Home Finance Agency. Through
this program the flow of private mortgage funds into remote areas and to
minority groups is being augmented.
While further progress in promoting extension of home ownership and
improvement of urban communities can be expected of existing governmental programs, their effectiveness would be enhanced by certain legislative changes. First, as proposed earlier in this Report, the mortgage insurance program should be amended in the interest of increasing the availability
of adequate housing for older persons. Second, in order to serve more
effectively the objectives of urban renewal, any community that seeks Federal assistance for public housing should be required to adopt a workable
program for the prevention and elimination of slums. To further the same
objectives, a public housing program of 35,000 dwelling units for each of
the next two years should be authorized. Third, in order to facilitate home
improvements, the permissible size of insured repair and modernization
loans, which has remained unchanged on the statute books despite the great
rise in building costs during the past fifteen years, should be increased.
This insurance program has proved very useful in promoting home im-




8i

provements; it is now safeguarded against abuse and should be given permanent status. Finally, the authorization of home mortgage insurance by
FHA should be increased and put on a more permanent basis.
IV.

ENLARGING PUBLIC ASSETS

All levels of government share a responsibility for providing the public
improvements on which the general welfare and the growth of the private
economy heavily depend. In projects which clearly involve the national
interest and are beyond the economic competence of local bodies, the Federal Government must play a key role. But its part in these essential programs must be performed so as to encourage rather than displace the
necessary efforts of State and local agencies.
Public construction has risen sharply since the end of World War II
and has been proceeding at a brisk pace in the last few years. When military, atomic energy, and other industrial components of public construction
are excluded and adjustments are made for price changes, it appears that
the volume of public construction in 1953-55 surpassed any earlier threeyear period. New public construction amounted to about 35 billion dollars in these years, with about two-thirds of this total accounted for by
State and local governments.
But a great backlog of necessary public works remains. This is largely
the consequence of heavy expenditures for our national security during
and since World War II, coupled with unexpected population gains. Outlays for public construction during the next few years should be large
enough to contribute decisively toward removing this backlog, replacing
obsolete facilities, and providing for normal growth. The stock of public
facilities must be increased, so that it will be commensurate with the growth
of private wealth and the improvement in the level of living of a rapidly
increasing population. Deficiencies in essential public works can seriously
restrict economic progress. It would be shortsighted to subject our economy
to such a hazard.
Among the deficiencies, none is more important for the Nation's future
than the shortage of school classrooms, which accumulated partly during
the years of depression and war, when school construction was severely
curtailed, and partly in the early postwar period, when it failed to keep
pace with the growth of the school-age population. In the last few years
expenditures on school construction have risen encouragingly, and building is currently proceeding at the record rate of 67,000 schoolrooms
per year. However, even at this rate of construction it would take many
years to remove the backlog, which is estimated at over 200,000 rooms, since
the greater part of the new construction must provide for growth and
replacements.
The provision of school buildings has been traditionally a State and local
function. It is highly desirable that it remain just that. At the




same time, it has become clear that in the absence of Federal aid, the
existing shortage of schoolrooms will long continue in many communities,
to the detriment of the entire Nation. If the critical shortage that now
exists is to be largely corrected over the next few years, Federal assistance
is essential. This conclusion has been reached by many students of school
problems, and it has recently been endorsed by the White House Conference
on Education, which reflected the results of serious deliberation in earlier
meetings of citizens throughout the land. In view of existing needs and
circumstances, the Congress is urged to authorize a program of Federal
aid for school construction which, over a five-year period, could be expected
to stimulate the States and localities to sufficiently greater efforts to remove
the accumulated shortage. Specifically, the Congress is requested to
authorize Federal matching grants to the States, to be used in districts that
are themselves unable to provide urgently needed public school facilities.
Loans should also be made available to facilitate school financing, in a manner and under conditions that are set out in the special Message of January
12, 1956. At the end of five years, when it may be expected that school
facilities will again be adequate, Federal aid can and should terminate.
Other shortages of educational plant exist at the present time. In particular, there are grave inadequacies in our facilities for medical research
and for training the large number of physicians, dentists, and health
scientists required by our rapidly growing population. Since private benefactions cannot fully fill the gap, it is recommended that the Congress authorize a five-year program of Federal construction grants to assist medical
and dental schools to improve their physical facilities for research and
teaching. Also, the Federal loan program for college housing should be
continued, but on a basis that will bring forth the large volume of private
funds that is necessary to meet growing requirements.
The construction of hospital and related facilities has been substantially augmented in recent years, in part because it has been bolstered by 700
million dollars of Federal grants. These have been made under the Hospital and Medical Facilities Survey and Construction Program, which
provides matching grants to the States for the construction of hospitals and
related health facilities. This program is being administered with close
attention to the needs of low-income groups and rural areas. The Congress is requested to extend the program for an additional two years.
Federal insurance of mortgage loans for the construction or improvement of
private health facilities is again recommended.
The importance of completely modernizing the Interstate Highway System, which links together the principal cities by 40,000 miles of road, is
so clear and so widely recognized that it requires no elaboration in this
Report. The country urgently needs an integrated network of safe, controlled-access highways to relieve existing congestion and to provide for
the expected growth of motor vehicle traffic. A modernized interstate




system would also help to strengthen the Nation's defenses and to reduce
the toll of human life exacted each year in highway accidents. The Congress is again urged to consider and to provide for the full modernization of
the Interstate Highway System. It was suggested last year that this vast road
program be financed by an independent authority created by the Congress,
and that interest and amortization on the highway debt be paid out of the
excess—which may be expected to increase—of Federal revenues from
present gasoline and lubricating oil taxes over current Federal grants-in-aid
for roads. If this financing plan is not satisfactory to the Congress, a sound
alternative not involving budget deficits should be devised. Since the need
for improved highway facilities is becoming more and more pressing, the
whole interstate system should be authorized as one project, to be completed
in about ten years.
By the nature of the projects involved, the Federal Government must
play a key role in the conservation and development of water resources.
In 1953-55, over 2 billion dollars of Federal funds were expended for the
construction of facilities of this type. Recent legislative and administrative
actions have strengthened both public and private activities in the sphere
of water resource conservation and development. The St. Lawrence Seaway
was authorized in 1954, after many years of discussion. In the same year,
the conservation of soil and water resources was advanced by allowing
outlays made by farmers on water projects to be treated as a current expense
for tax purposes, by expanding the provision of governmental loans for such
projects, and by establishing a cooperative program with State and local
agencies for the construction of small dams and related works. The Report
of the President's Advisory Committee on Water Resources Policy has
recently been transmitted to the Congress. This report sets forth a comprehensive policy for the conservation and development of the Nation's
water resources. It stresses the need for greater uniformity in the evaluation of projects, their authorization, and their cost-sharing provisions, as
well as close and continuous collaboration with local groups. In due course,
legislative proposals will be submitted to implement the recommendations
of this Committee.
In the conservation and development of water resources, including power,
the Federal Government should continue to advance the partnership principle, as exemplified by projects such as John Day, Markham Ferry, and
Cougar. It should continue to encourage leadership from local sources,
whether private or public, and assume an active role only where it has
some particular competence—that is, where the projects are especially
complex or large, where interstate conflicts are involved, or where there is
a clear impact on the national interest. The Upper Colorado River project,
which is vital to several States and which involves generation of power,
irrigation, municipal water supply, flood control, and other functions, is an
outstanding example of the type of project that the Federal Government




should undertake. Recommendations concerning this project and other
needed developments of water resources are presented in the Budget
Message.
The increasing scarcity of water makes it mandatory that its waste be
prevented. Pollution of streams and lakes is a flagrant example of waste.
Hence, the extension and strengthening of the Water Pollution Control Act
are again urged.
Expenditures on atomic energy construction have in recent years accounted for a significant part of total Federal construction expenditures.
In 1953-55 they amounted to 2.7 billion dollars. They are now tapering
off with the completion of important projects. Private investment, while
still modest, is being accelerated under the stimulus of the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954. In the spirit of this law, the Atomic Energy Commission has
given technical and financial assistance to development of private atomic
power plants, has invited private participation in the supplying of atomic
energy materials and services, has provided access to technical information,
and has released its patents without royalty. This cooperation of government and industry is bringing the goal of competitively priced atomic
electric power closer to realization.
The limitation of Federal efforts to their proper sphere in the construction of public assets will require the States and localities to continue assuming heavy responsibilities for public works. There can be little doubt that
the great majority of them have both the economic and financial capability
of doing so. In some cases, however, State constitutions or State and local
statutes which currently restrict borrowing may need to be revised. Smaller
communities seeking to raise capital for public improvements would also
be aided by a revision of the Federal tax laws, such as was recommended
last year, to allow a regulated investment company, holding the bulk of its
assets in the form of tax-exempt securities, to pass through to its shareholders
the tax-exempt status of the income received on such securities.
V. IMPROVING SKILLS AND TECHNOLOGY

The swift pace of scientific knowledge brings both new opportunities
and new responsibilities. What we as a people do, or fail to do, to improve
skills, to train specialists in the sciences and in engineering and other
applied fields, and to add to scientific and technical knowledge will have a
vital bearing on our national security and on the level of living of future
generations.
The problem of improving skills and building new knowledge has several
aspects. The provision of adequate physical facilities for training and
research is one of them. Progress in this direction is being made by the
present high rate of construction of facilities and will be hastened by the
Federal programs that have been recommended above. Another basic
aspect of the problem—adding to the supply of trained personnel to staff




the physical facilities—presents greater difficulties. As pointed out in a
special Message to the Congress in February 1955, the shortage of teachers,
while less obvious than the shortage of classrooms, is the more serious.
Shortages of personnel exist also in various branches of scientific research
and development and in numerous technical specialties.
Primary responsibility for meeting the critical shortage of teachers rests
with educational institutions, the States, and local communities. All practicable steps should be taken by them to attract suitably trained individuals
to the teaching profession. In this connection, special attention should be
given to the need for better high school instruction in science and mathematics. The supply of scientific and engineering manpower, so vital to our
military security and future prosperity, depends to a large degree on the
availability and quality of such instruction. Physics and chemistry are not
taught at all in many high schools, and in many others the teaching of these
subjects is seriously deficient. The experimental program of supplementary
training for teachers in science, mathematics, and engineering, which the
National Science Foundation has under way, should help to raise the quality
of instruction in these subjects. An enlarged appropriation for this purpose
is needed.
Private and public institutions of higher learning are the means through
which we must overcome the shortages of personnel in engineering, medicine, scientific research, and other areas. The newly recommended program for adding to the physical facilities for research and training in medicine and dentistry, which has already been noted, will help to meet certain
of these needs. Other activities of the Federal Government to encourage
higher education should also be strengthened, notably the program of
research grants and graduate fellowships administered by the National
Science Foundation, the program of research and training supported by the
Atomic Energy Commission, and the various programs of the Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare for training nurses, for medical research,
and for research on air and water pollution.
These programs, important as they are, should not obscure the need
for balanced expansion of our liberal arts colleges, universities, and technical
institutes. The increased need for advanced training and the prospective
growth of student enrollments pose difficult and far-reaching problems,
which should be thoroughly explored by the Office of Education together
with private and public institutions of higher learning. A distinguished
group of educators and citizens will soon be appointed to consider,
through study and conferences, the immediate and long-range efforts which
must be made to reach appropriate solutions to the problems facing our
colleges and universities.
The future improvement of our level of living, no less than our military
security, is heavily dependent on research in the basic sciences and technology. Our willingness to invest huge sums for this purpose is one of the
outstanding reasons for the pre-eminence of American science and industry.

Total public and private expenditures for research and development are
now estimated to be running at 5 billion dollars per year, if not higher.
Federal outlays for research and development, most of which is conducted
in industrial and university laboratories, have in recent years been above
2 billion dollars per year, and some increase in expenditures for these
purposes has been projected for the next fiscal year.
Most of the Federal funds for research and development are devoted
to projects of the Defense Department and the Atomic Energy Commission.
But as the Economic Report of January 1954 emphasized, such projects
may also be expected to enrich civilian technology. Indeed, many recent
tendencies in private industrial technology are traceable to pioneering Federal projects with a military accent. Among these tendencies are the drive
toward competitively priced atomic power, the application of radioisotopes,
the automatic assembly of radio and television set components, the use of
transistors and miniature vacuum tubes, the adaptation of electronic computers to office work, the experimental cold sterilization of food by radiation,
the formulation and fabrication of titanium and magnesium alloys, and the
design of turboprop and jet commercial airliners. Still more remarkable
prospects for peacetime technology are being opened up by research.
Such marvels of science and technology sometimes cause concern, lest
they lead to unemployment. However, our history teaches that new products and new techniques, instead of reducing the total number of jobs,




extend employment in new directions, increase its amount, and add abundantly to its fruits. Although adjustments for some individuals are made
necessary by technological changes, they can usually be carried out with
little difficulty when the oscillations of the business cycle are kept under
reasonably good control. The need of a strong system of unemployment
insurance to ease personal adjustments is stressed later in this Report.
VI.

PROMOTING THE INTERNATIONAL FLOW OF GOODS AND CAPITAL

The orderly growth of our economy exerts a strongly favorable influence
throughout the world. In turn, economic developments abroad are of
profound importance to us. Recent experience illustrates this interdependence. By 1953 the nations of the Free World had achieved sufficient
economic strength to be able to absorb the adverse reactions from the mild
contraction that got under way in the United States that year. Not only
that, but they continued buying from us on a scale that helped to check
our economic decline and to speed renewed expansion. In turn, the
resumed rise of our imports toward the end of 1954, reinforced by a heavy
outflow of private capital, helped to sustain economic expansion in other
parts of the Free World and thereby stimulated further expansion in our
own exports during the past year.
It is clear that our long-term interests are well served by expansion of
the international flow of goods, capital, enterprise, and technology. Sound
policies to promote these ends will powerfully advance our national security
and economic welfare, and help to build a stronger and more unified community of free nations.
Current restrictions on the flow of goods and capital hamper enterprise and limit the real income of consumers both here and abroad. Despite
the progress in trade liberalization achieved in recent years, restrictions are
still numerous and widespread. Reduction of these barriers requires both
direct action on our part and cooperation with other nations. Our proper
and necessary course was outlined in a special Message of March 1954,
following the report of the Commission on Foreign Economic Policy. The
Congress responded with important legislation in 1954 and 1955, but
additional action is urgently needed.
The Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1955 has continued for another
three years, with certain modifications, the authority initially granted in
1934 by the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act. The 1955 Act grants new
powers to the President to lower tariffs on a reciprocal and selective basis.
Individual tariff rates may be reduced by 5 percent per year for three years,
and rates that are in excess of 50 percent ad valorem may be reduced by
annual stages to that level. Experience has shown that the "escape clause"
and "peril point" provisions of the Act, which are designed to protect
domestic industries against serious injury from duty reductions, are broadly

consistent with our basic policy of trade liberalization. Experience has
also shown that efforts to expand world trade are most effective when
tariff reductions are negotiated on a reciprocal, multilateral basis. Under
the authority of the Trade Agreements Act, selective reductions in tariffs on
thousands of items have been made during the past twenty years, and they
have helped materially to enlarge our exports as well as imports. The 1955
Act has paved the way for a new series of tariff negotiations, which opened
at Geneva on January 18, 1956.
The chief instrument through which the United States has for eight years
cooperated with other countries of the Free World in reducing trade barriers
is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Negotiations
under the GATT are more effective than bilateral negotiations. They have
won for us tariff concessions on items accounting for about 50 percent of
the value of our exports. Moreover, through consultations with other
GATT members, we have secured the abolition of discriminatory restrictions on our exports of such important items as coal, apples, cigarettes,
lumber, potatoes, textiles, automobiles, tobacco, petroleum, wool, and
motion pictures. Several European countries have removed all discriminatory restrictions against dollar trade.
To correct certain shortcomings in the working rules and administrative
machinery of GATT, which have been recognized for some time, the 34




GATT members completed in March 1955 a revision of the basic Agreement
and proposed an administrative agency—the Organization for Trade Cooperation (OTG). Membership in the OTG would enlarge the advantages
the United States already enjoys under the GATT. It would also give
assurance to the rest of the Free World of our continuing interest in expanding the international flow of goods and capital. Early passage of legislation
authorizing our membership in the Organization for Trade Cooperation
is of high importance.
Customs regulations are capable of creating barriers to international
trade, no less serious than the customs duties themselves. Delays and
inconvenience arising from customs regulations have been reduced in the
past two years, and the Treasury Department is continuing to review its
procedures with a view to simplifying them. Congressional action, however, is needed to facilitate further progress. The basic purpose of the
Customs Simplification Bill of 1955, which the House passed in the first
session of the 84th Congress, is to diminish uncertainties and delays by
simplifying the present system of customs valuation. Modifications of this
bill have been suggested to avoid unintended reductions in individual
duties that would result from the proposed change in valuation procedures. Early enactment of such a suitably revised bill will constitute a
significant advance in our foreign economic policy.
The need for simplifying our tariff rate structure, which the Commission
on Foreign Economic Policy had emphasized, was recognized by the Congress in the Customs Simplification Acts of 1953 and 1954. As directed
by the latter Act, the Tariff Commission is studying present commodity
classifications and rate structures. Legislation will be needed in due course
to authorize revisions of our tariff classification schedules. In the meantime, other restraints on international commerce, those arising under the
Buy-American Act of 1933, were modified by an Executive Order of December 1954, which has resulted in the removal of a great deal of uncertainty
for foreign bidders who seek government contracts.
The field of foreign investment also offers opportunities to encourage
economic activity and trade on a world scale. A larger outflow of American capital would benefit both ourselves and other economies. By helping
to develop the resources of friendly countries, it would enlarge and diversify the supply of materials on which we can draw. At the same time, it
would enable less developed countries to achieve higher rates of economic
growth and to become more active partners in the trade of the Free World.
To the greatest extent possible, the funds for foreign investment should
come from private sources. When private capital moves abroad, it is often
accompanied by the export of technical, managerial, and financial skills.
Such benefits cannot be realized as effectively through government loans.
It is highly desirable, as stressed in last year's Economic Report, that we
"encourage investment in all countries whose desire to speed their economic
development has led them to create a hospitable climate for business invest-




ment." The recommendations made in that Report, with respect to the
taxation of corporate income from foreign sources, have not yet been acted
on by the Congress. Legislation on these proposals, which can have a significant influence on foreign investment, is again requested. Also, the lending
authority of the Export-Import Bank should be extended beyond June 30,
1958. This would enable the Bank—which has actively encouraged the
outflow of private capital by its loan participation, credit guarantees, and
loan supplements to private venture capital—to finance projects that call for
advances over a period longer than two years.
The United States has recently taken steps to participate in the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which is to be affiliated with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The IFC will begin
operations as soon as at least 30 countries, out of the 44 member countries of
the Bank that have indicated an intention to join, have together subscribed
75 million dollars. The IFC will make loans to supplement venture capital
going into productive private enterprises abroad, particularly in the less
developed areas of the world, and it will also help to find experienced management where needed. The new institution is expected to expand investment abroad by its own lending and also by helping to create an investment
climate in foreign countries that will be more attractive to their own citizens
as well as those of other nations.
The rate of economic progress is bound to play a vital role in the struggle
between the principles of freedom and those of regimentation in the poorer
and less developed areas of the Free World. Our economic development and
technical cooperation programs for raising living standards in these areas are
proving helpful and should be moderately expanded, with special emphasis
on activities that encourage local private enterprise and the inflow of private
capital from abroad. The Mutual Security Program, of which these economic programs are a part, must be continued. High though our expenditures on national security are, they would be vastly higher if we did not have
strong allies.
The United States can take pride in the progress that has been achieved
in cooperation with other countries in enlarging the mutually advantageous
flow of goods, capital, technology, and enterprise within the Free World
community. Continuance of this trend will build an international environment that is increasingly favorable to the maintenance of peace and the
extension of prosperity.
' VII.

INCREASING THE STABILITY OF OUR EXPANDING ECONOMY

Economic improvement, whether by our own actions or in cooperation
with other nations of the Free World, is always subject to the risk of interruption by business fluctuations. The mere fact that they have been kept under
good control in recent years is not an adequate basis for concluding that the
business cycle has been ironed out, or that we need be concerned no longer
about the possibility of running into a sizable recession or inflation. The

need for poise and foresight on the part of business, labor, and government is
undiminished. As we build for the Nation's future prosperity, we must strive
to promote not only a well-balanced growth of the economy, but also a relatively stable rate of growth. Although our defenses against recession and
inflation are much stronger than a generation ago, we should try to make
them still stronger.
By helping to maintain buying power at a time when payrolls diminish,
our Federal-State Unemployment Insurance System constitutes a first line of
defense against a possible recession. Remarkable advances in this insurance
system have been achieved during the past two years. In 1954 its coverage
was broadened by the Congress to include civilian employees of the Federal
Government and the employees of many small firms. Uninterrupted payment of benefits by States whose reserve funds become low was practically
assured by the establishment of a special Federal loan fund. Steps were
taken to equalize the tax impact of the System on new and old firms, thereby
removing a barrier to the establishment and early growth of new enterprises. These Federal actions have been supplemented by the States.
In these two years, 33 States, besides the District of Columbia, raised the
amounts that may be paid weekly to unemployed men and women covered
by the insurance system. Eight States and the District of Columbia
lengthened the duration of the period for which unemployment benefits
may be paid, and four States extended coverage to firms with fewer employees than the minimum set by Federal law.
Taken together, these changes represent the greatest improvement in the
Unemployment Insurance System since its inception. Nevertheless, there
is need for further progress. The last two Economic Reports have suggested
that the States increase benefits so that the great majority of covered workers
will be eligible for payments that at least equal half their regular earnings;
that the States which have not yet done so, lengthen the term of benefits
to 26 weeks for every person who qualifies for any benefit and remains
unemployed that long; that employees of State and local governments be
given the protection of unemployment insurance; and that employees of
very small firms, which are still excluded from the unemployment insurance
system in many States, be accorded this protection. Although very encouraging strides have recently been made toward these goals, they have
not yet been realized. The States are again urged to persevere in the task
of improvement, so that the stabilizing influence of the Unemployment
Insurance System on personal incomes may be enhanced.
To promote stable economic growth, it would also be desirable to increase
the influence that the Federal Government can exercise on consumer credit.
The development of consumer instalment financing has been, on the whole,
highly beneficial to our economy. By its means the homes of many millions
of American families have been enriched on a scale that would otherwise
have proved impossible. The soundness of this type of credit has been
repeatedly tested and found excellent. Nevertheless, instalment credit




93

sometimes accentuates swings in the buying of automobiles, furniture,
television sets, and other consumer durables, thereby exposing the rest of
the economy to the hazard of widened fluctuations. In view of the increasing importance of the durable consumer goods industries in our economy
and their marked tendency to fluctuate, consideration should be given to
restoring the Government's power to regulate the terms of consumer instalment credit.
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulated the
terms of consumer credit during 1941-47 and again in 1948-49 under an
Executive Order of the President. The Defense Production Act provided
temporary authority to reinstate these controls in 1950, but this power was
withdrawn by the amendments to that Act approved June 30, 1952. Experience during the recent past suggests that the authority to set, if and as
circumstances may require, minimum downpayments and maximum maturities on instalment credit for the purchase of consumer durables would
be a useful adjunct to other stabilizing measures. Its availability as a
stand-by measure, to be used only when the economic situation demands it
and under proper administrative safeguards, would increase the Government's ability to fulfill its responsibilities under the Employment Act.
Although present conditions do not call for the use of such authority to
regulate the terms of instalment credit, this is a good time for the Congress
and the Executive Branch to study the problem.
The authority of the Federal Government to influence the use of credit
in the purchase or improvement of homes is already fairly broad, but it
would be useful to extend it in two directions. First, greater flexibility
should be introduced in the terms on which the secondary market facilities
of the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) can be used by
the home building and home financing industries. At the present time,
mortgages may be sold to FNMA under its secondary market program only
on the condition that the seller acquire the Association's stock in an amount
equal to at least 3 percent of the value of the mortgages sold. The Board
of Directors of FNMA should be authorized to set this stock purchase
requirement at or above 1 percent, on the basis of conditions in the housing
market and in the economy generally. By reducing the permissible stock
purchase requirement, the liquidity provided by FNMA to the home mortgage market could be more effectively increased, if the economic situation
required it.
Second, the National Housing Act should be amended to allow the Federal Housing Administration to insure home repair and modernization
loans with maturities as long as 5 years. The maximum maturity for insured loans of this type is now 3 years, having been at this level since the
1930's. An extension of the maximum limit to 5 years, with discretion
granted to the Federal Housing Commissioner to vary the maximum maturity in the light of economic conditions, would permit a liberalization
of terms if and when some stimulation of the construction industry becomes
desirable.




94

The introduction in 1934 of insurance for bank deposits and for share
accounts in savings and loan associations has greatly strengthened the capacity of our economy to resist possible cumulative effects of any recessionary
development. The extension of insurance to the share accounts of credit
unions would be a useful step in the same direction. These cooperative
institutions have been growing rapidly. By mid-1955 over 7.5 million
people had about 2.5 billion dollars invested in credit union shares. The
loss of any appreciable part of these savings would work severe hardships
on individuals of limited means. As suggested in last year's Economic
Report, the Congress should consider the desirability of establishing a selfsupporting Federal program of share-account insurance for credit unions.
If such a system were established, it would be essential to maintain the
proper safeguards, limitations, and supervision that go with an insurance
system.
Finally, as has long been recognized, the adjustment of public works
expenditure can be helpful in achieving a stable rate of economic growth.
For this reason the Administration began concerning itself with the systematic planning of public works early in 1953. For a time this activity was
centered in the Council of Economic Advisers. Later, to give the planning
work added emphasis and to enlarge its scope, a unit was established in the
White House Office under a Special Assistant to the President to coordinate
public works planning. The inventory of the status of Federal plans for
public works, which was initiated nearly three years ago, is now maintained
on an annual basis. A survey of the status of State and local plans for public
works has been completed, and it is expected that similar surveys will be
made biennially. Recognizing the need for a reserve of "ready-to-go" projects, the Congress last year increased the provision for interest-free loans to
States and municipalities for public works planning. Still another forward
step would be taken if both the Executive agencies and the Congress became
accustomed, in connection with every bill on public construction, to consider
the possible need for flexibility in public works programming.
VIII.

T H E CREATIVE POWER OF A FREE ECONOMY

The broad purpose of the recommendations in the foregoing sections
of this Report has been to develop, in the language of the Employment
Act, "national economic policies to foster and promote free competitive
enterprise, to avoid economic fluctuations or to diminish the effects thereof,"
and "to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing
power." These recommendations largely concern the activities and
policies of the Federal Government. But important as these activities and
policies are, we must never lose sight of the fundamental truth expressed
at the beginning of this chapter, namely, that the lasting prosperity of our
Nation depends far more on what individuals do for themselves than on
what the Federal Government does or can do for them.




95

When many millions of men and women bring about general economic
improvement largely through their own actions, they do more than create
prosperity in their day. They also strengthen the moral roots of the
industry, the enterprise, and the resourcefulness from which still greater
prosperity and well-being will spring in the future. That is the basic
reason why a Nation that enjoys a high degree of economic freedom
typically generates its own growth, why it keeps creating new technologies,
new products, new markets, new enterprises, new jobs, larger incomes, and
better living. That is why we are still in the midst of a technological
revolution in agriculture, communications, and power, of which there was
only a glimmer a generation ago. That is why we may look forward with
confidence to the continued growth of our economy.
Foresight has helped our Nation make great strides in recent years toward
a balanced and sustained prosperity. We have succeeded in expanding
the scope of free enterprise, and yet increased the sense of security that
people need in a highly industrialized age. Great opportunities for
economic progress lie ahead. The recommendations of this Report will
prove helpful to the American people in pursuing them.

Some Leading Economic Developments During 1955
The primary purpose of this Appendix is to present the important facts
on certain economic developments in 1955. These facts help to document
the analytical account given in Chapter 2, and to provide a background for
the discussions in the other chapters of the Report.

I. The Nation's Total Output and Income
According to preliminary estimates, the gross national product in 1955
was more than 387 billion dollars, an increase of about 27 billion, or nearly
7}4 percent, over 1954 and a new high figure (Chart B-l and Table B - l ) .
After allowance for the small average price increase, the total product was
6 percent larger than the year before. The volume of goods and services
produced exceeded the previous 1953 peak by 6 percent in current prices
and by 3J/s> percent after allowance for price change.
The rate of increase for private expenditures—about 10 percent between
1954 and 1955—was faster than the rate for total expenditures, which were
affected by a decline in government purchases of goods and services. This
decline was due to a reduction of 3.4 billion dollars in Federal outlays;
State and local expenditures increased by 2.3 billion.
Within the private sector there was a vigorous expansion of business investment accompanying further rapid gains in consumer spending. Business investment, in a reversal of the 1954 decline, increased 27 percent,
from 33.7 billion dollars to 42.8 billion; although the larger part of this
increase was in inventory investment, the rise in business fixed investment
was about 8 percent. Personal consumption expenditures and residential
construction rose from 250 billion dollars to 269 billion, or about 7j/s>
percent (Table B - l ) .
Shifts in the degree to which various sectors contributed to the increase
in final purchases, that is, expenditures other than those for investment in
business inventories, are shown in Table B-2. Increases in personal consumption expenditures between the first and final quarters of 1955 accounted
for 63 percent of the gain in final purchases, against about 80 percent in
the preceding phase of recovery. Residential construction, which had made
substantial contributions to the gain in final purchases during 1954 and the
first few months of 1955, ceased to do so by midsummer and declined in the
latter part of the year. On the other hand, investment in nonresidential
construction and producers' durable equipment taken together, which had
added nothing to the increase in final purchases through the first quarter of
1955, accounted for an appreciable part of the gain in final purchases
during the rest of the year.

despite higher Federal tax payments associated with rising earnings and
despite somewhat larger payments for State and local taxes. The income
gains from 1954 to 1955 raised the per capita disposable income in constant
prices by more than 4 percent (Table D-13).
By far the greatest dollar additions to personal income in 1955 were
in labor income, which rose by 12.6 billion dollars, after a decline of
1.8 billion in 1954 (Table D - l l ) . This increase reflected gains in employment, longer average hours of work in manufacturing and other activities,
and substantially higher basic rates of pay in major industries and for
government employees. Transfer payments, which in 1954 had helped
to cushion the decline in total employee compensation, rose further, by
900 million dollars.
Investment income (rent, dividends, and interest) increased by 2.2 billion
dollars during 1955. Proprietors' income gained 500 million, reflecting
largely compensating changes in business and professional income, which
rose 1.4 billion, and in farm income which declined 900 million.
The distribution of personal income disbursements, which exceed personal
income by the amount of personal contributions to social insurance, shifted
in 1955 toward a larger share of labor income and transfer payments (75.4
percent). The share of investment income, which had increased in 1954,
was unchanged at 12.1 percent during the past year. The share of proprietors' income, however, continued to fall, as it had in earlier years. The decline from 13.0 percent in 1954 to 12.5 percent in 1955 was accounted for
solely by the drop in farm income; the income share of nonfarm proprietors
and professional persons remained unchanged (Table 3).
Personal consumption expenditures, which had increased 6 billion dollars
in 1954, rose another 16 billion in 1955. As average consumer prices were
fairly stable, consumption in real terms increased almost 6^4 percent. This
gain was larger than in any postwar year since 1946 (Table D-2).
In 1955, as in 1954, the increase in personal consumption expenditures
was greater than the rise in disposable income; therefore, for two years in
succession, the volume of personal saving has shown a decline, from 19.8
billion dollars in 1953 to 18.3 billion in 1954 and 16.8 billion in the year
just ended. Personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income
dropped from 7.9 in 1953 to 7.2 in 1954 and 6.2 in 1955 (Table B-3).
The sharp rise of consumer expenditures and the reduction of personal
saving during the past year were associated with large increases in purchases
of automobiles and other durable goods. Expenditures on durable goods
rose 20 percent, compared with gains of 4 and 5 percent in expenditures
on nondurable goods and services, respectively. As a percentage of disposable income, purchases of durable goods increased from 11.5 percent to
13.1 percent, those of nondurable goods dropped from 47.4 percent to 46.8
percent, while the share of consumer services remained unchanged at
almost 34 percent (Table B-3). The dollar increases in expenditures for
nondurable goods and services, however, were quite substantial. Together,




108

theSe categories accounted for about 10 billion of the 16 billion dollar
increase in total consumer spending.
The rise in expenditures relative to income was facilitated by a record
expansion of consumer credit, enabling consumers to finance additional
purchases of durable goods while at the same time increasing their outlays
on other goods and services. Although consumer and home mortgage
debt increased rapidly, individuals' holdings of liquid assets (currency and
bank deposits, savings and loan shares, and securities) also rose substantially.
In the year ended September 30, 1955, these asset holdings increased about
as much as debt (Table D-14).
BUSINESS INCOME AND INVESTMENT

Fixed business investment in 1955 totaled 39.6 billion dollars, against
36.6 billion the year before; in the fourth quarter of 1955, it reached a new
high annual rate of 41.7 billion. Investment in plant and equipment was
stimulated by the rapid growth of business sales. As sales increased,
capacity utilization in most industries improved rapidly. The introduction of new products or models, especially in highly competitive consumer
markets, stimulated investment outlays for both expansion and modernization. In some of the durable goods industries, declining military
purchases and rising civilian demand required investments for reconversion.
Investment was also encouraged by favorable earnings in both 1954 and
1955. While corporate profits before tax declined by 4.3 billion dollars
between 1953 and 1954, the expiration of the excess profits tax in January
1954 and the automatic decline in corporate tax liabilities accompanying
lower profits completely absorbed the impact of reduced earnings. As a
result, corporate earnings after tax remained unchanged. In 1955, profits
rose by about 9 billion dollars before and 4.5 billion dollars after taxes.
(Table D-52). Gains for unincorporated business firms are reflected in
the rise in business and professional income from 25.9 billion dollars to 27.3
billion.
The more liberal depreciation allowances provided in the 1954 Internal
Revenue Code also stimulated investment in 1955. Corporate undistributed profits and depreciation allowances in 1955 totaled about 5 billion
dollars more than in the previous year, despite an increase of 1 billion
dollars in dividend payments.
Finally, there was a marked improvement in the financial position of
business. In the 12 months ended September 30, 1955, cash, United States
Government securities, and receivables held by nonfinancial corporations
gained almost 13 billion dollars and inventories and other current assets
2 billion dollars, while net current liabilities rose only 8 billion. Thus, net
corporate working capital increased almost 7 billion; for the first time, it
surpassed 100 billion dollars (Table D-56). Because of rising profits and
larger retained earnings, the increased requirements of business corporations




109

for investment capital could be met for the most part from internal funds
(Table D-55).
In contrast to 1954, when industrial investment declined while commercial investment made modest gains, practically all major sectors participated in the expansion of capital outlays during 1955 (Table D-29).
Plant and equipment expenditures of commercial, construction, and communication firms rose from 8.2 billion dollars to 9.1 billion and reached
an annual rate of 9.7 billion toward the end of the year. By far the major
portion of this rise was due to investment of commercial firms in warehouses,
stores, office buildings, delivery trucks, and the like. The strength of investment in this sector is partly attributable to the backlog of undertakings
deferred because of restrictions during the Korean conflict. But it
reflects also the continuous demand for shopping and other commercial facilities in the rapidly growing suburbs of our cities. Moreover, the construction of large office buildings, until recently limited
to New York and a few other cities, is spreading to an increasing number
of localities where little or no new office space had been provided since
the early thirties.
Industrial outlays on plant and equipment, which had dropped 17 percent
between the third quarter of 1953 and the first quarter of 1955, recovered
rapidly as the year progressed. Between the first and final quarters of 1955,
manufacturing investment rose 24 percent, railroad investment 55 percent,
and public utility outlays 17 percent. Total industrial investment between
these periods gained 4 billion dollars, and by the end of the year it was
slightly above the previous high point registered in the third quarter of 1953.
Capital outlays of durable goods industries in 1955 totaled 5.4 billion
dollars, 6 percent above 1954; in the final quarter of the year, they reached a
record annual rate of 6.2 billion. Primary metals industries spent large
sums for further expansion and modernization. Investment by transportation equipment firms, particularly automobile producers, which had
increased substantially in 1954, reached an even higher level by the end of
1955. In fact, capital outlays in every major durable goods industry
increased markedly throughout the year.
T H E RECORD OF PRODUCTION

The rise in investment and consumption during 1955 brought new
production records in industry and related activities. Agricultural output
also attained a new high level. Total industrial output in May surpassed
the 1953 peak, and by the end of 1955 was 5 percent above it. The first
groups to exceed their 1953 peaks were minerals and nondurable manufactures, in February and March 1955, respectively. Output of durable
manufactures as a whole did not equal the 1953 high point before August
1955. Although sales of consumer durable goods had begun to increase
early in 1954, purchases of producers' durable equipment recovered only in




no

the spring of 1955. Moreover, the major impact of the decline in military
procurement after mid-1953 was on the durable goods industries.
Likewise, the rate of industrial expansion from 1954 to 1955 varied from
group to group (Table B-4). Durable goods manufactures increased
by 13 percent. In this group, the production of primary metals rose by
30 percent. Steel production was very high through most of the year and,
with the exception of the usual slack during summer vacations, was close
to theoretical capacity after March. The output of transportation equipment (mainly motor vehicles) increased 16 percent. Nondurable goods
manufactures as a group, having declined less than durables during the
contraction, also expanded at a slower rate, 9 percent. Within this group,
the output of rubber and leather products, stimulated by automobile
demand, rose 17 percent, but foods, beverages, and tobacco gained only
3 percent. The production of minerals increased 10 percent, with a sharp
expansion in coal mining (19 percent) and metal mining (23 percent).

The Federal Reserve index of consumer durable goods output advanced
more than 25 percent, partly reflecting a spectacular increase in automobile
production. In 1955, a record number of nearly 8 million passenger cars
came off the assembly line, against 5}4 million the year before. Large

While the recovery in industrial output during the second half of 1954
was heavily concentrated in industries associated with automobile production and construction, particularly housing, the expansion of 1955 broadened
to other industries, especially machinery. In the second half of 1954 almost
three-fifths of the increase in total production was attributable to five major
industry groups—primary metals, transportation equipment, stone, clay and
glass products, lumber, and rubber products. Each of these was substantially affected by the strength of automobile and housing demand. The
remaining nondurable goods industries taken together contributed about
one-fifth of the increase, and the remaining durable goods industries 14
percent. In contrast, this last group, a large part of which supplies the
wherewithal for new and modernized industrial equipment, contributed
about one-fourth of the rise in total output during 1955. The five industries which had accounted for the major share of the production gains in
late 1954 contributed 30 percent and nondurable goods 35 percent.
The rate of growth in production has slowed down in recent months.
Total industrial output increased 7 percent from July-August 1954 to January 1955, 5 percent from January to June, and 4 percent from June to
December. The deceleration was particularly marked in some of the
industry groups which had shown the greatest rate of increase during the
early phase of the expansion: metal mining, primary metals, transportation
equipment, rubber and leather products, and industries associated with
construction, such as clay, glass, and lumber products (Table B-4).
In other areas of activity, electric power production in 1955 continued
the spectacular growth shown throughout the postwar period. Power production of electric utilities rose 15 percent. Its rate of increase since 1946
has been almost four times that of gross national product in constant dollars
and three times that of industrial production. Ton miles of railway freight
carried in 1955 increased more than 10 percent.




112

N E W CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY

Total construction expenditures in 1955 increased 4.7 billion to a new
high of 42.2 billion dollars. Their share in the gross national product,
almost 11 percent, established also a postwar record. Private outlays
accounted for practically the entire gain over 1954. Public construction
increased only 200 million dollars as substantial gains in educational building, highway construction, sewer and water installations, and military facilities were largely offset by continued declines in expenditures for conservation and development and in public industrial construction. The latter
reflected primarily the completion of defense plants started or planned
during the period of Korean hostilities, and of atomic energy installations.
In the private sector, commercial building exceeded the 1954 volume
by about 830 million dollars and showed by far the highest rate of increase
(37 percent). Industrial construction rose to a new high of 2.4 billion
dollars, reversing the decline in the two preceding years. Among institutional construction types, the building of churches and similar edifices
continued to show a substantial rise (Chart B-2 and Tables D-30 and
D-31).

Residential construction expenditures in 1955 reached a new high of
16.6 billion dollars, an increase of 3.1 billion or 23 percent from the preceding year. More than 1.3 million privately financed nonfarm housing
units were started in 1955, a record exceeded only in 1950; this volume




of starts followed the absorption of 1.2 million units in 1954 and of about
1.1 million in each of the three preceding years (Table D-32).
The number of private housing units started last year totaled substantially more than in 1954 in spite of a decline in the seasonally adjusted
rate of starts during most of the year. The rate of starts in 1954 hovered
around 1.1 million units during the first five months but increased later to
a rate of almost 1.5 million in December. In 1955, the annual rate averaged nearly 1.4 million during the first half of the year but declined
gradually to about 1.2 million units at the year-end.

II. Employment and Earnings
Total employment rose by over 3 million and unemployment declined
by l/i million between the last three months of 1954 and the corresponding months of 1955, as the civilian labor force increased by over 2^4
million. The average workweek also increased, and there was considerable
overtime work, particularly during the latter part of 1955. The longer
hours combined with a continued rise in average hourly earnings brought
weekly earnings to record levels in most industries. Time lost in industrial
disputes continued at the low levels of the two previous years. Some of the
major collective bargaining agreements negotiated during the year included
plans for private supplementation of State unemployment benefits. As
the year ended, the country's two major labor federations merged after
some 20 years of existence as separate organizations.
NONAGRIGULTURAL EMPLOYMENT

The number of people employed in nonagricultural industries rose during
the current expansion to a level well above that in any previous period.
The rate of increase was greatest during the spring and early summer
months. Thereafter, the expansion continued at a more moderate pace,
as production capacity became more fully utilized and as fewer people were
seeking work. This broad pattern of expansion is evident in the estimates
of nonagricultural employment made by the Bureau of Census, as well
as in those made by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, except that the latter
series did not rise so rapidly during the spring and early summer (Tables
D-17andD-22).
Census figures show that the over-the-year rise in nonagricultural employment was about equally divided among men and women and was reflected
in almost all age groups. The percentage rise was substantially greater for
women than for men, however, and an especially sharp gain of about 10
percent was recorded for women 45 years of age and older, as the gradual
rise in labor force participation by this group was accelerated in 1955.
Employment of men in the 45 and older age group changed only slightly,
while for those in their sixties the rate of labor force participation continued
to decline. For men 20-44 years of age, who had experienced the greatest




114

employment decline during the 1953-54 downturn, there were sharp gains
during the spring and summer of 1955; for this age group, employment in
December 1955 was almost 4 percent higher than a year earlier. Among
youths of high-school age, employment, mostly in part-time jobs, rose by
20 to 25 percent.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, seasonally adjusted, show that the
rise in nonagricultural employment during the year occurred principally
in manufacturing, where the increase came to about one million (Table
B-6). Manufacturing employment rose rapidly in the first half of the year
and, after a pause on a summer plateau, again moved upward in the fourth
quarter, though without reaching its 1953 peak (Chart B-3). The level

of production in manufacturing was well above that reached in 1953, however, reflecting substantial gains in output per man-hour over this two-year
period. Estimates made by the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggest that
between 1953 and 1955 the average annual rate of increase in manufacturing
output per man-hour was considerably higher than in the postwar period
as a whole. The steady growth of employment in trade, finance, service,
and State and local government that has been characteristic of the entire
period since World War II continued, with an increase of over y% million
during 1955. Employment in mining hardly changed during the year,

though the decline of previous years was halted and the average workweek
in this industry increased sharply over 1954 levels.
The dominant development within manufacturing during the last quarter
of 1954 and the first quarter of 1955 was the increase of employment in the
automobile industry, with attendant effect on supplying industry groups as
well as on transportation equipment directly. By the spring of the year,
seasonally adjusted employment was rising in virtually every area of manufacturing. The employment gains in primary metals and in the metalworking groups were particularly noteworthy. The only substantial decline
during the year occurred in ordnance, reflecting a drop in production of




116

military goods. Employment in textiles has remained about the same for
the past two years, following a period of decline that dates back—with the
exception of a period immediately after the outbreak of the Korean conflict—to 1948.
UNEMPLOYMENT

The decline in unemployment over the past twelve months took place
while the labor force was increasing sharply. At the end of 1954, with
about 63 J/2 million people in the civilian labor force, unemployment had
fallen to a little under 3 million. During the spring and summer of 1955,
the expansion of job opportunities drew many people into the labor market
and the civilian labor force rose by about 4 million. Meanwhile, after a
seasonal rise early in the year, unemployment declined to a little over 2
million by the end of the summer. At the year end, after declining somewhat less than seasonally since summer, the civilian labor force totaled about
66/ 2 million people and there were about 2.4 million people unemployed
(Table D-17 and Chart 9).
The Bureau of Employment Security statistics on unemployment, which
are a by-product of State and other unemployment insurance programs,
show a decline in insured unemployment of almost 630,000, or 34
percent, over the past twelve months (Table D-21). The rate of decline
in insured unemployment has been more rapid than that for total unemployment, as reported by the Bureau of Census. The difference in movement between the two series may reflect the fact that many recent entrants
to the labor force had not yet acquired eligibility for unemployment
compensation.
The composition of unemployment changed substantially during 1955.
On the average, roughly half of those unemployed in any given month were
no longer in that status in the following month. About two-thirds of those
no longer unemployed had found jobs and the remainder had left the
labor force, in most instances to return to school or to full-time household
duties. Unemployment declined the most among those unemployed the
longest. The number unemployed for 4 weeks or under was not much
different in the fourth quarter of 1955 than in the fourth quarter of 1954;
the number in the 5 to 14 weeks group fell by about 20 percent; and the
number unemployed for 15 weeks or more fell by about 40 percent (Table
D-20). This decline in the number of long-term unemployed was paralleled by a drop in the number of people exhausting their benefit rights
under State unemployment insurance programs, which toward the end of
1955 was averaging less than half the number in the corresponding months
of 1954 (Table D-21). The rate of unemployment among married men
living with their families declined sharply, from about 3 percent at the end
of 1954 to about 2 percent at the end of 1955. The number unemployed
remained about the same among women and teen-age youth, where substantial employment gains were matched by the entry of large numbers into




117

the labor force during the year. Among men 20 years of age and older,
the number unemployed fell by about 25 percent (Table D-18).
The rise in employment which was experienced by most segments of the
population and of industry also spread throughout virtually all sections of
the country. According to statistics compiled by the Bureau of Employment
Security, between 1954 and 1955 the ratio of State-insured unemployment
to covered employment declined in 46 States and fell from 5.2 percent to
3.5 percent for the Nation as a whole (Table B-7). The national perTABLE B—7.—State-insured unemployment as a percent of covered employment, 1954—55

centage was over 4 percent in the first four months of 1955 but averaged
under 3 percent in the second half of the year. As unemployment declined,
it became less uneven geographically. While in 1954 insured unemployment amounted to 7 percent or more of covered employment in nine States
and was 3 percent or less in seven States, in 1955 only one State had a ratio
over 7 percent and twenty States had ratios of 3 percent or less.
At the same time, the severity of unemployment diminished in virtually all of the country's major labor market areas, and many of them were
reclassified by the Bureau of Employment Security during the year in
reflection of their tightening labor supply. Among the 145 major labor
market areas in the United States, the number with a "substantial labor
surplus" fell from 45 at the end of 1954 to 16 at the end of 1955. In some
of these communities, unemployment is a problem of long duration and has
arisen because of the decline of a dominant industry, such as coal mining
or textile manufacturing.
HOURS OF WORK AND EARNINGS

The increase in the average workweek of production workers in manufacturing, which began in April 1954, continued in 1955, bringing with it
an expansion in the number of overtime hours worked. The average workweek rose more than seasonally in the spring of 1955, from 40.2 hours in
January to 40.8 hours in May. Thereafter, its movement was chiefly
seasonal, as it declined in the summer and rose again to 41.4 hours at the
end of the year (Table B-8 and Chart 10). Among nonmanufacturing
industries, the average workweek in metal mining and bituminous coal
mining increased sharply during the expansion, following a marked decline
in the preceding downturn. In most other segments of the economy,
changes in the length of the average workweek were smaller (Table D-23).

As hours of work were increasing, so too were average hourly earnings
(Table D-24). For production workers in manufacturing as a whole,
average hourly earnings rose from $1.83 at the end of 1954 to $1.93 at the
end of 1955; and in durable goods manufacturing, they moved above $2.00
an hour in mid-1955 for the first time. These increases were attributable




partly to higher wage rates, partly to a rise in the number of premium hours
worked and, during the early phase of the expansion, to a relatively great
increase in employment in higher wage industries, such as automobiles and
steel. Outside of manufacturing, hourly earnings also rose during the year.
With the rise in hours of work, including premium hours, and in rates
of pay, weekly earnings improved sharply during 1955. Among production
workers in manufacturing, the increase over 1954 was a larger dollar gain in
real earnings than for any other year since World War I I (Chart B-4). It
amounted to about $5.00 per week after allowance for the small price changes
that occurred during the year. Among nonmanufacturing workers as well,
earnings were generally at record levels at the end of the year. In mining,
the large rise in hours of work contributed heavily to a sharp increase in
weekly earnings (Table D-25).

The Federal Government also raised the pay of its employees during the
year. An increase of 7.5 percent was authorized for classified Federal
civilian workers and an average of 8.3 percent for postal employees, affecting a total of about V/2 million people. These were the first increases since
1951 for the groups affected.
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

DEVELOPMENTS

In a period of expansion, with major labor contracts open for negotiation in most industries and with the demand for supplementary unemploy-




120

ment benefits bringing a relatively new element for major collective agreements to the bargaining table, the tide of industrial disputes might have
been expected to run high. It did not do so. Although there were a few
lengthy strikes and many shorter ones, the number of man days lost through
industrial disputes averaged about one-fourth of 1 percent of estimated
working time, a level only slightly greater than the postwar low point
reached in 1954.
Measures to supplement the benefits paid under State unemployment
insurance programs received relatively great emphasis in 1955 collective
bargaining, particularly in the automobile, farm equipment, can, flat glass,
and maritime industries. The resulting plans are generally designed to
bring unemployment insurance benefits plus the supplement to a total of 60
to 65 percent of take-home pay. The plans vary in detail, however, particularly as to an individual's rights to money paid into the private funds.
In most cases, the risks of unemployment are pooled by establishment of a
general fund from which payments are made to workers covered by the
plan when they become unemployed and are found eligible for State
unemployment benefits. In others, a special account is established in the
name of each worker, from which benefits are payable in the event of his
unemployment because of illness or economic reasons; in addition, the
worker receives any balance in his account if his employment is permanently terminated. In general, the plans are financed by employer payments
of about 5 cents for each hour worked.
The wage changes made through collective bargaining in 1955 were
higher than in 1954 and became larger during the year, as the expansion
gained pace and as major agreements were made. There was wide dispersion in the amounts of settlements, though almost all of them amounted
to at least 5 cents an hour and some to as much as 15 cents or more an hour.
Unions and managements worked out agreements reflecting the widely
varying situations to which their agreements would apply. In many cases,
as was true in 1954 and some earlier years, skilled workers received larger
than average increases, as unions and managements sought to maintain at
least the existing differentials among skill groups. Long-term contracts
were agreed to in important sectors of the economy, and deferred wage
increases covering at least 2% million workers were scheduled for various
dates in 1956 and beyond. Attention was also given to the vesting of
pension rights under established private pension plans, by providing permanent entitlement to benefits after a specified age and length of service.
In December 1955 the two major labor federations merged to form the
American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.
The merger brings together in one group an estimated 15 million workers
in the United States. Collective bargaining will be carried on by the
constitutent unions, as it has been in the past.

III. Prices and Inventories
Industrial and agricultural prices showed diverse movements during 1955.
The index of wholesale prices of industrial commodities was roughly stable
until mid-year and rose thereafter; for the year as a whole, it averaged 2.2
percent higher than in 1954. Prices of farm products in central markets
declined by 6.2 percent, and wholesale prices of processed foods dropped
correspondingly, though by a smaller amount (Table B-9). Since these
divergent movements were largely offsetting, the over-all index of wholesale
prices changed very little, increasing only 0.4 percent from 1954 to 1955
(Chart 12 and Table B-9).

The reduction in farm prices was a prolongation of the downward movement that began in 1951 and which has carried farm prices substantially
below their 1951 levels; industrial prices have risen moderately during the
same interval. When compared with the immediate prewar level, however,
the increase in industrial prices has not been so great as that in farm prices
(Chart B-5).
Price changes in 1955 were small for most major categories of finished
goods. Average prices of finished producer goods showed the largest increase—3 percent from 1954. Wholesale prices of consumer durable goods
advanced only 1 percent, while the rise in prices of consumer nondurable
goods other than foods was even smaller, about 0.6 percent Reductions in




122

food prices, however, outweighed these modest increases for industrial consumer goods, with the result that the index of wholesale prices of finished
consumer goods declined 0.7 percent (Table B-10).

Among retail prices, reductions covered a wide range of commodities,
as average prices of food, apparel, and house furnishings all dropped
1 or 2 percent. Prices of services, however, increased, and therefore the
decline in the over-all average of consumer prices was only 0.3 percent—
smaller than the decrease for commodities alone.
WHOLESALE PRICES

Price advances during 1955 were concentrated largely in the durable
goods sector of the economy (Table B-10). Prices of building materials,
steel, nonferrous metals, and natural rubber responded to the sharply
increased demand that accompanied the expansion of construction activity
and of durable goods production. In addition, high foreign demand
strengthened world prices of many of these materials and, in some instances,
production was temporarily interrupted by strikes at home or abroad.
Prices of finished durable goods tended upward along with prices of materials, but the margin between the two narrowed, especially in consumer durable goods.
Average prices of materials used in nondurable goods manufacturing and
of nondurable goods other than foods rose very little, while those of foods

declined. Large agricultural supplies restrained or depressed prices of
materials used in the manufacture of processed foods and a number of
other nondurable commodities, and ample capacity was generally available
to meet the increased demand for these products.
The movements of the over-all indexes for crude and intermediate materials and for finished goods were largely dominated by changes in prices
of foods and durables, since prices of nondurables other than foods were
comparatively stable. The index of prices of crude materials actually
declined because of the fall in prices of crude feedstuffs and foodstuffs,
which more than offset substantial increases for durable materials (Chart
B-6). Similarly, the advances of the over-all indexes of intermediate materials and finished goods were retarded by reductions for foods and slow
advances for other nondurables.
CONSUMER PRICES

Retail prices of consumer commodities declined 1.4 percent between 1954
and 1955 (Chart B-7 and Table B-9). Retail food prices averaged 1.5 percent lower than in 1954, while apparel prices dropped 0.6 percent and prices
of house furnishings fell 1.9 percent. Service prices increased, however,
with rents up 1.4 percent and average prices of other services 2.3 percent.
In general, prices of consumer commodities have drifted gradually and
irregularly downward since the end of 1951, although small increases occurred during the second half of 1955. At the same time, rents and prices
of other services (including public utility and transportation services) have
increased steadily. These largely offsetting movements gave a slight upward tilt to the consumer price index during 1952 and most of 1953; the
index then declined fractionally to a low in the spring of 1955 and rose
slightly in the following months. In December, it was 114.7, compared with
the high of 115.4 in October 1953.
The decline in retail food prices during 1954-55 was a reflection of the drop in farm prices, although a substantial part of
the latter decline was offset by increased processing and marketing charges. For many household durable goods, however, retail
prices declined relative to wholesale prices as department stores and other
retailers moved to meet the competition of discount houses. Average
retail prices of new automobiles rose during the last few months of 1954
when factory prices increased and dealers discontinued or reduced price
concessions with the arrival of the new models; concessions increased during
the winter and spring of 1955, however, and by September new car prices
were lower than a year earlier. The experience of the preceding year was
then repeated when the 1956 models were introduced late last year and
new car prices again increased.
Prices of a wide variety of consumer services rose during 1954-55, with
increases reported for rents, streetcar and bus fares, medical care, television
and automobile repairs, and other items. In general, service prices have
moved upward, gradually but steadily, since 1946. Compared with prewar
levels, however, they have risen less than commodity prices (Chart B-8).

INVENTORIES

Although inventory change in the business sector has been substantial,
accounting for about 20 percent of the rise in gross national product between
the second quarter of 1954 and the fourth quarter of 1955, the increase in
inventories has not been out of line with the growth of sales (Charts
28 and 29). After falling sharply as sales spurted late in 1954, the ratios
of wholesale and retail inventories to sales held steady throughout 1955.
Within manufacturing, the bulk of the inventory accumulation has taken
the form of goods locked up in the productive process. There were also
accumulations of purchased materials and finished goods, but these occurred
in response to higher levels of economic activity and were small; indeed,
these stocks fell relative to production and sales. Retail stocks of new cars
rose late in 1955. Apart from the automobile industry, which is now bringing its production into better adjustment with market demand, there is
little evidence in the business world of excess or speculative inventory
holdings.

IV. Agricultural Developments
OUTPUT AND STOCKS

Total farm output set a new record in 1955—about 3 percent more than
in 1954 and 12 percent more than in 1950. For most major categories
of farm commodities, previous records were approached or exceeded
(Chart B-9).
Output of all livestock and livestock products rose by nearly 3 percent
during the year, largely as a result of the 4 percent increase over previous
high figures for meat animals while production of poultry and dairy products continued at record levels. Sharply increased pork production and
unprecedented beef production furnished meat supplies of 161 pounds
per capita, the highest since 1908.
Output of all crops in 1955 closely approached the all-time high of 1948,
despite instances of severe weather damage in several areas and acreage
restrictions on the six "basic" crops. Feed grain output was nearly 6
percent higher than in 1954, and second only to 1948. Hay and forage
production rose more than 5 percent and was close to the record set in
1942. Output of oil-bearing crops was 10 percent above the previous
record level of 1954. Though planted acreage in cotton was 12 percent
less than in the previous year, total output increased by 7 percent because of
record-breaking yields. Production of food grains was reduced from that
in the previous year by smaller acreage allotments on wheat and rice, but
the acreage reduction was partially offset by higher yields.
The 1955 crops were produced on about the same total acreage of cropland used in 1954. The index of crop production per acre reached a new
high, 5 percent above 1954 and 1 percent above 1948. The man-hours
of labor used for farm work continued the more or less steady decline that

had begun in 1919. The 1955 figure was about the same as in 1954 and
39 percent below the 1918 peak. Output per man-hour continued the
rise that has been so pronounced since the beginning of World War I I ;
the index reached 130 percent of the 1947-49 average in 1955, an increase
of 16 percent since 1950 and 88 percent since 1940.
These summary figures reflect the rapid changes in our commercial agriculture during the last two decades. Increased use of machinery to replace
human labor and horses, increased use of fertilizer, widespread adoption
of many new production techniques, and increasing farm size which facilitates adoption of these more efficient methods have all contributed to the
rapid rise in output (Chart B-10).
At the beginning of the crop year stocks of most major farm commodities
were unusually high, and the bulk of the carry-over of most price-supported
commodities was held by the CCC (Chart B-l 1). Production in 1955 again
exceeded market demand at current prices, and CCC inventories and commitments for loans outstanding reached the record level of 8.2 billion dollars
on November 30, 1955. World supplies of many agricultural products
are at all-time highs, and surpluses of cotton and wheat are particularly
large.
FARM PRICE MOVEMENTS

Average prices received by farmers for all products remained fairly
stable in the first half of the year, slightly above the level of the last months
of 1954. In mid-1955 the impact of the near-record harvest began to
be felt, and the index of prices received by farmers declined in almost every
month from June through December. On December 15, 1955, the index
of prices received was 7 percent below that of a year earlier (Chart B-l2).
The decline in the average conceals many divergent price movements.
The December 1955 index of prices received for poultry and eggs was
32 percent higher than in December 1954, and prices received for dairy
products, tobacco, and commercial vegetables were all slightly higher than
a year earlier. The largest price declines were in products marked by
high current output; and for some of these products, carry-over stocks
were already abnormally heavy. The December 1955 index of feed grain
prices was 16 percent lower than the index in December 1954. Because
of the record output, prices of oil-bearing crops decreased by 17 percent
between December 15, 1954 and December 15, 1955; and the larger crop
of potatoes resulted in sharply lower prices to potato producers. The
index of prices received for meat animals was 21 percent lower on December 15 than a year earlier, largely because the average price of hogs had
dropped by 38 percent.
The prices paid by farmers for commodities used in family living remained
relatively stable during the year. Prices paid for items used in production
declined slightly, primarily as a result of lower feed prices. In the last few
months these declines were partially offset by increases in the prices paid
for motor vehicles and farm machinery. The expansion of nonfarm

employment opportunities contributed to a rise in farm wage rates, which
at the end of the year were 3 percent higher than a year earlier and more
than 5 times the average in the 1910-14 base period. The index of farm
real-estate taxes rose by nearly 5 percent during 1955, and that for interest
charges by 8 percent. The index of prices paid by farmers, interest rates,
taxes, and wage rates are combined to form the "parity index," which was at
the same level at the end of 1955 as a year earlier.
Since the parity index remained unchanged while the index of prices
received decreased during 1955, the parity ratio declined (Chart B-12).
The average for the year was 84, which was 6 percent below the 1954 average. On December 15, 1955 the parity ratio was 80, or 7 percent less than
the figure for a year earlier.
FARM

INCOME

The increased sales of farm products during the year were not enough
to offset the fall in farm prices, and net farm income declined. Realized
net farm income of farm operators in 1955 is now estimated at 10.6 billion
dollars, a decrease of 10 percent from 1954.
The number of farms continued to decline as existing farms were enlarged to improve efficiency, but net income per farm dropped by about
9 percent. As the economy expanded and nonfarm demands for labor
increased, farm people earned more from nonfarm sources, but preliminary




132

indications point to a 6 percent decline in per capita income of farm
people from all sources (Chart B-13).
Nevertheless, many farmers received higher incomes in 1955 than in
1954. Estimates of the Department of Agriculture made for four types
of commercial farms indicate that for some farms 1955 was a much better
year than 1954. Cotton farmers in the Southern Piedmont region, with
unusually high yields for this price-supported crop, found their net incomes
increased substantially. For dairy farms in the Central Northeast, the
higher milk output when prices were stable and feed costs somewhat lower
resulted in slightly higher incomes. After very low yields in 1954, wheatsmall grain-livestock farms in the Northern Plains generally experienced
improved yields in 1955, which raised their income. On the other hand,
hog-dairy producers in the Corn Belt found their incomes sharply reduced
by lower hog prices which were only partially offset by larger marketings.
In the Western Corn Belt many producers suffered from a combination
of severe drought and low hog prices.

There were also important regional differences in the changes in farm
income in 1955 (Table B - l l ) . Realized net income in New England, the
Middle Atlantic States, and the Pacific States averaged approximately
the same as in 1954; in the South Atlantic and East South Central
regions, it was higher in 1955 than in 1954; and in the West South Central




133

the East North Central, the West North Central, and the Mountain regions
it declined—the decline in the last three regions amounting to 20 percent
or more. Variations in weather, yields, and individual commodity prices
account for most of these variations between regions. Such variations are
not unusual in agriculture, and statistics showing total United States farm
income often obscure important regional divergences.

AGRICULTURAL FINANCES

Farm prices and incomes generally declined during the year, and both
farm mortgage debt and nonmortgage debt rose. Yet total farm asset values
and owners5 equities in these assets increased, chiefly because the value of
farm real estate continued to rise.
Average values of farm real estate on November 1, 1955 were 6 percent
higher than a year earlier, and above the peak that had been reached in
1952. There were new record values in nearly half of the States. This
strength of farm real estate prices is unusual in the light of the trend in farm
prices and incomes and of past relationships. The demand for farm real
estate arises in part from the desire of farm operators to enlarge existing
farms in order to utilize labor and machines more efficiently. Sales to
farm operators accounted for an increasing proportion of farm sales in
1955.
Farm real-estate debt increased by an estimated 10 percent during 1955.
It was to be expected that, as land prices moved upward and increasing
numbers of younger operators entered farming, farm mortgage debt would
rise from its very low level at the end of World War II. However, in historical perspective the present ratio of mortgage debt to real-estate value
is low (Table B-12). The rate of farm foreclosures increased slightly
during the vear ended March 1. 1955: but it was still below that in anv
year prior to 1944. onlv one-ninth of the average for 1925-29 and onefourteenth of the 1930-34 average. Preliminary indications suggest little
change in this rate in 1955.

Farmers' financial assets changed very little during the year. Non-realestate debt rose about 8 percent, but the rise in real-estate values was more
than enough to offset total debt increases. Owners' equities rose about 3
percent.

V. Financial Developments
Credit demands were high in practically all sectors of the economy during 1955. The rise in borrowing by home owners and automobile purchasers, and in bank borrowing by businessmen, exceeded increases in any
previous year. Commercial banks sold a large volume of United States
Government securities and added record amounts to their loan portfolios.
The value of security offerings by State and local governments declined,
while those of corporations increased moderately. The rate of growth in
the money supply slowed down. Interest rates rose.

BANK CREDIT AND BANK RESERVES

Total loans and investments of commercial banks increased by 4.4 billion
dollars in 1955 (Chart 18 and Table B-13). While loans increased by 11.3
billion dollars, holdings of United States Government securities fell by 7.1
billion. Investments in other securities increased by only 0.2 billion dollars.
The rise in commercial bank lending—the largest dollar increase in any
single year since the end of World War II—was concentrated in business,
consumer, and real estate loans. Business loans accounted for 5.6 billion
of the expansion in total loans. Increased borrowing was widespread in
industry and trade, particularly among public utilities and petroleum,
chemical, trade, and textile companies, but the largest business borrowers
were sales finance companies. Loans to consumers, which had declined by
0.2 billion dollars in 1954, increased in 1955 by 2.2 billion. Real estate
loans rose by 2.4 billion dollars, 0.7 billion more than in 1954.

NOTE.—Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding.

Excess reserves of member banks, which averaged slightly more than 800
million dollars during the summer of 1954, declined gradually and irregularly until they reached an average of about 500 million dollars in November
1955 (Chart 20 and Table D-44). Member bank borrowings at the
Federal Reserve Banks, on the other hand, increased from an average
of less than 100 million dollars to over 1 billion during the same period.
Thus, "free" reserves of member banks (excess reserves less borrowings
from the Reserve Banks) declined from over 700 million dollars in the
summer of 1954 to minus 500 million in November 1955. In December
1955, "free" reserves gained about 250 million dollars, as member bank
borrowings declined and excess reserves increased.
The change in the distribution of the publicly held Federal debt during
1955 is shown in Table B-14. The total debt held by the public decreased




136

by 0.1 billion dollars during 1955. Sales or redemptions of government
securities by commercial banks and the Federal Reserve Banks amounted
to 7.3 billion. The difference of 7.2 billion was absorbed mainly by nonfinancial corporations, State and local governments, individuals, pension
funds, savings and loan associations, and foreign investors; Federal security
holdings of insurance companies and mutual savings banks decreased slightly.
About one-third of the funds required to purchase this large volume of
securities came from individuals—either directly, or through State and
local and private retirement funds. Nonfinancial corporations, which had
sold 1.7 billion dollars of Federal securities during 1954, purchased 3 billion
in 1955.

T H E GROWTH OF PRIVATE DEBT

Net private debt rose by almost 39 billion dollars, an increase exceeded
only in 1950, and almost three times the rise in 1954 (Chart 24 and Table
D-47). Borrowings to finance purchases of homes and of consumer durable
goods contributed about one-half of the total 1955 increase. At the end of
the year, net private debt outstanding amounted to an estimated 381 billion
dollars, about 170 percent higher than the total at the end of World War II.
Private obligations accounted for almost three-fifths of the total outstanding
at the end of 1955; a decade earlier they had represented only one-third
of the total. Despite the rise during recent years, net private debt amounted
to about IJ/5 of a year's expenditures by consumers and businessmen in
1955, compared with ratios of iys in 1929 and tt/5 in 1939.
Mortgage Debt
Nonfarm mortgage debt, which had risen by 12 billion dollars in 1954,
increased by another 16.3 billion in 1955, to an all-time high of 121.7 billion.
More than four-fifths of this increase was due to a rise in mortgages on 1 - to




137

4-family nonfarm houses. The increase in outstanding Federally underwritten mortgages amounted to 50 percent of the total rise in outstanding
debt on 1- to 4-family dwellings, the largest proportion since 1951 (Table
D-42).
Consumer Credit
Consumer credit outstanding increased by 6.1 billion dollars in 1955,
compared with 600 million in 1954 and an average of 3 billion in earlier
postwar years. Instalment credit accounted for 5.3 billion dollars of the
total 1955 increase (Chart 21 and Tables B-15 and D-40). In turn, 3.9
billion of the increase in instalment loans reflected net extensions of credit
to purchase automobiles. Other consumer goods paper and personal loans
each rose by a little more than 0.7 billion dollars, while outstanding repair
and modernization loans remained practically unchanged for the second
consecutive year.

Preliminary estimates by Council of Economic Advisers.
NOTE.—Data are not adjusted for seasonal variation.
Source: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (except as noted).

The rapid growth in outstanding instalment credit was the result of a
sharp rise in extensions of new credit while repayments increased moderately (Chart 22 and Table D-41). The tendency for repayments to rise
more slowly than extensions was reinforced during 1955 by the lengthening
of maturities on new contracts, which reduced average monthly payments
relative to credit extensions. Extensions of all types of instalment credit
increased from a seasonally adjusted monthly rate of 2.4 billion dollars in
the summer of 1954 to a high of 3.2 billion in the third quarter of 1955.
The rate declined to 3.1 billion per month in the last quarter, but at that
rate it was still well above prior-year levels. Repayments increased from




138

a monthly rate of 2.4 billion dollars in mid-1954 to 2.8 billion in the last
three months of 1955, so that by the end of 1955 the gap between extensions and repayments was narrowing.
The sharp increase in extensions of automobile credit began after the
1955 models were introduced late in 1954. From a seasonally adjusted
monthly rate of 1.1 billion dollars in the third quarter of 1954, extensions
of automobile credit rose to a record monthly rate of over 1.5 billion in
May 1955; they continued at about that level through the third quarter
of the year, and then declined slightly in the last quarter. Automobile
credit extensions totaled 17.8 billion dollars in 1955, 5.3 billion or 42 percent
more than in the previous year (Table D-41).
Instalment credit expansion also played an important role during 1955
in markets for consumer durable goods other than automobiles. Extensions
of other consumer goods paper increased by about 1.4 billion dollars
between 1954 and 1955, an increase which contributed to the growth in
consumer purchases of furniture and major household appliances.
CAPITAL MARKETS

The value of securities offered by State and local governments amounted
to almost 6 billion dollars in 1955, 1 billion less than in the previous year
(Table B-16). This decline was attributable mainly to a reduction in tollroad issues. Borrowing for most other purposes was at or near the 1954
levels. New issues for the construction of school buildings accounted for
more than 25 percent of the capital raised in 1955 by State and local governments through long-term borrowing.
The total volume of corporate security offerings amounted to 10.2 billion
dollars in 1955, 7 percent higher than a year earlier. The new capital
obtained by corporations from these issues (net proceeds less amounts
applied to retirement of securities) increased by 17 percent between 1954
and 1955—from 7.5 billion dollars to 8.8 billion. Most of this increase
was accounted for by the larger offerings of sales and personal finance
companies. Flotations by corporations to raise working capital rose by
more than 50 percent. Offerings to finance plant and equipment expanded
by only 5 percent.
While the total volume of new corporate security issues increased moderately, common stock flotations rose by more than 80 percent between
1954 and 1955 (Table B-16). Greater use was also made of bond issues
which are convertible into stock. The increased attractiveness of equity
financing was the result of the rise in stock prices, which had begun in
September 1953 and continued through most of September 1955 with few
minor interruptions. In late September and early October, there was a
brief, but sharp, decline; the subsequent recovery brought stock prices back
to about the previous peak reached in September. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission index, stock prices increased by 85 percent
in the 2% years ended December 1955 (Chart 16 and Table D-58).

Credit extended for the purpose of carrying securities, including customers' debit balances and direct bank loans of weekly reporting member banks
to persons other than brokers or dealers, rose by more than 40 percent in
1954. After margin requirements were raised in January and April 1955,
the rate of increase in stock market credit dropped sharply. The rise—as
measured by customers' debit balances and bank loans to persons other than
brokers or dealers—amounted to about 300 million dollars in the last nine
months of 1955, compared with 1.1 billion in the preceding nine-month
period. Customers' debit balances represented less than V/2 percent of
the value of shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange at the end
of 1955, compared with about 9 percent in 1928 and 1929 (using brokers
loans as the most nearly comparable series).
In the latter part of 1953 and throughout 1954, the Treasury refrained
from issuing long-term securities. In 1955, on the other hand, the Treasury
issued a new 3-percent, 40-year bond in exchange for maturing securities
in February, and made an additional cash offering of the same bond in
July. Together, these offerings moved 2?4 billion dollars of Federal debt
into long-term securities. Apart from seasonal borrowing, other cash
and refunding needs in 1955 were met by the issue of notes and certificates
and, beginning in July, by an increase of 100 million dollars in each of
the 13 regular weekly offerings of Treasury bills.
MONEY SUPPLY AND INTEREST RATES

The money supply—defined as the total of adjusted demand deposits and
currency—rose rapidly during the second half of 1954, but its growth was
sharply reduced in the following year. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the
money supply increased at an average annual rate of 4.7 percent in the
second half of 1954; during 1955, its growth averaged 2.6 percent (Chart 19




140

and Tables B-17 and D-45). Time deposits, which are not included in the
conventional definition of the money supply, rose by 7 percent during 1954
and 4 percent during 1955.

The average annual rate of turnover of demand deposits (other than
interbank and United States Government deposits) increased by almost 7
percent between 1954 and 1955 in 337 cities outside major financial centers.
Interest rates generally reached their low points in 1954 before the business recovery got under way (Chart 17 and Table D-46). Yields on
Federal securities rose in the second half of 1954, while commercial paper
rates and yields on private and municipal securities were largely unchanged.
After the turn of the year, most interest rates exhibited a rising trend, but
the most pronounced changes were in the rates on short-term funds. Offering rates on Treasury bills, which averaged 0.65 percent in June 1954, rose
to an average of almost 2.6 percent in December 1955. Rates on prime
commercial paper with 4-6 months maturity remained at about 1*/$ percent
throughout the second half of 1954, but then advanced sharply; by the end
of 1955, they were 3 percent. Commercial banks increased the rate charged
on loans to prime customers from 3 percent to 3% percent in August 1955
and then to 3J4 percent in October. Between July and November, rates
on bank loans to security dealers and brokers were raised from 3 percent to
3^2-3^4 percent. The increases during 1955 brought short-term rates to
levels which exceeded the 1953 peaks.
For most long-term interest rates, the 1953-54 decline terminated in the
spring of 1954, several months before the upturn in business activity began.
Corporate bond yields changed little during the remainder of 1954, and
those on Federal, State and local bonds increased slightly in the latter half
of the year. Thereafter, yields on all types of long-term securities increased
until the late summer of 1955; they declined slightly in the early fall, and
then recovered to about the summer levels by the end of the year. In
December 1955, most bond yields were at about the levels prevailing early in
1953, but were still below their mid-1953 highs.

VI. Government Finances
FEDERAL FINANCES

Federal expenditures have been reduced sharply since 1953. For fiscal
year 1955, net budget expenditures were 64.6 billion dollars, 9.7 billion less
than in 1953 and 3.2 billion less than in 1954. The estimated expenditures
for fiscal years 1956 and 1957 are 64.3 billion and 65.9 billion dollars,
respectively (Table B-18). The reduction in expenditures was primarily in
the national security programs, the net budget expenditures for Department
of Defense military functions and total Mutual Security programs declining
from 49.8 billion dollars in fiscal year 1953 to 45.2 billion in fiscal year 1954
and 39.8 billion in fiscal year 1955. For fiscal years 1956 and 1957, the
estimates are 38.8 billion and 39.8 billion dollars, respectively.

Federal receipts also were reduced, reflecting primarily a cut in taxes of
about 7*/2 billion dollars since 1953. Such receipts for fiscal year 1955 were
60.4 billion dollars, 4.3 billion less than in 1954, and 4.4 billion less than in
1953. The estimated receipts for fiscal year 1956 are 64.5 billion; and
for fiscal 1957, they are 66.3 billion dollars.
Despite the large tax reductions since 1953, the budget is being brought
into balance. The deficit in the conventional budget has been greatly
reduced. In fiscal year 1955 the deficit amounted to 4.2 billion dollars,
compared with a deficit of 3.1 billion in 1954 and 9.4 billion in 1953. For
fiscal year 1956, a surplus of 200 million dollars is estimated; and for fiscal
1957, a surplus of 400 million (Chart 33).
On a consolidated cash basis (Table B-18), payments to the public in
fiscal year 1955 exceeded receipts from the public by 2.7 billion dollars.
This compares with cash deficits of 200 million dollars for fiscal year 1954




142

and 5.3 billion dollars for fiscal 1953. For each of the fiscal years 1956
and 1957, the cash surplus is estimated at 2.4 billion dollars.
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCES

The combined cash deficits of State and local governments in fiscal year
1955 amounted to 1.4 billion dollars, the highest in the past five fiscal years.
Both receipts and payments were substantially greater than in fiscal 1954,
but payments rose the more rapidly (Table B-19).

The increase in payments by State and local governments in 1955, which
continued the upward trend evident since the end of the war, was due
principally to outlays for capital improvements (for which needs had accumulated during the war), the rapid increase in population (especially in
the metropolitan areas and in the school and retired age groups), and
the public demand for more adequate governmental services to match the
rise in the standard of living. Among the States' pressing needs are
public roads and institutions for the mentally and physically handicapped.
The States are also providing increased financial assistance to their local
governments, either directly by participating in such programs as public
education, or indirectly through grants to local governments. At the local
level, public education continues to be a major problem. The postwar
increase in the number of births is having its impact on the need for additional classrooms, instructional materials, and teachers. The local governments are also confronted with urgent needs for sanitary and recreational
facilities, streets and roads, and enlarged provision for public welfare and
protection of life and property.




143

The increase in receipts reflects the high level of economic activity and
the consequent widespread increase in payments of State and local taxes
of all types, particularly corporate and personal income taxes, automotive
taxes, cigarette taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes. The States are
making an effort to finance their expenditures from their own resources, and
to help their political subdivisions. They are also renewing their assistance
in improving local property tax procedures. Collections from the property
tax have doubled since 1946. Local governments are also being granted
increasing authority to use nonproperty taxes to supplement their revenues
from the property tax.
The gross debt of State and local governments rose from 37.9 billion
dollars on June 30, 1954 to 43.2 billion on June 30, 1955. Of the 5.3 billion
dollar increase, 1.6 billion was in State debt and 3.7 billion in local debt.
Highways and school construction account for about 45 percent of the
increase in total State and local debt. The most rapid expansion was in
debt repayable from the proceeds of revenue-producing projects, such as
toll highways, water systems, and sewage plants, rather than in debt serviced
from tax revenues. State and local debt as of June 30, 1955 amounted to
11.2 percent of the gross national product, compared with 10.5 percent a
year earlier, and a little over 8 percent at the beginning of the decade
(Table B-20). The percentage figures in prewar years were substantially
higher.

These accounts, like the cash budget, include the transactions of the trust accounts. Unlike both the
conventional budget and the cash statement, they exclude certain capital and lending transactions. In
general, they do not use the cash basis for transactions with business. Instead, corporate profits taxes are
included in receipts on an accrual instead of a cash basis; expenditures are timed with the delivery instead
of the payment for goods and services; and CCO guaranteed price-support crop loans financed by the banks
are counted as expenditures when the loans are made, not when COO redeems them.

amounted to 2.7 billion dollars; in each of the two preceding years there
had been a deficit of 6.2 billion dollars, and in 1952 a deficit oi 3.4 billion.
Both the receipts and expenditures of State and local governments, in
contrast, increased persistently throughout the period 1951-55. In 1954
and again in 1955, expenditures of State and local governments on
goods and services increased relative to such expenditures of the Federal
Government.

VII. Economic Relations With Foreign Countries
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PROGRESS ABROAD

During 1955 economic expansion continued at an accelerated pace in
the developed countries of the Free World. Industrial output rose to
new peaks in most countries—that in Canada and Japan reaching new
highs after mild recessions during 1954. The rapid rise in European output, which began early in 1953, has taken place without a substantial rise
in consumer prices in most countries. Except in Italy, unemployment
in most of Western Europe has been reduced to low levels and in some countries is virtually negligible. Moderate rates of growth have been achieved
in many of the less developed countries in Latin America and Asia. Some,
however, have failed to participate in the economic growth and prosperity
of the industrial nations. This is particularly true of certain countries
that are heavily dependent upon exports of agricultural commodities,
the prices of which have declined over the past year.
The expansion of world production has been accompanied by a rise in
the volume of international trade above the postwar record achieved in
1954 and by a strengthening of the financial positions of many countries.
During 1955 gold and dollar holdings of foreign countries increased by
an estimated 1.7 billion dollars, chiefly in Continental Western Europe
(Table D-65). The gold and dollar holdings of international institutions,
including the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, increased by about 200 million dollars. The most adverse movement in the international financial picture
was the decline in British gold and dollar reserves by about 640 million
dollars. In the early part of the year, balance of payments difficulties
arose in Scandinavia, and a number of the less developed countries also
experienced difficulties during 1955. The international economic position
of Western Europe as a whole remained strong; its exports in the first
three quarters of 1955 were considerably above those in the corresponding
period of 1954. There was also a striking improvement in the foreign
trade balance of Japan, which still meets a part of its foreign expenditures
with dollars obtained from the sale of goods and services to United States
military forces.
There has been a general relaxation of trade and exchange restrictions during 1954 and 1955, which has benefited exports from the




146

United States. In January 1955, the members of the Organization for
European Economic Cooperation raised from 75 percent to 90 percent
their target for the liberalization of intra-European trade from quota
restrictions. Eleven members have already achieved the new goal, and
four others have achieved or exceeded the 75 percent goal. In addition,
over half of the private dollar imports of the OEEG countries have been
freed from quota and licensing restrictions, compared with less than onethird at the beginning of 1954. In the same vein, there has been a notable
relaxation in the administration of the remaining quantitative restrictions
against exports from the dollar area. Several European countries, including Belgium-Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Greece, and Switzerland, now
have virtually no import restrictions discriminatory against United States
commodities, and free international commodity markets for a number of
commodities have been restored in Britain and the Netherlands. The
improved financial position abroad has also promoted an expansion of longterm private international investment during the past two years.
WORLD COMMODITY DEVELOPMENTS

The industrial boom in Western Europe, together with our stockpile purchases, tended to offset the slackening of United States industrial demand
for nonagricultural materials in the first three quarters of 1954. Since
that time, the continued economic expansion in Europe and the resurgence
of industrial activity in this country have led to sharp advances in world
prices of industrial raw materials, particularly scrap metals, copper, zinc,
and rubber. Europe's accelerated industrial growth has also raised the
demand for coal and steel well beyond European production. Consequently, a strong element in the expansion of our exports between the
third quarter of 1954 and the first quarter of 1955 was the rise in sales of
coal, steel scrap, and steel, and these exports have continued to be large.
High rates of industrial activity here and abroad have raised prices of
industrial materials and semifinished goods. On the other hand, prices
of coffee and cocoa dropped sharply in late 1954 and the first half of
1955, and world prices for agricultural commodities, partly because of
the huge supplies in the United States, were generally weak during the
past year. Moreover, increased freedom of trade and advances in productivity have helped to hold down prices of manufactured products.
World agricultural production outside the United States exceeded the
high levels of 1954 in such important commodities as wheat, rice, cotton,
tobacco, peanuts, and soybeans. Foreign wheat production in 1955 is
estimated at some 400 million bushels higher than in 1954, and stocks of
wheat are at record levels in the principal exporting countries. Foreign
production of cotton increased by about 1.2 million bales in 1955, and
foreign countries as a group are producing within 2 million bales of the
quantity which they have been consuming. These developments partially




147

explain the shrinkage of our cotton exports from 5.5 million bales for the
1951 crop year to about half as much in the current crop year.
Favorable growing weather in many parts of the world contributed to
expanded production during 1955. However, of particular significance
has been the trend toward higher production arising from technological
progress and numerous government-sponsored programs to increase farm
output. In the years immediately following World War II, output
remained low in many areas because the disruptions caused by the war
could not be quickly overcome. By 1955 the results of intensive efforts
to enlarge agricultural yields and output were clearly evident.
TOTAL EXPORTS AND IMPORTS

In the twelve months ended September 30, 1955, our exports of goods
and services, excluding military aid transfers, totaled 19.3 billion dollars—
2 billion above such exports in the corresponding period ended September 30, 1954 and 2.3 billion above those in the calendar year 1953 (Table
B-22). These exports constituted about 5 percent of our gross national
product, compared with about 4 percent for nonfarm residential construction and 6 percent for the output of producer durable goods, two significant determinants of business activity. Military aid transfers declined from
4.3 billion dollars in 1953 and 3.1 billion in 1954 to 2.3 billion for the twelve
months ended September 30, 1955.

The relatively high level of exports in 1954 occurred in the face of a
moderate decline in nonmilitary imports of goods and services. This was
made possible in considerable measure by a heavy outflow of private capital
and increased military expenditures abroad, which helped to provide the
dollars to support the expanding foreign demand for our goods. In fact,
total payments to foreigners arising from nonmilitary imports of goods and
services, military expenditures abroad, foreign investments, and nonmilitary
grants, were slightly higher in 1954 than in 1953, and were significantly
higher in the first three quarters of 1955 than in the corresponding periods
of 1953 and 1954 (Table B-22).
During the first three quarters of 1955, nonmilitary imports of goods
and services rose to an average quarterly rate of 3.7 billion dollars, compared with 3.3 billion in the corresponding period in 1954 and 3.5 billion
in the calendar year 1953. Nonmilitary commodity imports rose steadily
after the third quarter of 1954, and in the third quarter of 1955 were
14 percent above such imports in the third quarter of 1954. The rise
in foreign travel and the increase in transportation and other service
expenditures helped to push total nonmilitary imports of goods and services during the year ended September 30, 1955 to the highest level in
our history.

sive of military aid shipments) reached 21 billion dollars during the year
ended September 30, 1955 (Table B-22). This amount exceeded foreign
purchases of United States goods and services during the same period. Foreigners therefore accumulated 1.6 billion dollars in gold and dollar assets in
their transactions with the United States, only a little less than in the
corresponding period ended September 30, 1954. This level of foreign
accumulation was maintained in spite of an increase of over a billion
dollars in the United States current account surplus (excluding military
exports and imports), as our military expenditures abroad, nonmilitary
grants, and foreign investments rose.
Merchandise Trade
During the first three quarters of 1954, nonmilitary merchandise exports
were maintained at approximately the same high levels as in 1953. In
the fourth quarter of 1954, exports rose sharply in response to the accelerated expansion in world demand, especially in Western Europe and the
sterling area. This rise in exports gave an additional stimulus to our business expansion in the fall and winter of 1954-55, and the high level of
world demand during 1954 helped to sustain the prices of internationally
traded commodities. Exports continued to rise during 1955. In the year
ended September 30, 1955 exports reached 13.9 billion dollars, the largest
total since the year 1951 (Table B-22).
During the first ten months of 1955, nonmilitary merchandise exports
from this country were about 12 percent higher than in the corresponding
months of 1954 and about 16 percent above the corresponding period of
1953. The rise in agricultural exports over 1954 was 8.8 percent: exports
of wheat, coarse grains, tobacco, meats, and dairy products rose, while
exports of cotton and rice fell (Table D-64). On a fiscal-year basis,
agricultural exports increased from 2.9 billion dollars in 1953-54 to 3.1
billion in 1954-55. In 1954-55 agricultural exports under special programs
including grants, loans, sales for foreign currencies, and barter represented
nearly 30 percent of the total, and an additional 15 percent were subsidized
(Table B-23).
The principal increases in nonagricultural exports were in steel products,
motor vehicles and parts, chemicals, coal, and paper. The rise in exports
of steel, steel scrap, and coal represented about 40 percent of the total
increase in nonagricultural exports from the first ten months of 1954 to the
first ten months of 1955. Total export sales to Canada, Western Europe,
and the sterling area increased, while those to Latin America and Japan
declined (Table B-24).
Commodity imports during the first ten months of 1955 were nearly
10 percent above the corresponding period of 1954, and 2.6 percent above
the corresponding period in 1953 (Table D-64). Economic expansion in
this country in 1955 led to increased imports of raw materials, including
rubber, lumber, iron ore, and petroleum, but imports of some industrial
raw materials were held down by supply shortages abroad. Imports of

agricultural commodities declined in value largely as a result of the fall
in prices of coffee and cocoa, and lower demand induced by expectations of
further price declines. A significant development was the increase in
imports of finished manufactures—a 17 percent rise in the first ten months
of 1955 over the corresponding period in 1954. The increased demand and
rising prices for raw materials resulted in higher imports from Canada and
South East Asia, while Western Europe and Japan shared in our growing
markets for manufactures. Reduced values of imports of coffee and other
agricultural commodities were responsible for the lower purchases from
Latin America, especially from Brazil and Colombia.

CAPITAL MOVEMENTS AND GOVERNMENT LOANS

The value of United States private investments abroad has risen steadily
throughout the postwar period; at the end of 1954 it was 26.6 billion
dollars, including long-term investments of 24.4 billion. The outflow of
American private capital in 1954 was greater than in the previous year,
mainly because of a sharp increase in short-term lending abroad. Direct
investments slightly exceeded the 1953 level, and the net movement of portfolio capital changed from an inflow of 185 million dollars in 1953 to an outflow of 225 million in 1954. In 1955, large redemptions and repayments
and a smaller volume of Canadian and International Bank borrowings
reduced the net outflow of long-term portfolio capital to 51 million dollars
in the first three quarters of the year; direct investments were somewhat
higher than in the corresponding period of 1954 (Table D-60).
There has been a modest revival during the last two years of American
private investment in foreign equity securities outside of Canada. During
1954 and the first three quarters of 1955, net purchases of outstanding
equity securities of foreign corporations totaled 278 million dollars, about
two-thirds of which represented British and Continental European securities. Medium- and long-term bank loans abroad totaled 282 million dollars
during the same period; a large part of these were made to Latin America
and some of them represented a conversion of short-term loans made in 1954.




152

Outstanding foreign loans of the United States Government declined by
100 million dollars, to 15.6 billion dollars, in 1954, reflecting repayments
in excess of new credits. Repayments, which have been running at about
a half billion dollars annually in recent years, are in large part to reduce
government loans made during the early postwar years. Total net capital
outflow on government account in the first three quarters of 1955 was 291
million dollars, of which 275 million was short-term (Table D-60).
Earnings on our foreign investments amounted to 2.4 billion dollars for
the twelve-month period ended September 30, 1955 (excluding reinvested
earnings of foreign subsidiaries). This is a major item in our receipts from
foreign countries. Over 200 million dollars of these receipts represent
interest payments on government loans abroad. The bulk of the earnings
comes from direct private foreign investments.

ACTIVITIES OF THE COUNCIL




OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS
DURING 1955




Letter of Transmittal
DECEMBER 30,

1955.

The PRESIDENT.

SIR: The Council of Economic Advisers submits this Annual Report
for calendar year 1955 in accordance with the requirements of Congress,
as set forth in Section 4 (d) of the Employment Act of 1946.
Respectfully,




ARTHUR F. BURNS, Chairman.
JOSEPH S. DAVIS,
RAYMOND J. SAULNIER.

157

Report to the President on the Activities of the Council
of Economic Advisers During 1955
The Employment Act of 1946 declares it to be the continuing policy and
responsibility of the Federal Government to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power by all means consistent with its
other obligations and in a manner calculated to foster free competitive
enterprise and the general welfare. The Council of Economic Advisers
was established under this Act.
On August 1, 1953 the Council was reconstituted under the President's
Reorganization Plan No. 9 of 1953. This reorganization strengthened the
internal administration of the Council and clarified its relationships with
the President.
Changes in Council Membership
Neil H. Jacoby, who served as a member of the Council from September
15, 1953 to February 9, 1955, while on leave from his university duties, returned on the latter date to the deanship of the School of Business Administration at the University of California, Los Angeles. Walter W. Stewart,
Professor Emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New
Jersey, who served as a member of the Council from December 2, 1953,
resigned April 29, 1955, but he has continued to serve the Council in a
consultant capacity.
Raymond J. Saulnier, Professor of Economics at Barnard College and
Director of the Financial Research Program of the National Bureau of
Economic Research, both of New York City, was nominated for membership on the Council on March 23, 1955. Joseph S. Davis, Director Emeritus
of the Food Research Institute, Stanford University, was nominated at the
same time. Both nominations were confirmed on April 1, 1955. Mr.
Saulnier took office on April 4, 1955 and Mr. Davis on May 2, 1955.
Major Activities During the Year
During the year, the Council kept economic developments under close
and continuous scrutiny and reported regularly to the President, through its
Chairman, on current economic conditions and prospects. In a year
marked by rapid economic expansion not only in our own country but
throughout the Free World, the central object of the Council was to advise
the President on policies that would promote the extension of prosperity
and at the same time restrain excesses that could eventually lead to economic recession. The Council gave special attention to monetary, finan-




158

rial, and agricultural problems, and to ways of extending prosperity to
lagging areas.
As in previous years, the Council worked closely with the departments
and agencies of the Government whose activities bear significantly on economic developments. The Chairman attended Cabinet meetings regularly, and presented the Council's views on economic conditions and on
policies that would contribute to continuing prosperity. The Council
kept in close touch with other policy-making and advisory groups in the
Executive Branch, including the National Security Council, the Defense
Mobilization Board, the National Advisory Council on International Financial and Monetary Problems, and the Council on Foreign Economic Policy.
The Council assisted in the preparation of the Economic Report of the
President, transmitted to the Congress on January 20, 1955. This Report
dealt with economic developments and policies during 1953-54. It also
presented the President's recommendations to the Congress and his suggestions to State, local, and private groups for actions that would promote
stable economic growth.
Hearings on the Economic Report of the President were held by the
Joint Committee on the Economic Report in January and February 1955.
The Chairman of the Council, accompanied by the other Council Members,
was the first witness at these hearings, appearing in executive session on
January 24. He discussed the findings and recommendations of the Report.
Responding to requests from members of the Committee, the Council later
submitted additional materials as part of its testimony.
The review of Economic Indicators, which the Council undertook last
year with the Joint Committee on the Economic Report, was completed.
A number of improvements suggested by the Council's study were incorporated in the publication in the course of the year, as the technical
problems associated with these changes were solved.
Advisory Board on Economic Growth and Stability
During the year, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
was added to the agencies represented on the Advisory Board on Economic
Growth and Stability. This change brought the membership of the Board
to ten. The expectation expressed by the President at the time of the
Advisory Board's establishment, namely, that it would make the work of
the Council more effective at the top policy level of the Executive Branch,
has been fully realized. The Advisory Board, which meets weekly, has
been immensely helpful in coordinating the economic policies and actions
of the various departments and agencies of the Government. The Chairman of the Council serves also as the Chairman of the Advisory Board.
The present membership of the Board is as follows:
Department of State—Herbert V. Prochnow, Deputy Under Secretary
for Economic Affairs
Department of the Treasury—W. Randolph Burgess, Under Secretary
for Monetary Affairs




159

Department of Agriculture—True D. Morse, Under Secretary
Department of Commerce—Walter Williams, Under Secretary
Department of Labor—Arthur Larson, Under Secretary
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare—Marion B. Folsom,
Secretary
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System—Abbot L. Mills,
Member of the Board
Bureau of the Budget—Percival F. Brundage, Deputy Director
The White House Office—Gabriel Hauge, Administrative Assistant to
the President
Council of Economic Advisers—Arthur F. Burns, Chairman
Task Forces
During the year, the Council kept five interagency task forces active,
each under the chairmanship of a senior member of the Council's staff.
They concerned themselves with the following subjects: private pension
plans, the economic status of low-income families, "spot" unemployment,
financial and credit developments, and problems in housing and home
financing. The last named of these task forces was especially busy during
the year, and its work assisted materially in improving information about
trends in home building and home financing. The task force on "spot"
unemployment made an important contribution to the development of
a proposal that will be presented to the Congress early in the coming session.
Other Activities
During the year, two Council members participated in meetings of the
Organization for European Economic Cooperation and associated countries, held in Paris. Mr. Burns attended the May meeting, at which experts exchanged views on economic conditions and prospects. Mr. Saulnier
attended the September meeting, to participate in OEEC's annual comprehensive review of economic conditions.
The Council handled a large volume of correspondence on economic
questions. Some of the communications were received directly. A considerable number were referred to the Council by other agencies and by
the White House.
Members of the Council's staff participated in training conferences and
seminars held by other government agencies for new employees and visiting
foreign experts. Staff members also served on a number of interagency
committees organized by other agencies.
Cooperation Received
The Council continued to receive cordial cooperation and willing assistance from other government and private agencies. Special analyses and
studies were made for the Council, factual materials were compiled for its
use, and experts from other government agencies participated in its conferences and task forces.




160

As provided for in Section 4 (e) of the Employment Act, the members
of the Council met from time to time with representatives of business, labor,
agriculture, finance, consumer interests, and universities.
Public Works Planning
A small unit was established by the Council in 1954 to coordinate public
works planning. This unit, in cooperation with the Bureau of the Budget,
completed an inventory of Federal public works plans, which the Council
had initiated early in 1953. The inventory showed the location of each
project, its urgency, status of planning and financing, the time required for
commencing and for completing, and so on. Arrangements were made in
1955 to maintain this inventory on an annual basis. In addition, a survey
of the status of State and local public works plans was carried out in late
1954 and early 1955, in cooperation with the Housing and Home Finance
Agency and the Bureau of the Census.
In view of the experience gained, the Council recommended that greater
and more systematic attention be given to public works planning. To
broaden the scope of this activity and to make it more effective, the function
of public works planning was transferred from the Council to the White
House Office on August 12, 1955, when a Special Assistant to the President
was appointed to coordinate publics works planning. Close cooperation
with the Council is being maintained by the new unit on public works
planning.

Staffing
The Council has continued to make staff assignments so that developments in every major field embraced by its responsibilities—industrial production, agriculture, employment and unemployment, wages and prices,
the national income and its distribution, public and private finance, international trade and finance, technology, business organization and practices,
social security, etc.—are under the scrutiny of a senior staff member, who
assumes responsibility for enlisting the cooperation of governmental and
private agencies in compiling, analyzing, and evaluating information in his
area of specialization.
The following are members of the senior staff, including those serving
on a part-time basis: Leo Grebler, Dale E. Hathaway, Bert G. Hickman,
Frances M. James, Alfred E. Kahn, David W. Lusher, Raymond F. Mikesell, Joseph A. Pechman, Charles L. Schultze, Louis Shere, George P.
Shultz, Irving H. Siegel, Walter W. Stewart, and Collis Stocking.
At the end of the year, the personnel of the Council numbered 30, counting all ranks.
Budget for Fiscal Years 1955 and 1956
For fiscal year 1955, the Council had an appropriation from the Congress
of $285,000 plus the unexpended balance from the preceding year's appropriation. Since this balance amounted to $65,500, the sum at the Council's




161

disposal was $350,500. The amount obligated
$321,590.
For fiscal year 1956, the Congress appropriated
activities. The reduced appropriation reflects,
transfer of the function of coordinating public
Council to the White House Office.

For 1947-55 "national security" expenditures include the items classified as such in The Budget of the
United States Government for the Fiscal Year ending June SO, 1954. The items are: military services, international security and foreign relations, development and control of atomic energy, promotion of merchant
marine, promotion of defense production and economic stabilization, and civil defense. These expenditures are not comparable with the "national security" category in the Budget for the Fiscal Year ending
June 30,1955. "National defense" expenditures for goods and services correspond more closely to the new
Budget definition; they include items shown under the national security classification in the 1955 Budget
and in addition, defense production and economic stabilization, military manpower selection, promotion
of aviation (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics only), and civil defense. National defense
expenditures for goods and services since 1947 are as follows: 1947,12.3 billion dollars; 1948,11.6 billion; 1949.
13.6 billion; 1950, 14.3 billion; 1951, 33.9 billion; 1952, 46.4 billion; 1953, 49.4 billion; 1954, 41.4 billion; and
1955, 38.9 billion.

* These estimates represent an approximate conversion of the Department of Commerce series in 1947
prices. (See Table D-3.) This was done by major components, using the implicit price indexes converted
to a 1955 base. Although it would have been preferable to redeflate the series by minor components, this
would not substantially change the results except possibly for the period of World War II, and for the
series on change in business inventories.

JGross national product less compensation of general government employees, i. e., gross product accruing

See Survey of Current Business, August 1954, pp. 20-24, for estimates in both current and 1947-49 prices
and for the implicit price deflators for 1929-51. Estimates for 1952-55 are based on unpublished data.
s Includes compensation of general government employees and excludes compensation of employees in
government enterprises. Government enterprises are those agencies of government whose operating costs
are at least to a substantial extent covered by the sale of goods and services, in contrast to the general activities of government which are financed mainly by tax revenues and debt creation. Government enterprises, in other words, conduct operations essentially commercial in character, even though they perform
them under governmental auspices. The Post Office and public power systems are typical examples of
government enterprises. On the other hand, State universities and public parks, where the fees and admissions cover only a nominal part of operating costs, are part of general government activities.

mainly in that it excludes depreciation charges and other allowances for business and institutional
consumption of durable capital goods, and indirect business taxes. See Table D-9.
2
Wages and salaries and supplements to wages and salaries (employer contributions for social insurance; employer contributions to private pension, health, and welfare funds; compensation for injuries;

3 Excludes income resulting from net reductions of farm inventories and gives credit in computing income
to 4net additions to farm inventories during the period.
See Table D-52 for corporate tax liability (Federal and State income and excess profits taxes) and
corporate profits after taxes.

i Individuals' saving in addition to personal holdings, covers saving of unincorporated business, trust
and pension funds, and nonprofit institutions in the forms specified.
* Includes currency, demand deposits, and time and savings deposits.
> Does not include net purchases by brokers and dealers or by other individuals financed by bank loans.
* Includes armed forces leave bonds and other U. S. Government bonds (except savings bonds) and
all8 securities issued by State and local governments.
Mortgage debt to institutions on 1- to 4-family nonfarm dwellings.
* Largely attributable to purchases of automobiles and other durable consumers' goods, although including some debt arising from purchases of consumption goods. The other segments of individuals' debt
have been allocated to the assets to which they pertain, viz., saving in insurance and securities.
NOTE.—In addition to the concept of saving shown above, there are other concepts of individuals'
saving with varying degrees of coverage currently in use. The series with the most complete coverage, the
personal saving estimates of the Department of Commerce, is derived as the difference between personal
income and expenditures. Conceptually, Commerce saving includes the following items not included
with SEC saving: Housing net of depreciation, and farm and unincorporated business investment in
inventories and plant and equipment, net of depreciation and net of increases in mortgage and other debt to
corporations and financial institutions. Government insurance is excluded from the Commerce saving
series. For a reconciliation of the two series, see Survey of Current Business, July 1955, table 6.

1 Data for 1940-52 revised to include about 150,000 members of the armed forces who were outside the
continental United States in 1940 and who were, therefore, not enumerated in the 1940 Census and were
excluded from the 1940-52 estimates.
2 Includes part-time workers and those with jobs but not at work for such reasons as vacation, illness,
bad weather, temporary layoff, and industrial disputes.
3
Labor force data for 1953 have been revised by the use of a new estimating procedure to provide greater
comparability with the 1954 data from the 230-area sample, and to improve the reliability of the 1953 data
themselves. For a description of the revisions, see Current Population Reports: Labor Force, Series P-57,
No. 155, January 1955. Data of Tables D-18, D-19, and D-20 are also on the revised basis.
NOTE.—-Civilian labor force data beginning with 1954 are based on a 230-area sample. For 1946-53 they
were based on a 68-area sample; for 1940-45 on a smaller sample; and for 1929-39 on sources other than direct
enumeration.
Beginning July 1955, labor force data are for the calendar week containing the 12th of the month; pre
viously, for week containing the 8th.
Annual population data are as of July 1; monthly data are as of the 1st of the month.
For the years 1940-52, estimating procedures made use of 1940 Census data; for subsequent years, 1950
Census data were used. For the effects of this change on the historical comparability of the data, see
Annual Report on the Labor Force, 1954, Series P-50, No. 59, April 1955, p. 12.

Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding.

Includes all full- and part-time wage and salary workers in nonagricultural establishments who worked
during, or received pay for, any part of the pay period ending nearest the 15th of the month. Excludes
proprietors, self-employed persons, domestic servants, and unpaid family workers. Not comparable with
estimates of nonagricultural employment of the civilian labor force (Table D-17) which include proprietors,
self-employed persons, domestic servants, and unpaid family workers, which count persons as employed
when they are not at work because of industrial disputes, bad weather, or temporary layoffs, and which
are based on a sample survey of households, whereas the estimates in this table are based on reports from
employing establishments.
2 Beginning with 1939, data are not strictly comparable with data shown for earlier years because of the
shift of the automotive repair service industry from the trade to the service division.
3 Not available.
4
Preliminary revisions.
5
Estimates incorporate preliminary revisions in the seasonal indexes for employment in contract construction and Federal Govvernment.

to employees subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act; and beginning June 1949, to nonsupervisory employees only.

Averages are based upon monthly data (exclusive of switching and terminal companies) summarized
in the M-300 report by the ICC and relate to all employees who received pay during the month except executives, officials, and staff assistants (ICC group I). Beginning September 1949, data reflect a wage rate increase and reduction in basic workweek from 48 to 40 hours.
2
Prior to April 1945, data relate to all employees except executives; from April 1945-May 1949, mainly to
employees subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act; and beginning June 1949, to nonsupervisory employees
only.
a Not available.
* Data beginning with January of year noted are not comparable with those for earlier periods.
8
Nine-month average, April through December, because of new series started in April 1945.
6
Preliminary.
NOTE.—Data are for production workers in manufacturing and mining, construction workers in building
construction, and for all nonsupervisory employees in other industries (except as noted). Data are for payroll periods ending closest to the middle of the month.
The annual figures for 1955 for industries other than manufacturing are simple arithmetic averages of
the monthly figures shown and not strictly comparable with the averages for earlier years, which have
been weighted by data on man-hours.

Annual total is sum of seasonally unadjusted quarterly expenditures; it does not necessarily coincide
with average of seasonally adjusted figures, which include adjustments, when necessary, for systematic
tendencies in anticipatory data.
* Estimates for fourth quarter 1955 and first quarter 1956 based on anticipated capital expenditures reported by business in late October and November 1955.
NOTE.—These figures do not agree precisely with the plant and equipment expenditures included in the
gross national product estimates of the Department of Commerce. The main difference lies in the inclusion
in the gross national product of investment by farmers, professionals, and institutions, and of certain outlays charged to current account.
This series is not available for years prior to 1939 and for 1940 to 1944.

Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding.

i Beginning in 1951, the estimates of retail sales and inventories are based on a new method of estimation adopted by the Bureau of the Census. Estimates shown in this table for 1939-50 are on the previously
published basis and estimates for 1951-55 are on the new basis. For a description of the retail sales and
inventories series, see Survey of Current Business, September and November 1952 and January 1954.
* Monthly average shown for year and total for month,
s Seasonally adjusted, end of period.
< Inventory/sales ratio. For annual periods weighted average inventories to average monthly sales;
for monthly data, ratio of average end of current and previous month's inventories to sales for month.
«Where December data not available, data for year calculated on basis of no change from November.
• Preliminary.
NOTE.—The inventory figures in this table do not agree with the estimates of change in business inventories included in the gross national product since these figures cover only manufacturing and trade rather
than all business, and show inventories in terms of current book value without adjustment for revaluation.

This does not replace the former index (1926=100) as the official index prior to January 1952. These
data from January 1947 through December 1951 represent the revised sample and the 1947-49 weighting
pattern. Prior to January 1947 they are based on the month-to-month movement of the former index.
The only official index up to and including December 1951 is the former monthly index (1926=100).
2 The data from January 1947 through January 1953 differ from the official series due to a|change in the
method of eliminating excise taxes and discounts.

1 June, December, and end-of-year figures are for call dates. Other data are for the last Wednesday of
the month.
2 Data are shown net, i. e., after deduction of valuation reserves. Includes commercial and industrial
loans, agricultural loans, loans on securities, real-estate loans, loans to banks, consumer credit, and other
loans.
3 Beginning with 1948, data are shown gross of valuation reserves, instead of net as for previous years.
Prior to June 1947 and for months other than June and December, data are estimated on the basis of reported
data for all insured commercial banks and for weekly reporting member banks.
4
Estimates in this table are based on book values and relate only to banks within the continental United
States. Therefore, they do not agree with figures in Table D-49, which are on the basis of par values and
include holdings of banks in United States Territories and possessions.
• June data are used because complete end-of-year data are not available prior to 1935 for U. S. Government obligations and other securities.
6
Not available.
7
Preliminary estimates by Council of Economic Advisers.
• Preliminary.
• For October 1955, certain loan items are available on two bases because of a reclassification resulting
from reporting errors. The business loans figure shown above is after reclassification. The figure before
reclassification is 30.7 billion.

1 Commodity data for 1936-38 and 1950-54 have been adjusted to conform as nearly as possible to 1955
statistical classifications. The distribution of nonagricultural exports by principal commodities, however,
is based on total exports for 1936-38 and on exports excluding "special category" items thereafter. (See
note 3.)
2 Data represent total exports minus shipments of military equipment and supplies by the Department
of Defense under the Mutual Security Program. Commodity breakdowns of nonmilitary exports are not
available.
3
" Special category" commodities are those to which security restrictions apply as regards publication of
detailed export statistics.
* Data exclude essential oils.
6
Data for 1950 and later periods exclude "special category" exports.
NOTE.—Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding.
