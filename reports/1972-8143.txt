ECONOMIC REPORT
OF THE PRESIDENT




ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT
To the Congress of the United States:
The American economy is beginning to feel the effects of the new
policies launched last August.
I undertook the New Economic Policy because it was becoming
clear that not enough was being done to meet our ambitious goals for
the American economy. The new measures are designed to bring the
Nation to higher employment, greater price stability, and a stronger
international position.
The essence of the New Economic Policy is not the specific list of
measures we announced on August 15; it is the determination to do all
that is necessary to achieve the Nation's goals.
Nineteen hundred and seventy-one was in many ways a good economic
year. Total employment, total output, output per person, real hourly
earnings, and real income after tax per person all reached new highs. The
inflation which had plagued the country since 1965 began to subside. In
the first 8 months of the year the rate of inflation was 30 percent less than
in the same months of 1970.
But I did not believe this was enough to meet the Nation's needs.
Although the rate of inflation had declined before August, it was still
too high. Although unemployment stopped rising, it remained near
6 percent. In the first part of the year, our international balance-ofpayments deficit—the excess of our payments to the rest of the world
over their payments to us—had risen far too high.
The conditions called for decisive actions. On August 15,1 announced
these actions.
First, I imposed a 90-day freeze on prices, wages, and rents.
Second, I suspended conversion of dollars into gold and other reserve
assets.
Third, I imposed a temporary surcharge on imports generally at the
rate of 10 percent.
Fourth, I proposed a number of tax changes intended to stimulate the
economy, including repeal of the excise tax on automobiles, a tax credit
for investment, and reduction of income taxes on individuals. At the same
time I took steps to keep the budget under control.




The package of measures was unprecedented in scope and degree. My
Administration had struggled for 21/^ years in an effort to check the
inflation we inherited by means more consistent with economic freedom
than price-wage controls. But the inflationary momentum generated
by the policy actions and inactions of 1965-68 was too stubborn to
be eradicated by these means alone. Or at least it seemed that it could
only be eradicated at the price of persistent high unemployment—and
this was a price we would not ask the American people to pay.
Similarly, more than a decade of balance-of-payments deficits had built
up an overhang of obligations and distrust which no longer left time for
the gradual methods of correction which had been tried earlier.
The measures begun on August 15 will have effects continuing long
into the future. They cannot be fully evaluated by what has happened
in the little over 5 months since that date. Still the results up to this point
have been extremely encouraging.
The freeze slowed down the rate of inflation dramatically. In the 3
months of its duration the index of consumer prices rose only 0.4 percent,
compared to 1.0 percent in the previous 3 months. The freeze was a great
testimonial to the public spirit of the American people, because that
result could have been achieved with the small enforcement staff we
had only if the people had been cooperating voluntarily.
The freeze was followed by a comprehensive, mandatory system of
controls, with more flexible and equitable standards than were possible
during the first 90 days. General principles and specific regulations have
been formulated, staffs have been assembled and cases are being decided.
This effort is under the direction of citizens on the Price Commission
and Pay Board, with advice from other citizens on special panels concerned with health services, State and local government, and rent. These
citizens are doing a difficult job, doing it well, and the Nation is in
their debt.
While this inflation-control system was being put in place, vigorous
action was going forward on the international front. The suspension of
the convertibility of the dollar was a shock felt around the world. The
surcharge emphasized the need to act swiftly and decisively to improve
our position. Happily, the process of adjustment began promptly, without disrupting the flow of international business. Other currencies rose
in cost relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result, the cost of foreign goods
increased relative to the cost of U.S. goods, improving the competitive
position of American workers and industries. International negotiations
were begun to stabilize exchange rates at levels that would help in correcting the worldwide disequilibrium, of which the U.S. balance-of-




payments deficit was the most obvious symptom. These negotiations led
to significant agreements on a number of points:
1. Realignment of exchange rates, with other currencies rising
in cost relative to the dollar, as part of which we agreed to recommend to Congress that the price of gold in dollars be raised when
progress had been made in trade liberalization.
2. Commitment to discussion of more general reform of the international monetary system.
3. Widening of the permitted range of variation of exchange
rates, pending other measures Q reform.
f
4. Commitment to begin discussions to reduce trade barriers,
including some most harmful to the United States.
5. Assumption of a larger share of the costs of common defense
by some of our allies.
6. Elimination of the temporary U.S. surcharge on imports.
The third part of the August 15 action was the stimulative tax program. Enactment of this package by Congress, although not entirely in
the form I had proposed, put in place the final part of my New Economic
Policy.
In part as a result of this program, economic activity rose more rapidly
in the latter part of the year. In the fourth quarter real output increased
at the annual rate of 6 percent, compared with about 3 percent in the
2 previous quarters. Employment rose by about 1.1 million from July
to December, and only an extraordinarily large rise of the civilian labor
force—1.3 million—kept unemployment from falling.
Nineteen hundred and seventy-two begins on a note of much greater
confidence than prevailed 6 or 12 months ago. Output is rising at a rate
which will boost employment rapidly and eat into unemployment. There
is every reason to expect thisv rate of increase to continue. The Federal
Government has contributed impetus to this advance by tax reductions
and expenditure increases. The Federal Reserve has taken steps to create
the monetary conditions necessary for rapid economic expansion.
The operation of the new control system in an economy without inflationary pressure of demand holds out great promise of sharply reducing the inflation rate. We are converting the fear of perpetual inflation
into a growing hope for price stability. We are lifting from the people
the frustrating anxiety about what their savings and their income will be
worth a year from now or 5 years from now.
For the first time in over a decade the United States is moving
decisively to restore strength to its international economic position.
The outlook is bright, but much remains to be done. The great prob-




lem is to get the unemployment rate down from the 6-percent level where
it was in 1971. It was reduced from that level in the sixties by a war
buildup; it must be reduced from that level in the seventies by the
creation of peacetime jobs.
It is obvious that the unemployment problem has been intensified by
the reduction of over 2 million defense-related jobs and by the need to
squeeze down inflation. But 6 percent unemployment is too much, and I
am determined to reduce that number significantly in 1972.
To that end I proposed the tax reduction package of 1971. Federal
expenditures will rise by $25.2 billion between last fiscal year and fiscal
1972. Together these tax reductions and expenditure increases will leave
a budget deficit of $38.8 billion this year. If we were at full employment
in the present fiscal year, expenditures would exceed receipts by $8.1
billion. This is strong medicine, and I do not propose to continue its use,
but we have taken it in order to give a powerful stimulus to employment.
We have imposed price and wage controls to assure that the expansion
of demand does not run to waste in more inflation but generates real
output and real employment.
We have suspended dollar convertibility and reduced the international
cost of the dollar which will help restore the competitive position of U.S.
workers and thereby generate jobs for them.
We have instituted a public service employment program to provide
jobs directly for people who find it especially hard to get work.
We have expanded the number of people on federally assisted manpower programs to record levels.
We have established computerized Job Banks to help match up jobseekers and job vacancies.
We have proposed welfare reform to increase incentives to
employment.
We have proposed special revenue sharing for manpower programs,
to make them more effective.
We have proposed revision of the minimum wage system to remove
obstacles to the employment of young and inexperienced workers.
We expect that these measures, and others, will contribute to a substantial reduction of unemployment.
In addition to getting unemployment down, a second major economic
task before us is to develop and apply the price-wage control system,
which is still in its formative stage, to the point where its objective is
achieved. The objective of the controls is a state of affairs in which reasonable price stability can be maintained without controls. That state of
affairs can and will be reached. How long it will take, no one can say.




We will persevere until the goal is reached, but we will not keep the
controls one day longer than necessary.
The success of the stabilization program depends fundamentally upon
the cooperation of the American people. This means not only compliance
with the regulations. It means also mutual understanding of the difficulties that all of us—working people, businessmen, consumers, farmers,
Government officials—encounter in this new and complicated program.
Our experience in the past few months convinces me that we shall have
this necessary ingredient for success.
We embarked last year on another great task—to create an international economic system in which we and others can reap the benefits of
the exchange of goods and services without danger to our domestic economies. Despite all the troubles in this field in recent years both the
American people and our trading partners are enjoying on a larger scale
than ever before what is the object of the whole international economic
exercise—consumption of foreign goods that are better or cheaper or
more interesting than domestic goods, as well as foreign travel and profitable investment abroad.
We don't want to reduce these benefits. We want to expand them. To
do that, we in the United States must be able to pay in the way that is
best—chiefly by selling abroad those things that we produce best or more
cheaply, including the products of our agriculture and our other hightechnology industries. This is our objective in the international discussions
launched by our acts of last year and continuing this year.
These tasks, in which Government takes the lead, are superimposed
on the fundamental task of the American economy, upon which the
welfare of the people most depends and which is basically performed by
the people and not by the Government. That fundamental task is the
efficient and innovative production of the goods and services that the
American people want. That is why I have emphasized the need for
greater productivity and a resurgence of the competitive spirit.
The outstanding performance of the American economy in this respect
provides a background of strength which permits the Government to face
its economic problems with confidence and to bring about a new
prosperity without inflation and without war.

Economic Review and Prospect
A Summary
Rarely has economic policy made so much news as in 1971. The freeze
and Phase II, closing the gold window and prospective devaluation, domestic
and international meetings at Camp David, the Azores, the Smithsonian Institution, and Bermuda, Key Biscayne, and San Clemente—all were continuing headline stories. These dramatic events were part of the process of
dealing with problems in the forefront of public attention—inflation, unemployment, the international position of the U.S. economy.
These policies and their sequels and consequences will be the economic
news of 1972. Most of this report is devoted to them. But this inevitable concentration on the news, whether in the press or in this report, can give a misleading impression of what is happening. The most important part of what
is happening, at least in the field of economics, is not what was new last year
or what will be new this year, but what is continuing.
THE LONGER VIEW
Before turning to the news it is worthwhile to point out some of the facts
that are not news. The simplest and most far reaching is that total output
per capita in 1971 was higher in the United States than anywhere else in the
world. Output per worker, per hour of work and—as far as can be estimated—per unit of all resources were also the highest in the world. In all
of these dimensions the economy continued to progress in 1971. In all of
them the figures showed record highs last year. Labor productivity—output
per hour of work—rose more rapidly than it had for several years.
In 1971, as in 1970 and 1969, there was a major shift in the allocation of
total output from military to civilian uses. Measured in yearend 1971 dollars
the annual rate of national defense spending declined by $25 billion from
the fourth quarter of 1968 to the fourth quarter of 1971, or from 9.4 percent
of GNP to 6.7 percent. In 1971, as in most other years, the largest part of
the increase in total output was devoted to private consumption. Real private consumption increased 3.4 percent from 1970 to 1971, or 2.2 percent
per capita. It amounted to $3,200 per capita in 1971 prices.
Most of the national income, and most of the increase of the national
income, is the compensation of employees. In recent years an extraordinarily large share of the increase of the national income, 91 percent from
1968 to 1971, has gone into labor compensation. Real compensation per hour
of work increased 2.5 percent from 1970 to 1971, compared to 1.2 percent
average from 1968 to 1970. On the average during 1971 there were 79 million




19

people at work, the highest number on record. In November the count
passed 80 million for the first time.
The efficient use of resources reflected in these figures is so commonplace
in America that it is rarely news. However, in the context of world history,
the American achievement is exceptional. It has not occurred automatically,
but is the result of private and public efforts. In 1971, as in the past, measures to improve efficiency were important components of government policy.
In Chapter 4 of this Report we discuss issues relating to the continuing
effectiveness of the economic system that are now of special concern. They
are issues of national policy with respect to improvement of the environment,
the supply of energy, research and development, surface freight transportation, and the provision of health care. Each of these issues has its unique
features, but one aspect common to all of them should be emphasized at
this time when we are engaged in comprehensive regulation of prices: They
all reveal the difficulties that arise in the absence of an adaptive price system, whether that absence results from the natural condition of the private
economy or from government regulation.
The basic environmental problem, for example, is that some resources,
like air, are common property and consequently the private economic system does not put a price on their use. The result is overuse or misuse—
such as the dumping of excess pollutants into the air. Similarly, much of the
knowledge that can be created by research and development becomes a free
good, so that private people do not have an adequate incentive to produce it.
A part of the health problem is the difficulty of finding a pricing system
for medical care which gives an incentive to economy in its use but at the
same time assures adequate service for all. In the field of energy we see that a
shortage and high prices of fuels may be caused by regulation intended to
hold down the price of fuel. And in surface freight transportation too stringent regulation of rates keeps goods from being moved in the most efficient
and cheapest way.
The lesson of all this is not laissez-faire. There are conditions where a
functioning price system does not naturally exist and has to be created
or simulated. But the lesson is of the great and cumulative losses likely to
result from continued suppression of the price system where it is functioning in anything like the normal manner.
URGENT PROBLEMS OF 1971
However important such matters are for the long run, they were overshadowed in 1971 by the urgent questions of unemployment, inflation, and
the balance of payments. At the beginning of 1971 each of these problems
had already been around for a long time. The balance-of-payments problem was the oldest. There had been uninterrupted concern with the excess of U.S. payments abroad over receipts from abroad since 1959. Attempts had been made from time to time to limit the outflow of dollars
by controls on capital flows and in other ways—but without lasting success.




20

The inflation problem had its origin in the middle of 1965, with the increase
of spending for the Vietnam war, the steeply rising budgetary deficit at high
employment, and the monetary expansion that accompanied it. Unemployment had been high although declining throughout the early 1960's until the
Vietnam inflationary boom forced it down to low levels.
As 1971 opened there was common expectation that progress would be
made on all these fronts. The rise of output which began in the spring of
1970 had been interrupted in October by the General Motors Corp.
strike. But after the strike settlement the general expectation was that recovery would be resumed at a faster pace and unemployment would decline
moderately in 1971. That was expected to be followed by a more certain
and larger decline in 1972. Moreover, a widespread belief prevailed in and
out of the Administration that 1971 would see a clear reduction in the rate
of inflation.
Certainly the acceleration of the inflation rate had come to a halt. Persistent operation of the economy below potential in 1971, even though
the economy was rising, seemed to offer reasons for expecting a reduction
of the inflation rate. The inflation would still be proceeding too fast when
the year ended; but the rate would have declined, and further decline
would be in sight. Steady expansion in the U.S. economy, with rising productivity and a declining rate of inflation, would also help to strengthen our
net export position and set us on the way to regaining balance-of-payments
equilibrium.
The Administration's goals went beyond this common appraisal of the year
1971. It believed that a more rapid expansion of the economy than was
generally forecast was desirable and feasible. The desirable and feasible
path was believed to be one that would bring the unemployment rate down
to the zone of 4l/2 percent by the middle of 1972.
The Administration believed that existing policy would move the economy
along that path. That policy consisted of a budget that would keep expenditures from exceeding the revenues that would be collected at full employment, but that would show large deficits in fiscal years 1971 and 1972,
and a complementary monetary policy. More important, the Administration
emphasized its preparedness to adjust policy if evidence indicated the need
to do so. The Administration's forecast that the economy would move
along the feasible path was a forecast that policy would be adapted to
achieve the desired result.
The Administration also indicated, in the Economic Report of 1971, its
readiness to move directly to restrain price and wage increases that were
not justified by competitive market conditions and were helping to prolong
the inflation and unemployment. It did not, however, forecast conditions that
would make comprehensive, mandatory price and wage controls appropriate.
EARLY PERFORMANCE IN 1971
In the first quarter of 1971 real output rose at an annual rate of 8 percent,
the highest quarterly rise since early 1966. The unemployment rate de-




21

clined from 6.1 percent in December 1970 to 5.9 percent in February.
The annual rate of increase of consumer prices in the first 4 months of
1971 was 2.9 percent, compared to 6.3 percent in the corresponding period
of 1970. The surplus in foreign trade rose in the first quarter (seasonally
adjusted).
Total output continued to rise throughout the year, and in the end it
was close to the common expectations with which the year had opened.
However, as the months of spring and early summer passed it became
increasingly clear that the economy was not meeting the more ambitious
goals of the Administration. First quarter GNP had been bolstered by
the makeup from the General Motors strike to a greater degree than
had been expected, and to a lesser degree by products other than automobiles. The rate of increase of real GNP fell to 3.4 percent in the second
quarter—not enough to reduce the unemployment rate. The decline of the
unemployment rate from December to February had not turned out to be
the beginning of a steady improvement; by May the rate had returned to
its December level. The decline in the rate of increase of the consumer price
index had not continued, nor had the slowdown of inflation been confirmed
by other measures. Although almost all measures showed that the rate of inflation was lower than it had been at its earlier peak, they gave little
assurance that the rate was still declining.
The second quarter also brought a rapid deterioration in the U.S. balanceof-payments position. The trade balance, which had improved briefly in the
first quarter, fell sharply in the spring. In addition the decline in U.S. interest rates relative to interest rates abroad in the early part of the year sharply
increased the outflow of funds from the United States. These events gave rise
to speculation which worsened the position further.
The combination of problems created a dilemma for economic policy.
A rate of expansion and a level of unemployment less favorable than policy
had projected could have been remedied by more expansive fiscal and monetary measures. But this remedy would have made the other problems worse.
It would have stimulated the still lively expectations of continuing or even
accelerating inflation and it would have speeded up the flight from the
dollar. The problems had to be dealt with simultaneously.
THE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY
This combination of facts and possibilities led to the decisive change of
policy that was announced on August 15. The United States suspended
the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets, for the first
time since 1934. It imposed a temporary surcharge, generally at the rate
of 10 percent, on dutiable imports. Prices, wages, and rents were frozen for
90 days, to be followed by a more flexible and durable—but still temporary—
system of mandatory controls. A package of tax reductions was proposed to
stimulate economic expansion.
The suspension of dollar convertibility and the freeze were the dramatic
elements in the announcement, and this might have led to an impression

that the program was aimed primarily at solving the problems of the balance
of payments and inflation rather than the problem of unemployment. In
fact, the program was directed at all three problems. The international
measures and the price-wage controls were both designed to create conditions in which a more expansive budget policy would be safer and more
effective. The measures to deal with inflation and the balance-of-payments
deficit were also expected to contribute to a reduction of unemployment.
The import surcharge and the expected realignment of currencies would
raise U.S. net exports, and as a byproduct contribute to employment in that
way. Similarly, the price-wage control system was intended to stimulate
spending and employment by reducing the inflation-anxiety of consumers
and businessmen.
The two dramatic steps—the price-wage controls and the suspension
of convertibility—had quite different roles in the future of the American
economy. The price-wage controls were meant to be emergency expedients,
required in a particular historical context but expected to fade away, leaving no permanent change in the system except the eradication of inflationary expectations. The suspension of convertibility, on the other hand,
signalled the determination of the United States to achieve a permanent
reform of the international monetary system.
By the end of 1971 substantial progress had been made in putting in place
the policies announced on August 15. The Revenue Act of 1971, signed on
December 10, incorporated the President's tax recommendations, with some
revisions.
On December 18 the United States and 10 other major industrial
countries agreed to a new set of international currency relationships and
to intensive negotiations looking toward short-term measures of trade liberalization. At the same time they agreed to push on with longer-term
discussions on new trade policies and on the international monetary system.
The price-wage freeze had given way to Phase II on November 14. The
basic machinery had been established: The Pay Board, the Price Commission, and other bodies had been set up under general coordination by the
Cost of Living Council. Overall principles had been set forth and specific
regulations issued on a great many subjects. Individual cases were being decided. The system would be evolving as long as it lasted, but it was operational by the end of 1971.
FIRST RESULTS
Some of the first results of the New Economic Policy were already visible
before 1971 ended. The most obvious were in the behavior of prices. The
consumer price index rose 0.4 percent, seasonally adjusted, from August
to November, compared to 1.0 percent in the previous 3 months. The index
of industrial wholesale prices declined 0.3 percent, seasonally adjusted, compared to an increase of 1.6 percent in the previous 3 months. In December
both indexes rose more rapidly, as was to be expected for a while imme-




24

diately after the freeze. Nevertheless, it was clear that the inflation rate had
been slowed.
Expansive effects of the new policy were less clear and prompt, except in
the case of automobile sales. The annual rate of sales of domestic autos
rose to 10.1 million in the 3 months after August 15, compared with 8.2
million in the previous 3 months. This increase was due in part to the
elimination of the 7-percent excise tax on automobiles; this change was not
enacted into law until December, but it was known that it would be retroactively effective on August 15. The increase of sales was also influenced by
the expectation of a price rise after the freeze. Total output of goods and
services increased in the fourth quarter at the annual rate of 6.1 percent,
compared to 2.7 percent in the third quarter. How much of this acceleration
was due to the New Economic Policy was not measurable.
OUTLOOK FOR 1972
At the end of the year the prospect was that 1972 would see rising output,
diminishing unemployment, a reduced rate of inflation, and a stronger U.S.
position in the world economy.
A general indication of the prospective rise of the economy from 1971 to
1972 is that the gross national product (GNP) will probably increase by
about $100 billion, compared with an increase of about $75 billion from
1970 to 1971. The increase in real output will be about 6 percent, compared
to 2.7 percent in 1971, and the increase in prices from year to year will
be around 3*4 percent, compared to 4.6 percent in 1971.
There are several reasons for expecting a significantly faster rate of increase
of GNP from 1971 to 1972 than was experienced from 1970 to 1971. It seems
likely that in 1972 every major category of expenditures for goods and services will rise more or decline less than in 1971, except for investment in new
houses. After a period in which total sales have been rising and inventories
have hardly changed, a sizable increase in business investment in inventories is
probable. As a result of the adjustment in exchange rates, U.S. net exports
should, during this year, stop falling and begin rising. After 3 years in
which Federal purchases of gjoods and services have hardly risen in money
terms, and have actually declined in real terms, purchases by the Federal
Government will begin rising again. The general growth in output, plus the
incentives of the recently enacted Job Development Credit and depreciation
liberalization, will speed up business investment in plant and equipment.
Consumer expenditures will increase more rapidly, spurred by rising earned
incomes, tax reductions, larger social security benefits, and greater confidence in the future.
Federal budget policies will contribute to the increase in GNP in 1972
through tax reductions that stimulate both consumption and investment, as
well as through increases in transfer payments to individuals, increased grants
to Stale and local governments, and increases in its own purchases. The
actual path of the economy in 1971 and the forecast for 1972 would result in




25

a budget deficit around $38.8 billion in fiscal 1972 (ending June 30, 1972)
and $25.5 billion in 1973. The outlays that would be made at full employment would exceed revenues that would be collected at full employment by
about $8.1 billion in fiscal 1972. In the next fiscal year, however, the budget
would return to its target position of balance at full employment.
The role of monetary policy in the expansion ahead will be to provide for
the increase of liquidity required to support increases in activity and income.
This outcome will involve a resumption of the growth of the stock of currency and demand deposits, after 5 months in which there has been relatively
little growth. The expectation of an increase of GNP around $100 billion is
based on the assumption that the required monetary growth will be
forthcoming.
The prospect is that we will have in 1972 not only a more rapid increase
of GNP than in 1971 but also a slower rate of inflation. There are two
reasons for expecting a slower rate of inflation. One is the accumulating
effect of the continued operation of the economy below normal rates of employment and plant utilization, even though those operating rates will be
rising in 1972. The other is the effect of the price-wage-rent control system.
The standards put forth by the Price Commission and the Pay Board, and
the early experience with their application, give grounds for confidence that
the system, operating within the general economic conditions in prospect
for 1972, will contribute to a lower rate of inflation. These controls are
operating in an environment in which other forces are contributing to a
return to stability. If our fiscal and monetary policies are prudently managed there is little likelihood that the controls will be exposed to the pressure
of excess demand.
With output rising at a rate of something like 6 percent a year, employment will rise strongly. This implies a fall in the unemployment rate to the
neighborhood of 5 percent by yearend. The number of people experiencing
some unemployment, and the average duration of their unemployment,
would both be reduced.
These estimates, like all economic forecasts, are subject to a considerable
margin of possible error. Circumstances are conceivable in which the rise
of the economy would be less than these estimates suggest. The rise in the rate
of inventory accumulation which is assumed to occur early in 1972 might
be delayed. The demand for new housing may be less than is implied here,
with a resulting decline of construction activity later in the year. The timing
of the effects of the exchange rate realignment on trade flows is not certain.
On the other hand, it is conceivable that the rise of the economy would
be more rapid than projected here. The picture drawn here is not one of
takeoff into a cyclical boom. At some stage the rise of final sales may trigger
the above-average rise of inventories characteristic of strong recoveries.
Increased utilization, rising profits, and reduced anxiety about inflation of
cost, could stimulate larger business investment expenditure. The estimates




26

we have made presuppose continuation of personal saving at a higher rate
than normal; a decline of that rate could significantly raise the economy.
Even given the course of the GNP in money terms, uncertainties would
remain about the prospect for employment, unemployment, and prices.
Variations in the rate of growth of the labor force and productivity, within
the limits of historical experience, could significantly affect the outcome.
And although the character and operation of the price-wage control system
give grounds for confidence, it must be recognized that there is little relevant precedent for predicting its effects.
Uncertainties of this kind must be taken into account in policy decisions.
The possibility that the rise of the economy and the decline of unemployment might lag behind the estimates made today calls for readiness to take
additional steps if this should turn out to be the case. But the possibility that,
with the policy now in place, the economy will rise even more rapidly than we
foresee today is a strong reason for not seeking to stimulate the economy more
now. One of the most common causes of the breakdown of price-wage control systems has been excess demand for goods and labor, which places upon
the control system the burden of resisting market forces. The control system
which has just been established is meant to assist market forces that would
be working to hold down inflation; it is not meant to resist market forces
working to accelerate inflation.
If excess demand is avoided, the control system can help to break the
habitual or contractual repetition of large price and wage increases that
keeps inflation going. It can generate the expectation of reasonable price stability that is essential to the achievement of reasonable price stability. And
as that happens it will be possible to eliminate the controls. How soon that
can be done will have to be determined in the light of experience.
The policy of restrained expansion of demand, coupled since August 15
with controls of prices and wages, will finally eradicate the continuing
inflationary consequences of the boom that started in mid-1965. However,
they will still leave questions that have troubled students of the American
economy for many years. Are there persistent structural characteristics in the
modern American economy that make inflation inevitable, or inevitable in
the absence of high unemployment? If so, can these characteristics of the
economy be changed? Upon the answers to these questions will depend the
possibility of holding down the rate of inflation after Phase II ends, not only
below the heights reached after the Vietnam war expansion, but to an even
lower level. These questions will be the subject of study by the Council of
Economic Advisers.
PROGRESS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY
The expected rise of the economy in 1972 results in limited part from an
expected increase in U.S. exports relative to imports. This in turn results in
part from the realignment of the dollar relative to other currencies. While
this contribution to the recovery is a welcome consequence of the stepc




27

that have been taken in the international economy, it is not their motivation
or primary significance. By mid-1971 it was obvious that something had to be
done to correct the U.S. balance-of-payments deficit, and that almost certainly required measures which would raise exports relative to imports. The
question was how to bring that about. The August 15 decisions expressed the
U.S. determination not to do it either by depressing the American economy
or by imposing controls on foreign trade. The reasons for avoiding such
controls need constant repetition. Americans have much to gain from being
able to buy what they like where they like and being able to sell what they like
where they like. The moves in the international monetary field were taken in
an effort to solve the balance-of-payments problem by means that would
preserve this freedom.
Moreover, the object of the steps taken was not just to solve the U.S.
1971 problem but to move toward better solutions for the future problems of
the United States and the world. Since the United States suspended convertibility, agreed to propose to the Congress an increase in the dollar
price of gold, and achieved a realignment of currencies, everyone is much
more aware that the problem of one major currency is the problem of all
and that the international financial system must be made more compatible with prosperity and freedom for all. The events of 1971 have created
a favorable atmosphere for progress in reforming the system.
The events of 1971 also helped to revive the possibility of resuming movement toward reduction of international trade barriers. The international economic community was suddenly confronted with the prospect that if it could
not agree to move forward together toward liberalization it could easily fall
backward. Fortunately, the decision was to move forward together, and
negotiations are underway which promise improvement in trading conditions for the United States and others.
The agenda of economic policy for 1972 is a heavy one. The expansion
of the economy must be guided along a steady path. The new price-wage
control system must be developed and refined further. Negotiations now
begun for trade liberalization must be pursued. Serious work must
be carried forward on the international monetary system. And, as
always, we must be prepared with new initiatives to meet needs that are
not now foreseen. But while much remains to be done we can be confident
that we are now on our way to goals that have eluded the American people
for many years.

CHAPTER 1

Performance and Policy to Mid-August

O

N AUGUST 15, 1971, the President announced a far-reaching New
Economic Policy designed to check the rise in prices and wages,
strengthen the Nation's external economic position and stimulate economic
activity at home. To curb the rate of inflation, prices, wages, and rents
were subjected to a 90-day freeze, which was followed by a comprehensive
but more flexible system of mandatory controls. To improve the Nation's
balance of payments, the President suspended the convertibility of the dollar
into gold and other reserve assets and imposed a temporary 10-percent surcharge on imports. And to strengthen the domestic economy, the President
proposed, in addition to these measures, a fiscal package whose stimulus
came from a set of tax cuts, which were passed by the Congress in December
in somewhat altered form.
Results of the new program were visible in varying degrees by the end
of the year. They were most apparent in the slowdown of price and wage
increases during the freeze. On the international front the major industrial
countries agreed to a realignment of currencies more favorable to the U.S.
competitive position and to prompt discussions concerning trade barriers
and long-term monetary reform. The strong upsurge in purchases of automobiles from mid-August through November was partly a result of the
proposed removal of the Federal excise tax, but much of it was apparently
an attempt by consumers to buy automobiles before prices were increased
in the post-freeze period. Perhaps the most significant effect of the combined
package was the impact on public confidence. From mid-August to the end
of the year, there was slow but steady improvement in confidence that the
rate of inflation was subsiding and the pace of the economic recovery was
gathering strength.

The decision to embark on the New Economic Policy (NEP) came from
an increasing awareness in the Administration that the ambitious goals it had
set at the beginning of the year were not being met. Progress in the fight
against inflation was proceeding too slowly, and its future success was uncertain. At the same time, the recovery was also progressing, but not fast
enough to cut the rate of unemployment. More crucial than either of these
for the timing of the decisions was the serious weakening of the dollar in
international markets. As the summer wore on, there were no signs of a resolution of the financial crisis that in May caused the Swiss franc and the
451-688 0—72

Austrian schilling to be revalued and the German mark and the Netherlands guilder to be set free to float in value. In the second quarter, the
U.S. balance of payments on the official reserve transactions basis had recorded a deficit of $23 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, and in
July and August pressure against the dollar reached enormous proportions.
Funds totaling about $3.7 billion moved into foreign official reserve accounts
in the week ended August 15. The time had come to deal decisively with
the international financial problem that had persisted for at least a dozen
years despite the efforts of four successive Administrations.
The domestic aspects of the New Economic Policy are discussed at the
end of this chapter and in Chapter 2 and the international aspects in Chapter
5. The rest of this chapter deals with events and policies in 1971, generally
up to the midsummer shift in policy.
DEMAND, OUTPUT, AND THE LABOR MARKET
The year 1971 was one of limited recovery in demand and production.
During 1969 the Administration had actively sought to slow down the economy in order to control inflation. Those efforts had their major impact at the
end of 1969 and early 1970, when the rise in demand slowed considerably
and output dipped, after which policy shifted in the direction of expansion.
A fragile recovery was reversed toward the end of 1970 by the lengthy and
severe strike at General Motors. The underlying course of the economy was
upward throughout 1971 and its pace was moderate for most of the year,
but the actual course of events was irregular because of strikes and their
aftermaths (Chart 1, p, 23).
Changes in demand and output as measured by GNP through the third
quarter of 1971 are reviewed in the following pages. Although the NEP
was announced in mid-August, it would be difficult to measure changes
through the middle of the third quarter. In any case, the measured demand
conditions of the third quarter are probably generally representative of the
demand conditions at the time the August 15 decisions were made, although
the increase of GNP in the quarter has turned out to have been lower than
was expected at that time.
DEMAND PATTERNS
From the third quarter of 19.70 to the third quarter of 1971, total GNP
rose 7.1 percent or by $70 billion (Table 1). This was considerably more
than the $43 billion rise over the preceding 4 quarters. The rise was
dominated by increases in residential construction and State and local
government purchases, both of which were especially responsive to the
improvement in credit conditions. Consumption expenditures showed an
above-average gain, while Federal purchases and business fixed investment
were weak. The overall increase was held down by a reduction in business
investment in inventories and by unexpectedly severe weakness in net exports. Indeed, if our economic performance were measured by domestic

The 7.1-percent increase in GNP reflected a 4.6-percent rise in prices
and a 2.4-percent increase in physical volume. Although this increase in volume was an improvement over the decrease of 1970 and the 2.2-percent
gain of 1969, it fell short of the rate required to keep unemployment from
rising. Unemployment reached a peak around the beginning of 1971 and
thereafter remained essentially on a plateau.
Consumer Income and Spending
Fiscal policy helped to buttress consumer income last year, as it had in
1970. Because the demand for labor was weak, the expansion in payrolls was

limited. Indeed, personal income excluding transfer payments rose only 5.4
percent from the third quarter of 1970 to the third quarter of 1971 (Table
2). However, transfer payments rose almost 20 percent, mainly because in
the second quarter of 1971 Social Security benefits were increased, the
change being retroactive to the beginning of 1971. Altogether the rise in
total personal income during this period came to 6.8 percent. Because of
the tax reductions under the Tax Reform Act of 1969 that became effective at the start of 1971, personal taxes declined relative to income. The
7.5-percent increase in disposable (after-tax) income was somewhat more
than the average annual gain for the past decade in current dollars but not
in real terms.
Personal consumption expenditures rose 7.7 percent from the third quarter
of 1970 to the third quarter of 1971, or 3.4 percent in real terms. Spending
on durable goods, which had changed little over the preceding year, rose
much more than average even when allowance is made for the sharp increase
in automobile purchases after August 15. What was noteworthy about consumer behavior during this period was the persistence of a very high rate
of personal saving. The 8.3-percent rate from the third quarter of 1970
through the second quarter of 1971 was higher than any 4-quarter average
since 1946. The rate peaked in the second quarter, coincident with the
large payment of Social Security benefits, and edged down thereafter.
Business Investment
Despite the improvement in profits and cash flow and the greater availability of credit in 1971, business fixed investment in real terms changed
little during 1971; the 4-percent rise in outlays from the third quarter of 1970
to the third quarter of 1971 was slightly less than the rise in prices. Excess
plant capacity was the main factor discouraging investment.
Investment was not uniformly weak last year. The sluggishness centered
in manufacturing and railroads, both of which showed typical cyclical re-




32

sponses, and in airlines. With their output decreasing from 1970 to 1971 to
a level far below capacity, manufacturers cut back their investment by 5^2
percent from 1970 to 1971 after holding it even from 1969 to 1970. Increases
were large for electric utilities, whose investment rose 20 percent over the
year.
Although real investment declined during 1970, gauged by recessions in
the postwar years the decrease was very mild—if allowance is made for the
GM strike. As a share of real GNP, business fixed investment has remained
high. The 10.6-percent share for 1971, although below the high average of
10.9 percent from 1965 through 1970, was above the average of 10.1 percent
for the 20 years from 1951 through 1970.
At the start of 1971 the Administration announced that depreciation rules
would be liberalized to stimulate fixed investment. The main features of
this liberalization were a shortening of permissible useful lives of equipment
and a change in the regulations affecting the calculation of depreciation in
the year of acquisition. The Treasury Department estimated that in the first
full year following these changes depreciation would be raised by $6/ 2 billion
and taxes on business income reduced by $2.8 billion. The liberalization,
with first-year benefits considerably reduced, later became part of the
Revenue Act of 1971. The new regulations were not expected to exert a
large influence in 1971—the main benefits were expected to be achieved subsequently—but they may have played a role in the step up of appropriations
and new orders for capital goods after the middle of the year.
The mildness of the recovery and uncertainty about the outlook caused
businessmen to pursue cautious inventory policies during most of 1971. The
$2 billion added to stocks during the year was even less than the small
addition in 1970. Last year, special factors associated with strikes had the
effect of stimulating inventory investment at first and depressing it subsequently. Automobile stocks were built up in the first half following the
pronounced liquidation of stocks caused by the General Motors strike in
late 1970. Prospects of a possible steel strike after July 31, the expiration
date of the labor contract, caused steel consumers to build up stocks in the
first 7 months of 1971, after which these inventories were liquidated.
The pattern of GNP change is altered if the change in investment in auto
and steel stocks is excluded from the total, as is done below. On this basis
the rise in GNP strengthened rather than weakened from the first to the
third quarter as compared to the rise over the preceding 2 quarters.

Residential Construction
Housing was the strongest sector of the economy in 1971. Private housing starts totaled more than 2 million units, the largest number recorded for
any year. Residential construction outlays rose almost 50 percent, or $14
billion, from the third quarter of 1970 to the third quarter of 1971. This
was one-fifth of the rise in total GNP.
The rise in housing was an extension of the recovery in starts that began in
the spring of 1970 and reflected exceptionally strong demand in a setting of
easing credit. Government subsidy programs and Government assistance in
mortgage markets also contributed to the housing expansion. Demand for
new homes had been partially frustrated during the second half of the
1960's, largely because of competing demands for credit by business and
government in an environment of restrictive monetary policy in 1966 and
in 1969. Traditional mortgage lending institutions, which were inhibited in
their ability to attract savings deposits, reduced mortgage credit sharply.
Mortgage interest rates rose to unusually high levels in 1969 and early 1970.
From a peak in the first quarter of 1969 to a trough in the first quarter of
1970 private starts declined 24 percent. The decreases in private starts of
2.7 percent in 1969 and 2.3 percent in 1970 occurred at a time when increases in family formation and replacement demand suggested the production of more rather than fewer homes. Consequently, a backlog of housing
demand, evidenced by extremely low vacancy rates, was carried into 1971.
The shift to an easier monetary policy in 1970 was the decisive factor in
the turnaround in housing. This change, along with growing support from a
number of Government-related housing institutions and a flood of savings
deposits into mortgage lending institutions, greatly increased the availability
of mortgage credit and brought the secondary market yield on FHA mortgages down slowly from the 9.29-percent peak that had been reached in
March 1970.
The strength of demand showed up in several different ways. Sales of new
one-family homes from January through October were 40 percent greater
than the corresponding 1970 total. The ratio between the inventory of
unsold homes and homes sold was lower than in any earlier year, at least
since 1963, when numbers of this sort werefirstcollected. Vacancy rates were
low for both rental and homeowner units. Homeowner vacancy rates
through the third quarter remained at their lowest levels in over a decade;
and although the rental vacancy rate rose from 4.9 percent in the second
quarter to 5.3 percent in the third, it remained low by the standards of the
1960Js.
Other Demand
Purchases by State and local governments rose about as much during
1971 as during the preceding year. Improving credit conditions facilitated
financing Jby State and local governments. There was no evidence of any




34

slowdown in the growth of payrolls, which make up close to three-fifths of
State and local purchases; however, the rise in employment continued to
slow down, while wage increases accelerated.
The deterioration in the Nation's trade balance is discussed in Chapter 5.
Here it need only be noted that the deterioration had a significant effect on
the change in GNP. In the third quarter of 1970, for example, net exports
were at the comparatively high rate of $4.0 billion. In the third quarter of
1971, the balance had fallen to zero, with imports rising much more
rapidly than exports. As a result, U.S. output of goods and services rose less
than the domestic U.S. demand, because more of that demand was met
from imports.
LABOR MARKET
Although growth of the labor force slowed down and civilian employment
expanded somewhat before the start of the NEP, the unemployment rate
remained near 6 percent through August and indeed through all of 1971
(Chart 1, p. 23). The stickiness of the jobless rate reflected primarily the
slowness of the cyclical recovery of private demand, the continuing downward adjustments occurring in the defense sector, and the strong cost-cutting
efforts in all sectors of the economy that resulted in greater output per hour
of work.
Labor Force
The total labor force increased by about 1.1 million from the third quarter
of 1970 to the third quarter of 1971, or by nearly one-third less than would
normally be expected from population growth and long-run trends in labor
force participation. Because of reductions in the Armed Forces, the civilian
labor force expanded more than the total labor force, rising by about 1.5
million. For men aged 20 to 24, increases in the civilian labor force were
particularly large again in 1971, reflecting the return of ex-servicemen to
civilian activity (Table 3 and Chart 2).

Long-run increases in the size of the Nation's labor force are governed
primarily by the growth of the working-age population (persons 16 years
of age and older). Over shorter periods, labor force changes are affected
by cyclical changes in economic activity. On balance, when labor demand
is strong, additional workers enter the labor force, attracted by plentiful
job opportunities, and when labor demand is not strong there is often a
net decline in participation. This responsiveness to changing demand conditions cannot be measured with great precision; but during the period
of very tight labor markets in the late 1960's, when unemployment was
low, overall labor force participation rose sharply. From early 1970 to about
mid-1971, participation rates declined.
Employment
Reflecting the relatively mild expansion of aggregate demand and employers' efforts to raise productivity, total civilian employment rose only
700,000 over the year ending in the third quarter. A large share of the employment increase occurred in State and local governments. In the private
nonfarm sector, continued growth of employment in service-producing industries was largely offset by further small declines in the goods-producing
industries.
This pattern of employment changes was similar to patterns after earlier
recessions with one major exception: There was no rebound in manufacturing employment. Within manufacturing, reductions by producers of defense goods and their suppliers continued to be large; from December to
August, employment in three industries primarily engaged in the production of military hardware—ordnance, aircraft and parts, and communications equipment—declined at an annual rate of 212,000 jobs. By August,
after the sharp layoffs in the steel industry, manufacturing employment
had fallen below 18.5 million, its lowest point since December 1965. Total
man-hours worked in factories in the third quarter of 1971 were down
nearly 10 percent from the peak reached in late 1969.
Defense Adjustment
The progressive winding down of the U.S. military involvement in Vietnam and a general realignment of defense spending have sharply reduced
manpower utilization in defense activities. Although the largest cuts caused
by this realignment are now behind us, imbalances and distortions arising
from the transition are still an important factor in the labor market.
In all, there has been a net reduction of about 2.0 million persons in
defense during the past 3 years (Table 4). The steady flow of young
veterans out of the Armed Forces, which was more than twice as large as
the net reduction in the Armed Forces in 1970 and 1971, created a special
unemployment problem, because most young men leaving the service require
somewhat longer than the average period to find work in local job markets.
Unemployment among former defense industry workers also tends to last
longer than the average because of their relatively specialized skills and

their residence in communities where large defense contractors are the major
employers. Persons and communities affected by defense cuts have been
beneficiaries of a variety of Government programs which are tailored to their
particular problems (see Chapter 3, pp. 109-10).
Unemployment
After rising steeply to approximately 6 percent of the work force at the end
of 1970, unemployment leveled off in 1971. Jobless rates for most groups
were unusually steady from late 1970 to late 1971 (Table 5).

The average duration of unemployment continued to rise in 1971, moving up from about 9 weeks in 1970 to nearly 12 weeks in 1971. Toward the
year's end, about 560,000 persons had been jobless for at least 6 months—
the maximum period for unemployment insurance payments under regular
programs. Many of the long-term unemployed were former aerospace and
defense workers living in Washington, California, Massachusetts, and a
number of other States that were heavily affected by reduced defense purchasing (Chart 3). Some additional income protection was provided to
many of these workers under the provisions to extend unemployment benefits
contained in the Employment Security Amendments of 1970. This Act, signed
into law by the President on August 10, 1970, established a Federal-State
program to provide up to 13 additional weeks of unemployment compensation when local or national unemployment became high. In all, 22 States
established eligibility under the individual State program at some time during
1971. About 340,000 wrorkers were drawing extended benefits at the peak.
The extended benefits program became effective throughout the Nation
in January 1972 because the national insured unemployment rate had
been above 4.5 percent for 3 successive months.
Regular unemployment insurance programs continued to provide shorterterm income protection to experienced unemployed workers who had been
jobless for shorter periods. An average of 2.1 million workers, the largest
share of whom are men in the prime working age groups, drew weekly
unemployment benefits averaging $54.50 under regular State unemployment insurance programs during 1971.
PRICES AND COSTS
At the start of 1971 there were signs that the fight against inflation was
yielding tangible results, and there were expectations that it would continue to do so in the coming year. During 1970 both the wholesale price
index and the consumer price index rose less than they had in 1969. Less
pronounced than the moderation in the rise of all wholesale prices, but
really more significant, was the slowdown in the rise of wholesale industrial prices. There was considerable slack in the economy. With activity recovering, prospects were good that there would be an improvement in
productivity, the growth of which had lagged seriously in the 2 preceding
years. Indeed, the rise in unit labor costs had already slowed significantly
during 1970.
To be sure, the then current evidence and the prospects were by no means
uniformly reassuring. The rise in the comprehensive GNP deflator increased
sharply in the fourth quarter of 1970, after declining from a peak in mid1969. And a slower rise in wage rates was yet to be seen. The automobile industry had just concluded a costly wage settlement that was followed by
a sizable increase in prices, and the 3-year contracts in the can, aluminum,
and steel industries were due to expire at varying times by the end of July.




40

Still the evidence at the beginning of 1971, viewed in the light of past experience, gave support to the conclusion that the disinflationary policies were
bearing fruit.
PRICES
The behavior of prices from the end of 1970 to mid-August and especially after April heightened concern about inflation. Although the rise
in consumer prices continued to decelerate for several months early in
the year, it quickened in the spring, as did the rise in wholesale industrial
prices (Charts 4 and 5). The evidence provided by the more comprehensive measures of price change, the GNP deflators, also suggested at least
a partial setback to earlier progress.
No single price index can tell the whole story of price behavior. For
this reason special indexes are reviewed below and after this a summary
statement is given.
Consumer Prices
The consumer price index (CPI), which had increased at rates of 6.1
percent during 1969 and 5.5 percent during 1970, rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 2.8 percent in the first quarter of 1971 (Chart 4).
The 1970 improvement had been due mainly to a slower rise in food prices.
The further slowdown in early 1971, however, reflected a much reduced rate
of increase for nonfood commodity prices, which in the past had displayed a
cyclical behavior but during 1970 had failed to decelerate. Lower interest
rates on mortgages were also important in the first-quarter slowdown.
The improvement proved to be short-lived as the second quarter brought
a rise of 5.3 percent (annual rate) in the CPI. Not only was there some
stepup in the rise of food prices, but nonfood commodities also rose more
rapidly, at about their 1970 rate, while mortgage interest rates leveled out.
Prices in July and August rose less rapidly than in the second quarter; the
slowdown was especially pronounced for food, but it was also evident for
nonfood commodities.
The behavior of the CPI, excluding mortgage interest and food, has a
special interest because the short-term movements of food prices are exceptionally sensitive to changes in supply as well as demand and because
mortgage interest costs are governed by factors rather different from those
influencing most other prices. This calculation also shows a slower rise in the
first quarter of 1971 as compared to 1970, a setback in the second quarter
and a slowdown from June to August (Table 6).
Wholesale Prices
Mainly because of pronounced declines in farm prices, the rise in the
wholesale price index (WPI) slowed considerably from 1969 to 1970—
from 4.8 percent during 1969 to 2.2 percent during 1970. Conversely, in
the first half of 1971, a strong recovery in farm prices was mainly
responsible for the acceleration to a 5.0-percent rate of increase.

underlying inflationary trend because it is little influenced by short-run
supply fluctuations. There had been some progress in restraining industrial
prices. After rising 3.9 percent during 1969, they rose 3.6 percent during
1970, and in the first quarter of 1971 a further deceleration was apparent.
However, this improvement was reversed in the second quarter. Industrial
prices rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.3 percent and then at a
much faster rate in July and August. In general, the quarterly pattern of
price change by major industry groups was very diverse and one cannot
easily categorize the industries showing the largest increases (Chart 5).
GNP Deflators
The broadest measure of price change is the implicit GNP deflator,
which is obtained as a by-product of the calculation of real output. A related measure is the deflator for gross private product; this excludes the
pay of government workers and thus their pay raises, which have often
distorted the interpretation of the behavior of overall prices because the
raises have come at irregular intervals, and because no allowance is made
in the accounting for increased productivity of government workers. Unlike
commonly used indexes such as the CPI and the WPI, whose movements
reflect price changes of fixed bundles of goods and services, movements in
the implicit deflators reflect not only price changes but also shifts in the composition of output, which are sometimes very pronounced. To abstract from
the effect of changes in the composition of output the Commerce Department has calculated alternative deflators; some use fixed 1967 weights, and
others are chain indexes utilizing weights of the preceding quarter. Some of
these measures appear in Table 7. All show some progress toward lower
rates of inflation around the second or third quarters of 1970, some setback

in late 1970 and early 1971, and varying degrees of improvement from the
setbacks in the second quarter of 1971.
Summary of Price Behavior
Chart 6 summarizes the behavior of several price measures in order to
describe the progress against inflation prior to the freeze. Six measures
have been selected, all but one of which—the GNP price deflator for personal consumption expenditures—have already been discussed. These indexes have all been computed quarterly, and in all cases the measure used
is a base-weighted index. The charts illustrate calendar quarter-to-quarter
changes, calculated at seasonally adjusted annual rates.
An examination of Chart 6 indicates the following: (1) Most of the
indexes show a peak rate of increase at some time in 1969; (2) most of
the indexes show a trough at some time in 1970; (3) in the second quarter
of 1971, the last full quarter before the freeze, we find that the rate of
increase is above the trough in all instances but below the peak in all but
one instance—wholesale industrial prices. That, of course, is a serious exception. Although it does not negate the improvement shown in the other
indexes, the exception was important enough and the other improvements
small enough to leave uncertainty about the future decline of inflation.
COMPENSATION AND WAGES
Increases in average hourly compensation in the private nonfarm sector
accelerated sharply from late 1965 until 1968, then leveled off at an
average annual rate of increase of about 7 percent until the freeze was
instituted in August 1971. A careful examination of these data on a quar45

growth. To have halted the acceleration in the rise of hourly compensation
was an accomplishment, but as long as increases of 7 percent persisted, there
would be a continuation of considerable price inflation.
Historically, increases in hourly compensation have slowed significantly
during periods of slack economic activity (Table 8), mainly but not excluTABLE 8.—Rates of increase of hourly compensation during expansions and

sively as a result of cyclical reductions of overtime and a shift in the mix of
employment away from high-wage industries. Such a respite was anticipated
for 1970 but did not materialize either then or in 1971. As is indicated further on, the underlying causes of this continued rapid rate of increase are
not clear. A technical factor that has hindered an understanding of wage
developments has been the lack of comprehensive time series data on wage
and salary rates. However, the information that is available suggests that
average increases in wage and salary rates remained high for most occupation
groups in most industries until mid-August.
Figures on average hourly earnings are available for production and nonsupervisory workers in private nonfarm industries, a group that accounts for
over four-fifths of all employees in the private sector. These data can be adjusted so that they more nearly approximate average wage rates by eliminating both the effects of employment shifts between high- and low-wage
industries and the effects of overtime changes (the latter adjustment is carried out only for manufacturing). The adjusted earnings increased nearly
7 percent during the year ending in the third quarter, about the same rate
as in the 2 preceding years (Table 9). Although different patterns
were evident among the individual industries, rates of increase in
adjusted hourly earnings for all these broad industry groups were above
6 percent, an indication of the pervasiveness of the wage spiral. In the trade,
finance, and services industries, where wage rates have ordinarily been more

sensitive to the business cycle, hourly earnings continued to advance rapidly,
despite ample supplies of labor and the relatively mild expansion of demand.
Statistics on negotiated wage rate changes are available for workers covered by large collective bargaining agreements. Wage increases negotiated in
major collective bargaining agreements in the first 3 quarters of 1971 averaged a bit less than in 1970 (Table 10). However, these average changes are
significantly affected by the mix of industries and by the unions involved in
bargaining. Moreover, they exclude the potential effects of wage increase

agreements with open-ended cost-of-living escalator clauses. In 1971, there
was a large increase in the number of workers covered by such cost-of-living
escalator clauses, although the total number so covered remains a small proportion of the work force. Much of the slowing in the rate of increase for
negotiated wage rates in 1971 occurred in the construction industry, apparently as a consequence of actions of the Construction Industry Stabilization
Committee (see Chapter 2).
Collective bargaining agreements in manufacturing provided larger wage
increases in 1971 than in 1970, with average first-year wage increases accelerating from 8.1 percent in 1970 to 10.7 percent in the first 9 months of
1971. Since 1965, average wage increases have been larger in nonmanufacturing industries than in manufacturing. Efforts of manufacturing workers to reverse this pattern, to regain old wage differentials, and to obtain
gains more nearly like those in the transportation and construction industries were partly responsible for the acceleration in manufacturing.
Data for manufacturing point to differences in wage behavior between
nonunion and union firms. Among nonunion establishments that made decisions to raise wages in the first 3 quarters of 1971, the increases were a little
less than in 1970. Union establishments, however, granted much larger
increases than those of the year before. Nonunion wage rates appeared to be
responding more promptly to the weakness in labor demand, just as they had
responded more promptly to the inflation that gained headway after 1965.
At that time nonunion wage rates rose more sharply than union wages.
Some statistics are also available on changes in salary rates in quite narrowly classified white-collar occupation groups. To judge from these data,
the rise in salary rates accelerated further in 1971, even though unemployment in most of these occupations had risen in 1970 and remained high in
1971 (Table 11).
Thus, although our statistics on wage and salary rates and changes are
imperfect, it appeared in the summer of 1971 that the expected slowdown
in wage and salary increases had not materialized. On the contrary, increases
were persisting at an inflationary pace.

PRODUCTIVITY AND LABOR COSTS

The rise in output from the third quarter of 1970 to the third quarter of
1971 was accompanied by a slight decline in man-hours of work. The resulting rise in productivity—output per man-hour—was an extension of an
upturn that began after the first quarter of 1970, and followed 2 years in
which output per man-hour was essentially unchanged (Chart 7). From then
until the third quarter of 1971, output per man-hour in the private nonfarm
economy increased at an annual rate of 2.5 percent. This did not make up
the earlier shortfall from trend.
The pattern of productivity change described above was broadly consistent
with patterns during previous business cycles, although there were some significant differences. First, the period of no appreciable increase in average
output per man-hour was unusually long—nearly 2 years. In the first part of
this period, from roughly mid-1968 to the summer of 1969, employers increased their employment rolls rapidly even though the rise in output was
slowing down. That period was one of low unemployment and high labor
turnover, one also in which employers seemed to be engaged in labor hoarding because of their expectations of rising demand and difficulties in hiring
experienced help. An extended interval of insignificant productivity growth
while output is still rising is not a characteristic of cyclical experience. In the
second part of the period, output declined while work forces continued to
expand until early 1970, and then were maintained or cut very little. Developments of this kind have been observed in other mild recessions.
Second, after 3 quarters of output growth total man-hours remained
about unchanged instead of rising, as in previous recoveries. The failure of
man-hours to rise probably reflected a heightened emphasis on cost control
resulting from the continuing profit squeeze and the mild recovery of output.
With the rise in hourly rates of compensation holding steady, the upturn
in productivity growth moderated the rise in unit labor costs. After having
risen at an annual rate of 6.5 percent during the 2 previous years, unit labor
costs rose at a rate of 3.9 percent from the third quarter of 1970 to the third
quarter of 1971 (Table 12).
CORPORATE COSTS AND PRICES
The labor costs discussed above are not the full story of cost inflation.
Data pertaining to nonfinancial corporations provide a useful framework
for breaking down the price of output into labor costs, nonlabor costs (depreciation, indirect business taxes, and net interest), and profits. This particular sector of the economy accounts for a large proportion of the Nation's
output, constituting 60 percent of private GNP in 1971. A special advantage
of analyzing corporate data is that the line between wages and salaries on the
one hand and profits on the other is fairly distinct, whereas in the noncorporate sector the income earned by a partner or sole proprietor is a mixture of labor and property income.

In the short run prices are viewed as being responsive to total costs as
well as to demand, but a rise in a particular component of cost does not necessarily mean a rise in price. For example, a rise in depreciation costs may
reflect a substitution of capital for labor which has the net result of leaving
total costs unchanged.
From the third quarter of 1970 to the third quarter of 1971, the price of
corporate output rose 4.2 percent, a little more than in 1970 and considerably more than in any one of the 3 years preceding 1970. The rise in total
costs slowed, and profits before taxes per unit of output rose 8.6 percent, or
10.2 percent if allowance is made for the liberalization in depreciation.
Despite the increase, unit profits were extremely low by post-war standards.
Unit costs of all types rose less rapidly during 1971 than the year before,
but the slowdown in nonlabor costs was less than that of labor costs
(Table 13). The rise in capital consumption allowances per unit during the
past year was partly influenced by the more liberal depreciation permitted
by the Treasury in 1971. Because of changing regulations affecting depreciation, and the use of historical costs in calculating depreciation, changes
in this component of costs are difficult to interpret. One cannot infer that a
rise in measured depreciation costs means a more rapid using up of the
stock of physical capital held by nonfinancial corporations.
When corporate output fell in 1970, indirect business taxes accounted
for a rising share of total price. To some extent this was a cyclical response,
since some of these taxes are relatively fixed and their share increases as
volume declines. The increase in output in 1971 was too small to keep these
costs from rising still more, despite the decline in taxes due to the elimination
of the excise tax on motor vehicles.
Interest costs per unit rose less rapidly last year, partly because the decline
in interest rates slowed the rise in the effective interest charge paid on all
nonfinancial corporate indebtedness.

Cost and Profit Shares
Table 14 shows the distribution of gross product originating in nonfinancial corporations. The profit share in 1971 (before taxes and including
the inventory valuation adjustment) was 11.0 percent, up from the very low
10.3 percent for 1970, but well below the 15.1-percent average from 1960
to 1969. Without the new 1971 depreciation regulations, the profit share
would have been only slightly higher at 11.2 percent.
The profit share is sensitive to the stage of the business cycle, and one
reason for the present low share is that the economy is operating considerably below capacity. As noted above, changing depreciation regulations also affect the profit share, but this can be remedied if depreciation
is calculated on a uniform basis. The Commerce Department has done
this in special calculations, shown below on line 2 for selected high-employment years and the more recent period. On this basis the decline in the profit
share from 1948 is less than the decline in the reported share, but the decline
since 1956 is the same on the two bases.
A comprehensive analysis of property income requires consideration of
interest charges, which have become substantially more important in postwar years. When the interest share is combined with the adjusted profit

INCOMES IN AGRICULTURE
Agricultural incomes often fluctuate widely from year to year for reasons
only partially related to output and price developments in the general
economy. The demand for farm products is relatively insensitive to changes
in overall output and prices. Farm prices, therefore, fluctuate primarily in
response to supply conditions for agricultural products. On the other hand,
since many farm inputs are purchased from the nonfarm sector, price
increases in the nonfarm economy have a direct impact on farm production
costs.




55

In the past 3 years, farm production expenses have been increasing at a
slightly faster pace than the general rate of inflation, reflecting primarily
higher input prices but also some increases in quantities of inputs purchased.
During this period, the value of farm sales increased 9.1 percent in 1969,
only 2.3 percent in 1970 and 4.9 percent in 1971. Net income of farm operators increased sharply in 1969—to the highest levels in over 20 years—and
then declined in 1970. According to preliminary estimates net income (including increases in the value of yearend inventories) recovered slightly in
1971. The pattern of the 1970 decline and 1971 recovery has also been
significant. Income of farm operators declined in each consecutive quarter
through 1970 and improved in each quarter of 1971. The improvement was
particularly strong in the second half of last year.
Aggregate measures do not give a complete picture of recent changes in
the income situation of farm families. Because of the continuing secular
decline in farm numbers, average net income per farm declined only
slightly in 1970 and the 1971 recovery returned it to the record level of 1969.
This indicator is also imperfect because the current census definition of a
farm includes many places only nominally engaged in farming. Many people who are counted as living on farms are primarily dependent on nonfarm
earnings; others supplement their farm income with nonf arm work. Earnings from nonfarm sources by the farm population have been increasing
regularly for many years and in 1971 they constituted over 48 percent of
the farm population's total personal income. Because the growth in nonfarm
jobs has been limited, income from this source has expanded at a slower
rate the last 2 years than in earlier years.
FINANCIAL POLICY AND FINANCIAL MARKETS
The economic goals of 1971 required considerable aid from monetary
policy. In the first half of the year monetary growth proceeded at very high
rates, but expansive effects upon the economy normally associated with such
rapid growth in money were not forthcoming. This shortfall from expectations came about because a large part of the increase in the money stock went
to satisfy an increased desire by the public for money balances. The year
1971 saw generally lower interest rates than 1970, and sectors sensitive to
the costs of credit, particularly housing, enjoyed a considerable expansion.
MONETARY POLICY
The Federal Reserve's stated goals of monetary policy in 1971 were "the
resumption of sustainable economic growth, while encouraging an orderly
reduction in the rate of inflation, moderation of short-term capital outflows,
and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments." After August 15 the success of the New Economic Policy became
one more goal of monetary policy. Throughout the year the Federal Reserve
sought monetary growth rates that would best bring about attainment of
these goals.




56

At the beginning of 1971 there was concern that monetary growth in
the last quarter of 1970 had been less than desirable. The growth rate for
the money supply (currency and demand deposits) or Mx during that quarter
appeared at that time to have been about 3*/2 percent at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate (measured from the final month of the third quarter to the final
month of the fourth quarter), and it was decided that a rate of growth of
about 7/2 percent in the first quarter of 1971 would compensate for this
shortfall. Policy in January was thus directed at attaining "some moderate
easing of money market conditions." Accordingly, open market operations
were aimed at lowering market interest rates. As the quarter progressed,
preliminary reports showed that the money stock was not growing as rapidly
as the Federal Reserve's analysis had predicted it would under the attained
money market conditions, and greater ease was sought.
In the second quarter revised data showed that the money stock had
in fact grown faster than had been anticipated. Because this was faster
than desired, policy was then directed at slowing the monetary growth
rate. To this end temporary "minor firming of money market conditions"
was sought, and market interest rates increased. Nevertheless the rate of
monetary growth in the second quarter exceeded the rate in the first quarter,
despite an increase in interest rates. For the 2 quarters combined, monetary
growth was very high, even after allowance for the shortfall in the fourth
quarter of 1970. From December 1970 to June 1971, the money stock rose
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 10.2 percent, and the broadly defined money stock that includes all time deposits at commercial banks except
large certificates of deposit (M 2 ) climbed at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 16.1 percent. These were high, not only compared to 1970 but compared to the preceding decade. During 1970, Mi had risen at a 5.4-percent
rate, M 2 at an 8.1-percent rate. In the 7 years ending December 1970, the
average annual rates of growth were 4.9 and 7.2 percent, respectively.
In June, the Federal Reserve showed less explicit concern with money
market conditions and continued its effort to moderate monetary growth
rates. Although in July the money stock continued to grow rapidly despite a
considerable rise in interest rates, in August the rates of expansion for both
Mi and M 2 fell sharply and* the rate for Mi turned negative in September.
The rise in Mi came to 3.8 percent for the third quarter as a whole. In
contrast to the first half of the year, the Federal Reserve at this time overestimated the monetary expansion resulting from the money market conditions that had been produced.
Despite the stated policy to place emphasis on the monetary growth rate
in 1971, actual operations were designed to influence interest rates and conditions in short-term money markets, with the intention of thereby achieving
the desired monetary growth rate. In practice the Federal Reserve operated
most directly on the interest rate on loans among banks, called the
Federal funds rate, relying on its appraisal of how monetary growth rates
would respond to various levels of the interest rate. If the money stock




57

responded to the Federal funds rate in a way that differed from the expected response, the monetary growth rate would differ from that desired.
In the first half of 1971, the public apparently wanted to hold more money
balances at the prevailing level of interest rates and income than past
relations among income, interest rates, and money balances suggested.
The bulk of the increases in money holdings appeared in individuals' accounts, and the pattern was part of a larger shift in the public's desire for additional financial liquidity in the first half of 1971. Table 15 shows that in

the first half of 1971 unusually large increases occurred in individuals' holdings of money, savings accounts, and U.S. savings bonds, while decreases or
smaller than usual increases were recorded in their holdings of other U.S.
Treasury and U.S. Government agency securities, corporate bonds, and corporate stock. This shift in the composition of assets was also influenced by
the substantial decline in interest rates after mid-1970, especially in the
rates on short-term securities.
The shift in assets by individuals in favor of more liquidity was accompanied by particularly large increases in debt incurred by the public, notably in the form of mortgage and other personal debt. There were also
important changes in the structure of business borrowing. As Table 16
shows, in the past year and a half corporations have shifted their financing toward equities and long-term bonds and away from bank loans and

short-term open market instruments. The shift of both individuals and corporations toward longer-term debt and shorter-term assets reflects in part
a reaction to the period of restrictive credit conditions in 1969. In that
year, business and individual borrowers had considerable difficulty obtaining
funds at rates they deemed reasonable. As a result, they began insulating
themselves from the pressures of credit markets when conditions eased in
1970 and 1971 by refunding short-term debt with long-term and rebuilding
their holdings of liquid assets.
INTEREST RATES
With monetary policy more expansive and with growing sentiment that
progress was being made against inflation, market interest rates early in
1971 continued their downward trends of the second half of 1970, reaching
levels that turned out to be the lowest of the year (Table 17 and Chart 8).
Fluctuations in long-term rates are typically smaller than in short-term, but
the differential movement last spring also reflected in part the continued
shift from short- to long-term financing by business borrowers, who were
attempting to insulate their liquidity position.

After March, interest rates began rising as a result of the reversal of inflationary expectations and attempts by the Federal Reserve to curtail the
monetary growth rate in the face of a shift in the demand for liquidity. By
July many market rates had risen to roughly the levels prevailing in November and December 1970, but all remained below the 1970 peak levels.
Reinter mediation
The year 1971 saw a continuation of the process of "reintermediation," which had started in 1970 as a correction of the preceding year's
"disintermediation."
Most thrift institutions are constrained in their ability to retain deposits
during periods of rising interest rates. Because the yields on their assets,
which are generally long term, change very slowly, it is difficult for them to
change rates paid on their liabilities, which are generally short term. Partly
in recognition of this problem, most of these institutions have regulatory ceilings on the rates they can pay on deposits. Under conditions of rising market
interest rates, earnings on long-term assets would generally not rise quickly
enough to enable institutions to pay rates on their deposits that would be
competitive with unconstrained money market instruments. The rate ceilings also curtail the ability of institutions to retain funds. As a result, when
interest rates rise very sharply, as they did in 1966 and 1969, financial intermediates both lose funds and acquire fewer new funds, more of which are
invested directly in primary assets, such as Treasury bills and bonds or
municipal and corporate bonds. This process has been termed "disintermediation" and, as Table 18 shows, it occurred in 1969. In that year banks

was reversed. Table 18 shows that the net increase in the flow of total time

and savings deposits through commercial banks and thrift institutions in
1970 exceeded the 1968 levels by 61 percent. The increase for the first 3
quarters of 1971 expressed at an annual rate was 58 percent above 1970.
Mortgage Interest Rates
Mortgage interest rates responded sharply to the general movements in
market rates and to the reintermediation process. In March 1970, reduced
deposit inflows and restrictive monetary policy had helped push secondary
market yields on mortgages to a postwar peak of 9.29 percent from a 7.13percent average in 1968. As market rates rose, the maximum rates permitted
on FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgages were raised from 6.75 percent in 1968 to 8.5 percent in January 1970. Subsequently, as open market
rates declined and reintermediation occurred, the ceiling rate was reduced
to 8 percent in December 1970, and down to 7 percent in February 1971.
In the early months of 1971 mortgage rates fell much more sharply than
other long-term rates. The secondary market yield on FHA new-home mortgages fell 1.58 percentage points from December to April, reaching the
year's low of 7.32 percent. Mortgage yields last spring were about equal to
those paid on new long-term debt issues of the highest rated corporate
borrowers. This drop in mortgage rates made an important contribution
to the record demand for housing in 1971.
In early summer, mortgage rates began rising somewhat faster than other
long-term rates as the housing expansion gained momentum. As the summer




62

wore on, discounts on insured mortgages rose to as much as 9 or 10 points
to equate the 7-percent maximum permissible rate with the higher yields
(7.97 percent as of early August) demanded by permanent mortgage investors. At the time, the ceiling rates on FHA and VA mortgages were not
raised, in order to avoid adversely affecting inflationary sentiment. As an
alternative to raising this mortgage rate ceiling, several Government agencies and Government-sponsored private institutions supported the market
by mortgage purchases, thus reducing the number of discount points (lowering the yield) on these mortgages. Partly as a result of these actions, yields
on insured mortgages began a downward trend in early August.
Assistance to Mortgage Markets
Because reintermediation in the first half of 1971 produced a large volume
of private funds for investment in mortgages, the housing boom proceeded
with little assistance from Federal programs. However, when the general
rise in interest rates in the spring threatened the expansion in housing, Federal mortgage market assistance programs assumed much greater
prominence. In June the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA),
a privately owned Government-sponsored institution, sharply increased its
purchases of insured mortgages. FNMA's net acquisitions of mortgages
totaled $2.4 billion in 1971 as compared to $4.5 billion in 1970 and $3.8
billion in 1969. But the bulk of the 1971 purchases came after May, with
approximately $1.4 billion of the year's purchases in Government-subsidized
loans. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation also made purchases
of $217 million of participations in conventional (uninsured) mortgages
and $562 million of FHA-insured mortgages during 1971.
In the third quarter, the Federal Home Loan Bank System took several
steps to aid the mortgage market. It liberalized terms on mortgage loans by
allowing 95 percent conventional loans. In August, shortly after the NEP
was announced, the FHLB Board reduced the liquidity requirements of
member savings and loan associations from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent to free
more liquid assets for lending. Simultaneously, the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation raised the price at which it purchased FHA-insured
mortgages from 91 to 94 percent of par and reduced from 7% percent to 1%
percent the yields it required on participations in conventional mortgages.
These moves closely followed a new program, in which the Government
National Mortgage Association (GNMA) used a $2 billion authorization to
purchase unsubsidized FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgages in
cooperation with FNMA and other purchasers.
This plan subsidizes FHA and VA mortgage rates when rate ceilings
produce high discounts. GNMA purchases these mortgages at 95 or 96
percent of par and sells them to any authorized purchaser at lower prices
that reflect market interest rates. GNMA absorbs the difference between
the support price and the market price, enabling home buyers to obtain
mortgage financing at lower rates.

FISCAL POLICY TO AUGUST 15

The Administration's fiscal policy as reflected in the budget submitted in
January 1971 was in general to keep expenditures from exceeding the revenues that would be yielded by the existing tax system under conditions of
full employment. There were two reasons for the Administration's adoption of this principle. First, the conventional notion of balancing the actual
budget more or less all the time had proved to be unworkable because either
tax increases or expenditure cuts would ,be required whenever revenue
was depressed by an economic slowdown, and this would be precisely the
wrong time for a restrictive fiscal policy. In fact, this standard of fiscal policy
had not been followed by an Administration for almost 40 years. Second,
some rule of policy that would confine expenditures within the limits of
what the Government was willing to raise in taxes was necessary to enforce
economy in Government. The principle that expenditures should not exceed full-employment revenues has the advantage that fiscal action likely
to intensify the slowdown would be avoided while the discipline of the basic
relationship between revenues and expenditures would be retained.
In conformity with this principle, the Administration's January 1971
budget called for the following relationship between expenditures and the
revenues that would be collected at full employment:

.1

The outcome for fiscal 1971 was close to these plans. Estimated fullemployment revenues after the end of the fiscal year were only $0.1 billion
below the January 1 estimates. Outlays were $1.4 billion, or about one-half
of 1 percent, under the estimate. Instead of an excess of full-employment
revenues of $1.4 billion there was an excess of $2.7 billion as then defined
(see footnote, p. 65).
Developments in the first 6 months of 1971 more significantly changed
the estimates of the full-employment budget for fiscal 1972. On the revenue
side the postponement, from 1971 to 1972, of the increase in the base for
Social Security contributions reduced estimated fiscal 1972 receipts by $2.6
billion. This was expected to be offset in part by an increase in the Social
Security contribution rate to take effect January 1, 1972. The net effect
of these and other smaller changes was to reduce the estimated fullemployment receipts by $1.9 billion. Estimated expenditures were raised
by $4.7 billion. The largest item in this total was an increase of $1.4 billion
of Social Security benefits above the budget. Other major items were an
increase of $1 billion in the estimated payments for unemployment compensation because of the continued high rate of unemployment, and a pos-




64

sible increase of $0.8 billion in military pay as a result of congressional
action.
Thus there was in prospect an excess of expenditures over full-employment
revenues of $6.5 billion in fiscal 1972, compared to an excess of revenues
of $2.7 billion in fiscal 1971.* On the national income accounts basis the
surplus would show a decline of about $3.5 billion between the 2 fiscal years.
This estimate for fiscal 1972 as it appeared in July depended heavily on
action still to be taken by Congress. Although the estimate made some
allowance for probable delays in the enactment of expenditure programs
that had been proposed by the Administration, even longer delays were
possible. And although the estimate also made some allowance for pending
congressional proposals above the budget, not all of those possibilities were
expected to materialize. Despite these uncertainties, it seemed highly probable in the summer of 1971 that there would be a significant shift from a fullemployment surplus in fiscal 1971 to a full-employment deficit in fiscal 1972.
The Administration considered this development appropriate in view of the
sluggishness of the economy. At the same time the Administration was
averse to making decisions that would add substantially to expenditure commitments for the future. Even within the limits of fiscal 1972, while more
fiscal stimulus was desired, there was danger of excessive expansion in the
prevailing inflationary atmosphere.
THE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY
WHERE WE STOOD ON AUGUST 15
As the summer of 1971 progressed, these facts became increasingly clear:
1. The economy was rising, and a continued rise could be expected; but
the rise was not as fast as was desirable, especially from the standpoint of
reducing unemployment.
2. Although the rate of inflation had stopped rising and might have
declined, the decline was not clear cut, and there was some danger that the
rate might rise again.
3. The U.S. international balance-of-payments position was deteriorating
sharply, and willingness abroad to hold dollars was ebbing.
While these facts were clear, their reasons and their implications were
unclear. The rate of economic expansion in the first half of the year was not
less than many forecasters had predicted, but two aspects of the limited
expansion were puzzling. As noted earlier, the rate of expansion of the money
supply had been extraordinarily large, much larger than had been commonly
*In this calculation, expenditures for unemployment compensation payments are
not standardized for the unemployment rate that would prevail at full employment.
It should be noted, however, that the estimates for fiscal 1972 made in July 1971
assumed about the same average rate of unemployment for the fiscal year as was
actually experienced in fiscal 1971. This procedure has been changed for the fiscal
1973 budget, which standardizes for the unemployment rate.




65

expected at the beginning of the year. Even when allowance was made for
some lag between the increase in the stock of money and any consequent
increase in economic activity, the response of the economy to the monetary
expansion was less than many studies had found in previous experience.
One possible explanation was that recollection of the liquidity squeeze of
1970 left individuals and businesses with an extraordinary desire to rebuild
their money balances when interest rates declined, as happened in early 1971.
This attitude might have been reinforced by the belief that rapid monetary
expansion presaged a future rise in interest rates. In any case the rapid
growth of money in the first half of 1971 seemed to have resulted from a
rapid growth in the demand for money and did not imply a growth of money
relative to desired cash balances, which in time would have stimulated more
economic expansion.
The other unusual feature of the limited expansion was the exceptionally high saving rate of 1971. Personal saving for the first 3 quarters of
the year represented 8.3 percent of disposable personal income, as compared
to an average of 6.3 percent in the preceding 10 years. The high rates of
unemployment and inflation in 1970 and 1971 may have contributed to the
high saving rate, as households tried to protect themselves against those
hazards. Whether there was another independent factor, "lack of confidence," as commonly claimed is difficult to say. The measurements we have
of this factor are weak and their historical connection with savings is loose.
Even in retrospect, the reasons for the exceptionally high saving rate of 1971
are not entirely known.
Why the slowdown in the inflation was so halting and uncertain is another question which has not been clearly answered. Although this phenomenon is often ascribed to "structural" changes in the economy, these structural changes are not unmistakably evident. And although the delay in the
disinflationary process was undoubtedly connected with the strength and
duration of the inflation in the preceding years, one could not be sure that
this explanation alone was sufficient.
The third part of the picture, the great enlargement in 1971 of the
balance-of-payments deficit, also had its share of unanswered questions. On
the basis of past experience, the sharp swing in the trade deficit was somewhat more than one might have expected from the rise in domestic demand
and the slower expansion of foreign economies. Nor was it clear why the
trade balance turned to deficit at a time when the rate of inflation in the
United States was less than in most other industrial countries.
Policy in the summer of 1971 had to address the uncertainties as well as
the obvious facts of these three interlocking problems. The relations among
the problems greatly complicated the choice that had to be made.
The Administration's economic targets and projections at the beginning
of the year were predicated on the idea that if the economy failed to rise at
the desired rate, steps could be taken to make it rise more rapidly. This




66

option was open in the middle of 1971. In fact, the planned fiscal policy for
fiscal 1972 had already been made more expansive than had been contemplated in the January budget, and further moves in this direction were possible. Also, the rate of increase of the money supply had been larger than had
been expected at the beginning of the year, and actions already taken by
the Federal Reserve to slow this expansion could have been modified or
reversed.
However, consideration of these expansive moves in the summer of 1971
ran first into the fact that the rate of inflation was still high, and then into
the danger that it might rise again. It could have been argued that a more
rapid rate of economic expansion would help to slow down the inflation
because it would speed up the growth of productivity and cut the rise in unit
labor costs. Although this argument was quite plausible early in 1971, a half
year later it seemed less convincing in the existing psychological atmosphere,
where any action that looked inflationary tended to increase the expectations
of inflation, even though the indication was superficial. In fact, some were
concerned at the time that action intended to be expansive might really be
restrictive because the expansive measures might intensify fears of inflation,
raise interest rates, weaken confidence, and thereby depress consumer and
business spending. Moreover, there was a related danger that fiscal and
monetary expansion might make America's international financial problem
more difficult by increasing the supply of funds available for investment
abroad and by arousing fears that American inflation would speed up again.
At the same time, the continued high rate of unemployment ruled out the
restrictive approach to the problems of the rate of inflation and the balance
of payments. Moreover, the Administration was determined not to try to
solve the balance-of-payments problems solely by tightening up controls on
international transactions. This had been tried repeatedly in the preceding
decade without yielding a satisfactory long-term solution.
THE AUGUST 15 DECISIONS
The key to unraveling this knot of difficulties was the necessity for dealing
with the international financial problem promptly and the Administration's
determination to deal with it in a bold and lasting way. The decision
initiated two policy actions in the international economy. First, the United
States suspended the convertibility of dollars into gold or other international
reserve assets, in order to protect the U.S. reserve position from further drain
and to signal to other countries our determination to achieve meaningful
improvement in our own position as well as needed reform of the international trade and payments system. Second, the United States imposed a
temporary surcharge on imports, generally at the rate of 10 percent, to help
protect the U.S. payments position until other more satisfactory actions
could be taken that would assure a stronger ,balance-of-payments position
for this country.




67

These international decisions tipped the scales on an issue that had been
the subject of intense consideration in the Administration for many months,
and indeed since January 1969. This was the question whether the Administration should intervene directly in holding down wages and prices—adopting what had come to be called an "incomes policy"—and, if so, on what
scale and in what way.
There were two fundamental objections to adopting such a policy:
1. Experience with such policy as it had been practiced abroad suggested
that it would not work—or at least not with much effect or very long—for
the natural reason that success would require that powerful groups suspend
the effort to reap the full advantage of their power.
2. Such a policy, at least if continued for very long, would interfere with
the efficiency of the economic system and might create an undesirable increase in the power of the government over its citizens.
On the other hand, a number of considerations argued for some direct
intervention:
1. Progress against inflation was disappointingly slow, and despite the
unspectacular record of incomes policies elsewhere the possibility of some
assistance from that source, even if temporary, could not be ruled out or
discounted.
2. There seemed to be a large and growing sentiment in the country for
some kind of incomes policy, and steps in that direction might relieve anxiety,
strengthen confidence, and improve the economy. This sentiment also increased the chance of getting the kind of voluntary self-restraint required
for success.
3. The Administration's acute consciousness of the pitfalls encountered in
previous attempts might enable it to avoid, on the one hand, premature collapse of the control system and, on the other hand, its unnecessary
prolongation.
The Administration took limited steps to influence wage and price behavior directly in 1969 and 1970. These included actions with respect to
lumber, and the construction industry generally, as well as the institution
of the National Commission on Productivity, the Regulation and Purchasing
Review Board, and the Inflation Alerts, as described in the 1971 Economic
Report of the President. Early in 1971 the Administration took a much
stronger step, establishing a system of wage controls in the construction industry, with parallel actions intended to affect other cost elements in the
industry (see Chapter 2, where the construction program is described).
This action was the first use of the mandatory control power given to the
President by the Congress through the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970.
The steps decided upon for dealing with the international situation introduced a potent new argument into the Administration's consideration
of the merits of a comprehensive system of controls. Improvement of our international position would require effective and convincing action on domestic inflation, in addition to the action the United States was seeking




68

in the international sphere. Such action on the domestic front would assure
our trading partners of our intentions and provide the framework for a
cooperative approach to the solution of international payments problems.
These considerations, combined with others already present, led to the
decision to institute a powerful, but temporary, price-wage control system.
Once this decision had been made it altered the balance of considerations
with respect to a more expansive fiscal policy. Action to make fiscal policy
more expansive had been limited by the need to avoid intensifying any inflationary expectations and stepping-up the inflation. The establishment of
the direct wage-price controls created room for some more expansive measures, because it provided a certain degree of protection against both the fact
and the expectation of inflation. This situation had to be approached with
caution, because excessive expansion could make the price-wage control
system unworkable. Still there could be no doubt that the tolerable rate
of expansion had been increased.
Thus, the decisions of August 15 consisted of a three-part, integrated
package: (a) International measures aimed at the balance of payments;
(b) controls aimed at checking inflation; and (c) fiscal measures aimed, in
combination with the international measures and controls, at speeding up
economic expansion and reducing unemployment.
The international measures taken on August 15 and their sequels are
described in Chapter 5. The controls are discussed in Chapter 2. Here we
take up the fiscal measures and the expected effect of the total program.
FISCAL ELEMENTS IN THE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY
The fiscal package proposed by the Administration on August 15 (as
described in detail by the Secretary of the Treasury to the House Ways and
Means Committee on September 8, 1971) was primarily motivated by the
desire to stimulate at once a more rapid expansion of the economy. The
composition of the package reflected a number of other objectives: To
improve the balance of trade, to accelerate productivity growth by raising
investment, to minimize the loss of long-term revenue-raising capacity, and
to hold down the deficit in the budget for fiscal 1972, while recognizing
realistically the likely outcome for the budget.
The package included the following items whose effects on the 1972
budget are shown in the table:
1. A job development credit. This would provide businesses with a tax
credit of 10 percent for new investment in the first year of the program and
5 percent for investment thereafter. The two-tier form of credit would create a strong incentive to push investment forward into the first year of the
program and would also hold down the revenue loss in subsequent years.
2. Repeal of the 7-percent excise tax on automobiles. This change was
expected to have a stronger immediate effect on spending, production,
and employment than a reduction in, say, the corporate or individual income




69

tax with an equivalent revenue loss. Repeal of the tax would also reduce the
price level a little.
3. Two steps changing the timing of tax cuts that had been previously
legislated. One change would raise the individual exemption to $750 on
January 1, 1972, instead of to $700 on that date and $750 on January 1,
1973. The other would increase the standard deduction on January 1, 1972,
to 15 percent with a $2,000 maximum. Both of these moves would increase
the after-tax incomes of individuals, and both were expected to increase
consumer spending in 1972 without reducing the revenues after 1973.
4. A temporary surcharge on dutiable imports, generally at the rate of 10
percent. (When all exceptions to the 10-percent rule were taken into
account, the effective rate of surcharge came down to 4.8 percent.) The
surcharge was not imposed to raise revenue but to provide the U.S. external
position with some temporary protection. The surcharge would raise revenues; but unlike the conventional revenue-increasing measure it would
stimulate rather than restrain the economy.
5. Provision for the Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC).
Through this new type of organization, U.S. exporters would be able to
obtain a deferral of income tax on their earnings from qualified export sales.
The purpose was to eliminate the previous bias that had worked against
exporting and in favor of manufacturing abroad, and thus to stimulate
exports.
6. Recognition that certain proposed expenditure programs had been delayed in the legislative process and thus required a reduction of estimated
fiscal 1972 outlays. The main items involved were general and special revenue
sharing and welfare reform.
7. Deferral for 6 months of the Federal pay increase scheduled to take
effect on January 1, 1972. This was the Federal counterpart of the wage
freeze being put into effect on August 15.
8. A 5-percent reduction in Federal employment. Such a reduction would
be the most effective way to reduce Federal outlays with minimum shortrange loss of service to the citizens.
9. Miscellaneous small reductions in expenditures. These included a
10-percent cut in foreign aid.
As Table 19 shows, the effect of this package was to reduce estimated
expenditures for fiscal 1972 by about $1.1 billion more than the reduction in
estimated receipts. At the same time, the program was intended and expected
to be expansionary. The primary reason, as already noted, was that the surcharge, while revenue-yielding, was foreseen as having an expansive effect
on domestic production, and the two-tier investment credit as exerting an
unusually powerful effect on investment in the next year relative to the
revenue loss in that year.
In addition, a common view was that both business spending and consumer
spending had been held down in the early part of the year by anxiety over
the inflation. One motive for the freeze on prices, wages, and rents, was the

hope of relieving this anxiety and encouraging more spending. If these ends
were accomplished there could be a major expansive effect without any
prior change in the budget.
Many aspects of the full package—that is, the freeze, the international
measures, and the fiscal steps—were unprecedented, and therefore any reliable calculation of the size of their effects was exceedingly difficult. The
Council of Economic Advisers estimated at the end of August that the Administration's package would make real 1972 GNP in 1972 prices about
$15 billion greater than it would have been without the new program, but
this figure was recognized as subject to a wide range of uncertainty.
The legislative outcome followed the general outline of the Administration's proposal but differed in several respects. Congress did not enact the
10-percent-5-percent job development credit, but instead passed a permanent 7-percent credit. Congress disapproved the revision in the treatment
of first-year depreciation which the Treasury had made administratively.
Congress also cut back the Administration's proposal, which had already
been passed by the House in 1970, to defer taxes on profits from exports. On
the other hand, Congress not only raised the personal exemption to $750
for calendar year 1972 but also raised the 1971 exemption to $675. Congress
went beyond the Administration's proposals in several other respects: It
raised the "low income allowance," or minimum standard deduction, to
$1,300 from $1,000 for 1972 and repealed the 10-percent excise tax on light
trucks. Other legislation made the Federal pay increase effective on January 1, 1972, contrary to the Administration's proposal. A new deduction for
child care and household help was also introduced.




71

The effect of the congressional action was to reduce the net revenue
loss for calendar 1972 about $1.2 billion below the cost of the Administration's proposal. Possibly more significant was the failure to adopt the job
development credit in its original form, which provided a strong incentive
for investment in 1972. Nevertheless, the enactment of the tax bill contributed to the expectation that a strong economic advance lay ahead, an
expectation which was becoming general as 1971 ended.

CHAPTER 2

Inflation Control Under the Economic
Stabilization Act
Public Law 92-210, the Economic Stabilization Act Amendments
of 1971, requires that the Economic Report of the President include a section "describing the actions taken under this title during
the preceding year and giving an assessment of the progress attained
in achieving the purposes of this title." This chapter is intended
to fulfill that requirement. There is, however, no intent to represent
the description of the control regulations contained herein as legally
binding interpretations.

A

T THE BEGINNING of 1971, the Administration and the President
were hopeful that reliance on appropriate monetary and fiscal policies,
along with the competitive forces of the free market, would be sufficient to
curb inflation. At the same time, there was recognition that the course
of events during 1971 would critically affect the choice of instruments to
achieve the desired goals.
The Government's instruments for inflation control include a range of
policies which are appropriate to various phases and types of inflation. One
of these instruments is the authority to impose direct controls as provided
under the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, as amended. It became
necessary to employ this authority in 1971, at first to restrain excessive wage
and price increases in the construction industry, and subsequently to initiate
overall restraints on wages, prices, and rents in the face of an exceptionally
stubborn inflation.
In his Economic Report of February 1, 1971, the President noted situations where the Government had taken action to reinforce market resistance
to inflationary pressures. Included were these actions:
—Measures to augment the supply of lumber and thus counteract
excessive price increases.
—Steps to increase oil production on Federal offshore leases and to
expand oil imports in order to restrain crude oil price increases.
—A review of the steel industry's economic problems with special refer-




73

ence to inflationary price increases in early 1971 on some steel products. (After the Administration had publicly expressed its disapproval,
these increases were reduced by about one-third.)
The President's Report also emphasized his particular concern about
excessive increases in wages, costs, and prices in the construction industry,
especially in view of the high unemployment that existed among construction
workers. He reiterated his December 1970 request that labor and management in the industry develop a plan to bring wages, costs, and prices into line
with the requirements of national economic policy, saying that a workable
plan would avert the need for Government action.
THE CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM
Concern with wage-price trends in construction was founded on the
experience of the previous years. Construction workers had received abnormally large wage increases in the late 1960's. During 1970 the upward trend
accelerated as nearly 700,000 union construction workers negotiated collective bargaining agreements which provided wage and benefit increases
averaging 19.6 percent in the first contract year and 15.6 percent annually during the life of the contract. These increases were a major factor
in the sharp rise in construction costs and prices, and they may have served
as a spur to inflationary wage demands by both union and nonunion
workers in other sectors of the economy.
The appeal for a voluntary program of cost restraint was not successful.
Late in February 1971 the President suspended the Davis-Bacon Act, which
sets wage standards for federally funded, assisted, or insured construction.
By late March, the Administration, working with labor and industry leaders,
had developed a cooperative program designed to restrain cost increases.
On March 29 the President reinstated the Davis-Bacon Act and by Executive Order 11588 formalized the cost restraint program. Under the authority
provided by the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, this Executive Order
established the administrative rules, organizations, and procedures to be
used in the stabilization of wages and prices in the construction industry.
The administrative mechanism for restraining wage increases took the
form of a 12-member tripartite Construction Industry Stabilization Committee (CISC). With the aid of Craft Dispute Boards made up of labor
and management representatives for individual construction trades, the
CISC was to review and pass upon the acceptability of all economic adjustments in all collective bargaining agreements negotiated in the construction
industry.
Executive Order 11588 spelled out two basic criteria for evaluating proposed increases in compensation. They were: (a) "Acceptable economic
adjustments in labor contracts negotiated on or after the date of this Order
will be those normally considered supportable by productivity improvement
and cost-of-living trends, but not in excess of the average of median increases
in wages and benefits over the life of the contract negotiated in major con-




74

struction settlements in the period 1961-1968"; and (b) "Equity adjustments in labor contracts . . . may, where carefully identified, be considered
over the life of the contract to restore traditional relationships among crafts
in a single locality and within the same craft in surrounding localities."
Because of the large number of contracts to be reviewed by the CISC, the
time needed to install administrative procedures, and the return of some
proposed contracts to Craft Dispute Boards for renegotiation, a backlog of
unapproved cases quickly developed. Its existence caused problems when
the wage-price freeze wras instituted on August 15. The freeze applied to
construction, as to all other industries, but it was not retroactive. Because
the construction contracts in the backlog had been decided prior to
August 15, the Cost of Living Council had no jurisdiction; the contracts
could, with CISC approval, go into effect as agreed. Thus the CISC continued to operate during the freeze and, subsequently, in Phase II under
the jurisdiction of the Pay Board, to clear up the backlog of old cases; this
process continued until late December.
In all, the CISC reviewed over 1,500 new collective bargaining agreements
that had been settled by the parties. Over one-fifth of these were not approved in their initial form by CISC. Construction industry collective
bargaining agreements settled and approved in the second and third quarters
of 1971 provided first-year wage and benefit increases of about 11 percent, a
significant reduction from 1970, when such increases averaged 19 percent.
CISC thus retarded the rate of growth in the compensation of unionized
construction workers and its existence appears to have been an important
factor in a reduction of strike activity in the industry. How much greater the
effect of the construction industry program would have been if the general
wage-price control system had not been established will never be known,
but real progress was undoubtedly made during the period of its independent existence.
Executive Order 11588 also established an Inter-Agency Committee in
the Federal Government to develop criteria for establishing acceptable pricing policies for construction contracts and acceptable compensation changes
for management and staff employees in the industry. The Inter-Agency Committee had developed and published draft regulations and was in the process
of drafting final regulations when its activities were superseded by the
broader price and compensation controls of the New Economic Policy.
AUGUST 15: THE WAGE-PRICE FREEZE
Acting under authority of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, the
President announced on August 15 an immediate 90-day freeze on prices,
rents, wages, and salaries and creation of a Cabinet-level Cost of Living
Council (CLC) to administer the freeze and to advise on further stabilization policies and actions.
The combination of conditions that led to direct Government action to
restrain prices and wages was discussed earlier. These conditions did not




75

automatically determine the type, duration, or rigor of the policy initially
undertaken, which could, of course, have ranged from a noncompulsory type
of policy operating mainly through moral suasion to the comprehensive
mandatory freeze that was actually applied.
During the first half of 1971 the Administration was under increasing
pressure to adopt some form of incomes policy, preferably a noncompulsory
one. However, such a policy was not considered appropriate for two reasons.
First, there was reason to believe that public opinion would regard such
a "soft" control policy as merely the first in a series of moves towrard compulsory controls. The result would be widespread efforts to increase prices
and wages in anticipation of a more stringent program; the Government's
likely reaction—successive escalations of controls—would result in more
inequities, distortions and, ultimately, administrative difficulties than would
a comprehensive freeze. Although the situations were considerably different,
experience with controls in the initial stages of the Korean conflict suggested that this would be the likely pattern of response to voluntary
guidelines.
Second, the nearest American approach to a policy of persuasion, the
guidelines of the previous Administrations, had been abandoned in 1966.
The Administration believed in 1971 that exhortation had lost most of its
force.
Beyond an incomes policy supported only by exhortation, there were, of
course, many possible variations of compulsory controls. The Phase II controls that followed the freeze represent one of those variations. Common to
all such systems, including the Phase II apparatus, is a need for time to formulate the program, to set up the administrative organization, and to write
and disseminate regulations. Such preliminary processes instantly become
public knowledge, with the predictable result that during the startup phase
of a complex restraint program all elements of the economy attempt to
improve their relative position before the controls become effective; the net
effect is to make the inflationary spiral even steeper.
The chief virtues of the freeze were its decisiveness, comprehensiveness,
and administrative simplicity. The President's announcement that practically all wage and price increases were prohibited left no doubt of a drastic change in the upward trend of prices and wages. Equally important, a
freeze could be—and was—imposed immediately, precluding anticipatory
price and wage increases and providing time to prepare and set in motion
more lasting and flexible measures.
The Administrative System
The Cost of Living Council (CLC) consisted of the Secretaries of the
Treasury (Chairman of the CLC), Agriculture, Commerce, Labor,
Housing and Urban Development, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers (Vice-




76

Chairman of the CLC), the Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness and the Special Assistant to the President for Consumer Affairs. The
Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System was
named adviser to the CLC. A small staff headed by a full-time executive
director supplied services including policy review, planning and analysis,
public information, legal counsel, and administrative services.
The CLC, under the authority delegated by the President in Executive
Order 11615, issued a series of orders putting the general freeze into operation
and made the principal policy decisions during the freeze. Policy was implemented through an organizational system headed by the Director of the
Office of Emergency Preparedness (OEP) which was delegated the authority
to administer, monitor, and enforce the freeze. The OEP, through its nationwide organization (which is designed to meet national emergencies or natural
disasters and plan for economic contingencies arising from possible emergencies) successfully carried out this assignment during the freeze period. The
OEP was assisted in interpreting and enforcing the freeze regulations by the
Treasury Department's Internal Revenue Service, a specially designated unit
of Department of Justice attorneys, and Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service field offices.
Freeze Policies
Reflecting the basic objectives of the freeze, the CLC's policy decisions
tended in the direction of the most emphatic possible stop to the inflation.
Only a minimum of exceptions to the freeze on prices, wages, and rents
was permitted. Because of the complexities of the markets for many goods
and services, however, it proved difficult to develop precise definitions that
applied with equal effect in all situations. The basic principle of the freeze,
as applied to wages, prices, and rents, was that the rate of payment during
the freeze period—August 16 to November 13—could not exceed the rate
in effect during the base period—July 16 through August 14.
Wages and Salaries. The crucial question in applying the basic principle
of the freeze was what "in effect" meant in cases where a prefreeze contract
or other arrangement called for a larger wage payment during the freeze
period than had actually been paid during the base period. It was argued
at the time that contracts have a sanctity which must be respected and
that a logical line could be drawn to distinguish contracts from other arrangements incorporating the expectation of a wage increase. However,
the opposing argument was that there was neither a logical nor an equitable
distinction in this type of situation, and to give preferential treatment to
contracts as the bases for granting wage increases would discriminate against
workers not covered by contracts.
This issue was resolved by deciding that wages would be limited during
the freeze to the rates actually paid workers during the base period, even
though they might have entered into an agreement calling for higher
rates to take effect sometime during the freeze. Such resolution of the issue

77
451-688 0—72



6

was deemed to be the most explicit and straightforward application of the
freeze. Moreover, approval of these higher rates would have seriously undermined effectiveness of the freeze and probably would have eroded public
support, which was based on equal treatment of all groups. Another important concern in this decision was the desire to avoid negative effects on production or investment. To allow wage increases to go into effect during
the freeze, while keeping an immovable lid on prices, would have squeezed
profits severely in some cases and might have resulted in some firms' temporarily curtailing production and employment, especially since relief might
have been expected after the freeze. To identify such cases and permit
selective price increases only where they were necessary to prevent this
result was not administratively feasible in the time limits of the freeze period.
Prices and Rents. The decision not to permit wage increases to take effect
during the freeze even if they had been contracted for earlier was paralleled
in the CLC regulations for both prices and rents. Rent increases were not allowed, even though tenants before August 15 had signed leases, secured by
deposits, calling for increases.
In the case of prices, the ceiling for the freeze period was the highest
price at or above which a "substantial volume" (interpreted to mean at least
10 percent of the total) of transactions had taken place in the 30 days
preceding the freeze. If no transactions had taken place during that period,
the nearest preceding 30-day period in which transactions occurred was to be
used as the base. A price transaction was deemed to have occurred when the
seller shipped a product to the buyer, not when the order for the product
was received. Thus, sales contracts entered into before August 15 providing
for deliveries during the freeze at higher than base period prices were set
aside.
In keeping with the principle of the freeze, price increases were
not sanctioned on the basis of cost increases; inequities and hardships arising
from this rule were assumed to be endurable for the 90-day duration of the
freeze. Raw agricultural products were exempted in the Executive Order,
however, and certain limited exceptions—for example, import price increases
and seasonal price adjustments—were allowed.
Raw Products. The exemption of raw agricultural products, including
seafood products, from price control created problems for some processors
who found their operating margins squeezed between uncontrolled costs and
frozen selling prices of the processed foods. Nevertheless, increases in the
uncontrolled prices were not allowed to be passed through, although there
were some minor extensions of the definition of "raw" products.
Imports. Imported products were subject to price increases during the
freeze at the level of the importer from three sources:
1. The surcharge on dutiable imports (generally 10 percent of the customs valuation). No surcharge was applied to duty-free imports or those
under quota.




78

2. An increase in dollar price resulting from fluctuations in international
exchange rates.
3. Price increases in world markets which were reflected in the delivered
price in the United States.
On the principle that U.S. Government actions were directly responsible
for the surcharge, the CLC permitted the dollars-and-cents amount of the
surcharge on a particular imported product to be passed through successive
transactions, including processing, to the final purchaser. Increases due to
dollar depreciation or price changes on world markets were allowed to be
passed on as long as the imported good retained its original form. If an
import was physically transformed, the price increase had to be absorbed.
Seasonal Price Adjustments. Sellers of goods and services which were
characterized by a marked seasonal fluctuation in price were likely to be unfairly penalized by ceiling prices based on the immediate prefreeze period.
Therefore, the CLC ruled that prices showing a "large distinct fluctuation at
a specific, identifiable point" in each of the past 3 years would be allowed
to increase to the level reached during the same seasonal period of the
preceding year.
New Products. As in past periods of price control, the definition of a product became controversial. The CLC decided that to be considered new a
product or service must be "substantially different" and not merely changed
in fashion, style, form, or packaging. In the event of introduction of a'genuinely new product or service during the freeze, two alternative methods of
pricing were permitted; the price could be based on the price of comparable
products or services or on the unit cost plus the normal markup of similar
products or services.
Other Rulings. The CLC determined that price ceilings did not apply
to exports and that increases in various welfare payments, workmen's compensation, and employers' contributions to previously effective fringe benefits were not covered by the freeze. Pay increases resulting from bona fide
promotions to jobs of greater responsibility and progression of apprentices or
learners to more skilled levels according to preestablished programs were
permitted on the grounds that they were not increases in the wage for a
given job. Actual wage increases were also permitted to meet requirements
of minimum wage laws or to eliminate illegal discriminatory employment
practices.
Exemptions. In all, nearly 6,000 requests for exemptions and exceptions to
the freeze regulations were considered by the CLC; five individual exemptions were made. Many requests were from persons in financial difficulties
not due to the freeze. Many others were from persons whose proposed
changes were permissible under existing regulations.
The freeze generated numerous problems for its administrators, but most
of their concern was occasioned by a small proportion of the economy's
millions of different wages, prices, and rents. The public was kept informed
by a series of questions and answers that amplified and interpreted the




79

definitions of the original Executive Order released by the CLG; the substance of these interpretations and definitions was incorporated in the more
extensive regulations and circulars published in the Federal Register by the
Office of Emergency Preparedness.
Dividends and Interest. The Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 did not
include provisions for regulating interest or dividends. Control of dividend
payments during the freeze period was carried on through a program of
voluntary compliance. The Secretary of Commerce sent telegrams to about
1,300 large corporations, asking them voluntarily to forego increases in
dividends during the freeze, and he received practically unanimous support.
Although interest rates were not controlled during the freeze, most rates
dropped significantly, in part because of the abatement of inflationary
expectations.
Administrative Record of the Freeze
Little administrative planning and no organizational preparation could be
carried out before August 15. Such activity might have given public notice to
the impending control program and jeopardized its prospects for success. As a
result, the freeze was as much a surprise to almost all of the people who were
to help administer it as it was to the Nation at large. Given these circumstances at its initiation, the administration of the freeze program must be
accounted outstandingly effective.
In exercising its authority to administer, monitor, and enforce the freeze
regulations, OEP had the benefit of its established facilities, including a
system of 10 regional offices (two of which were specially opened during the
freeze) connected to Washington headquarters by private teletype. In addition to OEP's 300 employees, personnel from many other Government
departments and agencies, including 2,500 IRS employees, were engaged
at least part time in the program.
Inquiries and Complaints. During the freeze period approximately 1 million inquiries regarding the stabilization program were received (mostly by
telephone) ; of these two-fifths concerned prices and the rest were equally
divided between wages and rents. Most of these were requests for interpretations, but nearly 50,000 were complaints of alleged violations, 75 percent
of Which concerned prices. Rents accounted for 19 percent of the complaints
and wages 6 percent. Over 60 percent of these complaints were found not
to involve actual violations; almost all of the remaining cases were brought
into compliance informally or through routine investigation.
In addition, over 85,000 spot checks carried out by IRS indicated over 90
percent in compliance. Of those in violation, over half promptly and voluntarily complied when the violation was pointed out.
Litigation. About 200 cases of violators who refused to comply voluntarily
after initial contact were forwarded to OEP regional offices during the
freeze; all but a few of these cases were resolved without court action. Eight
cases had reached court and 23 more were in various stages of prepara-




80

tion in the Justice Department as the freeze ended. This relatively small
volume of litigation reflects the widespread compliance with the freeze.
Effectiveness of the Freeze
Viewed as a whole and against the circumstances of its initiation, the
freeze was a major success. Its primary purpose was, of course, to reduce the
rate of inflation and its success in that respect may, in some degree, be
inferred from the behavior of the major price indexes.
Consumer Price Index. During the freeze the rate of increase of consumer prices as measured in the consumer price index slowed by more than
half from the prefreeze rate (Table 20). The index did not show a comTABLE 20.—Changes in consumer prices, selected months, 1971

plete halt because prices of some items in the index (about 10 percent of
the total weight) were unaffected, as a result of exemptions, exceptions,
and inapplicability of the controls. In addition, the rate of price increase
was somewhat overstated by the index during this period because time lags
in the collection of price data caused some prefreeze price changes to be
reported during the freeze. The exemptions and the measurement problem
led to a continued rise in the index during the freeze. Partly because of this,
special analyses of price changes item by item were undertaken. These showed
that except for raw agricultural products the prices were unchanged between
October and November for 86 percent of 120,000 consumer items for which
comparisons could be made; for about 6*/2 percent prices declined, and for
about 7 percent prices increased (Table 21). A similar pattern was found

these data whether the small proportion of increases that did occur were
entirely the result of allowable increases.
Industrial Wholesale Prices. The effect of the freeze on wholesale prices,
which is easier to observe because there are fewer lags in the collection of
data, was even more impressive than in the case of the consumer price index.
The index of industrial commodity prices, which had risen at an accelerating
rate after the first 3 months of 1971, declined at an annual rate of 1.3
percent from August through November (Table 22). The decline affected

most of the industrial commodity categories; the few increases that did occur
were attributable to import price increases or factors such as the seasonal
fluctuations associated with introductions of new automobile models.
Average Hourly Earnings. The freeze on the wage and salary side also was
effective. Hourly earnings (adjusted to more nearly approximate wage
rates) had shown an annual rate of increase of about 7 percent prior to
August; this dropped to an annual rate of about 1^4 percent between
August and November.
PHASE I I : ISSUES AND ORGANIZATION
The broad support of and compliance with the freeze reflected a national
willingness to support a rigorous anti-inflationary program, even at the cost
of some hardship. But it was clear from the outset that the freeze had certain important limitations if extended indefinitely. An indefinite freeze
is unworkable in a dynamic economy, where technology, new products
and changing demand patterns exert a continuing strong influence on
prices. Movements of prices and wages serve the essential purposes of organizing and guiding the allocation of resources, and to suppress them for long




82

would seriously distort resource allocation. The proper goal of the stabilization program is to reestablish an acceptably low rate of price increase by
reducing expectations of continued strong inflation and eliminating, to the
extent possible, practices and behavior which sustain or promote inflation.
But underlying expectations of a continuing inflationary trend could not
be arrested by a short freeze. A sequel would therefore be required; this
plan was reported to the Nation in the President's October 7 announcement.
It was vital to the success of the effort to disinflate through a system of controls that the transition from the freeze to Phase II should be orderly, well
understood, and widely supported. Many possible paths could have been
followed in the Phase II price-wage control system. In a free nation with a
market economy, however, these paths are somewhat circumscribed by social,
political, institutional, and economic constraints. In this instance, these constraints required that the control system employed in Phase II be as effective
and equitable as possible in reducing the inflation, while still permitting the
maximum operation of normal market mechanisms and ensuring an early
return to a free market economy. Administratively, the system also had to be
streamlined and efficient, and, to work, it had to earn a high degree of public support. These considerations raised certain decisive issues. Paramount
among them were these questions:
Should the program be mandatory?
How comprehensive should the program be?
How should the program be administered and enforced?
Who should set standards of price-wage behavior?
What standards should be set?
In addressing these problems of Phase II, the President and his Cost of
Living Council consulted with numerous representatives of each major
interest in the control program: labor and business, farmers and consumers,
State and local governments, and the Congress. The discussions revealed
an almost unanimous belief that the anti-inflationary effort should be continued to a successful conclusion, but a great diversity of strongly held
opinion about the best strategy and procedures for achieving price stability.
A consensus was ultimately fashioned upon the belief that Phase II required:
(a) A clear-cut, publicly supportable goal for the disinflationary effort; (b)
machinery allowing the public and major elements of the economy to participate in setting policy and administering the program; (c) an essentially self-administered system embodying strong incentives to encourage
anti-inflationary behavior; (d) provision in the system for maximum continued operation of competitive pricing and free collective bargaining.
In the interests of equity and effectiveness (and for the reasons noted
earlier in this chapter with respect to the freeze) it was decided that Phase II
controls would be mandatory and initially as comprehensve in their direct
coverage as was administratively feasible. In large measure, this decision was




83

based on the intensity and pervasiveness of the prefreeze inflation. The
intention was to preserve the psychological benefits already realized by the
freeze, to prevent an outbreak of renewed inflationary increases in prices or
wages in any uncontrolled sectors, and to establish a broad pattern of
restraint and thus reassure the public that the process of stemming inflation
would be as widely and evenly distributed as possible. This decision for
almost universal coverage at the outset did not preclude the possibility of
a subsequent relaxation of the controls by stages, as the effectiveness of the
system was demonstrated, confidence in the control of inflation was
strengthened, and sectors of the economy no longer requiring control wrere
identified.
A major issue of post-freeze control strategy was which of two courses to
pursue. One alternative was to follow up the freeze period with what might
be called a semifreeze, holding close to the rigid standards of the freeze
as long as possible. The danger here was that inequities and hardships caused
by the freeze had built up so much pressure that there would be an explosion
that might wreck Phase II before it got underway; also there would be
increasing problems of resource allocation. The other alternative was to
move quickly to the more flexible and durable standards that would eventually be needed, recognizing that this would cause a transitional bulge of
wage and price increases. Because of concern that a rigid stance wrould both
undermine the operation of normal market functions and force major confrontations that might endanger the continuation of the whole program, the
second of the two courses was followed. The cost of this choice was a temporary period of wage and price increases in excess of the goal.
Maintenance of maximum cooperation and support was also a vital consideration in structuring the policy-setting bodies. On the wage side it was
evident that participation of labor and management would be required to
give both groups a voice in the direction of the program and to ensure equal
treatment. It also was abundantly clear that administration and policymaking in this unique situation would require great expertise in the area of pricewage determination and that such ability was best found among persons with
long experience and training in the field. Also, large segments of the Nation—
including business, unions, and the general public—had increasingly supported a control program in 1970-71, and their insights and participation
were believed to be an important factor in the successful operation of the
controls program.
Structuring of the policy-setting bodies could have taken several directions
but the considerations summarized above pointed toward a tripartite combination (equal representation of labor, management and the public) for
policy determination in the wage area, and toward public membership only
on the price-policy body. In matters of pay, the different types of expertise
and, above all, the need and desire for cooperation dictated a tripartite
board.




84

Announcement of Phase II
On October 7 the President announced the outlines of the Phase II
program. The goal of the program, as proposed by the CLC, was to reduce
the rate of inflation to the 2 to 3 percent range by the end of 1972, a
reduction to about half the prefreeze rate. The development of guidelines
and standards to attain this goal was to be in the hands of policy-setting
units comprised primarily of personnel drawn from various sectors of the
economy, outside of Government but acting in the public interest. The~]
controls were to cover the economy broadly, were to be mandatory, and were j
to be removed when, in the President's judgment, conditions had been \
achieved which promised the maintenance of reasonable price stability 1
without them.
In its specific provisions, the administrative machinery (established in
Executive Order 11627) was to operate along participatory lines to the
greatest extent practicable. The CLC, consisting of high Government officials
and representing the President's direct interest, was assigned the responsibility of establishing broad goals, determining the coverage of the control
program, overseeing enforcement, and coordinating the anti-inflationary
effort in line with the overall goals (Chart 9).
The primary bodies created to develop standards and make decisions
on changes in all prices (including rents) as well as compensation (wages,
salaries, and fringe benefits) were, respectively, the Price Commission, composed of seven public members, and the tripartite Pay Board of 15 members,
who were divided equally among business, labor, and public representatives.
Advisory committees were also established to promote a voluntary program
to restrain interest rates and dividends, elicit State and local government cooperation, and to suggest means to curtail price increases in the health
services industry. A rent advisory board including landlord, tenant and public representatives was created to counsel the Price Commission, while the
preexisting tripartite Construction Industry Stabilization Committee was
placed under the authority of the Pay Board. The National Commission on
Productivity was expanded and assigned the advisory role of ensuring that
the entire stabilization program encouraged productivity growth.
For purposes of administrative efficiency, the CLC decided that smaller
economic units should not be required to give advance notice or to report
price and wage increases which were consistent with the basic guidelines
established by the Price Commission and Pay Board. The largest firms and
employee groups were required to obtain advance approval from the Commission and the Board for any change, and an intermediate group was
required to report after wages or prices were increased in accordance with
the stabilization rules. These tiers are shown in Table 23. The CLC also
recognized that prices of some products and services were either insignificant
in the overall inflation problem, relative to the administrative difficulty of
controlling them, or were subject to direct controls outside the Economic

PRICE COMMISSION AND PAY BOARD STANDARDS
Members of the Price Commission and Pay Board assumed their duties
in late October. From then to mid-November, when the freeze ended, they
had to organize staff, publish specific guideline regulations, and establish
prenotification and reporting procedures. Both groups were also under
immediate pressure at the opening of Phase II to deal with special problems
created by the 90-day freeze.
Price Standards
In assuming its responsibilities, the Price Commission announced a goal
of holding the rate of average price increases across the economy "to no
more than 2*/i percent per year." This conformed to the CLC's goal of
getting the inflation down to no more than 2 to 3 percent by the end of 1972.
The Price Commission also set forth the general rule that no price might
be increased beyond the ceiling price established for the freeze period, except in accordance with its regulations. The terms of these regulations were
as follows:
1. Manufacturers and Service Organizations. These firms were permitted
to increase their prices to reflect allowable cost increases which had occurred
since their last price increase but not before January 1, 1971. The cost increases were to be reduced to reflect productivity gains. Such price increases
could not have the effect of increasing the firm's profit margin (profits
before taxes as a percentage of sales) over its margin prevailing in a base
period (defined as the highest average of two of a firm's 3 fiscal years ending
prior to August 15,1971);
2. Retailers and Wholesalers. These firms were permitted to increase their
prices consistent with maintaining: (a) Their customary initial percentage
markup on products equal to or less than that prevailing during the freeze
period or (at the firm's option) during the firm's last fiscal year ending before August 15, 1971, and (b) the before-tax profit margin of the firm equal
to or less than that prevailing in the base period (defined as for manufacturers, above).
These regulations had the effect of placing a ceiling on the firm's overall
ratio of profit to sales, the ceiling being determined by the experience in the
past 3 years. The formula for permissible price increases normally precluded
an increase in the profit margin on individual products; in the event that
product mix factors had the effect of increasing the firm's overall profit
margin, the ceiling became operative. However, absolute profits could continue to advance in step with expanded production and sales. Since the regulations applied to individual producers and sellers, competitive influences
could continue to operate as an additional downward pressure on prices.
This factor was immediately apparent in cases where some manufacturers'
effective price increases were below those justified by their cost increases
because major competitors had been permitted a smaller increase. This




88

procedure also avoided the costly and time-consuming process of setting
individual price ceilings for individual products, with attendant problems
of product definition and of assembling and analyzing data.
Immediately after the freeze the Price Commission gave priority to decisions on requests from Tier I firms for price increases based on long-term
contracts written before the freeze, on adjusted base prices, or on price
adjustments posted or announced prior to August 15, 1971, as well as for
price increases based on contractual wage and other cost increases where
price adjustments had been deferred by the freeze. Other price increases
calling for advance notification were to be dealt with on the basis of approval
or disapproval by the Price Commission within 30 days.
Labor Cost Pass-Through. The Price Commission made clear soon after
assuming its duties that it would not necessarily grant price increases reflecting the full amount of increases in labor costs, i.e., increases in wages and
benefits minus gains in productivity. It promised "to look very carefully at
any labor cost increase, even if allowed by the Pay Board, to determine its
impact on price inflation," and said that "in general" it would not recognize
wage increases that exceeded the Pay Board's basic standard.
Rents. Price Commission rules for increases in residential rents provided
that the landlord could:
1. Increase his rent charge by 2*/2 percent annually above the base rental
upon 30-days notice to the tenant.
2. In addition, increase his rent charge by the dollars-and-cents amount
of the increase of State and local government taxes, fees, and charges for
services allocable to the individual unit.
3. Increase monthly rents by 1 ^ percent of the total cost of major
capital improvements made after August 15, 1971.
4. In the case of leases which had not been renewed within 90 days prior
to August 15, establish a new base rent, defined as that in effect on May 25,
1970, plus 5 percent.
Fire and Casualty Insurance. Price Commission policies covering all nonexempt insurance coverage restricted projection of increases in companycontrolled costs (as opposed to actuarial factors) to 2J/2 percent, limited the
projection of inflationary trend factors to 62.5 percent of what they would
have been in the absence of an economic stabilization program, stipulated
that no changes could be made in ratemaking formulas which would increase rates and, in lieu of the general profit margin test, imposed a
2 l/i -percent limit on increases in the profit portion of the premium. Insurance
departments of the various State governments are responsible for administering these guidelines, although final authority to review rate increases remains
with the Commission.
Public Utilities. Under the Price Commission's rules all public utilities with
$100 million or more in annual revenues in their most recent fiscal year were
required to notify the Commission when they request a rate increase from
their respective regulatory agency as well as when the increase is permitted




89

to be effective; public utilities with revenues of between $50 million and $100
million were required to notify the Commission when they were granted an
increase. The Commission relies initially upon certification by the regulatory
agency that the increase conforms to criteria specified by the Commission;
however, the Commission retains the right to disapprove an increase within
10 days after it has been granted.
Firms Showing Losses or Low Profits. Notwithstanding its other regulations, the Price Commission authorized all firms currently sustaining
a loss to increase their prices to the break-even level. In addition, firms with
annual sales of $1 million or less were permitted to increase prices to bring
their profit margins on sales up to 3 percent regardless of their experience
in the previous 3 years.
Health Care Services. The Price Commission approved policies for this
sector recommended by the Health Services Industry Advisory Committee
which operated under the jurisdiction of the CLC. The guidelines divided the
industry into two categories: Institutional providers, such as hospitals and
nursing homes, were to be permitted only such price increases as were justified
by allowable costs adjusted for productivity gains. Increases from 2^2 to 6
percent had to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service with supporting
justification and to the appropriate medicare intermediary; and increases
above 6 percent required an exception granted by the Price Commission.
Noninstitutional providers, including physicians, were permitted average
aggregate increases in their prices, based on allowable cost increases, of no
more than 2J/2 percent per year. Such increases might not have the effect of
increasing profit margins of the providers above the average of the highest
two of the past 3 years. Nonprofit providers were not permitted to increase
the ratio of their net revenues to their gross revenues as compared to the
base-year average.
Term Limit Pricing. The Price Commission late in 1971 established a simplified approach to approvals for price increases by Tier I companies: Under
the term limit principle (TLP) a company might apply for a weighted
average price increase covering all product lines for a 12-month period
without specific Commission approval of changes in individual product
prices. This modification was particularly useful to firms with complex
product lines which included thousands of individual items. The Commission required such a firm to keep records and file quarterly reports; and
the firm had also to establish a monitoring procedure which would assure
that the weighted average of increases did not exceed the approved limit.
Prices, Fees, and Charges of Federal, State, and Local Governments. The
distinction between prices, fees, and charges on the one hand and the
taxes le\ied by State and local governments on the other is often very arbitrary. Since taxes cannot be controlled under the economic stabilization
authority, an inducement to raise taxes rather than increase fees might be
present if the latter were controlled. Therefore, these fees (except those of




90

hospitals and public utilities) were exempted from control. However, all State
and local governments were requested to take steps to make sure that such
fees did not increase more than 2J4 percent per year; their chief executive
officers were also asked to report semiannually on fee increases. Similarly, the
Federal Government was scheduled to report the fee increases at the end of
each fiscal year.
Interest and Dividends.
Interest rates were lower during 1971 than 1970, and net borrowing by
households and nonfinancial business units increased substantially. The decline of interest rates may have reflected some abatement of inflationary
expectations. Despite the decline of interest rates there was considerable
public concern about the future course of interest rates and the Committee
on Interest and Dividends was directed by the CLC to maintain close
surveillance of interest rates with a view to formulating and preparing to
implement a program of voluntary restraints on such rates, particularly for
home mortgages and consumer loans.
The Committee proposed voluntary compliance with dividend guidelines
that requested that companies limit dividend increases to 4 percent per share
in 1972 (adjusted for splits and stock dividends) over the largest per-share
dividend paid in fiscal 1969, 1970, and 1971, or in calendar 1971. Various
special guidelines carefully defined acceptable procedures where new companies, mergers, and special situations were involved.
Pay Board Policies
General policies governing pay adjustments were adopted by the Pay
Board early in November. These became effective at the end of the freeze
and were applicable to all employees other than Federal employees and persons earning less than the Federal minimum wage. These guidelines included
three provisions. First, permissible annual pay increases would be those normally considered supportable by productivity improvement and cost-of-living
trends. The initial general standard for new contracts and adjustments was
set at 5l/2 percent and was subject to periodic review by the Board. Second,
existing contracts and pay practices established before November 14 would be
allowed to operate, subject to challenge by five members of the Board or a
party at interest. Third, retroactive payments for wage increases temporarily
foregone during the freeze would be permitted only upon approval of the
Board.
The Pay Board delegated to the CISC the responsibility of carrying out
Board policy with respect to the construction industry. The Board also agreed
upon and issued a series of definitions. Among the most important of these
were a base date (November 13) from which future wage increases were
measured against the standard and definitions of employee units. The Board
also waived reporting requirements for existing contracts until year's end, a
deadline later extended to January 31, 1972.




91

In mid-November the Pay Board issued standards regulating certain permitted exceptions to the general bl/i percent pay standard. These exceptions provided that: (a) Pay increases of up to 7 percent would be permitted
where tandem relationships (situations where pay rates for certain employees
or firms are based on rates for other groups of workers or firms) could be
proven to exist under certain stringent definitions, (b) Pay increases of up to
7 percent would be permitted where they were deemed necessary, within
certain narrow criteria established by the Board, to attract or retain essential
labor, (c) Pay increases of up to 7 percent would be permitted until
March 31, 1972, where pay increases had aggregated less than the sum of
7 percent per year for each of the past 3 years (under this exception only the
difference between the sum of 7 percent per year for 3 years and the sum of
the actual increases might be added to the 5/2 percent increase normally
permissible). (d) The portion of a pay adjustment tied to changes in the cost
of living might be calculated as a weighted annual average increase, provided
that the sum of this portion and the remainder of the adjustment did not
exceed the general pay standards. The first and second exceptions required
prior approval by the Pay Board, and the maximum permissible adjustment,
under any or all of these criteria, was not to exceed 7 percent.
Policies on executive and incentive compensation not covered by collective bargaining agreements were announced late in December. Essentially
these provided that executive compensation increases (including salaries,
fringe benefits, and perquisites of all types) were not to exceed the 5*/2 percent general standard. Existing incentive compensation and bonus plans were
permitted to continue as long as their costs did not rise by more than 5J/2
percent from the appropriate base period. Existing stock option programs
were permitted to continue if they met certain detailed legal and historical
tests, including the stipulation that the number of shares made available
should not exceed the average number made available during a 3-year base
period. Also late in December, the five business members of the Pay Board
reported their intention to challenge all deferred pay increases in excess of
7 percent called for by existing labor contracts.
Government Pay. Federal Government employees' pay, subject to existing legislation and executive decision, was to be monitored by the Federal
Pay Agent to ensure consistency with the stabilization program. The CLC
was to advise the President on the consistency of future Federal pay decisions
with the economic stabilization program. The pay of State and local employees wras subject to the Pay Board's rules but advance notice of such
increases within the Board's general standards was waived. If a governmental
unit certified to the Pay Board that it would abide by the Board's standards,
it was required to report pay increases only semiannually.
PHASE II OPERATIONS
At yearend the economic stabilization machinery of Phase II had been
operating about 7 weeks. Progress had been made by the Price Commission




92

and Pay Board in adopting and publicizing standards for price and wage
behavior, in establishing criteria for evaluating individual cases, in recruiting
and organizing necessary staff, and in setting up reporting procedures and
internal systems for handling applications.
To expedite the evaluation of applications and to consider regulatory
issues, the Price Commission had recruited a supporting staff of approximately 500 people, while the Pay Board, whose needs for staff were much
smaller, had recruited 75. A stabilization office was established under the
Internal Revenue Service; it utilized 360 local IRS offices with about
3,000 persons to administer, interpret, monitor, and enforce the wage, price,
and rent regulations of Phase II. A special unit of the Justice Department
provided legal support, with 170 people assigned to this task.
Price Commission
By early January there had been 3,460 advance notifications of price
increases filed with the Price Commission by an estimated 1,075 companies
(among the estimated 1,500 companies in Tier I ) . The Commission had
approved requests of 335 industrial companies for price increases, covering
products having a sales volume of $322 billion. (The total sales of all Tier I
firms was estimated at over $800 billion.) A total of 27 companies were
denied requested price increases. The approved increases averaged 2.9 percent on a weighted basis measured against sales of affected products by
applicant companies and 1.4 percent of total sales of the companies covered.
Companies receiving approval for increases were among the Nation's
largest producers in the automotive, steel, aluminum, and coal industries.
The average approval rate should not be construed as a general indicator
of the price behavior of all Tier I firms. In fact, at the end of the year,
the trend shifted to lower approvals. In addition, many large companies
had indicated to the Price Commission their intention to hold the line on
prices.
The Price Commission was giving close attention to a more detailed
articulation of the standards for price behavior, which would provide clear
rules both for the large companies required to report to the Commission
and for the millions of smaller businesses and individuals in the economy.
Particular priority was accorded to interpretation of the requirement that
"productivity gains" be taken into account.
Pay Board
Up to mid-January 1972, the Pay Board had received 114 applications
for pay increases from prenotifying Tier I organizations. The Board had
acted upon 16 applications, approving 11 and disapproving five. Two of
the contracts that were approved—the coal contract and the railroad signalmen's contract—provided initial wage and benefit increases in excess
of 10 percent. Both contracts represented special situations: The coal pact
was actually signed before the November 13 deadline after which Phase II
rules became effective and part of the signalmen's increase had been legis93

lated by the Congress. Deferred increases in both contracts are subject to
review in 1972 and 1973. The Board had also approved a 4-percent increase
for municipal workers in Chicago.
Early in January the Pay Board rejected five proposed contracts covering
over 100,000 aerospace workers. The proposed contracts had provided firstyear wage and benefit increases of about 12 percent. Also in early January
the Board approved wage and benefit increases of less than 5*/2 percent for
workers in eight major organizations in the prenotifying category.
Inquiries, Complaints, and Litigation
Inquiries about various aspects of the stabilization program averaged
over 24,000 per day from Phase IPs initiation to mid-January. Inquiries
about rent regulations accounted for more than half the total; the remaining inquiries were divided equally between wages and prices.
Complaints about alleged violations of Phase II rules averaged nearly 800
per day during Phase II, a somewhat lower volume than during the latter
days of the freeze. Complaints about prices averaged 56 percent of the total;
rent complaints were 40 percent and wage complaints 4 percent. The cumulative total of complaints during Phase II was over 30,000, of which about
two-thirds had been resolved by IRS action. Of some 8,700 requests received
for exemptions or exceptions from stabilization rules, over 2,500 had been
resolved. The bulk of the remainder involved rent questions.
There were only a few court cases involving Phase II regulations by yearend. Two injunctions had been issued against threatened evictions and
proposed rent increases. In a case covering Phase I and Phase II the Government had brought action against a municipal transit company to remedy
violations involving fare increases and reduction of service.
Program Administration
Because of the newness of the controls and systems, as well as the new
staffs and procedures, there was some early confusion in the control system and some misunderstanding. Probably the most notable example of
confusion involved specific price ceilings and the lists of base prices (applicable during the freeze period) which the Price Commission required
each retailer to post. Under the regulations, prices of the same product
could vary from store to store, and products essentially similar sold by different firms could also vary in price. Moreover, the legal ceiling prices in
retail stores could vary with fluctuations in the stores' wholesale purchase
prices. During earlier periods of price controls, ceiling prices were set by
product and were therefore more uniform. Under the present system it was
difficult for the public to assess accurately whether actual prices, when they
were above the posted base price, had been increased in accordance with
Price Commission regulations or not. Therefore, in cases where prices increased substantially beyond the posted base price the public was encouraged
to ask the store to explain the increase. If not satisfied, the consumer could
file a complaint with the IRS stating the basis for his complaint.




94

In the final analysis, however, effective enforcement depended on the
advance notification, reporting, and spot-check system, which permitted the
authorities to analyze cost and profit data.
EXTENSION OF THE STABILIZATION AUTHORITY
The Economic Stabilization Act of 1970—the legal basis for the freeze
and Phase II control programs—was scheduled to expire at the end of
April 1972. In response to a Presidential request, the Congress extended the
Act to April 1973. Extension of this authority provides sufficient continuity
and duration of the stabilization program to permit it to succeed. In extending the Act, however, the Congress substantially amended it, and
some provisions of these amendments may significantly modify certain policies developed under the initial economic stabilization program. Under the
revised Act:
1. Wage and salary increases which were scheduled to take effect after the
freeze according to contracts entered into before August 15, 1971, were to be
paid unless "unreasonably inconsistent" with Pay Board standards.
2. The President was directed to take action to permit wage and salary
increases which were scheduled to take effect during the freeze according
to contracts negotiated prior to the freeze, but not paid because of the
freeze, to be paid retroactively unless "unreasonably inconsistent" with
Pay Board standards.
3. The President was directed to take action to require the retroactive
payment of wage and salary increases provided for by law or contract prior
to August 15, 1971, where prices had been advanced, productivity increased,
taxes had been raised, appropriations had been made, or funds had otherwise been raised or provided for in order to cover such increases, regardless
of Pay Board standards.
4. Employer contributions to pensions, profit-sharing, annuities, and savings plans qualified under the Internal Revenue Code, as well as contributions to group insurance and disability and health plans were not to be
included in the definition of "wages and salaries" for control purposes unless
they were "unreasonably inconsistent" with standards for wages, salaries, and
prices.
5. Wage increases to any individual whose earnings were substandard or
who was a member of the working poor were not to be limited in any manner,
until such time as his earnings were no longer substandard or until he was no
longer a member of the working poor.
ASSESSMENT
The Economic Stabilization Act requires this Report to give "an assessment of the progress attained in achieving the purposes of this title." As
stated in the Act, the aims are "to stabilize the economy, reduce inflation,
minimize unemployment, improve the Nation's competitive position in
world trade, and protect the purchasing power of the dollar."




95

These purposes cannot be achieved by operations under the Economic
Stabilization Act alone. The freeze and Phase II contribute to their attainment as part of a combined program which also includes fiscal and monetary measures, exchange rate readjustment, and trade measures. The relation
of the wage-price controls to the rest of the package is important. If
monetary and fiscal policy keep the growth of demand moderate, the price
and wage controls can bring about more quickly and surely the lower rate
of inflation that competitive forces would cause in such circumstances. But
if demand is allowed to grow excessively, the price and wage control system
will lose its value. Correspondingly, if the presence of the price and wage
control system becomes an excuse for laxity in monetary-fiscal policy, the
system's effect on controlling inflation will be negative.
As discussed in Chapter 3, we believe that the combination of policies in
effect in 1972, including the price-wage control system, will produce substantial progress toward the goals of the Stabilization Act. The goals
may be summarized as less unemployment, less inflation, and a U.S. economy
which is more competitive in international markets. In this section of the
Report we concentrate on the contribution of the steps taken under the
Economic Stabilization Act.
Evolution of Prices and Wages
In the accomplishment of its own objectives, the freeze was an unqualified
success. It had the desired shock effect on the public's inflationary psychology,
and it held the line on prices and wages, allowing time for a more flexible
and durable system to be devised and put in place. The statistical evidence
on price behavior during the freeze is presented in Tables 20, 21, and 22.
Assessment of Phase II is obviously more difficult. It has been in operation
too short a time to generate any substantial body of evidence, statistical or
other, about its effects. The data on prices and wages for December, the
latest available, are not a measure of the effectiveness of Phase II and should
not be so interpreted. A temporary period of faster than desired wage and
price increases was an inevitable byproduct of decisions made with respect
to the transition from the freeze to Phase II. Several months of experience
are required before Phase II regulations and rulings will be fully reflected in
price and wage trends. At this time, therefore, the future outcome of policies
which have only just been inaugurated is chiefly a matter of speculation. The
principal questions are: Will the standards of the Pay Board and the Price
Commission lead to the desired results? Will the standards be observed?
The standards announced by the Pay Board and the Price Commission
imply the following arithmetic: If compensation per hour of work rises by
5 / 2 percent per annum, and if output per hour of work rises by 3 percent
per annum, labor costs per unit of output will rise by approximately 2l/2 percent per annum. If prices rise in the same proportion as labor costs, which are
the largest element in total costs for the economy as a whole, then prices will
also rise by 2 / 2 percent, a rate within the range of the goal set by the CLC.




96

Pay Board Decisions
A number of important factors must be taken into account in assessing
the prospects of achieving the goal. The basic standard of the Pay Board is
a 5l/2 percent permissible pay increase. Under certain circumstances, however, existing Pay Board regulations permit increases in excess of this
average standard. One of the most important of these exceptions is the
rule that permits wage increases scheduled under existing contracts to be
granted, even if they exceed 5J4 percent, unless they are challenged by five
members of the Board or a party to the contract; in that case they will be
reviewed by the Board. If all the known deferred increases in excess of 5}4
percent that are scheduled for 1972 under major collective bargaining
situations were granted and increases arising from cost-of-living escalator
clauses were restrained by a small rise in the CPI (2 to 3 percent), they
would add about 0.25 percent to the average rate of pay increase for the
year (i.e., if the average outside of situations providing deferred increases
were 5.5 percent and scheduled deferred increases were all granted, the
average rise in hourly wages for all private sector workers would be about
5.75 percent). The business members of the Pay Board have indicated their
intention to challenge all deferred increases in excess of 7 percent. If all
known deferred increases that are in excess of 7 percent were limited to 7
percent, then deferred increases would add a little more than 0.1 percent to
the average rate of wage increase in 1972.
The Pay Board rules also permit increases in excess of 5l/2 percent if they
are necessary to bring the cumulative increase during the last 3 years
to 7 percent a year, or to preserve certain limited traditional relationships
with other wages, or to attract labor in shortage situations. Pay increases
allowed under any or all of these exceptions may not exceed 7 percent
(that is, V/2 percent above the general standard) and the 3-year catchup
provision expires on March 31, 1972. While the direct impact on increases
in compensation for the entire economy of these exceptions probably will
be small, their impact through tandem wage relations and relative wage
pressures could be significant.
As this Report is written, the Cost of Living Council has not yet issued
an interpretation of the terms of the Economic Stabilization Act which excludes from control substandard wages and wages of the "working poor."
Neither has the Pay Board interpreted the exclusion of increases in certain
fringe benefits unless they are "unreasonably inconsistent with the standards
for wage, salary, and price increases."
The foregoing are all provisions of the regulations which would permit
wage increases to exceed 5 ]/% percent in certain circumstances. Moreover,
even if no particular wage rate rose by more than 5^4 percent, the average
compensation per hour of work could rise by more than that percentage
because of increased overtime or a more than average increase in employment in sectors where wage rates are above the average. Both of these causes
tend to operate in a period of economic expansion such as is envisaged for




97

1972. In addition, labor costs per hour of work will rise slightly in 1972
from an increase in employers' Social Security contributions arising from
an increase in the taxable earnings base.
On the other hand, and this point is most important, the standards of
the Pay Board are only the standards of permitted wage increases, not the
standards of required wage increases. Certainly in the conditions of 1972,
when labor shortages will be highly infrequent, we should expect many
wage increases to be below the normally permissible amount. In 1970, when
the average wage increase in large union contracts was 8.8 percent, 22 percent of all the workers covered by such contracts received increases below
5 percent. If in 1972 it develops that 5J/2 percent is the standard, or most
common, wage increase, there will be many increases below that, including
many instances of no wage increase at all. Some support of this expectation
may be found in the fact that several of the pay increases approved thus far
by the Pay Board have been significantly below the standard.
Our expectation is that the combination of the Pay Board rules and the
natural forces at work will, after the initial post-freeze bubble, hold the
rate of increase of compensation per hour close to 5j/i percent. Certainly the
rules themselves contain nothing which makes this rate clearly unobtainable. However, the course of events and decisions will have to be closely
observed to see what wage outcome is in fact being generated by the system.
Unit Costs
The simple arithmetic outlined above assumed that output per hour
of work in the private economy would rise by 3 percent per annum, which
is about the average rate of the post-World War II period. The rise of productivity was below average in 1969 and 1970 but faster in 1971; it could
reasonably be expected to be even higher in 1972, since the rate of increase
in productivity commonly exceeds the historical average in years of strong
expansion. One reason is the same as that which makes the rate of increase
of average compensation relatively high—a shift of employment and output
to industries with above-average productivity and wages.
Thus it seems not inconsistent with the existing rules that the rate of
increase of labor cost per unit of output should be in the range of 2 to 3
percent. Other costs will also be taken into account in the price ceiling
formula—notably depreciation costs, indirect business taxes and interest.
The anticipated rate of increase of these nonlabor costs combined in 1972
would probably not be so large as to force the rate of increase of total costs
per unit of output outside of the 2- to 3-percent range.
Price Commission Decisions
Whether the average behavior of prices will, in fact, approximately follow the behavior of unit costs is an important question. Under the general
rules of the Price Commission, price increases are permitted in proportion
to cost increases. However, there are several circumstances in which permitted price increases may be either larger or smaller than actual cost
increases.




98

1. Prices may not be raised as much as costs if the effect would be to raise
the net profit margin above that of the best two of the past 3 years.
2. The Price Commission will not automatically recognize all cost increases in calculating "allowable cost" for determining permitted price
increases.
3. The price regulations for wholesale and retail trade do not permit such
firms to pass on cost increases except increases in the costs of purchased
goods.
4. The operation of the term limit principle may result in a firm's
acceptance of a smaller average permitted price increase than its costs would
justify in order to qualify for use of simpler and more flexible procedures.
5. If it is necessary to use industrywide trend estimates of productivity,
in the absence of other information, in projecting costs, permitted price
increases will turn out to be larger or smaller than actual cost increases
where the actual productivity increase is larger or smaller than the estimate used. In a period when actual productivity rises may be exceeding the
trend, this would mean price rises exceeding cost rises, on the average, but
this effect would be limited by the profit margin ceiling.
6. As a result of specific exemptions by the CLC or the statute, items in
the CPI comprising 21 percent of its total weight are not controlled by the
Price Commission.
7. Public utilities may be granted above-standard rate increases where
necessary to meet essential service demands.
8. Exceptions from the general cost-justification rule have been provided
for firms with losses or very low earnings.
9. If costs decline, the system does not require price reduction unless the
"windfall profit" situation is encountered.
In the foregoing circumstances, and possibly others, legally permitted price
increases may be greater or less than cost increases. The net of all this is
impossible to estimate. Without more experience no more can be said than
that the rules and procedures do not seem inconsistent with permitted price
increases coming out on the average fairly close to permitted cost increases.
The actual behavior of prices will be determined not only by what the
Price Commission permits but also by what the market permits. The limitation of the market, including competition by firms with relatively small cost
increases, will work in the direction of holding price increases below those
legally permitted.
Although much remains to be seen, a reasonable judgment at this time is
that the standards so far promulgated, applied in the context of stronglyrising productivity without excess demand, are probably consistent with
achievement of the anti-inflation goal for the end of 1972. This is not, of
course, inconsistent with the expected bulge of prices in the early part of
the year as the transition from the freeze is completed. The longer-run effect
of the present standards will depend on specific policy decisions and interpretations by the control authorities, as well as on the cooperation of business
and labor. And the outcome of the system as a whole will depend on the




99

ability to amend the rules if it should appear that the existing rules are not
leading to the desired end.
Compliance
A further question which must be asked is whether the rules of the system
are likely to be observed by businesses, landlords, and unions. In fact, the
question is twofold: Whether the rules will be overtly defied, and whether
they will be covertly evaded. This issue also allows only a judgment
on the basis of limited experience. Overt defiance seems unlikely, given
the extensive support for the system which seems to prevail among the public
and the legal sanctions provided by the Economic Stabilization Act. Evasion
may be a greater problem. A control system is imposed upon millions of
economic units by an administrative staff of 3,000 or 4,000. Whether control
measures can succeed will depend upon three things:
(a) The continued belief of the American people that compliance with
the program is essential to the national interest;
(b) The ability of the managers of the system to devise self-executing
rules;
(c) The judgment of the Cost of Living Council in excluding from the
system, at the appropriate time, sectors of the economy which do not add
greatly to inflation but make important inroads on the resources of the
control system. In mid-January, the CLC moved along this path by exempting from coverage all retailers with annual volume of less than $100,000
and, under certain circumstances, rental units owned by individuals with
fewer than four such units. Exclusion of these numerous small units from
coverage will permit the administrators of the controls system to focus their
efforts and resources on large economic units which have a far greater impact on markets and whose competition will in turn limit price increases by
the uncovered units.
On the basis of the experience so far, we believe that the program will
help achieve the economy's transition to a situation in which reasonable
price stability can be expected without controls. The outcome will depend in
large part upon decisions made, and still to be made, by the Cost of Living
Council, the Pay Board, and the Price Commission. However, it will depend
even more upon the support and self-restraint of the American people. This
is the inescapable character of the system.

CHAPTER 3

Outlook and Policy

I

N THE SUMMER OF 1971 the American economy was beset by a conflict among four objectives—faster growth, higher employment, greater
price stability, and a more balanced external position. The danger was that
steps to speed up growth and boost employment by expanding demand would
worsen both the inflation and the balance-of-payments deficit.
The steps initiated on August 15 greatly increased the possibility of simultaneous progress on all four fronts. The price and wage control system has
provided more room for expanding growth and employment even while inflation and inflationary expectations are being reduced. The realignment of
exchange rates promises an improvement of the U.S. external position even
while the domestic economy is expanding. The measures taken last year did
not eliminate potential conflicts among these goals. Expansive measures must
still be moderated by concern with both inflation and the balance of payments. But the area of consistency among the objectives has been greatly
widened.
At the end of 1971 we were already seeing more rapid growth of output
and employment and a lower rate of inflation. During 1972 we expect continued economic expansion which will reduce the unemployment rate significantly. The lower rate of inflation should be more durable by the end of
1972, after a longer period of greater price stability. Progress should have
been made toward a stronger external position.
The U.S. economy will expand substantially in 1972. All major components of domestic demand will increase and the aggregate demand for goods
and services will rise by about $100 billion to around $1,145 billion. This is an
increase of 9^2 percent over the level of GNP in 1971. The real increase
will be around 6 percent while the implied increase in the GNP price
deflator is around 3J4 percent. This is compatible with the interim objective
of an inflation rate of 2 to 3 percent by the end of 1972.
There are several reasons for expecting that the forecast pace of expansion will be realized. In the fourth quarter of 1971 real output had already
begun to rise much more rapidly than in the 2 preceding quarters. Except
for a decline in net exports all sectors of demand rose in the fourth quarter.
A second reason is that fiscal and monetary policy has become more
expansionary. Third, the existence of price and wage controls will reduce the
pressure both of inflation and of inflationary expectations. This permits fiscal




101

and monetary policy to exert a more expansive thrust than was prudent
earlier when the inflation objective was more vulnerable. It has also strengthened consumer confidence and should strengthen consumer spending.
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1971
Preliminary data show that GNP rose by about $20 billion in the fourth
quarter of 1971, or at an annual rate of 7.7 percent. Most prices were subject
to the freeze during the first half of the quarter and to Phase II controls
thereafter, and the GNP price deflator rose at the very low rate of 1.5 percent per annum. Real GNP expanded at an annual rate of 6.1 percent. Manufacturing production, which had declined from May to August, rose from
the third quarter to the fourth at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.5
percent.
Rises in real economic activity were accompanied by strong increases in
employment and productivity. Civilian nonagricultural employment rose
more than 700,000 from the third to the fourth quarter, the average workweek lengthened by 0.3 hours and, in the private nonfarm sector, output per
man-hour rose at an annual rate of nearly 5 percent. As a result of the strong
productivity gain, unit labor costs showed their smallest increase since late
1965. Because the rise in the labor force was very large, the unemployment
rate was virtually unchanged.
Government purchases of goods and services accounted for $7 billion of
the total $20 billion rise in demand in the fourth quarter. Of this, $3 billion represented a rise in Federal purchases. This.was the largest increase
in Federal purchases since the first quarter of 1967; it was attributable to
larger defense outlays, partly to cover the volunteer army program, and to
increased outlays for agricultural price supports.
Investment expenditures also rose in the fourth quarter. Fleet sales of
cars were very strong, as were purchases of trucks. New orders for producers'
capital equipment averaged 4 54 percent higher during September to
November than in the 3 preceding months. Housing production in the fourth
quarter continued to show great strength; starts in December reached a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.5 million units, bringing the average
rate for the quarter to 2.3 million units. Investment in business inventories,
which had declined by $1 billion in the preceding quarter, rose by
$2 billion.
The New Economic Policy induced a sharp rise in automobile sales. Prior
to the August 15 announcement, sales of domestic-type new cars were running
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 8 million units. In September,
sales rose to a rate of 10.8 million and in October to 10.0 million; the rate fell
noticeably after mid-November when the price freeze ended. For the fourth
quarter as a whole, sales were not greatly different from the third quarter
rate, but the rate from September through December was 17 percent higher
than the average for the 3 months immediately preceding the NEP. Some
of the early rise was at the expense of foreign car sales and subsequent
domestic sales.




102

THE OUTLOOK FOR 1972
The outlook for each of the major components of expenditures on GNP
in 1972 is discussed below.
Business Fixed Investment
Business fixed investment in 1972 will rise significantly for the first time
since 1969. The Department of Commerce-SEC survey taken in November and December indicates plans for a 9-percent increase over 1971 in
outlays for new plant and equipment. The survey shows stronger than
average spending intentions for nonmianufacturing firms, especially airlines,
electric and gas utilities, and communications companies. For the nonmanufacturing segment as a whole the anticipations data show that capital outlays will rise by 12 percent in 1972. However, the manufacturing sector,
which was utilizing capacity at a relatively low level in the fourth quarter,
expects capital outlays in 1972 to be only 4 percent above the 1971 level.
Business should have little difficulty in financing this year's planned investment. With rising output, aggregate profits are expected to show a sizable
advance and retained earnings should rise significantly. The revised regulations on depreciation and the 7-percent job development credit will increase
after-tax corporate cash flow by an additional $2.5 billion.
Those components of business fixed investment not included in the plant
and equipment survey are likely to rise as well, but at a lower rate than
capital outlays included in the Commerce-SEC survey. The overall increase
in total business fixed investment is estimated to be around 8 percent on a
year-to-year basis.

Inventory Investment
The level of business inventories has changed relatively little over the
past 2 years and the ratio of stocks to sales has fallen. Although inventories
held by wholesalers were on the high side in late 1971, inventories held by
manufacturers and retailers were lower relative to sales than at any time
since the fall of 1968. With favorable sales prospects following the sizable increase in real output in the fourth quarter, business investment in inventories
should show a strong increase in 1972. The expected expansion of defenserelated ordering should also add to the demand for inventories. Inventory
accumulation for the year as a whole is expected to be around $8 billion.
Residential Construction
The total number of private housing starts in 1972 is expected to be 2.2
million units. Within this total, single-family units are expected to be much
stronger than starts of multifamily units. This shift from multifamily to
single-family units will strengthen total residential outlays in 1972, which
are expected to exceed 1971 by 15 percent or more.




103

In early 1972 market interest rates continued the declines which began
in 1971 and financial intermediaries continued to enjoy heavy inflows of
new deposits. These developments provided increased funds for home mortgages and induced a decline in mortgage interest rates. The outlook for the
remainder of 1972 is that the availability and cost of mortgage funds will
remain at levels that would be unlikely to limit the expansion forecast for
the housing sector.
The Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation will continue their mortgage purchase
programs and secondary market activities, and the Government National
Mortgage Association (GNMA) will continue guaranteeing mortgagebacked pass-through securities and standard mortgage-backed bonds. At
present, GNMA's insured-mortgage market support operation in conjunction
with FNMA is not operating because mortgage market rates have declined
relative to the FHA ceiling rate. If these conditions change, the coordinated
FNMA-GNMA purchase plan will be automatically resumed, with likely
support from other Federal agencies as well.
Net Exports
In 1971 U.S. net exports of goods and services declined from a level of
$4.7 billion in the first quarter to minus $2.0 billion in the final quarter of the
year. The outlook for net exports in 1972 is subject to a wider margin of
uncertainty than usual. Underlying factors point to a rise in net exports
within the year. The substantial realignment of the dollar's exchange rate
relative to other major currencies will improve the relative competitive
position of U.S. goods and services. The abatement of inflation in the
United States and the increase in productivity that is expected will reinforce
the effects of realignment. While the influence of these positive factors is
clear, both the magnitude and timing of the improvement they will bring
are difficult to specify. In addition there are two short-run factors in
1972 which can be expected to affect net exports adversely. The U.S.
economy will be expanding faster than it has in several years. At the
same time the rate of expansion in several major markets abroad will be
relatively low. Also, the initial effects of currency realignment may actually
be perverse because import contracts predating the change will entail higher
dollar outlays. Because of these factors, it will be some months before U.S.
net exports of goods and services are positive once again. The average for
the year as a whole will probably be close to zero.
Government Purchases of Goods and Services
Government purchases at all levels will constitute a highly expansive
force for economic activity in 1972. Total purchases are expected to rise
11 percent, with Federal purchases increasing by 9 percent and State and




104

local purchases by 12 percent. The increase in State and local purchases reflects the proposed revenue-sharing program of the Federal Government and
the continuing favorable conditions in credit markets.
Federal expenditures are discussed in more detail in the subsequent section
on fiscal policy.
Personal Consumption Expenditures
The expectations just outlined show that the demand for GNP, other
than consumption, in the aggregate will rise by around 12 percent between
1971 and 1972. Such a rise by itself should produce significant increases in
employment. In spite of the slower rate of increase in wage rates expected as
a result of wage and price controls, total payrolls will also increase significantly. The growth in earned income will be augmented by increases in
Social Security benefits. In addition, as a result of the high rate of personal
saving during the past 2 years, the financial position of consumers as measured by their liquid asset holdings is extremely strong. The impact of these
financial factors on consumer expenditures will, of course, depend on changes
in the level of consumer confidence.
In 1971 consumers increased their spending by 7.5 percent over 1970.
They also maintained their rate of saving out of disposable income in the
neighborhood of 8 percent. The ratio of saving to disposable income observed
in these 2 years is significantly higher than the 6 percent rate for the period
1960 to 1969. While this might represent a shift in consumer preferences
for, say, liquid assets, it has also been interpreted by some as being due, at
least in part, to the confidence factor, which tends to decline when the rate
of unemployment and the pace of inflation are high.
There is already evidence that consumer confidence has improved since
last summer. The expectation is that it will improve further as employment
increases and the rates of unemployment and inflation decline. If the reasoning which relates the saving rate to the confidence factor is correct,
consumer spending will rise at a faster rate than the rise in disposable income.
However, the forecast for consumer spending projected in this Report does
not assume that consumers in 1972 will reduce the high rate of saving that
prevailed in 1970 and 1971. In the first place, clear evidence of a sustained
drop in the saving rate is not yet available. Second, the tax cuts which
consumers will enjoy in the first half of 1972 and the increase in transfer payments scheduled for midyear will tend to keep the saving rate high because
the response of spending to such increases in income is typically delayed.
Consumer spending is expected to rise by around 8 percent in 1972.
Together with the forecast for nonconsumption expenditures the total
expected rise in GNP adds to about $100 billion.

Fiscal and Monetary Policy
Fiscal policy will make a major contribution to the achievement of an
expansive economy in 1972. Federal expenditures on the national income
accounts (NIA) basis are expected to total $251 billion in calendar 1972,
a rise of $29 billion, or 13 percent over calendar 1971. A substantial part
of the rise will occur during the first half of calendar 1972.
Federal purchases of goods and services, which had been declining gradually since 1968, have already begun to rise. The larger purchase figures
reflect previously announced increases in military pay, the Federal pay increase in January 1972, and additional increases in purchases. The rise in
defense purchases would reverse a fairly steady trend from the fourth
quarter of 1968 to the third quarter of 1971, during which the rate of defense
spending measured in current dollars declined by about 12 percent and in
constant dollars, 27 percent. These expenditures are scheduled to rise in
1972. In addition, there is a sharp increase in Federal grants to State and
local governments, which reflects the new revenue-sharing proposals of the
Administration as well as proposed increases in welfare grants to States.
Tax cuts will also provide considerable stimulus in 1972. From calendar
1971 to 1972 the net reduction in tax receipts due to changes in tax laws and
regulations is estimated at $3.7 billion on an NIA basis. The tax reductions are
estimated at $8.9 billion, but these are partly offset by increases in the social
security base starting in January 1972. Most of the economic impact of
these social security tax increases will not be realized until the second half of
1972; consequently, these tax increases should not depress consumer spending significantly in 1972.
In both 1971 and 1972 receipts are considerably less than expenditures,
primarily because the economy in these years is below its full potential. For
calendar 1972 NIA receipts are estimated to be $215 billion and NIA expenditures $251 billion. Thus, the projected deficit for calendar year 1972
is $36 billion on an NIA basis compared to $23 billion in 1971. This expansion of the deficit as computed on the forecast path for the economy indicates
that the 1972 fiscal policy is stimulative. The faster rise of expenditures than
receipts will increase demand either by direct government purchases or by
bolstering private incomes and private demand. The unified budget, measured on a full-employment basis, moves from a surplus of $4.9 billion in fiscal
year 1971 to a deficit of $8.1 billion in fiscal 1972. The budget on the same
basis returns to balance in fiscal year 1973.
The steady, strong expansion we seek and expect will require support
from monetary policy. An abundant supply of money and other liquid assets,
and favorable conditions in money markets, should encourage an expansion
of outlays by consumers, businesses, and State and local governments. This
process would involve a more rapid rise of currency and demand deposits
than occurred in the second half of 1971. Steps have already been taken by
the Federal Reserve System to start this acceleration.




106

Major Uncertainties
The Council's projection for aggregate demand for 1972 falls within the
fairly narrow range of projections made by private organizations and individuals. Nonetheless, there are important uncertainties which could produce a
level of economic activity either higher or lower than the level forecast.
The plans for fiscal expansion require action by Congress, which might be
slower in coming than has been assumed. Expansive policies can be
thwarted if consumers decide to increase their already high saving rate.
The expected adjustment of U.S. net exports might involve a longer lag
than we have posited. The change in business inventory policy may not
turn out to be as substantial or as rapid as the path assumed in the forecast.
On the other side there is a good possibility that consumers will increase
their rate of spending faster than the projected rise in disposable income.
This would have important secondary benefits in other sectors—notably in
business investment outlays and business demands for inventory.
GNP forecasts made by the Council have been qualified in the past by the
caveat that they should be viewed as the midpoint of a range of plus or minus
$5 billion around the forecast. When GNP was $500 billion, this was the
equivalent of a band of uncertainty of ± 1 percent. The equivalent band
of uncertainty for today's larger numbers would be ± $10 billion.
PRICES AND PRICE-WAGE POLICY
The rate of inflation in 1972 (as measured by the GNP price deflator)
is expected to fall to about 3J4 percent, the lowest year-to-year change since
1967. Toward the end of the year the rate of price change is expected to be
2-3 percent per annum.
The estimate made here of the rate of inflation during 1972 assumes two
things. First, it assumes a growth of money demand that is strong and steady
but not so exuberant that significant shortages of products or labor would be
created if price and wage increases were held to the forecast path. Second,
it assumes that the price-wage control system, given such demand conditions,
will be of the character, force, and duration needed to maintain that path.
The Administration's policy is to create and maintain both of these conditions. Earlier in this chapter we have described the demand conditions we
foresee for 1972 and the fiscal and monetary policies expected to help bring
them about. In Chapter 2 we described the existing state of the price-wage
control system. We expressed the view there that the existing system of
standards and procedures is consistent with the achievement of the antiinflationary goals the Administration has laid out, barring difficulties not now
foreseen. The important point, however, is that the system will be adapted
as necessary to achieve the goal.
The control system will be retained as long as is necessary to reach its
goal—which is a condition of the economy in which we can have a significantly lower rate of inflation without controls than we were experiencing
in the first part of 1971. Speculation that the Administration will abandon




107

the controls prematurely—out of fatigue, ideological aversion, or other
causes—is groundless. Having embarked upon this course the Administration has no intention of departing from it in circumstances where it would
risk either resumption of inflation or the need to reimpose the controls.
The basic premise of the price-wage control system is that the inflation
of 1970 and 1971 was the result of expectations, contracts, and patterns of
behavior built up during the earlier period, beginning in 1965, when there
was an inflationary excess of demand. Since there is no longer an excess of
demand, the rate of inflation will subside permanently when this residue
of the previous excess is removed. The purpose of the control system is
to give the country a period of enforced stability in which expectations,
contracts, and behavior will become adapted to the fact that rapid inflation
is no longer the prospective condition of American life. When that happens
controls can be eliminated.
How long that will take no one can say. The conditions now existing and
the policies in operation are unprecedented. The only sensible course is to
observe the behavior of the economy closely and to avoid commitment to
either a minimum or a maximum duration of controls.
During the control period there will be decisions to exclude from coverage one or another sector of the economy, as has recently been done for
retail stores with less than $100,000 annual sales and single-family houses and
apartments with two to four units under certain conditions. Such exclusions should not be interpreted as signs of the weakening of the system or
portents of its early termination. They may, in fact, make the system
stronger and more durable by permitting the administrative effort to be concentrated on the sectors most significant for inflation. This is especially true
when, as is often the case, price increases in the excluded sector would be
effectively limited by competition from the parts of the economy that
remain under legal control.
EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT
Our estimate implies an increase of 6 percent in real GNP between 1971
and 1972. This is about the rate of increase achieved in the fourth quarter
of 1971.
There is no easy way to separate the forecast rate of real growth into employment and productivity gains. Clearly, it should yield substantial increases in both. The extent to which the employment gains will reduce the
unemployment rate depends on the size of the increase in the labor force.
It is estimated that the unemployment rate should decline from the 6 percent
level of December 1971 to the neighborhood of 5 percent by the end of 1972.
Reduction of the unemployment rate in 1972 is a primary objective of this
year's economic policy. It is to this end that the Government is pursuing a
highly expansive fiscal policy. And it is in large part to this end that prices
and wages are controlled, so that the expansion of demand will generate
more jobs, not more inflation.




108

Concern with unemployment is also the primary motivation behind a large
variety of other Government efforts, more specialized in their impact but
nevertheless critical for achieving full employment. Many of these are now
focused on the problems arising in the transition from high levels of military
and civilian employment in national defense.
The number of male Vietnam era veterans in the civilian population has
increased by over 1.3 million over the last 2 years (Table 24). In June 1971,
the President launched a new program designed to aid veterans in the job
market. As part of this coordinated program, Project Transition, a predischarge counseling, training, and placement program, was expanded and
extended overseas. Training opportunities for veterans under existing manpower programs were increased, additional veterans' employment counselors
(many of them veterans) were added to the Employment Service and, perhaps most importantly, a new regulation which requires all Federal contractors to list job openings with the Employment Service should provide
veterans with opportunities to apply for a much wider selection of jobs. A
coordinated effort was also launched in the private sector. During the year
over 100 Job Fairs, which bring veterans and potential employers together,
were sponsored by the Jobs for Veterans Committee in cooperation with the
National Alliance of Businessmen, which also plans to place 100,000 veterans in jobs by June 1972. These efforts resulted in an estimated 320,000
direct job placements between June and October. Civilian employment of
Vietnam era veterans rose by 500,000 over the year (Table 24).
When unemployment is high, the development of additional jobs in
areas of unmet public needs is possible and desirable. Initiation of the Public
Employment program, which was authorized by the Emergency Employment Act of 1971, was a major step forward in this area. This Federal program, which temporarily subsidizes most of the cost of adding new employees

to State and local government payrolls, is designed both to meet the need
for improved public services and to provide transitional career employment
opportunities for jobless workers, especially veterans and the disadvantaged.
At year's end, funds had been provided for about 128,000 positions, and
about three-fifths of the jobs had been filled.
Retraining and job-finding services for engineers, scientists, and technicians, previously employed in defense or space efforts were greatly increased
in 1970-71 under the new Technology Mobilization and Reemployment program and related programs. These will be expanded further in 1972.
The realignment of defense expenditures after 1968 has had substantial
adverse impact on some communities whose economies depend on defenserelated activities. The Federal Government operates a continuing community aid program, which is under the jurisdiction of the Inter-Agency
Economic Adjustment Committee (chaired by the Secretary of Defense and
comprised of policy-level personnel drawn from all major domestic agencies).
The Committee's mission is to provide organized aid in the transition from a
defense-based local economy to a balanced local economy. To carry out its
responsibilities, the Committee ensures that all Federal Government services and facilities are focused on viable economic adjustment plans designed
in the local communities. On various occasions, the Committee working
through a local community task force has aided in the adjustment process
by the transfer of surplus Federal property, initiation or expansion of manpower training programs and related social services, small business loans,
feasibility studies, and public facilities grants. Thus far 44 communities in 22
States and Puerto Rico have been aided by this ongoing program.
One of the traditional areas of Government action in labor markets is
assistance to the rapid and inexpensive exchange of information between
those seeking work and those seeking workers. For many years, the Government has provided job information and direct placement services through
the U.S. Employment Service, a cooperative Federal-State program.
This information-placement effort has been and will continue to be improved by increasing the amount and reliability of data (especially increased
information on job vacancies) by the use of modern data processing
techniques (computerized listings of job openings, called "Job Banks") to
cover ever-larger market areas, and by instituting flexible special placement
programs focused on particular groups or areas most affected by special
unemployment problems.
Direct governmental investments in training programs of various types
are being reoriented to put special emphasis on training that will hasten the
transition to career employment. These programs are intended to assist the
unemployed and underemployed by developing their job skills so that they
may qualify for primary jobs that provide adequate incomes and increased
output. Manpower training programs enhance the flexibility and mobility




110

of the workforce, and provide disadvantaged workers with opportunities to
improve their well-being. Although already constructive, these manpower
programs can be greatly improved by making them more flexible, innovative,
and most importantly, responsive to local conditions and needs. This could
be accomplished by passage and implementation of the President's proposed
Manpower Revenue Sharing Act, which is now under consideration by the
Congress. This Act would (1) consolidate most manpower-type programs
under a single large-scale program, (2) eliminate most narrowly-targeted
categorical grants, (3) shift detailed program decisionmaking from Washington, D.C., to State and local governmental units, and (4) increase training
investments.
INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE LONG RUN
We believe that the combination of the steady growth of demand, the
temporary price-wage control system, and the manpower programs now in
effect will make possible an unemployment rate much lower than the 6
percent we were experiencing in 1971 and an inflation rate without controls
much lower than the 4 to 5 percent we were experiencing before the freeze.
This will not, of course, be the end of either the inflation problem or the
unemployment problem. The remaining problems can be summarized in
two questions:
1. How can we avoid in the future the kind of inflationary surge of
demand that occurred after 1965 and which determined the unique features
of the economic problem with which the Nation has been wrestling for the
past 3 years?
2. Even if such surges of demand are avoided, will the economy be left
persistently with unsatisfactorily high unemployment, or unsatisfactorily
high inflation, or both—even though both may be lower than at their 1970
or 1971 peaks? If so, what can be done about it?
THE CONTROL OF DEMAND
With respect to the first of these questions probably the greatest contribution would be to keep alive the memory of our recent experience. We have
now come to see more vividly than ever before how long and painful is the
effort to halt the inflationary process once it has been let loose. The avoidance of inflation is always, of course, an objective of national policy, and
was an objective in 1965-66 when the present episode began. But this objective may not get its proper weight because of failure to foresee the losses
of output and employment that will later be entailed in ending the inflation. Remembering the experience of 1969-71 should help to correct this
error.
Adherence to the principle of keeping expenditures that would be made
at full employment within the level of the receipts that would be yielded




111

by the existing tax system under conditions of full employment would
contribute to the avoidance of inflationary surges of demand. Certainly the
shift of the budget position from approximate balance at full employment
in fiscal 1965 to a large full-employment deficit in fiscal 1968 was a major
cause of the current inflation. There are rare circumstances in which a
deficit or surplus at full employment may be unavoidable or even appropriate
economic policy. But in general more reliable results will be achieved from
minimizing such departures than from following any of the alternative
courses—trying to balance the actual budget continuously, disregarding
budget balance, or making annual ad hoc decisions about the proper size of
the deficit or surplus. Continuous balancing of the actual budget would require the perverse action of increasing expenditures or cutting tax rates
when the private economy was booming and generating a large amount of
tax revenue. Disregarding the budget balance rule would leave the enormous
impact of the budget a random and destabilizing force on the economy. And
a policy of ad hoc decisions about deficits or surplus is exposed to the
political bias in favor of spending and deficits.
A similar precept of steadiness with respect to monetary policy would also
help to avoid inflationary excesses of demand. The problem is that there
is no single measure or objective combination of measures of monetary
policy that is a completely satisfactory or completely superior measure of
monetary policy by which a principle of steadiness could be calibrated.
Judgment must be exercised. However, there is probably a presumption
against extreme values or variations of the rate of change of narrowlydefined money, i.e., currency plus demand deposits.
The problems of managing fiscal policy or monetary policy or both have
apparently been underestimated. It may well be that more has been
promised than can be delivered with existing knowledge and instruments.
Certainly there is need for much additional research. But if the question is not one of keeping the economy on a narrowly-defined path
but one of avoiding violent aberrations like the one that began in 1965,
our tools are probably adequate, and the problem is more the national will
than the techniques of economics and economic policy.
Two years ago in this Report we recommended the establishment of a
Commission to study the structure of financial institutions in the United
States. One reason for this study, although not the primary one, was to
see if ways could be found to make the financial structure a better vehicle
for transmitting monetary policy into the economy. A distinguished group
of citizens has now completed and published this study, which will be reviewed by this Administration and others to determine what action should
be taken on its recommendations.
VIEWS OF THE INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM
The persistence of a combination of high unemployment and rapid inflation for a longer period in 1970 and 1971 than seemed consistent with




112

earlier experience appeared to support the view that inflation or unemployment or both had become structural features of the American economy.
This is not the only possible explanation of the developments of 1970-71.
The preceding inflation had been exceptionally long and strong. Estimates
of the likely duration of the disinflationary process based on extrapolations
from milder inflations might simply have been wrong, without implying
that there was a permanent problem. Nevertheless, even if a great deal of
weight is properly placed, as we think it should be, on the specific inflationary residue of the 1965-68 history, the hypothesis of a more durable
problem still requires examination.
The problem might take one or more of three forms:
(a) A tendency to an unsatisfactorily high rate of inflation which persists
over a long period of time and is impervious to variations in the rate of
unemployment, so that the tendency cannot be eradicated by any feasible
acceptance of unemployment.
(b) A tendency to an unsatisfactorily high rate of unemployment which
persists over a long period and which is only temporarily influenced by increasing aggregate demand at an inflationary rate.
(c) A persistently unsatisfactory "trade-off" between inflation and unemployment such that it is permanently possible to have less inflation by
accepting more unemployment, and vice versa, but with no combination
possible that would be regarded as satisfactory.
Listing these possible problems does not imply that they exist. Nor would
their existence imply any particular solution. Nevertheless the questions
raised are obviously highly relevant to future economic policy. The Council
of Economic Advisers will be making an intensive study of them during 1972,
with the assistance of experts from other agencies of Government.
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LABOR FORCE
One subject of major significance in identifying a satisfactory combination
of employment and inflation conditions and a policy to achieve it is the
character of the labor force and the labor market.
When what later became "The Employment Act of 1946" was first being
discussed, under the title of "The Full Employment Act," there was a common notion that full employment meant zero unemployment. However,
upon consideration it became clear that a situation of zero unemployment
was not feasible, at least in a free society, nor, indeed, desirable in view of
the costs that might be involved in achieving it. Some young people just
entering the labor force, or women reentering it, or people dissatisfied with
their previous place of residence or jobs, or having lost their previous jobs
in the normal rise and fall of firms that goes on endlessly, would be in the
process of looking for work. Unless there could be instantaneous adjustments—which there could not be—there would be a number of people
between jobs even in what might be ideal conditions of the labor market.




113

This type of unemployment is frequently termed "transitional" and includes
all or part of unemployment arising from the mobility of the American population, normal market frictions, seasonal variations, and some structural
problems. In other words, it is that component of total unemployment which
would respond to an expansion of demand only at high social cost, if at all.
Efforts were made when the 1946 Act was passed and shortly thereafter
to estimate the normal size of the transitional group. This was difficult
because the country had not been at anything like peacetime full employment since 1929 and relevant data were spotty. However, estimates converged on 4 percent as the proportion of the labor force that would be
unemployed at "full" employment. This highly uncertain estimate became
solidified over the ensuing years as a result of repetition, even though the
4 percent rate was seldom achieved.
This "minimum" unemployment rate, whatever it is, would not be
expected to be stable over time. For one thing, persons of different age, sex,
school attendance, and other characteristics would presumably have different rates of transitional unemployment.
Normal differences in transitional unemployment appear to explain much
of the relatively high unemployment rates of young people and of women.
In 1971 the unemployment rate for 16-19 year-olds was 16.9 percent, compared to a rate of 3.2 percent for married males; in 1969, a year of very
tight labor markets, the rate for teenagers was 12.2 percent, compared to 1.5
percent for married males. The persistence of this large differential in both
good times and bad suggests that factors other than the lack of aggregate
demand cause the differential.
The primary activity of most teenagers is school. In October 1970, 70
percent of all 16-19 year-olds and about 55 percent of the teenage labor
force were enrolled in school. For these youngsters, summer vacations, reentering school, going in and out of training programs or college or military
service are all reasons for entering or leaving the labor force or for changing
jobs. With many of these changes some unemployment is normal and it is
not surprising that more than two-thirds of all teenage unemployment is
associated with entering or reentering the work force.
The amount of labor force turnover of adult women appears lower than
that of teenagers but greater than that of men. Because of child care
and family responsibilities, women are likely to enter and leave the work
force more frequently than men, both over the course of a year or a lifetime. By contrast adult males have a very stable attachment to the labor
force. About 83 percent of males 20 years and over are in the labor force
(96 percent of those 25-54 years) and only a trivial proportion are voluntary
part-time or part-year workers.
Differences in turnover are reflected in differences in the reasons for unemployment of the different groups. In 1971, 82 percent of all unemployed
16-19 year-olds were unemployed as a result of voluntarily leaving their
last job or of entering or reentering the labor force. The proportion of adult




114

females in this category was 58 percent, but for adult males the proportion
was only 34 percent. Job loss is the primary reason that adult males are
unemployed.
During 1971, 16-19 year-olds accounted for 25 percent of all unemployment, compared to 17 percent in 1956. The relative increase in teenage
unemployment reflects both an increase in the teenage population and an
increase in their unemployment rate. Given that work in the market is
less and less a primary activity for teenagers, their labor force turnover, and
hence their transitional level of unemployment, may have increased.
Job opportunities for teenagers may be limited by a variety of factors.
The pool of jobs available at any given time may require more experience
or education than that typically found among younger workers. Available
jobs may also require certain continuity of work (hours per week or weeks
per year) which many teenagers are unable to meet because of the conflict
with normal school hours. All these factors tend to direct teenage job
seekers into occupations which are marginally productive and where
demand may be particularly vulnerable to adverse employment effects of the
minimum wage. The rising levels and expanded coverage of the minimum
wage since the middle fifties may have been a factor in the upward drift of
the teenage unemployment rate. For this reason the Administration has urged
the provision of a lower minimum wage for teenagers to prevent any further
narrowing of job opportunities.

To the extent that these transitional unemployment problems are unique
to different ages and stages of life, the total amount of such unemployment
will depend on the proportions of the labor force represented by persons in the




115

various groups. Table 25 shows the change in the composition of the labor
force by age and sex that occurred in the past 15 years and that projected
for 1985. It also shows what the average unemployment rate would have
been or will be if the unemployment rate in each age-sex category were at
its 1956 level (1956 was selected as a base because it was a peacetime year
of high employment and low inflation). This calculation does not reflect
changes that may have occurred in the exposure of a particular age-sex
category to transitional unemployment, such as may have been caused by
lengthened school attendance, or any offsetting factors arising from increased education or more efficient labor market mechanisms. It is presented
here as an example of one of the more obvious problems of attaining full
employment in a dynamic and changing economy. The projection that
women will continue to constitute a high proportion of the labor force suggests a continuing relatively high level of transitional unemployment.
The fact that the amount of "transitional" unemployment may be rising
implies something about what can be achieved by general expansive measures
alone, although the full implication will not be known until we can observe
the behavior of unemployment in the current expansion. However, these
developments also imply the need to do more directly about transitional
unemployment. In fact, over the past 10 years Federal efforts to deal with
this problem have increased substantially, and this Administration has
supported intensification and improvement of these efforts.

CHAPTER 4

Effective Use of Resources

W

HILE PROGRAMS to deal with the problems of inflation, expansion,
and the balance of payments captured the spotlight during 1971,
measures to assure the efficient use of our resources and productive capability
continued to be an important feature of economic policy. Two conditions
must be met if the performance of the U.S. economy is to match the rising
demands placed upon it: Our productive resources must be employed efficiently in producing each good or service, and the economy should produce
the combination of goods and services most preferred by society.
In many sectors of the economy the discipline of the competitive market
is enough by itself to ensure efficiency. In certain areas, however, resources
may not be allocated efficiently without at least some Government intervention. The proper nature and degree of Government intervention in such
sectors is always a central issue in economic policy. Changing circumstances
mean that Government must continually reexamine its role.
All the segments of the economy covered in this chapter are under
critical review to determine the Government's proper role. In some
instances, such as energy and transportation, certain aspects of Government regulation prevent the best use of resources. In other cases, such as
environment and pollution, the Government's role is being expanded to prevent overuse of environmental resources by other sectors of the economy.
Finally, there are sectors such as health and research and development where
the evidence suggests that Government's role should be redirected.
NATIONAL COMMISSION ON PRODUCTIVITY
Large demands will continue to be placed on the Nation's total resources
in the future. In order to respond to these demands, today's private decisions
and public policies must be formulated to foster tomorrow's productivity of
the Nation's resources.
Productivity can be denned in a variety of ways, the most common one
being real output per hour of work. This definition gives a rough measure
of how well we use our most important productive resource. A more comprehensive definition of productivity is output per unit of all resources. This
definition is more suitable for topics in this chapter because they deal with
selected adjustments that would improve the total output of goods and
services produced from our capital, labor, and natural resources.
Historically, there has been a steady improvement in productivity. Much
of this progress has been achieved through incentives within private markets.
Yet private markets do not ensure that all potential productivity gains are




117

achieved in the private sector, nor can they be expected to bring about
improved productivity of resources employed in the public sector.
Recognizing the importance of achieving improvements in productivity,
the President established the National Commission on Productivity in June
1970. The Commission is composed of representatives from industry, labor,
agriculture, the public, and Federal, State, and local governments. The
Commission makes recommendations to the President for actions to improve
productivity in the public and private sectors.
The responsibilities and duties of the Commission were substantially expanded by the Economic Stabilization Act Amendments of 1971.
During 1971 the Commission gave primary attention to four specific
aspects of productivity:
1. "Productivity Bargaining" Between Labor and Management. Such
bargaining focuses on mutually beneficial agreements that enhance labor's
productivity. The Commission believes that bargaining practices should give
greater attention to work rules, group incentives, work scheduling, job
enrichment, and other practices that can improve productivity.
2. Manpower Adjustment Policies. Improvements in productivity lead to
higher average incomes, but they can also result in dislocations for individual
workers. The Commission believes that public and private adjustment
policies should be strengthened and refined to make the human costs of
change, where they exist, less burdensome.
3. Education and Research and Development. Since productivity is closely
linked with education and with research and development, the Commission
has studied current institutional arrangements that may inhibit desirable
performance in these fields and believes that added incentives for experimentation and innovation in such arrangements would be advantageous.
4. Government Productivity. Government employment is expected to continue to grow rapidly in the future, particularly at State and local levels. The
Commission believes that greater attention should be given to improving the
productivity of government employees in order to increase efficiency and
reduce costs for this expanding service sector of the economy.
ENERGY
The growth in consumption of fuels by automobiles, electric generating
plants, homes, and factories is closely associated with increases in our material
levels of living. Historically, however, energy use has not grown as rapidly
as GNP. While real GNP (in 1958 dollars) rose from $183.5 billion in 1930
to $617.8 billion in 1965, for a compound annual growth of 3.5 percent,
energy consumption rose from 22.3 quadrillion btu's to 54.0 quadrillion btu's
during the same period, an annual growth rate of only 2.6 percent. The use
of energy per dollar of GNP (again in 1958 dollars) therefore fell from
121,500 btu's in 1930 to 87,400 in 1965.
During this same period energy was becoming cheaper relative to other
goods and services. While the price index of all goods and services (the GNP




118

deflator) rose 125 percent during this period, the wholesale price index
of fuels and electric power rose only 70 percent. Thus, although energy consumption was growing it was not growing as rapidly as GNP, and although
energy prices were rising they were not rising as fast as the prices of other
goods and services.
Since 1965, however, a sharp upturn in the energy-GNP ratio has occurred.
From 87,400 btu's used per dollar of real GNP in 1965, the number rose
to 95,600 in 1970. While output for the economy as a whole was growing
at 3.1 percent per year, energy consumption grew at 5.0 percent. This sharp
upturn in energy use was associated with a more rapid increase in prices.
Prices of fuel oil and bituminous coal, in particular, rose sharply in 1970.
These developments gave evidence of at least a short-run shift in energy
demand and prices. At the same time more fundamental changes were occurring in the domestic supply picture that were less noticeable to the typical
consumer. Between 1960 and 1969 crude oil production was steadily rising,
but the size of proved reserves actually fell in absolute terms. At current
rates of production, proved reserves declined from 12.8 years of production
in 1960 to only 9.3 years in 1969. The addition of the enormous Prudhoe
Bay field in Alaska to the 1970 statistics increased our proved reserves by
almost one-third, but this oil will not be available unless it can be transported
to market in an environmentally acceptable way.
Natural gas reserves have also been falling in recent years. Proved reserves
in 1970, including the natural gas associated with oil in the Prudhoe Bay
field, were lower than in 1967. With production of natural gas rising
at 5.4 percent per year since 1960, reserves have fallen from 20.1 years of
annual production in 1960 to 13.2 years in 1970. The importance of these
developments is underlined by the fact that domestic oil and gas contributed
almost two-thirds of our energy supply in 1970.
The accelerated growth in energy demand relative to GNP in recent years
is not expected to continue. Most observers forecast an annual average
growth in energy consumption of just over 4 percent, paralleling the expected growth in GNP. A comparison of earlier forecasts and current realities, however, suggests that any assumptions about future demand and supply
must be regarded as tentative, to be modified as new evidence becomes
available.
Future energy problems involve even more than a growing demand in
relation to supply. The Nation will not only consume more energy in
the future but will also insist that this energy be cleaner. The full social
cost of producing, transporting, and consuming energy should be counted
in decisions about how much of each kind of fuel to use. If this were done it
would result in a new pattern of fuel consumption. Natural gas, a sulfur-free
fuel, would face soaring demands, while coal consumption processes would
have to be improved to reduce harmful emissions.
Recognizing the Nation's growing energy problem, the President on
June 4, 1971, sent an energy message to Congress, the first Presidential message devoted exclusively to this subject. Some initiatives in the message




119

emphasize direct measures to increase the supply of clean energy: Development of the nuclear breeder reactor, acceleration of oil and gas leasing on
the Outer Continental Shelf, a leasing program for our oil shale and geothermal resources, expansion of our uranium enrichment capacity, and
support for other efforts in energy research and development.
Other actions included in the message will indirectly help to expand
potential supply. For example, support for developing sulfur oxide control
devices will lead to clean uses of our abundant coal resources, and a system
of planning the sites for our power plants and transmission lines will help to
reconcile the need for energy with environmental demands. The President
has also announced steps to conserve energy by requiring better insulation
on federally insured homes. To balance energy and environmental needs,
he also proposed a tax on sulfur oxide emissions to help ensure that the
full social cost of energy consumption is built into the price of energy.
Despite much discussion about an energy problem, even an "energy crisis,"
the problem is not always precisely stated. The problem is that domestic supplies of environmentally acceptable energy are becoming ever more scarce in
the face of a growing demand. This scarcity can manifest itself in three ways.
In markets where prices are permitted to equate supply and demand, upward pressures on prices may develop. In markets where prices are not permitted to rise to equate supply and demand, shortages may emerge in the
form of gaps between desired consumption and actual supply. If imports are
not restricted, there will be increased dependence on foreign sources. Because some of these sources may be insecure, the Nation will be exposed to
supply disruptions or costs incurred from domestic stockpiling to guard
against potential interruptions in imports. Depending on the market, therefore, the problem may take the form of rising prices, shortages, or reliance on
uncertain foreign supplies.
Insofar as price increases are needed to call forth supply they are a proper
response to an underlying condition of scarcity. An example would be
the worldwide increases during 1970 in the prices of heavy fuel oil, particularly the low-sulfur type. A temporary scarcity of tankers and limited
facilities for refining and desulfurization, coupled with rapidly accelerating
demand, caused the price of fuel oil to rise sharply. As tanker rates returned
to more normal levels, price declines began to occur. During the entire
episode of high prices, however, there were no cases of domestic shortages
that some had feared.
Currently a shortage does exist in the natural gas market. Wellhead prices
of gas for interstate delivery, which are regulated by the Federal Power
Commission (FPC), have not been high enough to induce a supply equal to
the growing demand. As a result not only has the demand itself been unmet,
but there have also been geographical distortions in the consumption of gas,
higher prices for competing fuels, and greater difficulty in meeting our
environmental goals.
Because gas marketed in the State in which it is produced has not been
subject to FPC price controls, producers have found it more attractive to




120

commit new reserves to intrastate markets. From 1963 to 1970., reserves earmarked for interstate markets fell by 18.4 trillion cubic feet. Comparable
statistics for intrastate commitments do not exist, but the fact that the
estimated total for proved reserves, excluding Alaska, fell by only 12.9 trillion
cubic feet suggests that intrastate commitments may actually have risen.
Although residential consumers in the East and Midwest might have been
willing to outbid intrastate buyers, they have not had the opportunity to
do so. Electric generating plants in the major gas-producing States of
Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas, which could have been designed to use
other fuels, are fueled almost entirely by natural gas. Thus, some markets
lack gas because of artificially low ceiling prices, whereas in other markets
this fuel is used excessively and its price is depressed to the level of interstate
ceiling prices.
It is sometimes argued that low ceiling prices for gas result in low prices
for competing fuels. Actually, the opposite is more likely to be true. Large
supplies of gas would tend to depress prices of both gas and competing fuels,
so that in those circumstances low gas prices would be associated with low
prices of competing fuels. But artificially low gas prices lessen supply and
create shortages. Since unmet demands for gas are transferred in part to
other fuels, the result is greater demand and higher prices for these other
fuels. The gas shortage itself therefore contributes to price increases in other
energy markets. Indeed, the sharp increases in the price of low-sulfur fuel oil
in 1970 came about partly because natural gas supplies were unable to
respond to the increased demand for clean fuels.
The Nation's gas shortage is particularly serious at this time; large
metropolitan areas badly need more gas if they are to meet air quality standards. Not only is the total supply of gas reduced by low ceiling prices, but the
available supply tends to be used disproportionately in intrastate markets
where acceptable air quality is ordinarily less difficult to achieve.
In the past 2 years the FPG has taken steps that could increase gas
supplies. New ceiling prices, substantially above the prices previously
authorized by the Commission, have been set for each of the major production areas. Weighted by area production, new wellhead ceiling prices
average about 24 cents per thousand cubic feet, compared to 18 cents for
previously authorized prices. The Commission has also issued a ruling that
small producers, who together accounted for about 13 percent of 1969
production, shall be exempt from ceiling prices.
Despite these steps toward prices that more nearly reflect the market
situation, important policy issues remain. The large interstate pipeline
companies, being unable to meet their customers' demands with domestic
natural gas and pipeline imports from Canada, are turning toward imports
of natural gas in liquefied form from overseas and to synthetic gas produced
from imported crude oil and naphtha. Although these imports would tend
to increase the supply, they cost far more than supplies from conventional
domestic sources. Prices at the refinery or vaporization plant would frequently
be $1 or more per thousand cubic feet. Delivered to the same markets,




121

domestic natural gas at new ceiling prices would cost about half that amount.
Thus, we could afford to pay significantly more for domestic gas, thereby
appreciably increasing its supply, and still have lower prices than would have
to be paid for gas from the alternative sources now being considered.
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
Environmental resources are common property: They are free for those
who use them, and thus are not rationed as they would be if they were
private property and users were required to pay a price for their use.
As a consequence such environmental resources as clean air and water have
been overconsumed in certain uses, particularly the disposal of growing
amounts of industrial, municipal, and agricultural wastes. The same excesses
have been evident in thermal and noise pollution. The right to dump noise
into the air, for example, carries no discipline of a price that must be paid
to encourage restraint or to compensate others adversely affected by such
pollution.
The question is, How can Federal, State, and local governments limit the
uses of environmental resources so as to balance their value for such different purposes as breathing, drinking, recreation, natural beauty, and absorption of wastes? In assuming this task, governments face two major problems. First, the value of environmental resources in alternative uses must be
assessed to provide a basis for determining a balanced use pattern. Second,
governments must design rules that will achieve a balanced use at the
least cost to the economy. The economic efficiency of different approaches
to this rationing problem was examined in the 1971 Economic Report of
the President.
The pending decision about issuing a right-of-way permit to the Trans
Alaska Pipeline illustrates the considerations involved in government allocation of environmental resources. On the one hand, there are urgent energy
needs that would be served by the large supplies of low-cost crude oil from
the North Slope. The Prudhoe Bay field is one of the largest and one of the
lowest-cost oil fields discovered by man. Its development would supply additional domestic energy to the West Coast of the United States at costs to the
Nation well below those of less secure imports. On the other hand, the pipeline would pass through some of the most remarkable wilderness areas in
the United States, and there is no certainty that environmental contamination could be avoided altogether.
The Secretary of the Interior, as custodian of the public lands, must
decide whether to issue the right-of-way permit. To help him assess the
costs and benefits of alternative decisions, the Council of Economic Advisers
examined the economic costs to the Nation of not building the pipeline.
Other agencies reported on such matters as the effects of the pipeline construction on the Alaskan economy, the impact on our national security,
and the possibility of pipeline failures. According to the National Environmental Protection Act, the Secretary of the Interior himself must file a state-




122

ment with the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality describing the probable environmental impact of the action. Having completed
these tasks, he will then be in a position to make a decision based on full
consideration of the costs and benefits.
In calculating the labor and capital costs to the Nation of not building
the pipeline, the Council of Economic Advisers compared the pipeline project with one of the other principal ways of meeting the Nation's demands
for low-cost energy—importing the same amount of oil from overseas as
would be produced at Prudhoe Bay. According to the Council's study, the
real resource cost of imported oil would be more than twice that of the
Prudhoe Bay crude delivered to the West Coast. Development of the 10billion-barrel field and transportation of the oil to the West Coast would save
the Nation $15 billion to $17 billion during the expected 20-year life of the
field. These costs must of course be weighed with other considerations
mentioned above in arriving at an ultimate decision.
Most environmental decisions are not of an all-or-nothing character. Instead, they involve setting quantitative limits on the use of our environmental resources, assessment of charges for use, or the distribution of subsidies to parties investing in facilities to control pollution.
These cases offer a wide range for judgments about where incremental
costs and benefits will come into balance. In the control of water pollution,
for example, costs of improvements rise more rapidly as we approach the
total elimination of pollutants. According to estimates made by the Environmental Protection Agency, 85 to 90 percent of water pollutants from municipal and industrial sources can be removed by 1982 with aggregate new expenditures of just over $60 billion during the next decade. To remove another 10 percent would cost almost another $60 billion; to achieve zero
discharge of pollutants would cost roughly $200 billion more, or over $60
billion for each percentage point of additional removal. At this level, the
incremental cost is so enormous as to raise serious questions about the
appropriateness of carrying removal this far. The substantial resources that
would be needed to improve effluent quality only slightly beyond levels of
purity that would already be high could be used to benefit the economy in
dozens of more significant ways. Public policy must decide where these
resources would produce the greatest benefits.
Problems of controlling water pollution are complicated by other factors.
First, the level of benefits provided by removal of pollutants from a particular
water basin depends on the potential uses of that basin. Where potential
recreational uses are important, for instance, the benefits of removing pollutants are likely to be higher than in a major shipping channel. Final water
quality standards should reflect the benefits attainable; controls on pollutant
emissions can then be aimed at the achievement of those standards. Second,
our knowledge about the effect on water quality of removal of different
amounts of given pollutants is still incomplete. Even if final water quality
goals can be appropriately established, the extent to which emissions of a




123

given pollutant need to be reduced in order to reach that quality level is not
clearly known. A third problem is presented by the fact that pollutants result
from both "point sources" (municipal and industrial waste facilities) and
"general sources" (fields, farms, or mines) while controls generally have
been enforceable only at point sources. There are instances in which, even
with the removal of all pollutants from point sources, desired water quality
could not be achieved; there are other instances in which current levels of
pollutant emissions produce no deleterious effects.
Since in practice both benefits and costs of pollution control vary from
basin to basin, participation from the local, State and regional levels is appropriate in setting the goals for water quality.
A similar problem of estimating costs and benefits is posed by a system of
charges to discourage the emission of pollutants. Here the choice explicitly
requires assessing the value to the public of removing pollutants and
setting a charge that reflects the dollars and cents value of these benefits.
The Administration is considering a legislative proposal for a charge to be
levied on sulfur oxide emissions. To fix a charge per pound of sulfur emitted
means calculating the costs of abatement and the benefits accruing to natural
beauty, vegetation, property, and health from reducing these emissions.
The Environmental Protection Agency has made rudimentary estimates of
the more readily measurable benefits and costs of reducing sulfur oxide that
will provide a basis for setting the charge.
As a method of limiting pollution, emission charges—or effluent fees, as
they are sometimes called—possess distinct advantages. For one thing they
result in an efficient allocation of the resources devoted to pollution abatement. Because each source of pollution will reduce emissions to the point
where the costs of doing so just equal the charge, those sources that can
clean up a given proportion of their emissions at low costs will press their
abatement activities farther than sources incurring higher costs. In contrast
to what would happen if equal standards were applied to each source, a
larger share of abatement activity will be undertaken by sources with low
costs. Insofar as abatement costs differ from source to source, a charge
would achieve a greater reduction in emissions for a given amount of labor
and capital resources committed to pollution abatement than would be
achieved by a uniform standard. Conversely, a given reduction in emissions
can be achieved more economically by setting a charge rather than a
standard.
Another advantage of emission charges lies in the information they generate. Disagreements frequently occur about the technological feasibility or
the costs of meeting specific standards. Polluters argue that the standards
either cannot be met or can be met only at heavy cost, while environmental
advocates minimize the difficulties. An emission charge always makes it in
the interest of polluters to reduce emissions as long as the cost of doing so
is less than the charge. The charge will therefore reveal the reduction in
emissions that is economical at a cost equal to the emission charge itself.




124

Since environmental regulation should always be carried out with as much
knowledge as possible of costs and benefits, an emission charge can be a
valuable tool in supplying information about actual costs. As more information becomes available, the charge can be adjusted to equate benefits and
costs.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Investments in scientific knowledge and in its application to productive
uses have become an important characteristic of the American economy.
Benefits from the development and utilization of knowledge are many and
varied. They are evident in improved health for millions of Americans
as well as in our greater understanding of outer space. They include entirely new products that enhance the quality of life and new techniques
that expand the productivity of the Nation's human and physical resources. While an accurate evaluation of those benefits that directly improve economic performance is difficult—to say nothing of the less tangible
benefits—it is widely agreed that the group of activities called research
and development (R&D) plays a central role in our economy. It has led
to new products and industries; and it can contribute in important ways
to solving today's complex economic and social problems.
Research and development has become a major economic activity. In
recent years over $25 billion—nearly 3 percent of the Nation's total expenditures—has gone into R&D. Two-fifths of the expenditures for this purpose
reported in 1971 were made by private profitmaking firms. The Federal
Government paid for most of the remainder (Table 26).

The Federal Government is itself an important performer (as well
as funder) of research and development; in 1971 nearly 15 percent of all
R&D was performed directly by Federal agencies. But the Federal Government's influence on the R&D industry is even larger than its actual share
of these activities might imply. Government policy influences the supply
of scientific manpower; it also affects incentives for private investment
through cost-sharing arrangements, tax policies, patent laws, and other legal
mechanisms.
RATIONALE FOR GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT
Government is a large purchaser of goods and services, and many of the
things it buys have a large R&D component. Defense equipment and the
exploration of space are obvious examples. Government as the purchaser of
such goods and services must also support whatever research and development is required for their production, either through direct Federal funding
of the R&D or indirectly through the price it pays for the production of the
final goods themselves. The bulk of Federal expenditures for R&D fall in
this category; national defense and space alone accounted for 79 percent of
R&D funding in fiscal 1971 (Table 27). Research and development done
for these purposes have had applications in other fields. Therefore the
amount of R&D supported for defense and space is relevant to the scale of
appropriate Federal support for R&D in the private sector.
But Government has an appropriate role in R&D even when its results
will not be incorporated in Government purchases, because private firms
would underinvest in R&D for goods normally purchased by the private
sector. Although an investment in R&D may produce benefits exceeding its
costs from the viewpoint of society as a whole, a firm considering the investment may not be able to translate enough of these benefits into profits on its
own products to justify the investment. This is because the knowledge which
is the main product of R&D can usually be readily acquired by others who
will compete away at least part of the benefits from the original developer.
This is particularly true of basic research, where the output frequently
occurs in the first instance not as a marketable product, but rather as an
advance in basic knowledge that can subsequently be used in applied research
and development by a wide and often unforeseeable range of firms.
One way to encourage more spending on R&D for private goods is, of
course, by direct funding. When this approach is followed, it is sensible
for Government's share of total expenditures to be greatest for basic research
and to decline at subsequent stages. The difference between social and
private benefits is largest for basic research and diminishes when investments
begin to provide returns that can be obtained through private markets.
Increasingly it is recognized, however, that even at the developmental,
demonstration, and diffusion stages of innovation, social benefits may exceed
private benefits.




126

There are also indirect ways the Government can promote R&D investment for private goods. Public policy has long encouraged and rewarded
innovation and the progress of science through patent laws which permit
inventors to capture a larger portion of benefits than would otherwise be
possible. Other legal mechanisms including those that deal with "trade
secrets" also permit the entrepreneur to internalize benefits that otherwise
would accrue outside his firm.
The difficulty of a firm undertaking its own R&D efforts may be especially
great when the firm is small in relation to the scale required for efficient
R&D efforts. In some cases this difficulty is overcome by the R&D activities
of larger firms which supply machinery or materials to smaller firms, for
example, by producers of farm machinery or seeds for farmers. In other cases
there are firms and institutions that specialize in research and development
as such. Also, firms may be able to share risks or pool their support of R&D
through formal or informal consortia under today's legal and institutional
arrangements. For example, in fragmented industries in which several such
consortia are probable, joint R&D would not normally be considered a violation of the antitrust laws. On the other hand, joint efforts among leading
firms in highly concentrated industries would normally be considered undesirable. In general, actions taken by private groups which lead to improved
allocation of resources would not be in conflict with the antitrust laws;
actions which lead to excessive market power would be.
It must be recognized that in some industries the small firm is the most
effective institution for accomplishing R&D. This is perhaps the case most
frequently at the early stages of development of a new technology. Large
firms sometimes prove to be insufficiently flexible to adapt to rapidly advancing technological innovation. In other instances large, regulated firms
facing relatively assured markets sometimes achieve only a slow pace of
innovation. The benefits of innovation may be capturable, but the spur of
competition is absent.
When private action or patent protection is not sufficient to achieve scale
economies or capture external benefits, direct Government support for
R&D may be appropriate. This would be especially true in an established
industry with many small firms. Under such conditions an individual firm
may have little incentive to undertake its own research or to participate in
an ongoing venture in R&D conducted jointly by a group of other firms;
it would have difficulty capturing the benefits of its own efforts, and the
benefits of their efforts would probably be available without the firm's financial support. Federal support for agricultural research, for instance, started
because individual farms were too small to undertake their own research and
lacked the incentives and institutions to support joint arrangements.
While it is clear that Federal involvement is essential to prevent underinvestment in R&D, the optimal amount of this activity is much less clear. The




127

proper allocation of R&D among alternative activities presents a further
problem. In theory, benefit-cost analysis can answer these questions, but in
practice it is difficult to measure reliably either the aggregate benefits from
R&D or the benefits from investing in particular projects. This is inherent
in the conditions which lead to government intervention—benefits are often
widely diffused in society and thus difficult to measure. Comprehensive
analysis is further hindered because the transformation of research into
new knowledge and of new knowledge into public and private innovations
and workable technologies is not yet adequately understood. Until better
analysis is available to show the benefits, costs, and processes associated
with R&D, informed judgment will continue to be the major element in
shaping public policy.
REGENT DEVELOPMENTS
Several recent developments have raised serious questions about the adequacy of this Nation's research and development program. Recognizing these
developments, the President in 1971 directed the Domestic Affairs Council
to undertake an intensive review of Federal policy in this field.
The most prominent development has been in total expenditures for
research and development; they grew rapidly until about the mid-1960's but
have recently been rising quite slowly. Indeed, if total outlays are adjusted
for rising costs, "real" outlays for R&D have actually been declining since
1968. As a result, research and development amounted to a smaller percentage of GNP in 1971 than in any year since 1960.
Federal R&D spending, in real terms, declined at an annual rate of 4 percent between its 1967 peak and 1971 principally because of scheduled
reductions in space exploration from $5 to $3 billion. Nonfederal spending
continued to show a real increase through 1969 and then declined the past
2 years.
New Emphases
New national priorities have been reflected in substantial reallocations
of Federal R&D expenditures (Table 27). All of the recent declines in
total Federal outlays for R&D have been in national defense and space.
National defense accounted for 86.5 percent of Federal R&D expenditures
in 1960; during 1965 this proportion declined to 56.9 percent and remained
near that level through 1971. The major growth in Federal support from
1961 to 1966 was in space research and technology, which by 1965 accounted
for one-third of the total Federal R&D expenditures. Since 1966 space R&D
has declined each year both in absolute terms and as a share of the total.
Expenditures for R&D related to human resources (mainly in health and
education) and economic affairs increased rapidly throughout the decade.
Between 1965 and 1971 the share of the total devoted to these fields doubled;
together they accounted for 18.6 percent of Federal R&D expenditures in
1971.

Unemployed Scientific Manpower
Declines in "real" research and development expenditures, especially the
shift in Federal programs away from defense and space, and a slowing of
general economic activity have increased unemployment among the Nation's scientific workers. Statistics available on the extent of this unemployment indicate that nationally it is lower than overall unemployment; but
it is clear that for certain skills and in certain localities unemployment has
become a severe problem, especially in contrast to the tight supply situation only a few years ago. The amount of actual unemployment, however,
would probably not indicate the full extent to which scientific personnel
are underutilized, since some people are employed at jobs which do not
fully use their technical skills.
International Developments
During the last decade the United States has devoted a larger share of its
GNP to research and development than any other country and a larger portion of these dollars to basic research, the type that provides the greatest
external benefits. Experience of recent years has demonstrated that the
benefits of R&D go beyond the borders of the performing nation. Basic
research findings from all parts of the world are generally available for all
nations to use, and the same increasingly appears true for applied and
developmental research efforts as well. This has become evident in the
shortened period between the time a new product is introduced and the
time it is replaced by newly developed competitive products.
These developments are in part a natural result of expanding national
economies throughout the world and of improved networks of international
communications. They also result partly from specific policies of some nations to import the findings of basic and applied research conducted elsewhere and to concentrate domestic efforts on developing and refining
applications.




129

These and other trends in national and international R&D policies have
implications for the international competitive position of U.S. exports,
which have been concentrated in high-technology goods, dependent on R&D
investments. The conditions which underlay this Nation's comparative advantage in such goods in the past no longer appear so prominent. Both
the level and the mix of U.S. research and development have changed
considerably in recent years. The level of all R&D as a percentage of GNP
in the 1970's may remain below that of the 1960's. In many other industrial
nations the reverse would appear likely. The nature of R&D activities will
help determine tomorrow's comparative cost conditions and the patterns
of world trade.

EXPANDED SUPPORT FOR R&D
The President's budget for fiscal 1973 proposes an increase in R&D funding of $1.4 billion, or 8 percent, above fiscal 1972. This increase should help
reverse the recent declines in "real" Federal funding for all R&D activities.
Federal support is being expanded in several critical areas: basic research;
national security; and civilian R&D. In addition, the Administration is
moving to improve the overall management of R&D to ensure an appropriate level, priority, and efficiency of effort.
The Budget calls for a 15 percent ($700 million) increase for civilian
R&D. Over one-half of the increase will be directed toward six priority domestic objectives. New emphasis will be given to potentially fruitful developments in the fields of energy, environment, transportation, health, natural
disasters and drugs. In addition, two experimental programs will be initiated
to stimulate R&D investments and applications by private firms and nonfederal institutions. One program will be administered by the National
Bureau of Standards; the other program, to be administered by the National
Science Foundation, will include efforts to help improve our understanding
of the process of innovation and research application. A variety of approaches will be followed by both agencies including more joint activities
among universities, industry and Government, demonstration of new
technologies and encouragement for small, innovative R&D firms.
SURFACE FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION
The Federal Government has long been involved in regulation of the
transportation sector. Railroad transportation was first regulated under the
Interstate Commerce Act of 1887. Other modes later came under regulation—motor carriers in 1935 and certain inland and coastal water carriers
in 1940. Economic and competitive conditions have changed considerably
since regulation was initiated, but the changed conditions have not been
adequately reflected in the regulations under which the Nation's surface
freight carriers are required to perform.




130

One of the most significant and negative outcomes of regulation has been
the fixing of transportation rates in relation to the value of service to shippers, rather than in relation to the costs of providing service. In the early
years such value-of-service pricing was a form of price discrimination intended to benefit railroads Which operated under conditions approximating
monopoly. As competition from other transport modes grew, rail rates substantially above transportation costs for high-valued goods presented attractive competitive targets for motor and water carriers even though the
railroads might have been the low-cost carrier of such freight. The process
continues today, and as a consequence, the railroads are increasingly the
carrier of low-value bulk commodities despite their comparative advantage as a long-haul carrier for general cargo. Through regulation, value-ofservice pricing has been imposed on shippers, requiring them to pay rates for
services in excess of the costs of those services. This leads to the provision of
less transportation services than is desirable for society. In addition, transport
pricing unrelated to the costs of providing efficient service causes mislocation
of facilities for commerce and industry, which must adjust to existing transportation rate patterns.
Regulation of carriers has also led to waste of resources within a
given mode. For example, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)
certificates, which grant motor carriers the privilege to operate, require
these carriers to traverse fixed routes and to pick up and deliver only at particular points on those routes. Regulation thus artificially imposes on motor
carriers the disadvantages which accrue naturally to rail and barge lines.
Some motor carriers and regulated barge operators are further limited in
the commodities they are permitted to carry. This limitation compounds
the empty backhaul problem: That is, largely as a result of restrictions in
their operating certificates, trucks from A may haul one or more commodities to B and return empty, while others from B haul goods to A but also
return empty. Removal of such restrictions on competition among carriers
and of impediments to efficiency can mean significant savings to the economy
as a whole without cost to any sector.
The railroads, especially, have faced another problem due to regulation.
They are required to continue operating branch lines when such lines are
unprofitable, and sometimes even when revenues do not cover their out-ofpocket costs.
To the extent that regulation has given one mode or sector artificial advantages in particular markets, relaxation of regulation would lead to some
adjustments among sectors. Improved resource allocation would mean the
loss of such artificial advantages, but in some cases it would also benefit more
than one carrier. Abandonment of uneconomic branch lines, for example,
would benefit rail carriers and simultaneously provide new markets for
motor carriers in accord with their comparative advantage in short-haul carriage. Other shifts of traffic in accord with the comparative advantage of
each mode could be expected.




131

There are no significant economies of scale for motor carriers and most
major rail lines appear to be of sufficient size to achieve scale economies
under current conditions. Thus there is little danger that competition, once
established, could not remain viable.
Even though many regulations were designed for the benefit of railroads,
the financial position of these carriers is particularly weak, a fact that became especially clear in 1970 and 1971. Though there is no single, fully
satisfactory indicator which summarizes the financial position of railroads,
especially in comparison with other modes and industries, their return on
investment provides some information, particularly in year-to-year comparisons. The return on stockholders' equity for the Nation's Class I rail carriers
dropped from 3.1 percent in 1968 to 0.4 percent in 1970 (Table 28). In
comparison, the figure for all manufacturing firms in 1970 was 9.3 percent,
down from 12.1 percent in 1968. Barge carriers approximately matched
the performance of all manufacturing firms while motor carriers had somewhat lower returns.

The Nation's largest rail carrier, the Penn Central, filed for reorganization in 1970; several other railroads had done so earlier and some, including
the Reading, followed in 1971. The physical plants of many railroads are in
serious disrepair because their long-term low-earnings performance has led
to deferral of maintenance and delay in the purchase of new equipment.
Since railroads are the major long-haul freight carrier, their difficulties have
adverse effects on the entire surface freight system.
Changes in the earnings performance of the railroads and other carriers
cannot be attributed principally to the total volume of their traffic. While
freight traffic during the last decade rose somewhat more slowly than total
output in the economy, the volume nevertheless increased at an average
rate of more than 3 percent annually from 1960 to 1970. Total surface
freight traffic rose from 1,084 billion ton-miles in 1960 to 1,491 billion in
1970. The growth in traffic is shown for various modes in Table 29.




132

As suggested above, much of the problem in the surface freight transportation system can be traced to regulation itself. Selective deregulation offers
opportunities to improve the efficiency of the industry and increase its ability
to meet growing demand.

REGULATORY MODERNIZATION ACT OF 1971
In 1971 the Administration proposed a relaxation of regulation in surface
freight transportation. The Transportation Regulatory Modernization Act
of 1971 would institute a series of regulatory changes leading to a more
competitive market and a stronger surface freight transportation industry.
One of the most significant features the Act proposes is the removal of
conditions in the ICG operating certificates that serve to reduce efficiency
or restrict competition. It would permit greater freedom for carriers to
serve points intermediate to the terminals specified in the certificates, and
permit removal of route-of-travel and commodity restrictions. Procedures
for such removal are to be established by the ICG within 6 months following
passage of the Act. Certificates for the entry of carriers into the industry
(which would mainly affect motor carriers) could not be denied, as at present, on the basis of the impact of new entry on a particular carrier; instead
decisions would have to be made in light of the impact on the total quantity
and quality of service provided over the routes in question. These modified
criteria would apply only to existing certificate holders during the first
2 years following passage of the Act. After that they would apply to all.
The proposed legislation also would specify a "zone of reasonableness"
within which surface freight carriers would be able to price their services.
Railroads, truck lines, and barge lines would not be permitted to charge
prices below the variable cost of providing service. In the absence of "inter-




133

modal" competition, a maximum price limit would also be legislated, equal
to 150 percent of fully allocated costs. For the first year, however, no
rate change in excess of 20 percent woud be allowed. In the second year
the band would be widened to 40 percent; but in any case rate changes would
be required to fall within the zone determined by the legislated minimum and
maximum. (The Department of Transportation has recently outlined to the
Civil Aeronautics Board a zone-of-reasonableness approach for domestic
airline rates. The move has received strong support from several air carriers
and from the Department of Justice. Approval of such a zone, if wide enough
to encourage meaningful price experimentation, would help materially to
meet the goals for improved airline regulation set forth in the 1971 Economic
Report of the President.)
Under specific criteria in the legislation, railroads would be permitted
to abandon more of their unprofitable branch lines than is currently allowed.
Approximately 20 percent of the country's railroad track miles are now
deemed to be used too infrequently to be profitable. Also carriers whose
management would be given greater freedom in setting their rates and in
modifying their services would become subject to legal constraints similar
to those imposed on competing firms in other industries.
FACTORS AFFECTING THE TRANSITION
The continuing expansion in freight traffic augurs well for an orderly
transition to a more efficient system following passage of the Act in substantially the form proposed. Gradual shifts in traffic among modes can be
expected in accord with the comparative advantage of each. Average freight
rates in trucking would be expected to show some reduction, but this would
not come at the expense of the typical operator's profits or the wages of labor.
Instead, it could flow from the orderly removal of inefficiencies that regulation has imposed on the industry in the past. Moreover, the adjustments that
would be brought about by the proposed legislation would occur over a 2to 4-year period in the context of rising demand for carriers' services and
under provisions of the legislation specifically designed to ease the problem
of transition.
While relaxed regulations would lead to greater efficiencies in trucking
without requiring major new investment (partly because the Nation's interstate highway system is nearing completion), the same is not true for the
railroads. To compensate for the years of deferred investment in new plant
and equipment, the railroads will have to make large capital outlays. Once
these are in place, railroads should be able to fulfill their role as an efficient
and profitable component of our freight transportation network with average freight rates lower than they are today.
A number of proposals and developments will improve the situation of
the railroads. The Transportation Assistance Act, also proposed by the
Administration, provides new incentives for increasing railroad rolling stock
through Equipment Trust Certificates and the modern scheduling and con-




134

trol of rolling stock. An increasing earnings potential for the railroads is
also possible from the resumption of a high level of general economic growth,
the additional stimulus to rail traffic which will result from rates more
closely in accord with costs, and, where it has been unprofitable, the removal
of passenger traffic deficits from the private railroads. These steps will make
it less difficult for the railroads to attract private capital.
Passage of the legislation proposed by the Administration would be a
significant step toward a stronger and more efficient transportation system.
The legislation to relax regulation is expected to yield annual savings to the
economy of roughly $2 billion; this will be reflected in some rate reductions
and should also result in improved earnings in financially distressed segments
of the industry. On the other hand, failure to move forward or even excessive delay could mean continued unsatisfactory performance of this vital
service in the economy and may lead to increasing direct involvement by the
Federal Government accompanied by large subsidies.
RAIL PASSENGER SERVICE
In 1971 direct Federal action was taken on rail passenger traffic. Past
regulation often required railroads to continue passenger transportation services over a long period even when it was uneconomic to do so. This resulted
both in prolonged losses to railroads and in deterioration of the quality of
equipment and service.
Passenger traffic from a number of railroads was transferred to an autonomous, quasi-governmental corporation known as "Amtrak." Several actions
were carried out by this corporation during its early months of operation.
Some unprofitable lines were discontinued; a significant segment of activity
was concentrated in a number of hi^h-density and potentially profitable
travel corridors; and new investments were made. However, the funds
initially appropriated for Amtrak have proved to be inadequate for continued operation. It is still too early to judge the success of this initiative.

HEALTH AND MEDICAL CARE
Improvement in the health of the population has always been a concern
of Government. This concern has recently been intensified by sharp increases
in the demand for medical services and by rapidly rising costs in this
sector.
In fiscal 1971 the Nation's medical expenditures for all types of care were
$75 billion. At $358 per person, this sum represents 7.4 percent of the gross
national product. Five years ago medical expenditures amounted to just
under 6 percent of GNP, or $212 per person. In part, of course, this dramatic
increase during the past 5 years is due to price increases. The medical component of the consumer price index has risen much faster than the overall
index. Even after adjusting for increases in the medical care price index,
however, real resources spent on medical care increased faster than real
GNP and grew at an annual rate of 4.3 percent per capita since 1966. In the




135

past fiscal year the growth rate of expenditures slowed down to 2.5 percent
per capita in real terms. This represented less of a slackening than occurred
in the per capita GNP in real terms.
Although improvement in the health of the population was clearly the
ultimate goal of these expenditures, it is also true that the relation between
good health and medical expenditures is less than direct. First, our medical
dollars may not always be used effectively. Ideally, the preferences of consumers and capabilities of suppliers freely interact in the market to determine
the price and amount of the commodity consumed; and this interaction
leads to the use of resources that best contributes to the material well-being
of people. In the case of medical care, however, distortions in this process
occur because, on the demand side, consumers are not always able to judge
the service, and, on the supply side, competition is often limited by restrictions on entry into medical practice and hospital services. Although these
restrictions may have been intended to protect consumers, as a side effect
they may also impede the efficient utilization of resources. In addition, the
dominant position of nonprofit organizations in the market providing hospital services raises other questions about whether incentives to minimize
costs are as great in medicine as in other parts of the economy.
Yet even great improvements in the market for medical care would not
solve all health problems. Another important problem arises because
good health is related to many factors in addition to medical care. Some
of these factors are subject to an individual's control: diet, exercise, smoking, and consumption of alcohol. Other conditions, such as the amount of
pollution in the air and water, depend rather on the actions of society as a
whole. In addition, there are more elusive influences, like the tension generated by attitudes toward work and other circumstances of modern life. The
importance of life styles and environment to health has become much more
apparent in recent years.
To start to answer the general question of how we can best "produce"
health, we must find a way of measuring changes in the level of health. What
must be measured is the actual output—health—not simply such inputs as
amounts of medicine consumed, days spent in hospitals, or the hours in consultation with doctors. While no comprehensive measures of the national
health have been developed, and each existing measure has its limitations,
such indicators as mortality rates and disability days have been widely used
to trace changes over time and to compare localities. The relationships observed between these measures of health and other variables have revealed a
number of paradoxes.
It was once assumed that rising incomes would lead to improved health,
but this assumption is now open to question. Once an area or country reaches
the level of income typical of the most economically advanced nations, the
correlation between income and health is less clear cut. It seems quite possible that beyond this level any further increases in income may call into play
environmental factors unfavorable to health, and these may counterbalance




136

the favorable effects of better medical care per se. For example, those States
with the highest per capita income do not necessarily have the lowest
mortality rates. Indeed, there appears to be a slight positive association between income and mortality rates, except for infant mortality, even though
States with the highest per capita income also tend to have more abundant
medical care whether measured by medical expenditures or by such indicators as the number of doctors per capita.
A comparison of the United States with other developed countries provides another illustration of the difficulty of understanding the complex
relations between medical expenditures, income, and health (Table 30).
Although the United States has the highest per capita income, as well
as the highest per capita medical expenditures, we do not have the lowest
mortality rates. Our record of life expectancy at age 10, particularly for
males, is below the average of the 22 countries belonging to the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). However, our infant
mortality rate and maternal mortality rate, while not the best, are better
than the average. Similarly, the five OECD countries with the next highest
per capita income (after the United States) do not consistently have the
best mortality records, particularly with respect to male mortality.
These patterns are puzzling. Does the activity of earning higher wages
itself produce tensions which have adverse effects on health? Or do hazards
engendered by the style of life become more critical with higher incomes?
These considerations suggest that much is still to be learned about the complex "technology" of producing health.

Furthermore, the health indexes that have been mentioned here cannot
by themselves be used to evaluate the effectiveness of medical care. When
the probability of becoming ill varies among States and countries because
environmental factors, life styles, and even genetic characteristics differ, it
can be misleading to base conclusions about the quality of medical care
on simple comparisons between medical expenditures and measures of
general health.
Since medical care is likely to remain a major instrument for improving
the Nation's health, and since it is a focal point for public \ olicy, there is
a clear need for developing tests for the effectiveness of medical care. At
present, we do not have the data required to make such tests, and thus we
can evaluate only imperfectly the efficacy of alternative medical care policies.
TRENDS IN HEALTH INDICATORS IN THE UNITED STATES
Within the United States, trends in many of the health indicators have
shown continuing improvement during the past 20 years. Infant mortality
rates, which had declined very slowly—15 percent from 1950 to 1965—
dropped 20 percent from 1965 to 1970. The number of restricted activity
days, which is one measure of morbidity, has declined from an annual 16.2
days per person in 1960 to 14.8 days in 1968. Mortality rates for females over
54 years of age have declined since 1960. On the other hand, mortality rates
for both male and female adults in the 25- to 54-year-age range and for
males over 54 years of age have changed little. The lack of improvement in
the mortality record of this latter group, despite the large increase in medical
expenditures, is particularly puzzling.
One problem that the health indicators point up sharply is the difference
in the health of different segments of the population, particularly the differences observed between the white and Negro populations in the United
States. Although Negro mortality rates have declined considerably over the
past two decades, they still remain much above the rates for the white population. Life expectancy for Negro males and females was about 7.4 years less
than for white males and females in 1968. Despite a decline of 22 percent in
infant mortality from 1965 to 1970, the Negro rate at 31.4 per 1,000 live
births in 1970 is still 80 percent higher than the white rate.
FINANCING MEDICAL CARE
The foregoing discussion suggests that public policy for improving health
should focus on a complex approach, with provision of medical care as only
one of many facets. We must therefore decide how to allocate our health
dollars among the different routes to better health: medical care, medical
research, and such programs as those to purify the air or improve nutrition.
Even when the appropriate role of medical care has been delineated, however, one is left with other problems, such as how the care is delivered and
financed.
One important influence on policy has been the growing consensus that
access to medical care should not depend exclusively on an individual's level




138

of income. As a result, public financing of medical services has become an
increasingly large part of total outlays in these services, growing from 26
percent in fiscal 1966 to 37.9 percent in fiscal 1971. The Federal component
has grown even faster, from 13 percent in 1966, before Medicare was
really underway, to 25 percent in 1971. Shifts have also taken place within
the private sector. Whereas direct payments by users once accounted for
the bulk of all private spending for medical care (86 percent in 1950), by
fiscal 1971 only 58 percent came from this source. Private health insurance
or payments by a third party have now replaced much of these user
payments.
The element of risk complicates the financing of health because an individual's need for medical care is much more variable than is his need for
other goods and services. Insurance against high-cost illness has been the
answer for most people. Hospital expenses for some 80 percent of the civilian
population (almost 84 percent of the population under 65 years of age) are
covered by private health insurance. The proportion with coverage for surgical expenses is 78 percent. A substantial part, more than 70 percent, of the
hospital expenses borne by the private sector are covered by health insurance.
Easy access to lower-cost group health insurance often depends on employment. It is therefore not surprising that many of the poor, especially those
not in the labor force, do not have adequate private coverage. Medicare
gives protection to most of the elderly. Medicaid provides additional protection for roughly 18 million of the aged, the blind, the disabled, and lowincome families with children, but this protection is very uneven among the
States. Moreover, many of those who are not so poor and who have some
protection nevertheless lack sufficiently comprehensive benefits.
This uneven coverage, combined with the soaring costs of the past few
years, has led to considerable discussion about new methods of financing
medical care. The criteria most frequently mentioned are not necessarily
compatible. First, many people believe that access to medical care should
not be limited by a person's financial resources. At the same time, financing
schemes should provide a mechanism for controlling costs and encouraging
efficient resource use. But the more medical care is divorced from current
ability to pay, the greater the role of payments by a third party; and when
third party payments increase, incentives for patients and doctors to economize tend to diminish. Medical services use scarce resources; if they are to be
efficiently allocated, benefits must be compared with costs. Experience with
Medicaid and Medicare and the growth of other third party insurance have
shown that all too often the most expensive treatment is undertaken without
giving sufficient consideration to what the treatment would cost and what
it would contribute to the cure of the illness compared to the costs and benefits of other treatments.
The development of health maintenance organizations (HMO's) has
recently received attention as a possible solution. These organizations provide
all-inclusive medical services for a fixed payment set in advance. Since an




139

organization which receives a fixed sum has some incentive to budget its
resources wisely to meet the needs of its clients, this system offers the promise
of encouraging a control of costs along with an efficient use of resources. For
example, it would be in the interest of the organizations to pay stricter attention to the benefits and costs of increasing well-patient care and diagnostic
services to prevent future illnesses or to guard against overuse of facilities.
This leads, however, to another concern. Is it possible to ensure that HMO's
give high quality service? If there were sufficient competition between them,
and if enough choice were provided among various forms of health insurance
plans, both the cost discipline and the quality of service could be safeguarded.
NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE PROPOSALS
In his health message of February 18, 1971, the President outlined a comprehensive program for improving the Nation's health and specifically taking
steps to resolve many of the problems mentioned above. The problem of
making adequate medical care more widely accessible is covered through
two plans in the proposed National Health Insurance Act. First is the
National Health Insurance Standards Act which would require that employers offer a basic health benefit package to employees and their families;
under this plan over two-thirds of the cost would be contributed by the
employer, with the remainder coming from the employee.
The second plan proposed, the Family Health Insurance Plan, is intended
to meet the needs of low-income families headed by an adult who is not
usually employed and who would therefore not be eligible for coverage under
the National Health Insurance Standards Act. In contrast to the Standards
Act, which would be privately financed, the Family Plan would be federally
financed: The Government would pay 100 percent of the costs for families
in the lowest income bracket (up to $3,000 annually for a family of four),
and other families' premiums would be scaled to their incomes up to the
eligibility limits for the program.
Both plans incorporate some features designed to improve efficiency in
delivering health care and to encourage cost restraints. Requiring that insured
persons pay part of the costs of the benefits they receive, by means of deductibles and payment-sharing provisions, would encourage more prudence in
the use of services and discourage waste. With insurance expanded to cover
visits to physicians' offices as well as hospital care, resources may be better
allocated between the two kinds of service. As further protection for the
public, the Administration has urged measures to regulate the private
insurers. Consumers would be protected against insurer insolvency. In addition, annual audits would be required, and rates would be disapproved if they
were found to be unreasonable. Another provision would require a State's
approval of new capital investments. It is hoped that in this way unnecessary
duplication of very advanced hospital equipment can be avoided. Other
provisions are designed to assist the consumer by requiring that both insurers
and medical care providers disclose certain kinds of information.




140

One important effect of the two plans would be the impetus they would
offer to the formation of HMO's. Both the National Health Insurance
Standards Act and the Family Health Insurance Plan require that the option
to join an HMO be provided as an alternative to health insurance. At present
many States have legal barriers that prohibit the formation of HMO's.
Federal legislation would preempt these barriers and allow HMO's to compete with traditional fee-for-service medical care. The rapid formation of
these groups would be further encouraged by proposed Federal grants and
loans. As this relatively new form of health care organization grows, it is possible that the competition thereby introduced will encourage experimentation
with as yet undiscovered modes of delivery of health care.
Other parts of the Administration's proposals for an overall health strategy
include pollution control, safety programs to reduce highway accidents and
product hazards, and programs to improve nutrition through financial aid
to the poor and better information for all. In addition, inspection and research efforts to control harmful food and drugs will be intensified. Research
against sickle cell anemia has been intensified, and the President has signed
the National Cancer Act of 1971 which provides for strengthened efforts in
cancer research.
The Administration has also made a major commit] nent to solving our
health manpower problems. The Comprehensive Health Manpower Training Act of 1971 and the Nurse Training Act of 1971 authorize institutional
grants on a per student basis—a sizable incentive to medical and other health
profession schools to train additional health personnel. Problems will, however, remain. For example, even with more and more physicians the problems
of assuring an effective distribution of qualified doctors by geographical areas
and specialties must still be solved. The 1971 Act provides incentives for
physicians to practice in localities having a shortage of doctors as well as
incentives for them to devote their time to primary care (particularly family
medicine), a specialty which has been neglected in recent years.

CHAPTER 5

The United States and the World Economy

F

OR THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY, 1971 was a year of
transition between two eras.
The monetary arrangements under which the free world operated after
World War II had become subject, especially from 1965 onward, to
increasing strains and frequent crises. In 1971 the system reached a critical
turning point when the pressures of disequilibrium converged on its key
element—the United States dollar. The suspension of the dollar's convertibility into gold and other reserve assets on August 15, 1971, marked
the end of the old order and initiated the reforms required to correct
the basic disequilibrium from which it suffered.
Exchange Rate Realignment
One major change that has already taken place is a significant multilateral
realignment of exchange rates. This was achieved through a combination
of market forces (floating rates) and negotiation; the process culminated
in the Smithsonian Agreement of December 18. The United States agreed
that a suitable means for devaluing the dollar in terms of gold to $38.00
per ounce will be proposed to Congress as soon as a related set of shortterm trade expansion measures is available for congressional scrutiny. Upon
passage of the required legislative authority, the United States will propose the corresponding new par value of the dollar to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). Other countries, notably Japan, Switzerland, and
West Germany, agreed to revalue their currencies in terms of gold, while
France and the United Kingdom agreed to hold to their previous par values.
The set of exchange Tates negotiated in the Smithsonian Agreement is
designed to help correct the relative overvaluation of the U.S. dollar. At
the same time the new structure embodies exchange rates among all major
currencies which should reduce payments imbalances between each of the
major countries and all the others.
The revaluation of each of the major exchange rates against the dollar
relative to the parities which prevailed on January 1, 1971, is shown in
Table 31.
Wider Bands
The Smithsonian Agreement also embodied a second important change.
Under the IMF Articles of Agreement, each member was required to

maintain the exchange value of its currency against gold or the U.S. dollar
within a band or range no wider than 1.00 percent on each side of its
parity value. It was agreed, pending longer-term monetary reforms, that
this band could be widened to 2.25 percent on each side by countries
choosing to do so.
Trade Barriers and Mutual Security Costs
Outside the monetary sphere, the United States received commitments
from its principal trading partners and allies to negotiate on measures
designed to improve the access of U.S. exports to foreign markets and
to increase their mutual security expenditures.
A New Monetary System
Beyond the immediate changes discussed or settled in 1971 the world
faces the more extended task of designing a new order for international
monetary exchange and cooperation. Although the dimensions of this new
order have not yet been defined, it is clear that they will embody fundamental changes from the order under which the free world operated in the
quarter century between 1945 and 1970. In particular, both the role of
the United States within the international system as a whole and the role
of the U.S. dollar within the monetary sector of the international system
will have to be redefined in ways consonant with future realities rather
than with those prevailing in the past.
The sequence of events that led to the suspension of dollar convertibility
on August 15 is rooted in arrangements developed 25 years ago. Similarly
the events begun on August 15, 1971, will have consequences that reach
far into the future.
THE RECOGNITION OF DISEQUILIBRIUM
The decision by the United States to close the gold window and to impose a temporary 10-percent surcharge on imports, on August 15, divides




143

1971 into two parts. Any analysis of the year must key itself to this division.
During the fLst half of 1971 the exchange markets became progressively
unsettled, and there was a massive flow of dollars which finally precipitated
the August decisions. What caused so many more individuals, firms, and
governments to become convinced so quickly that the value of the U.S.
dollar was going to fall relative to the other major currencies? Why did this
conviction develop after the apparently tranquil year which international
finance experienced in 1970?
The swing of opinion was not triggered by any single event: Rather, it
was built up through the cumulation of successive and mutually reinforcing
layers of evidence and analysis. At least three tributaries of opinion about
the position of the dollar converged in 1971. Together they contributed to
speculation against the dollar on a massive scale.
1. One view was that the external monetary position of the United States
had been in fundamental disequilibrium throughout the 1960's. A fundamental, or long-run, disequilibrium exists when the supply of a national
currency to foreigners through the net balance of a nation's payments and
receipts consistently exceeds the potential foreign demand for it. With the
exchange rates and trading conditions that prevailed in the 1960's the United
States was unable to finance its entire set of external policy commitments—
on mutual security, on trade, on development aid, on capital mobility—
except through the steady issuance of liquid dollar obligations. Balance could
have been restored by a shift in relative exchange rates. However there was
considerable inertia in the system's mechanism for exchange rate adjustments, especially with respect to the dollar. The rules and practices of the
system put almost no pressure on surplus nations to revalue. At the same
time, given the dollar's role as the major reserve currency, there were strong
inhibitions against a U.S. devaluation. Furthermore, until the establishment
of Special Drawing Rights (SDR), which were first issued in 1970, there
was no adequate source of growth in world reserves other than U.S. deficits.
Such a situation permitted the U.S. liquidity deficits not only to continue
but to grow.
Since this process was not regarded as sustainable, the conclusion of the
argument was that the disequilibrium would have to be recognized explicitly
and corrected sooner or later by a fall in the external exchange value of
the dollar.
2. A second basis for concluding that the U.S. dollar was overvalued in
1971 was the belief that the poor wage-price-productivity performance of
the U.S. economy between 1965 and 1969 relative to that of its trading
partners had significantly lowered the competitiveness of U.S. goods both in
home markets and abroad. According to this view, the persistent and sometimes large trade surpluses of the pre-1968 period could be expected to
disappear, and the already large U.S. payments deficits would get larger.
Such developments would lead inevitably to a correction via a relative




144

devaluation of the dollar. These beliefs were reinforced by the comparatively
poor trade performance of the United States in 1970 and 1971.
In 1970 the United States was in a mild recession, whereas the economies of most of its major trading partners were operating close to capacity.
Since the normal effect of a recession is to reduce imports and the
normal effect of a boom is to increase imports, the situation in 1970
should have brought with it a large increase in net exports from the United
States to the rest of the world. Net exports of goods did increase—from $0.7
billion in 1969 to $2.1 billion in 1970—but this increase was too small to be
reassuring, especially when compared with the average trade surpluses of
$2.8 billion from 1965 to 1969 and $5.4 billion during the 1960-64 period.
On the contrary, the $2.1 billion trade surplus achieved in 1970 was regarded
as an indication of relative weakness, a sign that the trade surplus of the
United States would inevitably turn to a trade deficit as soon as the U.S.
economy began to recover from its temporary 1970 recession. This is exactly
what happened in 1971.
3. Finally, there was the belief that developments in the conduct of
monetary policy here and abroad (and hence in relative short-term interest
rates) would induce large outflows of short-term capital from the United
States to Europe.
In the United States the recession of 1970 brought with it a fall in interest
rates. As monetary policy was eased in order to help the recovery phase of
the economic cycle, interest rates, especially money-market rates, fell even
further. For example, the rate on 3-month Treasury bills, which had peaked
at 7.9 percent in January 1970, and was 6.7 percent in June, declined to
3.3 percent in March 1971.
In Europe, where the economic cycle lagged that in the United States
by about a year, there was a much smaller decline in money rates. In the
United Kingdom, for example, the rate on 3-month Treasury bills, which
was 6.9 percent in June 1970, was still 6.7 percent in March 1971. The
3-month interbank loan rate in Germany declined somewhat more, from
9.6 percent in June 1970 to 7.6 percent in March. The improvement in
the liquidity of the U.S. banking system in 1970 had already induced a
substantial return flow of short-term capital from the United States to Europe
as U.S. banks repaid their borrowings from their branches abroad. The
trend continued in the first quarter of 1971. The United States had been in
heavy deficit in 1970 (on an official reserve transactions basis the deficit was
nearly $10 billion); with the additional short-term flows the deficit in 1971
was expected to be intolerably high.
When adverse developments in trade and money flows actually did appear,
all of the different reasons for believing that the external value of the U.S.
dollar might change converged. Actions based on these exchange-rate anticipations led to two massive flows of dollars: One was a substantial net outflow
of liquid funds from U.S. residents to residents of other countries; the other
was a large conversion into other currencies of dollar funds held by banks
and businesses abroad.




145

The size of the sales of dollars to foreign central banks was reflected in
the size of the U.S. deficit measured on an official reserve transactions basis.
The deficit for the first quarter of 1971 was $4.7 billion (quarterly rate,
not seasonally adjusted). Excluding the receipt in that quarter of Special
Drawing Rights in the amount of $717 million, the deficit for the first
quarter alone was $5.4 billion—a larger amount than in any full year
except 1970. The quarterly deficit increased to $6.5 billion in the second
quarter and to $12.7 billion in the third. By the end of September, the total
deficit for the preceding 9 months reached $24.6 billion, which is equivalent
to $31.9 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (excluding the SDR
allocation).
REACTIONS TO THE U.S. DEFICIT
The effect of the massive outflow of dollars on the official reserve positions of the major industrial nations—known as the Group of Ten—is shown

The recent large increases in these reserve positions began in 1970 but were
not viewed as a problem in that year. Many European central banks, and
notably West Germany's, had lost reserves during the previous year when the
flow of short-term funds was away from Europe and into the United States.
They and the Bank of Japan (whose reserves had previously been low relative
to its volume of trade) were not unhappy to see their reserve positions increase. The continuing inflow of dollars into Europe, however, became a
serious problem when the U.S. deficit widened in early 1971.
* The Group of Ten—or G-10, as it is called—originated in 1962 when these 10
members of the IMF agreed, through the General Arrangements to Borrow, to lend
the IMF specified amounts of their currencies if a need should arise. Switzerland,
which is not a member of the IMF, participates in the Group of Ten as an observer.




146

The U.S. monetary authorities took various actions designed to reduce or
intercept the flow of short-term capital. The Export-Import Bank and the
Treasury issued $3 billion of securities to foreign branches of U.S. banks,
and thus intercepted funds that might have otherwise landed in foreign central banks. Steps were also taken in Europe to discourage the dollar inflow.
During 1970 West Germany had been the major recipient of the dollar
outflow. This came about not only because of the general strength of the
German economy and its large trade surplus but also because of the severely
restrictive credit policy that West Germany was following, which kept
effective interest rates in that country well above international levels.
As early as February 1971, the West German authorities tried to discourage
further short-term inflows by eliminating the main factor which was attracting these inflows—the higher effective dollar-equivalent short-term interest
rate available in West Germany. Because West Germany's domestic situation
required a policy of tight credit and high interest rates, the authorities were
not prepared to lower domestic interest rates to prevailing international
levels. They tried therefore to achieve their objective by driving down the
forward value of the mark by selling marks, for forward delivery, against the
dollar. The operation proved to be unsustainable and was abandoned. The
basic dilemma remained: How, in the face of large potential dollar inflows,
could authorities simultaneously (1) continue the policy of credit restraint,
(2) avoid exchange controls, and (3) maintain the parity of the mark?
In early May reports by leading German institutes of economic research
highlighted the dilemma and recommended that the best solution was either
for the mark to be revalued to a new parity, or for the market value of the
mark to be freed from its parity value and allowed to float upward.
This recommendation was greeted with sympathy by some senior members of the German government, and the market became more convinced
than before that the mark was about to appreciate relative to the dollar.
Speculative funds, poised as they were for action, flooded into the German
Central Bank at unprecedented rates in the early days of May. On May 5
the rate of inflow rose to $1 billion in the first 40 minutes of trading. The
Central Bank stopped buying and let the dollar value of the mark rise under
market pressure.
Other nations had to face the prospect that, as pressures on Germany
eased with the rise in the mark-dollar rate, some of these speculative pressures would converge on their currencies. The "strong currencies" that were
particularly vulnerable were the Dutch guilder, the Swiss franc, the Austrian
schilling, and the Belgian franc.
The Netherlands permitted the guilder to float. Belgium, which had
two exchange rates—one official and one "financial"—permitted the latter
to appreciate. Switzerland and Austria responded in more orthodox fashion.
During the weekend after May 5 they raised their parities by 7.07 and 5.05
percent respectively.




147

The subsequent rise that took place in the dollar value of the floating
mark and guilder reinforced convictions that the U.S. dollar was fundamentally weak, not just against one or two currencies, but against virtually
all the major trading currencies.
During the second quarter of 1971 the U.S. performance on trade and
payments deteriorated further. With increasing evidence of this deterioration appearing in current reports, confidence in the sustainability of the
dollar's exchange value fell further.
Demand by foreign central banks on the U.S. Treasury to convert a
portion of the dollars they were absorbing was restrained by the knowledge
that such a move would be self-defeating if everybody tried it at the same
time. The stock of reserve assets held by the United States (around $14.5
billion) was far smaller than the stock of dollars held abroad. Nonetheless,
there were substantial reductions in U.S. reserve assets. From the beginning
of 1971 to mid-August the U.S. Treasury paid out over $3 billion in reserve
assets—about 40 percent of this in early August. This depletion took place in
spite of heavy temporary drawings of foreign currencies by the Federal
Reserve (under its swap lines of credit with other central banks), which it
used to absorb some dollars that central banks might otherwise have presented at the U.S. Treasury for conversion into gold or other reserve assets.
By August the private and public pressures to convert the dollar into
other assets—foreign currencies and ultimately reserve assets or their equivalent—became overwhelming. The United States suspended convertibility of
the dollar on August 15. Its value in terms of several major currencies started
to float.
AUGUST 15
The President's announcement suspending the convertibility of the dollar
included other measures to protect the Nation's trade and payments position. In particular, it imposed "an additional tax of 10 percent on goods imported into the United States." As related measures, the President ordered
a 10-percent cut in foreign aid and pointed out that the time had come for
other nations "to bear their fair share of the burden of defending freedom
around the world." The tax applied only to goods on which duties had
been reduced under reciprocal trade agreements, and in no case did it raise
a duty beyond the statutory rate. Where it was limited by the statutory ceiling the surcharge was less than 10 percent. On automobiles, in particular,
the tax amounted only to 6.5 percent. Furthermore, all imports subject to
mandatory quantitative restrictions were exempt from the new tax. Such
goods included petroleum, sugar, meat and dairy products, certain other
agricultural products, and cotton textiles covered by the Long-Term Textile
Agreement. The surcharge affected about one-half of U.S. imports.
In addition, subsequent statements of policy confined the Job Development Tax Credit proposed in the announcement to domestically produced




148

new machinery and equipment as long as the import surcharge remained in
effect
These actions, and the position taken by the United States in subsequent
negotiations, linked the questions of improved access to foreign markets for
U.S. exports and a better sharing of the financial burdens of mutual
security to the basic issue of exchange-rate realignment.
The issue of exchange-rate realignment immediately raised some fundamental questions.
1. How should realignment be achieved? Should it be done through market forces (freely floating rates) or through negotiations?
2. If the realignment were to be arranged through negotiations, how large
an improvement in the U.S. balance would be required? How should the
counterpart of this improvement be shared among other nations? And,
finally, what set of changes in exchange rates would this require?
Starting in September, the United States pursued both approaches to
realignment. The second required an explicit analysis of the U.S. balance
of payments.
BALANGE-OF-PAYMENTS ANALYSIS
Any analysis of the nature and size of U.S. external disequilibrium must
begin with an examination of balance-of-payments accounts. These data, for
the first 3 quarters of 1971 (at seasonally adjusted annual rates) and for
earlier periods, are shown in Table 33.
The table is arranged to show several "balances" which summarize different aspects of our trading and financial relationships. Unfortunately, there
is no single balance measure which adequately presents the total picture. In
assessing the external accounts one must not only study the developments
at the various levels shown on the table but also analyze these on the basis
of evidence not contained in the table itself.
BALANCE ON GOODS, SERVICES, AND REMITTANCES
This balance reflects the flow of payments in these categories: Merchandise trade; services such as travel, transportation, and insurance; income
on previous international investments; military expenditures involving foreign exchange; and Government pensions and private remittances. It excludes the flow of Government grants and of long-term and short-term
capital.
The table indicates a steady deterioration in this measure of the U.S.
position. During the first half of the 1960's the United States had a favorable
balance averaging $5.2 billion a year. But from the high point of $7.7 billion reached in 1964 the balance declined in each succeeding year except
1970. In the first 3 quarters of 1971 the balance was down to an annual
rate of $0.1 billion—an adverse change of $7.6 billion since 1964.
The deteriorating trend in this measure largely reflected a parallel decline
in our balance on merchandise trade. Like the balance on goods, services and
remittances, the trade balance reached a high point in 1964 (when there was

a positive balance of $6.8 billion). After that it declined steadily until the
rise in 1970. During the first 3 quarters of 1971 there was a deficit in the
balance of trade at an annual rate of $1.7 billion. The adverse swing in the
trade balance from 1964 to 1971 was $8.6 billion.
Underlying this trend was an extremely rapid increase in merchandise
imports into the United States: From 1964 to 1971 imports rose by 147
percent, or at a compound rate of about 14 percent per annum. U.S. merchandise exports also rose dramatically—by 74 percent—but this increase




150

did not match the growth of imports. The persistently faster rise since 1964
in U.S. imports compared to U.S. exports was not caused by a relatively
more rapid increase in the level of U.S. income and product. Indeed, measuring growth in terms of their gross national products, either real or nominal,
all but one of our major trading partners were expanding at a faster rate
than the United States. The demand aspects of this situation should have
induced a more rapid rather than a slower rise in U.S. exports relative
to U.S. imports.
Price-Cost Developments
There is no simple explanation for the decline in the U.S. trade surplus.
One factor is that the relatively poor price-cost performance of the U.S.
economy associated with the inflationary developments after 1965 reduced
the relative competitiveness of American goods.
Table 34 gives two measures of the price competitiveness of U.S. products in the world economy. Neither measure is fully satisfactory. The index of
unit labor costs in manufacturing is deficient for international comparisons
because exports may have a product mix that differs from total production,
and because measures of labor compensation in different countries do not
equally reflect changes in total labor costs. Likewise, the index of unit
values for exports of manufactured goods is sensitive to changes in the
composition of exports and is subject to other technical deficiencies. Nonetheless, changes in these two indicators do offer evidence that price and cost
developments between 1965 and 1969 were significant enough to influence
the U.S. trade balance.
During the first half of the 1960's, price stability in the United States
seems to have made U.S. goods more competitive in world markets. Unit
labor costs in manufacturing fell in this country through 1964 while those
in other industrial countries remained unchanged. The unit value of U.S.
manufactured exports held its own relative to our competitors' export
prices, neither of the indexes changing significantly. These price developments, together with the cyclical pattern of output changes in the United
States and its markets, contributed to rising U.S. trade surpluses through
1964.
During the latter part of the 1960's, however, in a period of increasing
inflation both in the United States and elsewhere, the price and cost competitiveness of U.S. products was eroded. From 1964 to 1969 unit labor
costs in manufacturing rose at 2.5 percent per annum in the United States—
more than twice as fast as the 1.2 percent per annum recorded for our major
trading partners. Unit values of U.S. manufactured exports also increased
more than twice as fast as those of our competitors.
In 1970 the relative price and cost position of the United States began to
recover. This was partly the result df the earlier application of disinflationary
policies in the United States than elsewhere and partly due to appreciations
in the exchange-values of the West German mark and the Canadian dollar.

In the first half of 1971, export prices of foreign manufactured goods, as
measured by the index of export unit value, increased less than the corresponding index for the United States. But unit labor costs in manufacturing
abroad were rising much more rapidly than here. Data for the year as a
whole are not yet available. Both the U.S. program of wage-price restraint
after August 15 and the revaluations of foreign exchange rates relative to the
dollar will increase the relative price-competitive position of the United
States significantly.
CYCLICALLY ADJUSTED BALANCES
The steady deterioration since 1964 in the U.S. balance of trade and current balance appeared to have been reversed in 1970. This was not a genuine reversal of the otherwise strong underlying downward trend. Rather, the
cause was the conjunction of a recession in the United States with booming
conditions abroad. In 1970, real gross national product fell in the United
States; abroad, output continued to expand vigorously, although at a somewhat lower rate than that experienced in 1969. In short, the improvement
of the U.S. current account balance in 1970 was a temporary phenomenon
caused by the fact that cyclical influences operating in the United States
were not in phase with those operating abroad.




152

The influence of such induced effects on the observed trade and current
account balances can be eliminated by appropriate adjustments to provide
a "cyclically adjusted" figure that better reflects the underlying position.
Several agencies, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), the U.S. Treasury, and the Federal Reserve
Board have begun to develop data on "cyclically adjusted" balances.
For 1970, the OEGD's cyclical adjustment estimates indicate that the
observed U.S. surplus of $2.2 billion on current transactions (excluding
Government grants) in that year was $2.4 billion higher than it would have
been under "normal" conditions (defined as a condition of normal high
employment in all OECD countries). U.S. calculations indicate a 1970 adjustment for cyclical and other special factors of $2.8 billion. According to
the latter estimate, on an adjusted or normalized basis, the United States in
1970 had an unfavorable balance of $0.6 billion. Similarly, after adjustment,
the underlying balance was much less favorable than is indicated by the
observed figure of $0.1 billion for the first 3 quarters of 1971.
When allowance is made for cyclical factors, it becomes quite clear that
during the past 7 years there was an uninterrupted deterioration of the U.S.
position on current account (excluding Government grants) : From a surplus
(cyclically adjusted) of around $6.1 billion in 1965 to an estimated deficit
(cyclically adjusted) of $2.5 or $3.0 billion for 1971. This is a significant
swing in position even for an economy as large as that of the United States.
The fact that the move was steadily in the same direction made the change
all the more significant.
THE CAPITAL ACCOUNTS
The United States has been a net supplier of private and Government
long-term capital and grants to the rest of the world in every year since
World War II ended. A major component of the outflow of private capital
is private direct investment abroad. This flow had grown from an average
of $1.8 billion a year in the first half of the 1960's to $3.3 billion in the
second half of the decade. It reached $4.4 billion in 1970, and the annual
rate was $5.5 billion in 1971. This net outflow has been substantially exceeded
in every year of the decade by the income from U.S. direct investments
abroad, which is included in the balance on goods and services.
There is a counterflow of foreign direct investment into the United States
Until 1968 this counterflow was very small, but in 1969 and 1970 it reached
a rate of almost $1.0 billion a year. In 1971, the inflow of direct foreign investment into the United States not only ceased, but there were net capital
transfers from foreign subsidiaries in the United States to their parent
companies.
The other component of long-term capital flows in Table 33 shows the net
result of numerous long-term capital inflows and outflows. It includes: Longterm U.S. Government loans (net of repayments received); U.S. purchases
of foreign security issues; foreign purchases of U.S. securities; and longterm loan transactions here and abroad. For the 1960's as a whole there was a




153

net outflow for this component. But beginning in 1968 an expansion occurred
in the inflow of foreign long-term investment to the United States, including
borrowing abroad by U.S. firms. In 1968 itself there was a net inflow, particularly from Europe. In 1970 the inflows balanced the outflows. However,
in 1971 the inflows fell off, and outflows rose; as a result, the net outflow
rose to a rate of $2.5 billion.
Taking the long-term capital ac zount as a whole, net capital outflows rose
by $4.9 billion between 1970 and 1971. Much of this adverse swing was
caused by capital movements influenced by the prospect of speculative gains.
BALANCE ON CURRENT ACCOUNT AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL
The current account balance combined with the balance on long-term
capital account plus Government grants provides an important yardstick
(sometimes called the "basic balance") for measuring and assessing the
fundamental position of a nation relative to other countries. Starting in mid1971 the official U.S. presentations of balance-of-payments data have begun
to recognize the importance of this yardstick, and it is now published as a
separate "balance."
In 1970 the United States was in deficit on basic balance by $3.0 billion.
Between 1970 and the first 3 quarters of 1971 the balance worsened by
$7.1 billion to reach an annual rate of $10.2 billion. Of this, $2.2 billion was
due to a worsening of the balance on current account and $4.9 billion to a
net increase in the long-term capital outflow. Although the basic balance
generally reflects underlying forces, it is sometimes subject to short-run movements. This appeared to be the case in 1971.
THE SIZE OF THE REQUIRED CORRECTION
Negotiations on exchange-rate realignments which began soon after August 15 required an answer to the question: By how much should the United
States improve its basic balance in order to achieve a stable equilibrium?
The U.S. representatives presented an analysis which showed that the
required turnaround was about $13 billion. The calculations were as follows:
1. Under conditions of reasonably full employment both in the United
States and in other major trading countries, the U.S. deficit on current account (excluding U.S. Government grants) for 1972 was projected to be
$4 billion on the basis of the exchange rates and other trading conditions
in effect in April 1971.
2. The annual outflow for Government grants and credits plus private
long-term capital flows from the United States to countries other than Western European nations, Canada, and Japan was estimated at $6 billion, or
just over one-half of 1 percent of the U.S. gross national product. The average annual outflow for these purposes during the 5-year period from 1967
through 1971 was about $ 5 / 2 billion.
3. A secure payments position would require that this estimated $6-billion
capital outflow be covered by a surplus on current account. Since the projected "full-employment" current account for 1972 was in deficit by $4 bil-




154

lion achieving a surplus of $6 billion required an improvement of $10 billion
in the U.S. current account.
4. Two other factors caused additions to this basic estimate. The first
was an allowance of $1 billion a year to cover a persistent outflow, which the
data collection network does not capture. This outflow, which is shown as
"errors and omissions" or unidentified transactions in the accounts, fluctuates from year to year, but it has been consistently negative since 1960, the
average level being around $1 billion. The second factor was an allowance
of $2 billion to provide the prospect of a small surplus on basic balance, to
cover persistent short-term capital outflows or to serve as a margin of safety
against errors in the underlying assumptions and calculations. With the
addition of these two factors, the turnaround required for the United States
to achieve a secure position was estimated to be $13 billion.
DEVELOPMENTS AFTER AUGUST 15
Reactions abroad to the August 15 announcement were varied. The major
European exchange markets closed during the week following the announcement. When the exchange markets were reopened, no country except France
attempted to hold the exchange value of its currency against the dollar
within the 1-percent upper limit of its parity rate. The exchange value of
the dollar in these markets declined, and on average continued to decline
during the succeeding months.
In France the exchange market was segregated. For dollars received
as a result of transactions related to international trade, the French government continued to intervene in order to support the parity rate. All
other dollars received were diverted to a "financial franc" market; here,
severe restrictions were imposed on inflows of funds, but the rate was allowed
to find its own level.
In Japan the exchange markets were not closed after the August 15 announcement, and the Japanese government continued to intervene by purchasing dollars at the official ceiling rate. During August alone the Japanese
Central Bank took in $4.4 billion—an amount considerably larger than their
$2.9 billion of total dollar holdings at the end of 1970. Official intervention to hold the dollar rate at its ceiling was then suspended, and limited
intervention avowed the value of the yen to rise about 5 percent relative
to the dollar. In subsequent months the government continued to intervene in order to dampen the pace at which the yen would appreciate relative to the dollar. In the process, dollar holdings by the Japanese Central
Bank increased an additional $1.4 billion to $11.6 billion by the end of
October.
ALTERNATIVE ROUTES TO REALIGNMENT
Developments after August 15 made one fact clear: The immediate
operational issue facing governments was a realignment of the pattern of




155

exchange rates, especially a realignment of the U.S. dollar relative to the
other major currencies.
Among the questions associated with this operation were these:
1. How should the industrial nations arrive at a new set of equilibrium
exchange rates? One route was to let all currencies float freely for a transitional period until a new set of equilibrium rates emerged. The other was to
negotiate a multilateral shift to a new set of fixed rates.
2. If the second route was to be used, should the United States "contribute" to the realignment by a formal devaluation of the dollar against gold?
Or should negotiations concentrate on exchange rates among currencies,
expressed in dollars, with the question of the gold price being left to subsequent negotiations on longer-range issues?
3. How large was the readjustment required to restore the U.S. balance
of payments to an equilibrium position? How large an average change in
the dollar's exchange rate did this require? How should the effect of the
proposed readjustment in the U.S. position be shared among other nations?
Mutually acceptable answers to all of these questions depended in part on
related issues. The inclusion of trade practices and the question of mutual
security costs as part of the overall negotiations involved other members
of foreign governments besides financial officials. This affected the tempo
and procedure as well as the substance of the negotiations.
REALIGNMENT THROUGH FLOATING
One issue was whether market-determined exchange rates or negotiations
provided the most efficient route to equilibrium.
In spite of intervention by central banks, at first to hold rates within limits
set by parity values, and later to suppress the pace of the relative appreciation of the currencies, a significant pattern of exchange-rate realignment did
take place in 1971, particularly after dollar convertibility was suspended. The
general path of these upward movements relative to previous parities against
the U.S. dollar is shown in Chart 10.
The U.S. position on the issue was that a transitional period of free
floating could lead the world swiftly and efficiently to a new pattern of
equilibrium rates. This position was put forward by the Secretary of the
Treasury on September 30, in his address to the Annual Meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, when he said:
. . . I believe we should welcome the help that the market itself can provide in reaching crucial decisions.
Many nations already are allowing their currencies temporarily
to float, but they have done so with widely varying degrees of intervention and controls. As a result, some adjustments clearly needed
are being delayed or thwarted, the process of multilateral decisionmaking impeded, and political questions multiplied. In this respect,

our surcharge and restrictions on capital flows could, like those
applied by other countries, themselves be a disturbing influence.
If other governments will make tangible progress toward dismantling specific barriers to trade over coming weeks and will
be prepared to allow market realities freely to determine exchange
rates for their currencies for a transitional period, we, for our part,
would be prepared to remove the surcharge.
With few exceptions the suggestion of the United States was not accepted.
In most countries market forces were suppressed by a variety of new measures,
including regulation of inflows, exchange controls, and central bank intervention in the market. Eventually the question of realignment had to be
settled through bilateral and multilateral negotiations.
The opposition to a policy of arriving at a new set of exchange rates via
market-determined forces was motivated by a complex mixture of reasons.
RELUCTANCE TO REVALUE AGAINST THE DOLLAR
Many nations were reluctant to let their currencies appreciate too far
against the dollar. This attitude was not, of course, an argument against
floating as such; it applied equally well to revaluation via negotiation.
Raising the value of one's own currency (or permitting it to rise) reduces the price competitiveness of export industries. For many countries,
expanding exports provided an impetus for overall economic expansion
which these governments were reluctant to surrender. Even when governmental policies did not emphasize export expansion, the export industries
were highly visible politically; governmental actions that might erode
their prospects had to be taken with care. While revaluation also provided
countervailing advantages to other segments of a revaluing economy—
especially to consumers, importers, and tourists going abroad—these benefits
tended to be spread more broadly and were therefore less visible. The reluctance of other countries to see their currencies appreciate relative to the
dollar, regardless of how this was accomplished, was intensified in the second
half of 1971 by the slowing of the boom conditions which had prevailed in
many countries in prior years.
RELUCTANCE TO REVALUE AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES
Reluctance to revalue against the dollar was one reason why many nations
did not permit market pressures to express themselves freely. A collateral
reason was the unwillingness to have the national currency revalued against
other currencies whose values were being held down by intervention or
controls. When one nation revalues relative to the dollar—which it may be
willing to do in the interest of restoring equilibrium—it is thereby revalued
relative to all other nations that do not revalue, and this it may not be willing
to permit. Given the multilateral nature of the problem, the idea of floating
toward a new equilibrium requires the cooperation of all nations. The absten-




159

tion of even one important nation from the joint action may be enough to
hold up the entire process. This is what happened in the autumn of 1971.
The French commercial franc was held to its previous parity value against
the dollar (established in 1969). When the West German mark moved up
to a range of from 10 to 12 percent above its parity with the dollar (also
established in 1969), it moved up to the same extent against the French
franc. Since France is West Germany's largest trading partner, both for exports and imports, this 10 to 12 percent increase in the mark's cross-rate
against the franc was regarded as unacceptable by West Germany, especially since this cross-rate had already been increased by nearly 23 percent
in the 1969 realignments.
Similarly the unwillingness of the Japanese authorities to let the value of
the yen rise freely relative to the dollar was affected not only by a desire
to limit the change in the yen-dollar rate; it was also affected by the rates
between the yen on the one hand and European currencies on the other.
RELUCTANCE TO CORRECT BY REVALUATION ALONE
There was a third set of motives for rejecting the floating route to realignment. This process of arriving at new rates would leave the dollar standing
still in relation to gold while other currencies moved up by varying amounts.
For one reason or another many nations were unwilling to accept such an
outcome.
One of these reasons was that acceptance of the process would explicitly
recognize the U.S. dollar as the benchmark against which all other national
currencies set their values. There was a body of opinion in Europe that the
benchmark should be an objective one, or at least a multinational one which
did not bear the stamp of any single country. The existence of this body of
opinion has important implications for the choice of a basic monetary unit
of account in the international system of the future.
A second reason was that, if the United States devalued, other countries
could reduce or avoid the political onus of revaluing. Thus it was easier for
the United Kingdom, for example, to stand still for an 8-percent U.S. devaluation than to revalue by an equivalent amount with the United States
standing still, even though the effect on exchange rates would be the same.
The third reason was that revaluation reduces the value, expressed in
the domestic currency unit, of a nation's stock of foreign monetary assets. The
value of its gold holdings measured in the national currency falls to the
extent of revaluation, and so do its holdings of other reserve assets, notably
the U.S. dollar. This balance-sheet loss for each revaluing nation, so far as
the gold component is affected, could be reduced by requiring the United
States itself to contribute to a realignment through an increase in the dollar
price of gold.
The floating route was therefore rejected in favor of a negotiated pattern
of change, in which the dollar itself made part of the adjustment by moving
down relative to gold.




160

FINAL NEGOTIATIONS ON EXCHANGE RATE REALIGNMENT
By the end of November floating had moved exchange rates some distance
from the old parities. The French commercial franc was the only major currency that was held to the upper limit of the narrow band around its parity
value. Bilateral and multilateral negotiations between the United States and
its principal trading partners on trade and mutual security costs had also
commenced.
At the ministerial meetings of the Group of Ten nations held in Rome a
hypothetical devaluation of the dollar against gold was discussed as one
aspect of a possible overall package agreement (which included a pattern of
currency revaluations by other nations and adjustments in existing impediments to trade). The United States offered to consider a new pattern of
exchange rates involving an average adjustment that would not fully meet
its objective of a turnaround of $13 billion.
The negotiations were completed on this basis at a later meeting of the
ministers and governors of the Group of Ten nations held at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington on December 17-18. The key elements in the
agreement were a new set of exchange rates and provisions for a wider
band, within which market rates would be free to move up to 2.25 percent
above or below the new "central rates." As part of the agreement the
United States lifted the temporary surcharge on imports which it had
imposed on August 15.
The agreement will not be formally complete until Congress acts on the
dollar price of gold. In the meantime, intensive trade negotiations have been
in process with Canada, Japan, and the European Community. The results
of these talks are to be available for congressional scrutiny when the gold price
legislation is considered by the Congress.
The $35 per ounce gold price reflects the exercise of authority given to the
President (in the "Thomas Amendment" of May 12, 1933) to redefine the
gold content of the dollar at not less than 50 percent of its previous gold content. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, by Executive Order, set the price at
$35 an ounce in 1934. The President's power under the Thomas Amendment
was extended periodically until it expired on June 30, 1943.
The par value of the U.S. dollar communicated to the International
Monetary Fund in 1946 was 0.888671 grams of fine gold—equivalent to $35
an ounce. Under the terms of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act of 1945
(the Act which authorized U.S. membership in the International Monetary
Fund), the President must obtain congressional authorization before proposing or agreeing to a change in the par value of the dollar.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY REFORM
The Smithsonian Accord dealt with the most pressing issue which faced
the international monetary system after August 15. It thereby set the stage for
the more extended task of designing a new order for international monetary
cooperation, on which more intensive work will begin in 1972.




161

Measured by overall results, the international economic arrangements in
force since World War II were strikingly successful. The basic goals of the
founders of the Bretton Woods system were achieved to a high degree. Trade
and payments among nations were increasingly freed and grew rapidly. International consultation and cooperation developed to an extent previously
unknown. The balance-of-payments problems which individual nations experienced at various times did not prevent the general pursuit of policies of
relatively rapid and steady growth. In total, the record of the 25-year period
was one of unprecedented progress for the world economy—and this is an
impressive tribute to the functioning of the so-called Bretton Woods system.
At the same time, the way the monetary component of the system actually
operated departed in many important respects from the mechanics envisaged
by the participants at Bretton Woods. As reviewed in past Reports of this
Council, a pronounced asymmetry developed between the role of the United
States and the role of other countries. The stability of the system—its ability
to reconcile trade, balance of payments, and reserve goals of various countries, to provide adequate liquidity, and to achieve elasticity in financing—
came to be heavily dependent on the willingness and ability of the United
States to lose reserves, to absorb more or less persistent deficits in its external
accounts, and to maintain a passive role with respect to its own exchange
rate. The dollar became the center of the system, and this placed particularly
heavy responsibilities on the United States to maintain stability domestically
along with open trading and financial markets.
The system which evolved had advantages and disadvantages from the
standpoint of both the United States and other countries. Whatever its
merits, the important underlying premises of a dollar-centered system are no
longer valid. With the strong recovery of the European economies, with the
striking growth of Japan, and with industrialization proceeding elsewhere in
the world, the position of the United States in the world economy is no
longer as predominant as it was in the 1950's. The development and extension of the European Community, with its plans for increasingly close economic and monetary integration of the region, adds an important new, if still
uncertain, dimension to the picture. In monetary terms, the U.S. reserve
position became inconsistent with a presumption of convertibility of the
dollar into reserve assets. This was aggravated by the repercussions of domestic inflation since the mid-1960's, which weakened the U.S. trade and payments position.
Reform of the international monetary framework has been the subject of
extensive discussion for many years. The creation in 1970 of a new international reserve asset, Special Drawing Rights, is a major innovation in the
system. A thorough report by the Executive Directors of the International
Monetary Fund on the role of exchange rates in the adjustment of international payments, also issued in 1970, both reflected and contributed to the
growing consensus that there is a need for greater flexibility in official
exchange rates.




162

In 1972 further and more far-reaching negotiations on restructuring the
international monetary system will begin. Although the eventual shape of
the new order will not be known until these negotiations are completed, the
primary questions with which the negotiators must deal are clear.
1. One issue is the degree of "fixity" that should be provided for in the
exchange rate mechanism. The Bretton Woods system contemplated that
each IMF member government would establish a fixed par value for its
currency and maintain this value in the exchange markets within a narrow
margin of plus or minus 1 percent. The par value would be adjusted only
when a fundamental disequilibrium became manifest over a period of time,
and then presumably by a substantial amount. In practice, this rigidity,
broken at intervals under heavy pressure, may have become self-defeating in
terms of maintaining the broader stability and continuity of the system.
Should the new system place an equal emphasis on exchange fixity by requiring all nations to establish official par values? If so, should the band of
exchange rate variation permitted around par values be widened? Alternatively, under what conditions should countries be permited to let exchange
values of their currencies be determined by market forces, as Canada and
others have found it convenient and useful to do in the past?
2. A second, related issue concerns the mechanisms to be utilized for
maintaining reasonably balanced international payments positions. As indicated, the Bretton Woods system tended to think of an exchange rate
change as an adjustment of last resort. Nations whose currencies became
overvalued relative to other currencies have tended to delay unduly before
making a change in the exchange rate. Furthermore, because nations with
undervalued currencies also resisted exchange rate changes, and were able
to do so longer, most exchange rate changes have been downward. The
operating question is how changes might be made in a less disturbing way
in the future, with pressure more evenly distributed among surplus and
deficit countries, and with the United States having the same degree of
freedom of action as other nations.
As noted, there is a growing consensus in favor of greater flexibility:
However the correct degree of flexibility, the rules for implementing the
process, and the role of the IMF in this implementation process need to be
examined and defined.
The need for wider margins than the dt 1 percent specified in the Fund's
Articles of Agreement is also well recognized. The Smithsonian Accord
provides temporarily for margins of z± 2^4 percent. The proper width of
margins for the longer run must be determined.
Negotiations on the future adjustment process will also cover issues other
than exchange rate flexibility. These will include ways and means of influencing short-term capital movements and the degree to which the mix
of monetary and fiscal policy should be influenced by external considerations.
3. A third issue is the question of how much liquidity the system needs
and how this liquidity should be provided. The amount of liquidity needed




163

will depend on how the other questions are answered, including particularly
the flexibility and efficiency of the adjustment mechanism. The question of
how liquidity is to he provided raises the issue of the role of alternative
reserve assets. The United States and many other countries share the conviction that gold should and will play a diminishing role in the system. Already, considerable progress has been made in developing the SDR as an
alternative international reserve asset, but many questions remain, including
the appropriate role of the dollar and other reserve currencies.
The agenda for negotiations is a large one. Fortunately, there is wide
agreement that the objectives of the Bretton Woods system remain as valid
as before and negotiations will be based on the fundamental premises that
nations want to promote international monetary cooperation, balanced
growth and increased freedom for trade and payments, stability in the
exchange markets, and the avoidance of competitive undervaluation of
rates. The challenge will be to find the mechanisms that will assure those
results, taking into account the realities of the 1970's and the new balance
of economic power and responsibilities.
TRADE POLICY DEVELOPMENTS IN 1971
For over three decades the free world has been gradually liberalizing commercial policy to achieve the economic and political benefits of an open
trading world. The United States has taken a position of consistent leadership in this movement. This course recently has faced and survived two
major tests. There have been strong pressures in the United States itself to
redirect policy toward quantitative restrictions on trade and investment.
While the United States extended import restraints to a few additional commodities in 1971, legislation that would apply quantitative restrictions
broadly to imports has not been enacted. The second major test, and one
that became subject to spirited debate in 1971, came with the trade policy
actions to combat the U.S. payments deficit taken in connection with the New
Economic Policy. Although it provoked considerable controversy, the import
surcharge did not set off the series of retaliatory actions abroad that had
been feared in some quarters. And it was removed before the end of 1971
when the currency realignment made it no longer necessary.
During a period when commercial policy is under major pressure for
change—as it has been during the past 2 years—it is particularly important
that necessary preoccupation with month-to-month events not be allowed to
blur appreciation for the long-term objective of U.S. international economic
policy. That objective is an open world economy in which trade and investment flows among countries are not distorted by national barriers to free exchange. Moving toward that objective will enhance broad foreign policy
objectives for this country, and it will provide important economic benefits.
International exchange permits mutually beneficial specialization in production among countries; it provides healthy competition to ensure efficiency in
domestic industries; it expands the variety of goods available to U.S.




164

consumers and producers; and in times of inflation it provides a wholesome
brake on price increases.
To many Americans the benefits of liberal trade policies are not highly
visible because they are broadly diffused. But the short-run costs that trade
liberalization sometimes imposes on specific groups are usually highly visible
indeed. Thus, the costs of liberalization are more keenly felt than the benefits,
and that tends to make removal of trade and investment restrictions difficult
to achieve.
Substantial progress has nevertheless been made toward free international
exchange in industrial goods during the past 25 years, mainly by reducing tariffs. But much work remains. The President anticipated the controversial and difficult policy issues confronting the United States when he appointed the Commission on International Trade and Investment Policy to
study U.S. positions and to recommend a policy for the 1970's. He also recognized that proper formulation and implementation within the executive
branch required better coordination among the agencies engaged in international economic policy. In early 1971 he established the Council on International Economic Policy in the White House.
The President's Commission on International Trade and Investment
Policy, whose membership was drawn from business, labor, and the universities, presented its report in July, United States International Economic
Policy in an Interdependent World.
The Commission's recommendations included, on the one hand, measures
designed to strengthen the capacity of U.S. industry and labor to compete
effectively and, on the other, proposals for negotiations with our major trading partners. Specifically recommended were actions which might reduce the
adverse effects on U.S. exports of the European Community's Common
Agricultural Policy and the Community's widening preferential tariff arrangements and international action to deal with market disruptions due to
imports.
For the longer term, the Commission recommended negotiations "looking
toward the progressive reduction and eventual elimination of barriers to
trade and investment," including reform of the international monetary system, with negotiations eventually leading to the "elimination of all barriers
to international trade and capital movements within 25 years."
The purpose of the newly organized Council on International Economic
Policy is to strengthen the policymaking process. The Council is chaired by
the President, and its members are the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Defense,
Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor, the Ambassador at Large, the Director
of the Office of Management and Budget, the Chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers, the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations, the
Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to
the President for Domestic Affairs. The President stated in his Executive
Order that the Council was to (a) "achieve consistency between domestic and




165

foreign economic policy," (b) "provide a clear, top-level focus for the full
range of economic policy issues," and (c) "maintain close coordination with
basic foreign policy objectives." The work of the Council is directed by its
Executive Director, who is also Assistant to the President for International
Economic Affairs. As his first assignment, the Executive Director was instructed by the President to prepare a review of the position of the United
States in a changing world economy. This briefing was presented to the
Council in April 1971 and was subsequently reviewed with leaders in
Congress and others outside the Administration. The Council is now pursuing
work programs in a variety of areas—such as export promotion, more comprehensive adjustment assistance programs, and foreign investment policies—
and is planning for a series of foreign economic negotiations.
In addition to strengthening its own apparatus for policy formulation
in the trade sector, the Administration has extended contacts with
our trading partners. The President's Special Trade Representative has
participated in the High Level Trade Group assembled by the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development to explore avenues for major
negotiations which might lead in the next few years to a more effective
climate for international trade and investment. This group began monthly
meetings in November and aims to complete a report for the Council of the
OECD in the spring of 1972.
The Commission's report and the coordinating work of the Council have
helped to identify the major policy issues in the area of international trade
and to initiate steps through which these issues will be resolved.
EXPORT POLICY
The disappearance of the traditional U.S. trade surplus in 1971 itself
raised a fundamental question. Is a trade surplus desirable or essential for
the United States?
On one side of this question is a view that exports should always exceed imports by a wide margin because net exports are both a stimulant
to the domestic economy and a symbol of relative economic strength. This
position views exports as inherently desirable and imports, unless unobtainable domestically, as undesirable or at least suspect. The policy prescription
corresponding to this mercantilist position calls for adoption of the measures
necessary to keep (the volume of U.S. exports higher than the volume of
imports in every single accounting period, regardless of cyclical circumstances or developments affecting other elements in the balance of payments.
In another corner are those who argue that after years of investment
abroad the United States has achieved a special status in the world. It is
a major creditor nation which receives a large and growing income from
overseas investments. It is possible, indeed appropriate, for a nation in this
position to use some of this income to finance a net inflow of imports. These
net imports are the fruits of resources the Nation has foregone consuming or
investing domestically in previous years.




166

In fact, however, the appropriate approach to exports depends upon the
approach that is taken to all of the other elements in the balance of payments. While the United States is a major creditor nation—the inflow of
net investment income was over $6 billion in 1970 and is expected to grow in
the future—a large net investment income does not mean that the country
can afford an equally large trade deficit. U.S. policies involve other major
payments commitments—grants and loans to less developed countries, mutual security costs, pensions and remittances to citizens living abroad, and
funds for additional overseas investments. To the extent that these commitments are desirable, as they clearly are, they also have to be financed. Given
the probable size of these flows in the immediate years ahead, it is unlikely
that net investment income will be large enough to cover them, to say nothing of a trade deficit as well. Thus a trade surplus will be required if our goal
is external balance. Moreover, export growth will permit imports to expand.
For the long run the optimal policy toward exports, as well as toward imports, is one directed to achieving efficient resource allocation within a
system of generally balanced international payments.
The preferred means of correcting any disequilibrium that might arise in
a nation's balance of payments is through a change in its exchange rate. This
method, unlike other ways of restoring equilibrium, does not distort the
relationships among transactions: All sellers and all buyers of foreign exchange are affected alike. A change in the exchange rate of the dollar was the
process used by the United States in 1971 to correct its balance-of-payments
deficit.
However, in a world where trade and investment flows are subject to either
special impediments or incentives, more direct measures to stimulate exports may sometimes be justified. Legislation to authorize Domestic International Sales Corporations and steps to expand export credit facilities are
examples of such measures.
Domestic International Sales Corporations
The provisions of American and foreign tax laws in many cases have provided an incentive for U.S. firms selling abroad to establish production facilities overseas. U.S. tax liability is not incurred on income earned abroad until
it is repatriated, and effective foreign tax rates are often less than those in
the United States. Exporters from domestic sources, on the other hand, face
immediate tax liability.
This imbalance has been removed in part by the Revenue Act of 1971.
Under provisions of the new law U.S. exporters will be able to enjoy tax
treatment comparable to that of U.S. producers located abroad. The law provides for formation of a new type of corporation to be known as a Domestic
International Sales Corporation (DISC). Taxes on 50 percent of a DISC's
income may be deferred indefinitely, provided that 95 percent of the DISC's
receipts and assets relate to qualified exports. Loans to a parent company to
finance research and development expenditures, inventory accumulation,
or investment in plant and equipment can be counted as export-related assets,




167

so long as the proportion which these loans bear to total expenditures for
such purposes does not exceed the proportion of the borrower's total sales accounted for by exports. Dividends to DISC stockholders are to be fully taxed.
The Administration's 1971 proposal concerning DISC underwent two
major changes in Congress. First, the 100-percent deferral originally requested by the Administration was reduced to 50 percent. Second, Congress
added a proviso to discourage a DISC from investing tax deferred income in
foreign production facilities. In the bill enacted, the tax deferral on any DISC
profits which are lent to parent companies will be terminated if such profits
are judged to have been invested in foreign plant and equipment.
The potential for tax deferral in a DISC is intended to provide U.S. exporters with tax advantages similar to various advantages provided exporters
in other countries. The availability of DISC will also blunt one incentive
that has existed for U.S. firms to locate production facilities abroad rather
than at home.
Export Credit Facilities
The competitive position of sellers in different countries for third-country
export markets is influenced by the export credit facilities they can offer,
and many governments have taken measures to provide especially advantageous financing for exports. In the United States export credit facilities are
influenced by general monetary policy, by various banking regulations, by
the operations of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and by policies of other
governmental financing and procurement agencies. Apart from monetary
and pricing policies which led to an easing of interest costs for all borrowers
in 1971, two steps were taken which increased the special credit facilities
for exporting.
On August 17 legislation was enacted to exempt export credits from the
Voluntary Foreign Credit Restraint guidelines administered by the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The formula announced by the
Board of Governors in November freed both bank and nonbank financial
institutions to expand their lending for exports. It was also designed to
remove some existing or potential inequities among the institutions participating in the program.
Legislation passed in August removed Export-Import Bank receipts and
disbursements from Federal unified budget totals and provided new leeway
for the Bank's export financing activities. New short- and intermediate-term
discount programs, together with activity under its other programs, should
increase the Bank's total authorizations for loans, guarantees, and insurance
from $5.4 billion in fiscal 1971 to $11.5 billion in fiscal 1973.
EASING THE ADJUSTMENT TO IMPORTS
Changes in the volume and composition of a country's imports usually
reflect underlying changes in incomes, tastes, or comparative costs. The release of resources from industries that lose their competitiveness is offset by
expansion in industries that become more competitive. The value of total




168

production is increased by the reallocation of resources to what have become
more productive uses.
In some cases, however, imports increase so rapidly that they displace
domestic resources faster than these can be transferred to other uses. Public
policy cannot ignore such disruptions to individual markets or areas, particularly if there is general excess productive capacity and limited opportunities
for resources to shift. Positive programs of adjustment assistance are then required to facilitate the necessary transfer of resources into other uses and to
ease the financial stress on the workers and owners involved. The adjustments
can also be moderated by controlling the pace at which imports are permitted
to increase.
Moderation of imports through arrangements with the main suppliers is
a technique that has been used for several years both here and abroad. U.S.
steel imports are now subject to such agreements. Cotton textiles and certain
meats have been for some time subject to intergovernmental agreements.
Government agreements to limit the rate of growth of manmade and woolen
fiber apparel and textiles were concluded in 1971.
Imports of textiles and apparel have long constituted a special
problem for the United States. On the one hand, textiles have an important
place in the budget of all Americans, and the benefits of low-cost imported
products are widely shared. On the other hand, the 2.3 million persons employed in the textile and apparel industry in the United States tend to have
characteristics that make adjustment to new employment especially difficult.
The rate of growth of cotton textile shipments to the United States came
under regulation in the multilateral Long Term Arrangement on Cotton
Textiles of 1962. Imports of yarns, fabrics, and apparel made of wool and
manmade fibers, however, have continued to grow at a rapid rate. The
volume of imports of manmade fiber textiles increased more than seven times
between 1964 and 1970; and in the first 6 months of 1971 the flow increased
almost 80 percent above the level of the corresponding period a year earlier.
After especially difficult negotiations, memoranda of understanding were
signed in October with the governments of Japan, the Republic of China,
Korea, and Hong Kong, the leading sources of supply. Under the terms of
these memoranda, the parties agreed to limit their exports of manmade fiber
and wool textiles to this country. The agreements limit the growth rates for
various categories of these imports to levels in the range of 5 to 7.5 percent
per annum. Such rates, while much lower than the growth rates recently
experienced, still somewhat exceed the growth in the U.S. market. The
agreements are intended, therefore, to provide time for the domestic industry
to adjust, while still permitting American consumers increasingly to enjoy the
benefits of low-cost imported supplies.
The use by the United States of voluntary agreements with foreign governments or private groups to restrain shipments to the U.S. market has
some attractions over other forms of import restraint such as tariffs or
import quotas. Tariffs and quotas are often subject to international treaties




169

and agreements, and further resort to them may also require legislative
action. Restraints that are built into law have often become permanent even
when the original need for restraint was itself only a temporary one. In
contrast, the technique of requesting foreign suppliers voluntarily to limit
their sales in the United States is simpler and avoids the complications
of law.
However, voluntary agreements also have serious disadvantages. While
the limitation of foreign supplies in the U.S. market lifts domestic prices
for the goods above what they would otherwise have been, thereby providing
the intended relief to domestic sellers, the higher prices that American users pay in this instance are not offset through the higher government
tax revenues that would have been collected had higher tariffs been used to
achieve the same purpose. It is also not clear that voluntary agreements are
always easy to remove. In order to make the restraints operative, suppliers
need to coordinate their production and sales plans. In the past, export
restraint mechanisms have frequently been used as instruments of monopoly
power. Dissolving them has without exception been extraordinarily difficult. The fact that they originate now under duress from the buyers rather
than from the volition of sellers may not in the end change their character.
There is a more fundamental danger in too widespread a use of the export
restraint technique. This is the additional threat it poses to hopes for
a world organized predominantly on free-enterprise principles. Marketoriented societies can be efficient and progressive when competitive
forces are present to inhibit the exercise of arbitrary power. But competition requires nurture. Voluntary agreements which encourage
foreign sellers to organize in order to restrain their American sales
foster those cartels and exporters' organizations which we have for many
years sought to eliminate. Clearly voluntary agreements need to be used with
circumspection.
The need to protect U.S. industries from market disruptions in the near
future will be reduced significantly by the recent realignment of currencies.
Products imported from Japan and many Western European countries will
be higher priced in U.S. markets as a result of the revaluations of these
currencies. At the same time, the impetus to U.S. export industries from
the currency realignments, together with the general thrust of economic
expansion, will provide more varied and more productive alternative uses
for resources now employed in the industries most vulnerable to imports.
AGRICULTURAL TRADE
International trade in agricultural commodities continues to be impeded by
a variety of import restrictions. The economic and social conditions in nearly
every major industrialized country present serious problems of adjustment for
resources employed in agriculture, quite apart from international trade
considerations. Most governments have responded to this problem by
adopting domestic price-support measures that are supplemented by restric-




170

tive trade policies. Tensions over these policies have been growing and surfaced prominently in 1971.
Unlike trade in manufactured products, agricultural trade received little
substantive attention in the successive rounds of negotiations which reduced international tariff barriers in the postwar years. Indeed, many developed countries, including the United States, pursued domestic agricultural
policies that resulted in an increased level of protection against agricultural
imports. This was particularly true in the European Community, where
internal prices have been pegged substantially above import prices through a
complex system of import levies and export subsidies.
During 1971 the United Kingdom, partly in preparation for EC membership, moved from a consumer-oriented, relatively liberal, import policy
toward the EC system by raising minimum import prices on grains and other
commodities. The support price to Japanese rice producers was nearly doubled during the 1960's and is one reason why Japan is no longer a significant
importer but instead faces burdensome rice surpluses.
The United States has a significant comparative advantage in many
agricultural products and therefore has a clear interest in reducing existing
impediments to trade in these products. It is also clear that price-support
techniques now used in most industrial countries, including the United
States, are major impediments to the development of freer trade in
agriculture.
Agricultural support policies in the United States have been substantially
modified in recent years. Direct payments have been substituted for high
price supports for major grains and cotton, commodities that are traditionally
exported. This change has permitted market forces to have more influence
over actual prices and has reduced the necessity for large export subsidies and
import restrictions. The Agricultural Act of 1970 extends these reforms and
improves upon them by giving farmers greater freedom in their planning
decisions.
Despite these reforms a number of commodities continue to receive support through the price mechanism, and pose problems for a liberal trade
policy. Price supports for milk, for example, have been increased over 50
percent in the past 6 years. Partly for this reason and partly because of distortions in world markets caused by similar programs abroad, most dairy
imports are now subject to quotas. Four additional dairy products were
brought under quotas beginning in 1971. Also, like most developed countries,
the United States maintains a sugar program that encourages domestic
production through high internal prices. Quotas limit imports and
thereby support internal prices. The U.S. sugar program was extended
for 3 years in 1971. Several traditional export commodities are supported by limitations on production and substantial export subsidies.
About 60 percent of our rice production, for instance, is exported with the
aid of export subsidies and concessional sales to developing countries.




171

There is now realization that agricultural trade is an important item on
the negotiating agenda. There is also agreement that freer trade in agricultural products can occur only if the basic problem of agricultural adjustment
and the techniques for providing assistance to farmers are dealt with in an
international context. As the President's Commission on International Trade
and Investment Policy stated, "the time is ripe for a concerted international
effort to deal with all aspects of the problem including, in particular, the
levels and techniques of agricultural support."
The Commission's analysis, and work done elsewhere, suggest the following important guidelines for future negotiations on agricultural trade:
—Discussions over agricultural trade policies will be unproductive
until domestic techniques of support are modified.
—New policies will be needed to aid the adjustment of some resources,
particularly low-income workers, to more productive and higher income pursuits.
—Importing countries must participate with exporting countries in facilitating adjustment if an improvement in the international use of
resources is to be obtained.
—While each country must be free to provide income assistance to those
employed in agriculture, the mechanisms for this assistance should
minimize interference with production, consumption, and trade.
EAST-WEST TRADE
The widening of the political dialogue between the United States and
Communist nations in 1971 was accompanied by trade expansion measures.
Commercial relations between state-controlled and free-enterprise economies present problems unlike those which are experienced in trade between
predominantly market-oriented economies. Private firms, for example, can
be at a disadvantage in dealing with large state-trading agencies, and legal
recourse by individual firms against foreign states may be difficult. It is
awkward to apply commercial policy codes that have been negotiated among
governments of market-oriented countries—such as those embodied in the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade—to rigorously socialized states.
And the Communist countries can more readily employ economic relationships for political ends than is possible for the free-enterprise states. Furthermore, legislation in the United States and elsewhere places restrictions on
private and public trade and credit in connection with Communist countries. And regulations in both the Communist countries and the West restrict
the movement of trade representatives. Finally, the Communist states are
not party to a number of important international economic organizations and
conventions.
Several significant changes occurred in U.S. trading relationships with
the Communist countries in 1971. The President's announcements that he
would visit Peking and Moscow in 1972 were preceded by a proclamation
in June lifting the embargo on imports from the People's Republic of China




172

and freeing a long list of U.S. goods for export to that area. A requirement that 50 percent of U.S. exports of wheat, flour, and other grains to
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union be carried in U.S. vessels was also
lifted. The termination of this requirement facilitated the sale in November
of over $125 million in U.S. feed grains to the Soviet Union—the first such
grain sales since 1964. An amendment to the Export-Import Bank Act in
August authorized the President to extend Export-Import Bank credits to
further exports to Communist countries when he finds this to be in the
national interest. In his first use of this authority, the President directed the
Bank to participate in financing exports to Rumania.
Two Soviet Deputy Ministers of Foreign Trade visited the United States
in 1971, and at the end of the year the U.S. Secretary of Commerce led
a trade delegation from this country to Moscow and Warsaw. U.S.-Soviet
talks on trade and shipping are to be continued in 1972.
GENERALIZED PREFERENCES FOR EXPORTS OF DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES
In October 1969 the President voiced his support for the adoption by all
developed countries of a liberal system of generalized tariff preferences for
the exports of lower-income countries. The step is seen as a means of facilitating the economic growth of less developed areas by encouraging their integration into an interdependent world economy. It is also a means of reversing
the trend toward specialized preferences whereby a limited number of developing countries have secured access to the markets of particular developed
countries, especially those in the European Community. All too often this
has occurred in conjunction with "reverse preferences" which open the
developing countries' markets in a discriminator)7 way. Proposals made by
the members of the OECD were accepted in 1970 by the United Nations
General Assembly as a "mutually acceptable" basis for the establishment of
a generalized preference system. The European Community and Japan have
initiated systems based on their proposals.
Action on Generalized Preferences by the United States was delayed in
1971 by the unsatisfactory state of the balance of payments. The agreement
of December 18 on exchange-rate realignment, in moderating the potential
balance-of-payments problem for the near future, enabled the President on
December 21 to announce his intention to submit Generalized Preference
legislation to Congress in 1972.
A POSITIVE PROGRAM FOR FREER TRADE
In international trade, as in domestic trade, increased specialization and
exchange offer prospects for large gains in productivity. Imports enrich both
consumption and investment by increasing the variety of products available
to users and by lowering their costs. At the same time imports into a country
provide the funds with which other countries can purchase its exports. Re-

173

12

ductions in impediments to freer flows of trade, therefore, lead to higher
standards of living which are widely shared.
To prevent the changes in patterns of production and consumption which
accompany a growing interchange of goods and services from being disruptive, it is important that market adjustments of two kinds take place
efficiently:
1. When imbalances develop between the growth of exports and imports,
and if these lead to an overall payments imbalance, a mechanism is necessary to bring about corrections. Variations of international exchange rates,
by realigning costs and prices among countries, constitute one very efficient
process.
2. When changes in demand patterns call for changes in the patterns
of production and employment, a mechanism of internal adjustment is
needed to make sure that capital and labor in industries which lose market
position can shift readily to growing opportunities in other fields.
In 1971 the United States initiated major steps to improve both of these
forms of adjustment. Important measures were taken in the international
monetary field, notably a significant realignment of exchange rates and a
broadening of the band within which exchange rates can move freely.
In the domestic economy, general policies were adopted to curb inflation
and to expand economic activity and employment opportunities, and work
was begun to develop broader arrangements for assisting adjustment by
firms and workers affected by the liberalization of trade.
Measures were also taken which can enhance the contribution which two
major sectors of the economy make to exports.
One of these sectors is high-technology industry. Such industries require
large investments in research and development. This Nation's comparative
advantage in the sector depends on its continued technological leadership.
To maintain this leadership the Administration has developed proposals to
stimulate research and development investment.
The other sector is agriculture. The potential for U.S. agricultural exports
is not now realized because serious impediments bar the way to increased
trade in agricultural products, mainly in the form of high price supports in
important markets abroad. While U.S. agricultural policy has been substantially revised in recent years, away from high price support programs, corresponding action has not been taken in other countries. Negotiations are in
progress which have as their goal the reduction of impediments to agricultural trade.
Most of the postwar growth in international trade has come from increased exchange of manufactured products, and it has taken place among
the developed nations of the world. As less developed countries move away
from heavy reliance on primary production into manufacturing activities,
they too will need to participate more actively in the interchange of manufactures. Agreement has been reached among the developed countries of




174

the world, and between them and less developed countries, on a program
through which exports from less developed countries will be given preferential treatment in developed country markets. In the implementation of
this program the United States is seeking to minimize the discrimination
which developed countries apply to such imports by source and to eliminate
the practice by which "reverse preferences" have been granted by some of
the developing countries to some developed ones. Legislation to implement
a U.S. program in this area is in preparation.
Over the past 20 years the major economies of the world, including the
United States, have enjoyed very high rates of growth in output and income.
These rates have been higher than anyone predicted at the end of World
War II and clearly higher than could have been predicted on the basis of
experience prior to that time. One reason that these gains have been possible
has been the rapid expansion in the interchange of goods and services that
has been brought about by a steady dismantling of impediments to international trade.
Continued progress toward further reductions in existing barriers will
require positive policies by both the United States and its trading partners.
The international monetary arrangements will have to be made more flexible to accommodate unpredictable changes in world production and consumption patterns. At the same time domestic and international policies will
have to provide a milieu of expanding employment opportunities in order
to facilitate the reabsorption of resources displaced by change.
If both sets of policies are successful, the shifts which result from change
will cease to be feared as harmful dislocations and will be recognized as part
of a desirable movement toward higher economic benefits in which most
people share.

Report to the President on the Activities of the
Council of Economic Advisers During 1971
During 1971 a far-reaching program in economic policy was put in place,
the most far-reaching in the postwar period. The Council contributed to the
formulation and implementation of this program and also continued to
participate in many policy-oriented activities of Government.
Significant changes in the membership of the Council took place during
the year. Hendrik S. Houthakker resigned in July to return to his position as
Professor of Economics at Harvard University. He was succeeded by Ezra
Solomon, whose appointment was confirmed by the Senate on June 17.
Mr. Solomon is on leave from Stanford University, where he is the Dean
Witter Professor of Finance.

ECONOMIC POLICYMAKING AND THE COUNCIL OF
ECONOMIC ADVISERS
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COUNCIL
The central responsibilities of the Council continued to be to provide the
President with information and analysis of economic conditions, to evaluate
economic policy, and to make recommendations designed to foster the goals
of the Employment Act of 1946. In this act the Congress has declared that
"it is the continuing policy and responsibility of the Federal Government
to use all practicable means consistent with its needs and obligations and
other essential considerations of national policy . . . to promote maximum
employment, production, and purchasing power." The challenge of economic policy in 1971 was to make progress toward the stipulated objectives
of the Employment Act while at the same time recognizing such "other essential considerations of national policy" as strengthening the basis for a more
stable price level and improving our external payments position.
The President is kept informed of economic developments and of the
Council's views through personal discussions and memoranda from the
Chairman. Presentations and written comments are also made to the Cabinet and Domestic Affairs Council, the Cabinet Committee on Economic
Policy, the "Troika," the "Quadriad," other Administration officials, and
the Congress. Such communications reflect a continued, careful monitoring
of current economic developments and projections by the use of a variety of
statistical and analytical tools.
The Council staff works with other agencies to appraise existing activities of the Federal Government and to develop new programs. It also reviews
bills proposed for action by the Congress and submits recommendations. The
Council's recommendations give particular attention to economic implications of prospective programs and actions. During 1971, the Council formally expressed opinions on about 200 bills in various stages of the legislative
process.
As in previous years, the Council and its staff participated in the Administration's examination and formulation of programs and policies in many
areas. These were directed toward such matters as energy, environmental
quality, international trade and finance, research and development, transportation, trade adjustment assistance, and assistance to communities affected by defense cutbacks. The Council also provided leadership to interagency studies of the problems in particular industries and in relation to
particular products, notably steel and timber.
In addition to this variety of ongoing activities, the Council helped to
design the comprehensive new economic program that was instituted to
deal simultaneously with domestic and international problems affecting the
U.S. economy. Subsequent to its adoption, members and the staff helped to
resolve questions which arose early in the operation of the new program, to
explain the program to the public, and to develop the policies further.




182

POLICY COORDINATION
The Council and its staff maintained close contact with other Government officials in order to share viewpoints and coordinate policy activities.
Communication between the Treasury Department, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Council of Economic Advisers continued to be
closely coordinated. The Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the
Office of Management and Budget, and the Chairman of the Council,
known collectively as the "Troika," met frequently to discuss economic
developments and policy issues. There are also second- and third-tier Troika
groups. The second tier consists of one of the other two Council Members,
the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, and the
Economist for the Office of Management and Budget. The third tier comprises senior staff economists from the three agencies. Memoranda on the
outlook were prepared periodically in 1971 by the latter group and submitted to the second tier of the Troika for approval before transmission to
the three agency heads. The President met regularly with the Troika, and
from time to time the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System joined Troika meetings, thus forming the "Quadriad."
One of the vehicles for coordinating broad economic policies within the
Executive Office is the Cabinet Committee on Economic Policy, established
by Executive Order of the President on January 24, 1969. Members include
the President, the Vice President, the Secretaries of the Treasury, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, and Housing and Urban Development, the
Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers, and the Deputy Under Secretary of State
for Economic Affairs. The Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers
coordinates the work of the Committee.
In 1971 the Chairman of the Council continued to serve as a member of
the Domestic Affairs Council and as Chairman of its Subcommittee on
the National Energy Situation. The Chairman also served as a member of
the Property Review Board, the National Commission on Productivity, the
Defense Programs Review Committee, and the Regulations and Purchasing
Review Board. Reflecting the Council's wide range of interests, the other
two members and the Senior Staff Economists also participated in a number
of inter agency committees, task forces, and study groups.
The Council's active role in the development of the new economic program began with the meetings that preceded the President's address on
August 15. The Chairman served as Vice Chairman of the Cost of Living
Council and, during the period of the freeze, as Chairman of the Executive
Policy Committee of the Cost of Living Council. Mr. Stein headed the Task
Force of the Cost of Living Council which prepared recommendations to
the Council for a program to follow the freeze.
The Council of Economic Advisers testified several times during the year
before the Joint Economic Committee, a committee with which the Council
has a particularly close association. In accordance with annual practice,




183

testimony on the economic outlook was presented by the three Council
Members on February 5 following submission of the Economic Report to
Congress. On February 18 the Chairman joined the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget in testimony
before the Senate Appropriations Committee; similar testimony was given
before the House Appropriations Committee on February 24. The Chairman
appeared before the Subcommittee on Foreign Economic Policy of the Joint
Economic Committee on June 29 to discuss issues related to the role of the
United States in the world economy. Testimony was also given by the Chairman and by Mr. Stein before the Joint Economic Committee on July 8
concerning the state of the economy at midyear, and on August 30 the Chairman testified concerning the new program for domestic and international
economic policy. In addition, the Chairman presented testimony on June 15
to the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs in regard to the
national energy situation; and on December 7 he appeared before the
House Public Works Committee to discuss issues involved in amending the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act.
In the international sphere, Council Members and staff took part in
meetings of the Economic Policy Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The Chairman of the Council was
again head of the U.S. delegation to meetings of the Economic Policy Committee, and in 1971 he served this Committee as Vice Chairman. Through
this Committee, member nations seek better understanding and coordination
of their domestic economic policies. The Council Members and Senior Staff
Economists also participated in several subcommittees of the Economic
Policy Committee, including Working Party III on the balance of payments
and international financial problems, the Working Party Group on ShortTerm Economic Prospects, Working Party IV on inflation, Working Party
II on promotion of long-term economic growth, and the Manpower and
Social Affairs Committee on problems and policies relating to manpower
and the labor market.
The Chairman of the Council was also a member of the U.S. delegation
which engaged in joint Cabinet discussions with Japan in September.
NATIONAL COMMISSION ON PRODUCTIVITY
The National Commission on Productivity was established by the President in June 1970 to recommend ways to improve productivity in the American economy. Members represent industry, labor, agriculture, the public,
and State, local, and Federal governments. The Director of the Office of
Management and Budget acts as Chairman. Other Federal Government
representatives are the Secretaries of the Treasury, Commerce, and Labor,
the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and the Special Assistant
to the President for Consumer Affairs. The staff of the Commission at the
end of 1971 included an Executive Director and three other professional
members. The Commission received administrative services from the Council of Economic Advisers, and its budget was included in the budget of the




184

Council in fiscal year 1972. The Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, as
amended and extended in December 1971, sets forth a number of objectives
for the Commission and contains authorization for appropriations to carry
out its activities during the period ending April 30, 1973.
PUBLICATIONS
The annual Economic Report is the principal means by which the Council provides the public with information and analysis of economic conditions
and policies. About 50,000 copies of the February 1971 Economic Report
have been distributed. The Statistical Office of the Council prepares Economic Indicators, which is issued monthly by the Joint Economic Committee. Approximately 10,000 copies of this publication are currently circulated.
NEEDED LEGISLATION
The Employment Act of 1946 requires that the Economic Report be
transmitted to the Congress not later than January 20 of each year. It is
also a statutory requirement that the Budget be sent to the Congress "during
the first 15 days of each regular session"; customarily the Economic Report
is presented a few days after the Budget. The fact that in recent years the
Congress has not convened until after mid-January, however, has resulted
in a later date for the transmission of the Budget and hence for the Economic
Report as well. These later dates for the convening of the Congress and the
transmission of the Budget have repeatedly necessitated a joint resolution of
the Congress to permit the Economic Report to be presented after the statutory deadline of January 20. Accordingly, it would be advisable to amend
the Employment Act of 1946 to provide that the Economic Report shall be
transmitted to the Congress not later than 15 days after the Budget. This
would retain the desirable features of a deadline, but would automatically
ensure its consistency with whatever date the Congress might set to conyene.
PUBLIC CONTACTS
From time to time during the year the Council met with groups of
academic, business, and labor economists to discuss questions of mutual
interest. Many individuals, including businessmen, labor leaders, foreign
visitors, students, and educators, also visited Council Members for discussions. Another important channel of communication was the substantial
number of speeches on economic developments and policy made throughout the year by Council Members and Senior Staff Economists. Finally,
continuing contacts were maintained with representatives of the news media
through personal interviews and telephone conversations.
ORGANIZATION AND STAFF OF THE COUNCIL
OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN
The Chairman is responsible for reporting the Council's views to the
President, as officially provided by the Employment Act, as amended by
Reorganization Plan No. 9 in 1953. This duty was discharged through
direct consultations with the President and written comments on economic




185

developments and policy considerations. The Chairman also represented
the Council at Cabinet meetings and at many other formal meetings and
other contacts with Government officials. He also exercised ultimate responsibility for directing the work of the professional staff.
COUNCIL MEMBERS
The other two Council Members directly supervised the work of the
professional staff. Although the Council is not organized into departments,
there has been an informal division of responsibilities by subject area.
Mr. Stein's areas in 1971 included forecasting and analysis of economic conditions, medium-term economic projections, fiscal policy and taxation, Federal
budget matters, Federal credit programs, monetary policy, financial institutions, welfare and social security, agriculture, defense, manpower, and
wages and industrial relations.
Responsibility for directing the work in international finance and trade
policy, foreign aid and economic development, transportation and regulated
industries, individual price behavior, technology, environment, antitrust,
health and education, housing, private finance, energy, and urban
and regional problems was handled by Mr. Solomon in 1971 after
Mr. Houthakker resigned.
PROFESSIONAL STAFF
At the end of 1971 the professional staff consisted of 14 Senior Staff
Economists, two Statisticians, five Junior Economists, and two Research
Assistants. Members of the professional staff were responsible for economic
analyses and policy recommendations in major subject areas involving the
Council's interests and responsibilities. In addition, Staff Economists carried
out many different Council and interagency assignments requiring a broad
application of their general knowledge and analytical skills. The professional
staff and their special fields at the end of the year were:

of meetings throughout the year. She also handled the fact checking of
memoranda, testimony, and speeches. Dorothy Bagovich, Catherine H. Furlong, V. Madge McMahon, and Natalie V. Rentfro assisted Miss James.
The Council also conducted a student intern program, employing a limited number of promising students of economics, both graduate and undergraduate, for various periods but particularly during the summer months.

Note.—Data in Tables B-27 through B-33 are based on reports from employing establishments and relate to full- and
part-time wage and salary workers in nonagricultural establishments who worked during, or received pay for, any part of
the pay period which includes the 12th of the month.
Not comparable with labor force data (Tables B-22 through B-25), which include proprietors, self-employed persons,
domestic servants, and unpaid family workers, and which count persons as employed when they are not at work because
of industrial disputes, bad weather, etc.
For description and details of the various establishment data, see "Employment and Earnings."

iExcludes agricultural business; real estate operators; medical, legal, educational, and cultural service; and nonprofit
organizations. These figures do not agree precisely with the fixed investment data in the gross national product estimates,
mainly because those data include investment by farmers, professionals, institutions, and real estate firms, and certain
outlays charged to current account.
2Commercial and other includes trade, service, construction, finance, and insurance.
s Estimates based on expected capital expenditures reported by business in October-December 1971. Includes
adjustments when necessary for systematic tendencies in expectations data.
Note.—Annual total is the sum of unadjusted expenditures; it does not necessarily coincide with the average of seasonally adjusted figures.

is included beginning with 1951, and the debts of the Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Intermediate Credit
Banks, and Banks for Cooperatives are included beginning with 1968.

Annual data are average equity for the year (using four end-of-quarter figures).
Note.—For explanatory notes concerning compilation of the series, see "Quarterly Financial Report for Manufacturing
Corporations," Federal Trade Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission.
Data are not necessarily comparable from one period to another due to changes in accounting procedures, industry
classifications, sampling procedures, etc. Specific information about the effects of the more significant changes and revisions is contained in the following issues of the "Quarterly Financial Report": third quarter 1953, third quarter 1956,
first quarter 1959, and first quarter 1965.

1 The figures shown here for internal sources, undistributed profits, and capital consumption allowances differ from
those shown for cash flow, net of dividends, undistributed profits, and capital consumption allowances in the gross corporate product table in the national income and product accounts of the Department of Commerce for the following reasons:
(1) these figures include, and the statistics in the gross corporate product table exclude, branch profits remitted from
foreigners net of corresponding U.S. remittances to foreigners; and (2) these figures exclude, and the gross corporate
product figures include, the internal funds of corporations whose major activity is farming.
2
Foreign investment excludes amounts financed by bond issues abroad, and bond issues outside the U.S. are excluded
from financial sources of funds above.

3 Includes Federal agency issues.
Receivables from and payables to U.S. Government do not include amounts offset against each other on corporations'
books or amounts arising from subcontracting which are not directly due from or to the U.S. Government. Wherever possible,

* I ncludes marketable investments (other than Government securities and time certificates of deposit) as well as sundry
current assets.
* Generally reflects definitions and classifications used in "Statistics of Income" for 1961.
Note.—Data relate to all U.S. corporations, excluding banks, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, and beginning with the new series for 1961, investment companies. Year-end data through 1967 are based on
"Statistics of Income" (Treasury Department), covering virtually all corporations in the United States. "Statistics of
Income" data may not be strictly comparable from year to year because of changes in the tax laws, basis for filing returns,
and processing of data for compilation purposes. All other figures shown are estimates based on data compiled from many
different sources, including data on corporations registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
