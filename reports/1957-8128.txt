LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL
THE WHITE HOUSE,

January 23,1957.
To the Congress of the United States:
I present herewith my Economic Report, as required by Section 3 (a)
of the Employment Act of 1946.
In preparing this Report, I have received the assistance and advice of
the Council of Economic Advisers. I have also had the advice of the heads
of the executive departments and independent agencies of the Government.
I set forth below, essentially in the words of the Report itself, what I
consider to be its major conclusions and recommendations.
Opportunity and Responsibility in a Free Economy
The vast productive power of the American economy was demonstrated
again in 1956 in a record national output of $412 billion of goods and
services.
In addition to providing this material basis for better living, our free
economy gives indispensable support to our form of political life and offers
unparalleled opportunities to the individual for personal choice and
development.
Important responsibilities accompany these opportunities. They are
borne in part by Government, but they must be borne also by the individual
in his own economic activity and in his organized activity with others.
Government must use all practicable means to promote high levels of
production and employment, and to contribute toward achieving an expanding and widely-shared national income, earned in dollars of stable
buying power. It must pursue policies that encourage the enterprising
spirit of our people and protect incentives to work, to save, and to invest.
It must exercise a strict discipline over its expenditures and avoid taking
in taxes too much of the incomes of individuals and businesses. It must
strive to strengthen competitive markets and to facilitate the adjustments
necessary in a dynamic economy.
Even more exacting are the responsibilities of individuals and economic
groups. Business managements should formulate and carry out their plans
so as to contribute to steady economic growth. They must also recognize
the broad public interest in the prices set on their products and services.




in

Both management and labor should remove restrictions on the operation
of competitive markets and enhance the economy's adaptability to change.
Of particular importance in a prosperous economy is the responsibility of
leaders of business and labor to reach agreements on wages and other
labor benefits that are consistent with productivity prospects and with the
maintenance of a stable dollar.
Reliance for stability in economic growth cannot be placed exclusively on
the fiscal and monetary policies of Government. The successful extension
of prosperity with price stability calls for a cooperative effort in which the
policies of individuals and economic groups and of all levels of government
are consistent with one another and mutually reinforcing.
Economic Growth and Improvement,

1953-56

The opportunities which our free economy provides for the improvement
of well-being are clearly evident in the record of the last four years. Civilian
employment increased by about 3.7 million. Per capita personal income
measured in constant dollars rose 10 percent after taxes. Five million
homes were built and home ownership became more widespread. Rising
incomes enabled consumers to expand their purchases of virtually all types
of goods and to make important improvements in their own provisions for
financial security. Participation in, and support of, religious, cultural, educational, and civic activities increased significantly.
Great strides were taken in the expansion and improvement of the Nation's productive facilities. Business firms and farmers spent over $150
billion for this purpose. These investment outlays contain the promise of
greater national output and better living in the years ahead.
Agriculture has faced difficult problems in this period, resulting chiefly
from the persistent tendency for production to exceed commercial demands.
Progress has been made, however, toward a better balanced farm economy,
and there has been some recent improvement in farm income. To sustain
agricultural progress, experience suggests that continued emphasis is needed
on the basic objectives of the last four yearsâ€”wider freedom for our commercial farmers in managing their own enterprises, appropriate shifts in the
use of the Nation's cropland, an improved system of price supports, and
research into new products, markets, and uses.
The period was marked by economic improvement throughout the free
world and by a notable expansion of international trade and finance, including our own exports and imports. Sharp increases have occurred in
our exports to industrialized countries with high per capita incomes and to
others currently experiencing a rapid rate of economic growth. This fact
shows that prosperity elsewhere widens markets for the products of our
farms, mines, and factories.
The contributions that Government can make toward the achievement
of stable economic growth have been evident during the last four years.




IV

The 1953-54 experience demonstrated that, when consumer and business
confidence is maintained, timely public policies can help keep recessionary
tendencies in check. The Government policies followed in 1955 and 1956
helped to moderate the upward pressure on prices and to prevent conditions
that would threaten economic stability.
The Economy in 1956
The Nation's aggregate output of goods and services in 1956 was $21.5
billion greater than in 1955, despite a decrease in activity in some sectors
of the economy, notably in automobile production and home construction.
Heavy expenditures for new plant and equipment by business concerns,
increases in foreign trade and investment, a high rate of consumer expenditures, and rising outlays by State and local governments contributed to the
expansion. About half of the increase represented a gain in physical output,
and the remainder reflected moderately higher prices.
Sizable gains in employment were made in important sectors of the
economy; for the year as a whole, there was an increase of 1.8 million over
1955 in total civilian employment. Incomes rose for all major groups of
income recipients.
As the year progressed, farm income improved. There were further advances in the value of farm land, in the net worth of farm proprietors, and
in agricultural exports. Farm technology continued to improve.
Financial markets and prices were under continuous pressure. Interest
rates rose as the demand for credit continued large relative to the supply
of funds. The unusually heavy demands of business concerns tended to
raise prices of capital goods and related commodities. High costs of raw
materials and wage increases that tended to outrun the year's small gain in
productivity were pervasive factors making for higher prices.
Pressures on prices, costs, and financial resources in 1956 called for the
continuation of policies designed to counter inflationary forces. The Federal Government's budget surplus contributed to this end, as did the credit
restraints imposed by the Federal Reserve System. The events of the year
showed, however, that when production and employment are high, wage
and price increases in important industries can create upward pressures on
costs and prices generally, and that the monetary and fiscal policies of Government must be supported by appropriate private policies to assure both a
high level of economic activity and stable prices.
Extending and Broadening Economic Progress
This Report outlines legislative proposals designed to carry out the
declared policy of the Employment Act. They include measures to
strengthen our enterprise system, enlarge our national resources, and improve the level of living.




Government can strengthen the enterprise system at this time by preserving a balanced budget. Accordingly, the Congress should continue tax rates
at their present levels, and Federal expenditures should be strictly limited.
Our enterprise system would also be strengthened by legislative measures
to assist small businesses and to foster competition. These measures, which
the Congress is urged to consider, include extension of the Small Business Act
beyond June 30, 1957; easier access of small- and medium-sized companies
to capital markets; such tax adjustments as can be made with a minimum
loss of revenue; and reduction of the burden of paperwork imposed by
Government. The Congress is also urged to provide for needed improvements in the antitrust laws and in the procedures available to enforcement
agencies.
Recent changes in our financial structure and practices call for careful
study of the adequacy of existing facilities for meeting the Nation's capital
and credit requirements and of the means for exercising appropriate controls over credit. As requested in the State of the Union Message, the Congress should authorize a National Monetary and Financial Commission to
perform this important task.
Our enterprise system would benefit from United States membership in
the Organization for Trade Cooperation and participation in the International Atomic Energy Agency, and from continuation of economic
assistance, including defense support, under the Mutual Security Program.
Additional measures are required to enlarge and improve our national
resources. The partnership principle, which encourages local leadership
and participation in the development of water and power resources, should
continue to be given close attention in current authorizations and appropriations.
To aid agricultural adjustments, recommendations will be made to the
Congress for an improved acreage-allotment and price-support program
for corn, and for steps to deal with problems of land use and water shortage
accentuated by recent drought conditions. Extension of Title I of the
Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act for one year, and a
limited increase in permissible losses, would be a useful short-run measure
for helping reduce surplus stocks of farm commodities.
The Congress is again requested to enact a program of Federal assistance
for developing the economic base of local areas experiencing persistent
unemployment.
No proposal for enlarging our national resources is more important than
that for Federal assistance in overcoming the critical shortage of schoolrooms. The Congress is urged to enact a program which would help meet
the backlog of these needs within four years. After that time full responsibility for school construction should revert to the State and local
governments.




VI

Further advances in the level of living would be accomplished by measures
to raise the Nation's standards of housing, health, and personal security.
Home building and ownership would be aided by an adjustment that would
bring the maximum interest rate on VA-guaranteed home loans into closer
conformity with competitive market rates; by an increase of funds for the
secondary market operations of the Federal National Mortgage Association;
and by an extension of the Voluntary Home Mortgage Credit Program.
Health standards would be advanced by legislation to encourage voluntary
health plans and by a program of construction grants for medical and dental
training facilities.
Personal security would be strengthened by extending unemployment insurance coverage to employees of small firms and certain other groups; by
broadening minimum wage legislation to cover additional workers needing
this protection; by requiring Federal registration and reporting by private
pension and welfare funds; and by a program of technical aid and limited
financial assistance to States for promoting occupational safety.
Conclusion
There are grounds for confidence that the Nation's over-all prosperity
will be extended into the months ahead. A moderate rise in business capital
outlays is indicated. Construction expenditures and foreign trade and
investment should continue to favor economic expansion. The combined
expenditures of Federal, State, and local governments are expected to be
higher. Consumer expenditures should be sustained by favorable employment conditions and good earnings.
However, uncertainties and problems are always present in the economic
situation and require careful attention. These include the present
international situation, the upward pressure of costs and prices, factors
affecting capital outlays by business, and the provision of an adequate flow
of new savings to meet the prospective heavy demands for funds.
These and other uncertainties and problems which inevitably arise in a
dynamic economy challenge individuals, economic groups, and Government
to meet their respective responsibilities for maintaining stable economic
growth. If all live up to these responsibilities, the capacity of our economy
to provide the high levels of employment, production, and purchasing power
envisaged by the Employment Act, and broadly attained in the past year,
will be further enhanced.

Chapter 1

Opportunity and Responsibility
in a Free Economy

T

HE ENORMOUS PRODUCTIVE POWER of the American economy was demonstrated again in 1956 when the Nation's output of goods
and services reached $412 billion. This vast and increasing output provides
the means for assuring our national security, supplying our present consumption needs, and building our capacity for future production. Furthermore,
it is accompanied by the release of additional time for creative personal
development as well as for the more complete enjoyment of material things.
Our free economy thus affords the American people an opportunity for
better living in all its aspects.
These accomplishments reflect the efficiency of competitive markets as
instruments for organizing and expanding production and consumption, but
they do not of themselves reveal the social and individual values inherent
in a free society. Among these are wide access to education and training,
choice of a vocation from among many different employments or business
pursuits, enjoyment of the rewards of one's own accomplishment, and freedom to plan consumption and investment according to personal preference
and judgment. Moreover, our free economy gives indispensable support to
the form of political life that we cherish.
There are instructive parallels between our political and economic institutions. No form of government offers greater opportunity for individual
expression, or places heavier reliance on individual leadership and integrity.
Similarly, no type of economic system offers greater opportunity for individual achievement or places heavier responsibilities on the individual.
But although the opportunities afforded by such an economy are evident
on all sides, the responsibilities on which it relies may be less obvious and
less well understood.
These responsibilities, which center on the need for preserving and
strengthening the institutions of competitive enterprise, are borne in part
by Government. First, Government must pursue policies that give positive
encouragement to the spirit of enterprise and protect the essential incentives to work, to save, and to invest. These policies must be designed
with consideration not merely to their present impact but also to their
long-run effect on the vitality and resiliency of the economy. Second,
Government must exercise a strict discipline over its expenditures and must




take in taxes no more than absolutely necessary of the incomes of individuals and businesses. Third, Government must curb monopolistic tendencies and strive for conditions in which individuals, new methods, and new
products have an opportunity to prove themselves in fair competition. It
is incumbent on Government to assure the reasonable diffusion of economic
power as our forefathers did of political power. Fourth, Government must
pursue policies that facilitate the adjustments to advancing technology and
changing consumer demands that are essential in a dynamic economy. It
must avoid policies that make these adjustments more difficult. Finally,
it must pursue policies that will help maintain high levels of production and
employment and contribute toward achieving the goal of an expanding and
widely-shared national income, earned in dollars of stable buying power.
But Government cannot assume exclusive responsibility for the smooth
functioning of our enterprise system, nor can it guarantee sustained economic growth. Even an attempt to do so would involve intervention on a
scale incompatible with the fundamental character of our enterprise system,
based as it is on the belief that, when regulation is minimized, the energies
and talents of the individual are more fully released for economic betterment. In such an economy, heavy responsibilities for the effective and
equitable functioning of production and distribution must be borne by the
individual in his own economic activity and in his organized activity with
others.
Prominent among these responsibilities is that carried by the management
of business concerns, particularly of companies having large and widespread
operations, to administer their affairs so as to help avoid economic imbalance
and dislocation. That much progress has been made in the acceptance of
this responsibility is evidenced by the increasing practice of planning expansion programs well into the future and organizing operations with a view to
greater stability of employment. Nevertheless, our economy has been subjected at times to heavy strains as excesses have crept into the management
of business inventories, into the expansion of facilities, and particularly
into the use of credit. Business management has a clear responsibility, in
its own interest no less than in the national interest, to avoid such excesses
and to formulate and carry out its plans so as to contribute to steady
economic growth.
Management also has the responsibility, as does labor, to remove restrictions on competition and to enhance the adaptability of the economy to
new technological and demand conditions. And thoughtful leaders of
agriculture will not seek to improve its economic position by means which
would prevent essential adjustments to changing market conditions. Competitive markets and the opportunity to move into any line of endeavor
within the limits established by personal aptitudes, technological needs, and
market demands are essential conditions of a strong enterprise system.
A further responsibilty of leaders of management and labor in a free
economy derives from the fact that concentrations of power place in their




hands the ability to take actions that, through the sensitive network of our
economic system, significantly affect the Nation as a whole.
Specifically, business and labor leadership have the responsibility to reach
agreements on wages and other labor benefits that are fair to the rest of
the community as well as to those persons immediately involved. Negotiated wage increases and benefits should be consistent with productivity
prospects and with the maintenance of a stable dollar. And businesses must
recognize the broad public interest in the prices set on their products and
services.
The full burden of avoiding price inflation, which is an ever present hazard in an expanding economy operating close to capacity, cannot be successfully carried by fiscal and monetary restraints alone. To place this burden
on them would invite the risk of producing effects on the structure and
functioning of our economy which might, in the years ahead, impair
the vitality of competitive enterprise. And failure to accept the responsibilities inherent in a free economy could lead to demands that they be
assumed by Government, with the increasing intervention and loss of freedom that such an approach inevitably entails. The successful extension of
prosperity with price stability must be a cooperative effort in which the policies of individuals and economic groups and of all levels of Government are
consistent with one another and mutually reinforcing.
There is much that the last four years can teach us of the opportunities
inherent in a free economy and the responsibilities of Government and of
citizens for helping to realize them. Accordingly, this Report first gives a
brief account of economic developments and policies in 1953-56. This is
followed by a more detailed record of economic developments in 1956 and
of the policies which Government adopted during that year to help maintain stable economic growth. Finally, proposals are set forth to help extend
prosperity into the future, to strengthen competitive enterprise, and to increase our ability to achieve further improvements in national well-being.




Chapter 2

Economic Growth and Improvement, 1953-56
HE ECONOMIC REPORT transmitted to the Congress in January
1954 called attention to the opportunity afforded by the ending of the
conflict in Korea to turn the productive capacity of the Nation increasingly
to peaceful purposes and thereby to undertake a sustained improvement in
living standards. It also set forth the main lines along which the Federal
Government proposed to move toward this goal and to seek to fulfill its
mandate under the Employment Act of 1946 to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power. Although the Economic
Reports of the past few years have described the improvements in living
that have been achieved and the policies followed to promote stable economic growth, it may be useful to review briefly the developments of the
four years, 1953-56. This review will provide both a record of achievement in a free economy and guidance for the years ahead.
The period was one of growth in our own economy and in the economies
of other free nations, and witnessed clear gains in the well-being of the
American people. The course of expansion was not entirely even, however,
and the capacity of our economy to adapt to extensive, and in some cases
sharp, changes was repeatedly tested. The agricultural sector faced especially difficult problems of adjustment. The rapidly changing conditions
in the economy as a whole, as well as in particular sectors, called for a high
degree of flexibility in Government policies affecting economic growth and
stability. Successive sections of this chapter sketch this record of economic
growth, of improvement in well-being, and of adjustment to economic
change.

T

GROWTH OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

Increasing numbers of our people have been seeking and finding employment during the past four years. The number of persons in the labor force
in 1956, including those in the military services, was almost 4 million more
than in 1952; and the decline of 750,000 in the armed forces in this
period released an additional number for civilian employment (Chart 1).
During 1954 the growth in the labor force was relatively slow; but in
the past two years the rate of growth was unusually rapid. Along with this
increase in the labor force, the number of persons employed rose by
about 4 million. Although unemployment increased during 1953-54

contraction of economic activity, it has since fallen to less than 4 percent
of the labor force, and a significant number of the unemployed are persons
newly drawn into the labor force who are counted as unemployed while
t seeking work.
The employment of growing numbers of persons has been accompanied
by increases in the efficiency of our productive system. The output of
goods and services expanded in 1956 to the new high figure of $412 billion.
Expressed in dollars of constant purchasing power, this is 12.5 percent
more than was produced in 1952. With an employment increase of 6 percent during these years and a modest decline in average working hours, the
gain in output reflects a sizable improvement in productivity. However,
changes in productivity have historically been uneven from year to year, and
the last four years have been no exception. In the expansion of early 1953,
and again in the recovery of 1955, productivity gains were quite large. On
the other hand, advances in productivity were small during the 1953-54
contraction and again in 1956.
Since purchases of military goods by the Federal Government were reduced sharply in the four-year period, over-all measures of the increase
in national output do not fully reveal the rise in the flow of goods and services available for civilian use (Chart 2). The 1953-54 adjustment to a
lower level of defense expenditures made it possible to devote an increasing
proportion of the economy's resources to the output of goods and services for
consumers, to the enlargement of productive capacity, and to the needs of
State and local governments. While total gross national product in constant
dollars rose about 12.5 percent, consumer expenditures, private investment
outlays, and State and local purchases of goods and services increased substantially more. Together, these three sectors of our economy accounted for
88 percent of all purchases of goods and services in 1956, compared with 84
percent in 1952.
The Nation's productive plant and equipment have been notably expanded and improved. Since 1952, business firms and farmers have spent
over $150 billion to increase capacity and replace worn out and obsolete
facilities. The growth in the physical stock of equipment appears to have
been especially large, perhaps as much as one-quarter. Also, important
advances in technology have improved the quality and efficiency of plant
and equipment. These investment outlays contain the promise of greater
national output and better living in the years ahead.
As would be expected in a growing economy in which production techniques and patterns of demand are continually changing, not all industries
shared equally in the expansion. For some industries with a strong growth
component, notably chemicals, aluminum, and electric power, output increased throughout the period; production in certain other industries,
whose output fell substantially in 1954, advanced rapidly in both 1955
and 1956; and the output of still other industries, such as automobiles and
home building, which had been particularly high in 1955, declined in 1956.

The growth of income received by individuals is another indication of
the increased economic activity of the last four years. Personal income
disbursed to individuals rose from $276 billion in 1952 to $331 billion
in 1956. Despite some contraction in the flow of incomes in the latter
part of 1953 and early 1954, the total for each year during the four-year
period was higher than for the preceding one. Personal incomes after
taxes also rose rapidly, reflecting both the increase in incomes received and
the 1954 reduction in personal tax rates.
This expansion resulted in a clear improvement in income per person.
The 1956 average weekly earnings of production workers in manufacturing,
for example, were $80.13, a rise of $12.16 a week over 1952. Even after
allowance for the 2.3 percent increase in consumer prices which occurred
between 1952 and 1956, the gain in weekly earnings amounted to over
$10.50. Not only did those who work for wages and salaries make substantial absolute gains during the period; their share of income also rose.
Labor incomeâ€”that is, the sum of wages, salaries, social security benefits,
and related paymentsâ€”constituted 75.8 percent of total personal incomes
disbursed in 1956, compared with 73.8 percent in 1952.
The income of business proprietors and professional people also expanded.
Farm income continued to decline through 1955, but some improvement
took place in 1956. Dividend payments increased each year, although
corporate profits fluctuated more than other forms of income.




This record of expanding employment, production, and incomes shows
that we do well to place primary reliance for economic growth and improvement on competitive enterprise. It demonstrates anew that such an economy, operating in an environment that provides the incentives needed for
the full utilization and improvement of economic resources, has vast potentialities for advancement of material welfare. The competitive economy's
growing productiveness is based on the fact that it provides increasing
amounts of capital for the use of each worker and encourages the maximum
use of the energies and talents of the individual. Through the organizing influence and discipline of competitive markets, these powerful forces
are employed to meet the needs and preferences of the consumer as expressed in the market place. And all this is accomplished within a framework of free institutions and individual choice. Essentially, the record
reveals the opportunity that a free economy affords for the betterment of
well-being.
The period has also been one of improvement in the economies of other
nations of the free world. Vigorous economic growth has characterized the
industrialized countries of Western Europe and also Canada and Japan. In
each of these, the flow of goods and services to consumers and the additions
made to productive plant and equipment have increased materially. Substantial progress has also been made in many of the nations that are economically less developed, although the rate of growth has varied widely
among them.
A remarkable strengthening of international trade and finance has
taken place. Trade among the nations of the free world rose from less
than $74 billion in 1952 to approximately $93 billion in 1956. Responding
to economic expansion at home and abroad and to the gradual relaxation
of trade controls, our foreign trade and investment have increased markedly;
both exports and imports were at record levels in 1956. Following a decline
for a short time after the termination of the Korean conflict, nonmilitary
exports of goods and services increased during 1954, thus helping to sustain
business activity in this country. The expansion of these exports was extended in 1955 and 1956, in the latter year reaching about $23 billion,
approximately 28 percent more than in 1952. Imports of goods and services
followed the trend of domestic business activity more closely, falling in 1954
and rising in the next two years. In 1956, they totaled almost $20 billion,
some 25 percent above their total four years earlier (Chart 3).
Although Government grants and credits still financed a sizable amount of
our exports, increasing reliance was placed on private trade and investment
during the past four years. Net private investment abroad of United States
funds was at a new high in 1956. While expanding their purchases of goods
and services from the United States, other countries have added about $7
billion to their gold and dollar reserves since 1952. The increase in these
reserves, which were severely depleted during and after World War II, is
traceable largely to our imports of goods and services and to our mili-

tary expenditures abroad. Further expansion of nonmilitary exports will
continue to depend, fundamentally, upon the volume of our imports and
the amount of private United States investment in foreign countries.
The sharpest expansion in our exports has been in shipments to
industrialized countries with high per capita incomes, which are often
competitive with us, and to certain less developed countries in which the
rate of economic expansion has recently been high. This fact strongly
suggests the economic advantage to this country which can accrue from
economic development abroad. When trade is conducted on a nondiscriminatory, multilateral basis, it is natural to expect that prosperity elsewhere will be reflected in an increased demand for the products of our
farms, mines, and factories. Such has been the case in the last four years.
IMPROVEMENT IN LEVEL OF LIVING

The rise in real incomes which was described above reached to all income
levels. Whereas 27.1 million families, or 54 percent of the total, had incomes before taxes of more than $4,000 in 1952, 30.6 million, or 59 percent
of the total, had incomes of this amount in 1955. Data are not yet available on the distribution of incomes in 1956, but other evidence indicates




that the improvement continued. Since the cost of living rose only
slightly over this period, most of the increase in money incomes represented
an actual gain in well-being. Expressed in dollars of constant purchasing
power, per capita personal income rose 10 percent after taxes and consumer
expenditures 11 percent. Some indicators of the increase and diffusion
of well-being in recent years are given in Chart 4 and Appendix D.

Striking achievements were made in housing.. The 5 million dwelling
units that were constructed exceeded the number built in any other fouryear period and substantially enlarged the housing stock available to the
American people. There were improvements in the size, design, and equipment of new homes, and sizable outlays for repairs and alterations added
to the comfort and convenience of existing homes. A growing proportion
of our homes were owner occupiedâ€”60 percent in 1956, compared with
55 percent in 1950.
During the four-year period, 24.5 million new automobiles were bought,
and, even though large numbers of old cars were scrapped, the number of
automobiles increased 11 million. Consumers also purchased large quantities of other durable goodsâ€”especially household appliances.
The increase in the ownership of homes and of consumer durable goods
entailed a large increase in debt. Short- and intermediate-term consumer




debt increased $15 billion, or 53 percent, from December 1952 to December 1956; home mortgage debt rose $40 billion, or 69 percent. On
the other hand, American families made large additions to their financial
assets. Consumer holdings of bank deposits, savings bonds, and other selected financial assets were about one-fourth higher in 1956 than in 1952.
Provisions for personal security were also improved by large increases in
the number of persons covered by life and medical insurance and in the
degree of protection afforded, as well as by governmental social security
programs.
Participation in and support of religious, cultural, educational, and
civic activities are more extensive than ever before. Church membership has increased markedly, and recent years have witnessed a sharp rise
in the construction of church and related buildings. Outlays for library
construction have been large, and book circulation and publication have
exceeded any previous records. Greatly increased amounts of resources are
being devoted to education at all levels. Public and private outlays on construction of educational buildings totaled $3.1 billion in 1956, a rise of 57
percent in four years; and private grants and gifts for higher education are
estimated to have increased about two-thirds.
This is a gratifying record of the improvement in the level of living that
can be achieved through a vigorous competitive economic system. In particular, it shows the capacity of such a system to bring about a widespread
participation in the benefits of economic expansion. But much room for
improvement remains.
Although average incomes have increased substantially, the incomes of
many Americans are still inadequate. Some in the low-income group
are older persons, beyond the employable age; others suffer from illness or
are handicapped by lack of adequate training, education, or knowledge of better job opportunities. Also, some areas have failed to share
in the general economic expansion; certain communities have had relatively high levels of unemployment over protracted periods. Considerable
progress was made in the last four years, however, under various private
and governmental programs aimed at meeting these problems and at
strengthening personal security. Proposals are put forward in Chapter 4
for broadening and strengthening these activities of Government.
PROBLEMS OF AGRICULTURAL ADJUSTMENT

The basic problem of the agricultural sector of the economy in recent
years has been a persistent tendency for production to outrun commercial
demands. In response to a rapidly advancing technology and remunerative
price supports, farm output has risen since 1952 (Chart 5). Consumption
and exports have failed to increase correspondingly. Reflecting these facts,
and the sharp decline in exports in 1952-53, stocks of surplus farm products
have accumulated. Before the 1954 harvest could be affected by acreage




II

allotments, carry-overs of wheat and cotton had risen to about 3 5/2 times
those of 1952 and the carry-over of corn had nearly doubled (see Chart 11,
p. 31). Partly as a by-product of large cotton crops, stocks of food fats also
nearly doubled. Substantial shifts were subsequently made in crop acreagesâ€”predominantly out of wheat and cottonâ€”but large parts of this
cropland were diverted to the production of feed grains, with the result
that markets for a widening range of commodities have been threatened
by excessive supplies.
These developments in output and stocks have been reflected in farm
prices and income. For nearly five years the index of prices received by
farmers moved persistently downward from the peak reached in February
1951 under the inflationary impact of the Korean conflict. But because the
volume of farm marketings increased, realized gross farm income in 1956
was only 1 percent below the high level attained in 1947, before agricultural
production abroad had recovered from wartime dislocation. However, the
newer techniques of production and a delayed rise in prices paid by farmers
raised farm expenses more than one-quarter in the interim, and net farm
income was accordingly reduced substantially.
These conditions have naturally tended to bring about an extensive and
difficult transition in agriculture. In general, adjustments have been in the
direction of a better balanced farm economy. Most of the decline in the
total number of farms has been among units that yield inadequate income to
their operators; the number of moderate-sized family farms has increased;
and the proportion of farms owned in whole or in part by the farm operator
has risen. The value of farm assets has increased in recent years, and
farmers' equities are at a record high level. Although total farm debt has
increased every year since 1946, the mortgage debt component is now only
slightly higher in relation to the value of farm real estate than in the most
favorable years on record. Debt repayments have proceeded largely on
schedule, and foreclosure rates are low. Farm families have added to their
holdings of consumer durable goods at a rapid rate and, as usual, with less
resort to consumer credit than is customary among urban families. In
short, agriculture as a whole has made gains, though its income is not as
high as in years of exceptional war and postwar demands.
Forces and conditions originating in the nonfarm sectors of the economy
have to some extent contributed to agriculture's adjustment problems. As
individual incomes rise, certain major farm products, such as wheat and cotton, meet severe competition from other desired consumer goods. Jointly
with increases in efficiency, these demand factors have tended historically to
reduce agriculture's proportion of employment, population, and national
income. And conditions in the nonfarm economy have a direct impact on
farm costs; for example, the prices of tractors and farm machinery reflect
the pressure of general industrial demand, and the price and supply of
fertilizers respond more to factors at work in the chemical industry than to
those originating in farming.

Some trends in the nonfarm sectors of the economy have operated
distinctly in agriculture's favor. Increasing population and rising incomes
have sustained total domestic consumption of farm products. Higher real
incomes have increased the demand for livestock products, and industrial
technology has created new market opportunities for the vegetable oilseeds.
General prosperity has widened job opportunities for farm people outside
agriculture, and farm earnings have been increasingly supplemented by
off-farm employment.
In the immediate situation, however, efforts to stabilize farm income have
led to Government activities on a broad scale. These have involved not
only substantial public expenditures but also serious encroachment on the
private marketing system. Net budget expenditures on behalf of agriculture, which are an indication of the immediate fiscal burden though not
necessarily of the ultimate cost to the Treasury, now account for almost onequarter of the Federal budget excluding national security expenditures and
interest on the public debt. The six so-called "basic" commodities were
supported at 90 percent of parity through 1954, and dairy products likewise
until early in that year. Even under the somewhat more flexible scale in
effect since then, support levels are frequently the most important single
factor in determining the prices prevailing in a number of commodity
markets. The Commodity Credit Corporation has become a major operating unit in our economy, with a statutory borrowing authority of $14.5
billion and an outstanding debt of more than $11 billion to the United
States Treasury. Its investment in price-support loans and inventories
increased nearly $7 billion between June 30, 1952 and June 30, 1956,
despite the disposal of commodities valued at about the same amount.
Among shipments overseas, there has been a marked increase in commodities moving under Government programs concurrently with a decline in
unsubsidized, commercial exports (Chart 6). The implications of these
measures for agriculture and for the economy in general emphasize the
importance for sustainable agricultural improvement of the policy objectives of the last four yearsâ€”wider freedom for our commercial farmers
in managing their own enterprises, appropriate shifts in the use of the
Nation's cropland, an improved system of price supports, and research
into new products, markets, and uses.
ADJUSTMENT TO ECONOMIC CHANGE

The last four years have demonstrated the ability of the Nation's private
economy to expand, to provide an increasing number of jobs, and to raise
levels of living. Also, they have tested the capacity of our economy to adjust
to large changes in the pattern of demand and the effectiveness of public
policies designed to promote growth and stability. Because the stabilization
problem is continually changing in a dynamic economy, policies aimed at
promoting stable growth must be flexible. This fact was well illustrated
in the last four years, in which the problem shifted from one of helping to

contain contractive forces and to bring about an early recovery in 1953-54
to one of restraining inflationary pressures in 1955-56.
Government policies aided significantly in preventing the declines in
inventory and defense expenditures during 1953 and 1954 from causing a
severe recession, and they contributed to the subsequent recovery. Legislative reductions in tax rates and changes in the tax structure, and the reduction in tax liabilities which automatically accompanies declining incomes,
helped maintain disposable personal incomes (Chart 7). Similarly, incomes
were supplemented by payments made under our unemployment insurance
and social security programs. Tax measures increased the means and the
incentives for business outlays on capital goods, and ample credit was made
available on favorable terms. These measures became effective promptly,
before the forces leading to a downturn could gather momentum and spread
through the economy.
The extent to which the recession was contained and the vigor of the
recovery that followed are shown in broad measures of employment, production, and income. Total civilian employment, which had been 62.3
million on a seasonally adjusted basis in the second quarter of 1953, the
period of peak activity, declined to 61.1 million in the third quarter of 1954.
In the same period, gross national product measured in constant prices fell
3 percent. Personal disposable income, which had been at an annual
rate of $251 billion in the second quarter of 1953, actually rose to $254
billion in the third quarter of 1954. With incomes well maintained,
the physical volume of consumer purchases declined only 1 percent from
the second quarter to the fourth quarter of 1953, and then rose to a new
high in the second quarter of 1954. Residential construction outlays
measured in constant prices fell slightly in the second half of 1953, but
increased sharply thereafter. Business construction expenditures began
rising in late 1953; even though purchases of producers' equipment continued to decline, total fixed investment expenditures rose throughout 1954,
and in the third quarter surpassed their 1953 peak. State and local expenditures increased each quarter during the recession.
In the recovery period, taken from the third quarter of 1954 through the
second quarter of 1955, total civilian employment rose about 2^4 percent,
to 62.7 million; and gross national product, personal disposable income, and
consumer purchases of goods and services each increased about 7 percent,
all measured in constant prices. During the remainder of 1955, economic
activity continued to increase vigorously; there were substantial gains in
employment, production, and real incomes. While wholesale prices of
industrial goods began to rise appreciably after the middle of the year, consumer prices, on the average, remained stable.
As strong expansionary forces began to be felt, the policies pursued during the second half of 1953 and 1954 were modified toward the end of the
latter year. The Federal Reserve authorities reduced slightly the degree
of credit ease that had prevailed. In January 1955 a Federal budget which




z8

brought cash receipts and expenditures into balance was recommended.
This required the postponement of corporate and excise tax reductions
scheduled for April 1955, which was requested of, and granted by, the
Congress. As the recovery became more firmly established and economic
activity continued to expand, Government policies were increasingly directed toward avoiding excessive demand pressures and consequent inflationary price increases. Since the rise in home building and in mortgage
debt was particularly sharp, the Administration in April, and again in
July, imposed restraints on the terms of federally-underwritten credit extended for home purchases. Federal Reserve authorities moved toward a
more restrictive credit policy early in 1955, and maintained it during the
remainder of the year.
The year 1956 illustrated again that the course of economic events is
never a mere extension of the recent past. Although many of the policies
adopted in 1955 to promote economic growth with price stability were continued in 1956, the developments of the year required important policy
modifications. These developments and the policies followed by Government are described in the following chapter.
The adjustments successfully completed in the last four years reveal the
very great capacity of a free economy to correct imbalances and to maintain growth with a high degree of stability. Business concerns contribute
significantly to this process by doing a more systematic and orderly job of
planning and scheduling capital outlays. Improvements in economic information make it possible to discern maladjustments before they reach
serious proportions. Fluctuations in economic activity are moderated by
the variation of Federal tax receipts which accompanies changes in income,
and by changes in the amount of unemployment compensation payments.
And Government has learned much about fostering economic stability
through properly designed and aptly timed public policies. The contraction of 1953-54 showed that if consumer and business confidence is
maintained, and if appropriate and well-timed fiscal and monetary actions
are taken by Government, massive programs of Federal intervention aimed
at countering recessionary tendencies are not only unnecessary but are
wholly undesirable. The experience also shows that vigorous competitive
enterprise supported by wise governmental policies can use the opportunity
provided by a reduction in military expenditures to achieve a significant
improvement in our level of living.




Chapter 3

Economic Developments in 1956
S THE YEAR 1956 OPENED, an expansion of some eighteen months'
- duration had carried total production, income, and employment to new
high levels. The over-all expansion proceeded at a more moderate rate in
the early months of the year, and the small rise in gross national product
was due to higher prices rather than to further increases in the physical
output of goods and services. The slowing down in the pace of the expansion was largely attributable to reduced automobile sales and production,
lower residential construction, and smaller additions to inventories. Although these downward movements persisted through the spring and
summer months, over-all business activity continued to advance because of
strength elsewhere, notably the rapidly rising volume of expenditures for
plant and equipment. In the final quarter automobile production and
sales turned upward, and additions to business inventories increased. The
result was a substantial rise in business activity which, combined with the

estimated annual rate of $424 billion in the final quarter of 1956 (Tables
1 and 2). For the year as a whole gross national product was $412 billion.
About half of the increase of $21.5 billion over 1955 represented a gain in
real output, and the remainder reflected moderately higher prices. The
number of persons employed in 1956 averaged 65.0 million, an increase of
1.8 million above the preceding year. In view of the very high levels of
activity that had already been reached in 1955, the advance last year was
substantial (Chart 8).
T H E PATTERN OF THE EXPANSION

Foremost among the sources of strength in the economy during 1956 was
the continued expansion in outlays for new productive facilities. Capital
outlays rose to an annual rate of $37 billion by the end of 1956, almost
20 percent above the level prevailing a year earlier. The strength of
investment, which was particularly notable in expenditures on equipment,
was all the more remarkable since the increase came after a similar rise
during 1955. These unprecedented provisions for new and improved productive facilities were the enterprise system's response to continued high
sales in most sectors, favorable long-term business expectations, rising funds
from depreciation charges, and competitive pressures to use new technological developments.

Capital outlays rose in virtually all branches of production, transportation, and trade. The increase during 1956 was most marked in manufacturing, followed by public utilities. Within manufacturing, producers of
automobiles^ chemicals, steel, and petroleum products accounted for most
of the gain. Investment by commercial enterprises continued to rise, but
at a much slower rate than during the preceding year.
Larger expenditures by State and local governments added substantially
to demand in 1956. State and local governments increased their spending on goods and services almost $3 billion, as outlays on schools, highways, and various community facilities continued to rise. The expenditures
of State and local government units exceeded their revenues, and their
borrowings in the capital markets were again large. The Federal Government's fiscal operations helped to moderate the inflationary pressures that
resulted from the larger volume of business activity. Although Federal
expenditures on goods and services were higher in the second half of the
calendar year, as was the sum of social security and other transfer payments,
tax revenues increased in response to the advance in private incomes and
yielded a surplus in both the conventional and cash budgets.
Growing foreign trade and investment was another expansionary factor.
Merchandise shipments abroad (excluding military aid transfers), which
comprised approximately three-fourths of our exports of goods and services,
were nearly $3 billion greater than in 1955 and at a record high of $17 billion (Table 3). Almost three-fourths of these shipments consisted of manufactured industrial goods, mostly finished goods. Export activity was
especially marked for a number of industries confronted by heavy domestic
demands; machinery exports rose about 24 percent and with iron and steel
products and chemicals accounted for about one-third of the $3 billion
increase. Expansion of bituminous coal exports provided an important
additional market for that industry.
Merchandise shipped to this country, which comprised almost two-thirds
of our imports of goods and services, rose more than $1 billion, to a new

high of nearly $13 billion. Half of our merchandise imports consisted of
finished and semimanufactured industrial goods. Larger inflows of such
items as structural steel, machinery, nonferrous metals and ferroalloys, and
iron ore and concentrates reflected the high level of our industrial activity.
Notable increases also occurred in imports of automobiles, paper, cotton
and woolen textiles, and, prior to the blocking of the Suez Canal, crude
petroleum.
The excess of exports over imports was made possible in part by greater
private capital investments abroad. These investments, which were almost
$1.2 billion in 1955, more than doubled in 1956. Most of the increase consisted of investments in foreign branches and subsidiaries of United States
corporations in Canada, Western Europe, and Latin America. The volume
of sales of Canadian securities to United States investors was larger than in
1955. United States Government loans to foreign countries, and investments of foreigners in the United States, also increased. The net result
of all these transactions, with private remittances and nonmilitary Government grants virtually unchanged, was an addition of almost $2 billion of net
foreign investment to gross national product.
Consumer expenditures on all goods and services continued to rise.
But the gains were not as large as during 1955, reflecting a smaller increase
in incomes and a greater volume of savings. A larger amount of tax payments further limited the gain in personal disposable income, which was
about $16 billion, whereas in 1955 the gain had been more than $20 billion.
Personal savings accumulated at an annual rate of $22 billion in the final
quarter of 1956, compared with less than $19 billion in the same period of
1955. Nonetheless, consumers in the final quarter of the year bought nondurable goods at an annual rate more than $6 billion higher than a year
earlier, and added at a similar rate to their spending on services. They
also spent more on durable goods, with the exception of automobiles.
Outlays for automobiles and home building, which had risen to unusually
high levels through the third quarter of 1955 and had been a major expansionary factor during that year, were a moderating influence in the economy
through most of 1956. That total economic activity could continue its
upward course when there was substantial downward pressure in these two
important industries was one of the notable features of the year.
In the third quarter of 1956, consumer and business purchases of automobiles, together with expenditures by automobile manufacturers and retail dealers incident to changes in inventories, were one-third below those
in the same quarter a year earlier; in the fourth quarter, however, these
expenditures rose substantially. Consumer purchases of automobiles and
parts, after a decrease from an annual rate of $18.5 billion in the third
quarter of 1955 to $13.7 billion in the third quarter of 1956, increased to a
rate of about $15.5 billion in the last quarter, as new models were introduced.




Housing starts, which had declined during 1955, continued generally
downward as home builders were faced with reduced availability of funds,
higher costs of land and construction, and more selective demand. Expenditures for residential building followed a similar pattern, although they
declined more slowly, until their annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1956
was $2.3 billion below the peak rate in the third quarter of 1955. Despite
the relatively large declines in both housing starts and expenditures, 1.1
million dwelling units were built in 1956 and residential construction
expenditures were higher than in any year except 1955.
Additions to inventory played a less important part in the expansion of
1956 than in the recovery and expansion of 1954-55, although they remained substantial. During the first half of the year, production was cut
back and inventories were reduced in a number of industries related to automobiles and housing. However, there were large increases of purchasedmaterials inventories by durable goods producers generally, of work-inprocess inventories by manufacturers of producer equipment, and of stocks
of such nondurable goods as synthetic fibers, cotton and synthetic fabrics,
and gasoline. Total business inventory accumulation during the first half
of the year was at an annual rate of $3.8 billion, compared with $6.1 billion
in the final quarter of 1955. The over-all rate of accumulation was smaller
in the third quarter, as metal fabricating industries used up inventories
during the steel strike and automobile dealers further reduced their stocks.
This movement was reversed, however, in the closing months of the year,
when automobile manufacturers and dealers and some of their suppliers
rebuilt their stocks and manufacturers of producer equipment continued
their accumulations; these additions more than offset reductions in the rate
of inventory accumulation by most industries manufacturing nondurable
goods.
Changes in industrial production reflected the year's shifting pattern of
major demands (Table 4). Early in the year, industries affected by lower
automobile sales experienced substantial declines. Lumber production
was adversely affected by the reduction in residential building. However,
industries that benefited from the high capital outlays expanded their
output almost without interruption throughout the year. The output of
the stone, clay, and glass industries, influenced by heavy nonresidential construction demands, moved up moderately to a high in May. Production of
nondurable manufactures rose slightly during the latter part of the year,
after edging downward through July. Soft coal production rose 6 percent
above that in 1955 as a result of strong domestic and export demand. At the
year-end, the Middle East crisis led to new high output of domestic crude
oil.
Despite this diversity in individual industry experience, total industrial
production, which had receded slightly during the first half of the year
* and sharply in July as a result of the steel strike, advanced again in the fall.
At the end of the year, total output was 2 percent above that of December
1955 and at an all-time high.

HIGHER EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME

The expansion of over-all business activity in 1956 created ample job
opportunities in most occupations, and incomes rose for all major groups
of income recipients (Chart 9). Sizable employment gains were made in
trade, construction, finance and other services, public utilities, and State
and local governments. For the year as a whole, the gain in civilian employment was 1.8 million. Since agricultural employment declined more than
100,000, total civilian nonagricultural employment was about 1.9 million
greater than a year earlier. Average employment for the year reached a
high of 65 million.
In manufacturing, the production adjustments necessitated by the decline
in automobile sales and housing construction involved reductions in hours
of work and in the number of persons employed in the affected industries.
Most of the reductions in working force, however, were less than the declines in output, since firms retained many of .their experienced workers.
Employment continued to increase in those industries in which output was
expanding, notably in machinery. Also, the employment of nonproduction
workers in manufacturing continued to rise appreciably during the year,

even in some sectors where production workers were laid off. For manufacturing as a whole, total employment by the end of the year had reached
a level above that at the end of 1955.
Unemployment remained relatively low throughout 1956. During most
of the year the average duration of unemployment was shorter than in 1955,
and unemployment for men with family responsibilities was low.
Improvements in income were widely shared among the major groups of
income recipients. Compensation of employees in the final quarter of the
year was approximately 6^4 percent above that received in the fourth
quarter of 1955. The largest relative gain was made by employees of
private nonmanufacturing concerns. Despite slightly lower hours of work,
average weekly earnings in manufacturing increased by $3.65, to $82.89,
in the final quarter of 1956. Total business and professional income
advanced almost 7 percent. Dividend payments remained large during
1956, and for the year as a whole were somewhat higher than in 1955.
Rental incomes fell slightly. Total personal incomes rose $19 billion,
compared with a rise of $23 billion during 1955.
DEVELOPMENTS IN AGRICULTURE

After declining since 1951, agricultural prices and income both increased
moderately during 1956. In the first six months, prices of farm products
moved distinctly upward, and about half of the increase was held during
the harvest months. Net realized farm income was about 5 percent higher
than in 1955 (Chart 10). After adjustment for the change in farm inventories, net income was the same as in 1955, although it rose after the
middle of the year. There were further increases in the value of farm land
and in the net worth of farm proprietors.
Total farm output in 1956 was at a new high, despite conditions of
extreme drought in a region stretching from South Dakota to the Mexican border. As yields per acre for some crops were the largest ever
recorded, the index of crop production was for the second successive year
at the peak that had been attained in 1948. The corn crop was the second
largest in history, produced on the smallest acreage in over 60 years, with
corn yields per acre at an all-time high. Soybeans, for which market
prospects were excellent, were produced in unprecedented volume. The
wheat crop was slightly larger than in 1955, but a little below prospective
domestic and export disposition. With carry-over stocks at excessive
levels, lower production of cotton, tobacco, rice, and feed grains other
than corn represented adjustments in the direction of a better balance
between output and market requirements.
Changes in output of livestock products also were for the most part in the
direction of needed adjustments. Hog slaughter late in the fall was below
the rate that had seriously depressed prices a year earlier. There were
large shipments of cattle at relatively firm prices. The prolonged rise in the
number of cattle and calves on farms apparently came to a halt. For milk

and dairy products, the year was marked by a combination of higher prices,
larger output, near-record cash receipts from marketings, and reduction
in stocks.
Exports of farm products in the year ended June 30, 1956 were substantially larger than in the preceding fiscal year; in terms of physical volume,
they were the highest in 29 years. Government export programs played an
important role in this increase in shipments. In addition, feed grains
benefited from an expansion in livestock numbers in Europe; tobacco, from
generally increasing consumer incomes and improved foreign exchange
positions overseas; oilseeds, from a short olive crop in the Mediterranean
countries; and wheat, from enlarged import needs in Northwestern Europe
to compensate for winter wheat lost in the 1956 freeze. Exports have continued to rise so far in fiscal 1956-57.
However, major problems of adjustment remain. Neither the volume
nor the composition of farm output has as yet been brought into proper
balance with combined domestic and export requirements. United States
carry-overs of a number of crops have continued to mount (Chart 11). For
certain key commodities, the excess of stocks is world-wide. The grain stocks
carried into the 1956-57 marketing year by the principal exporting countries
were higher than ever before. World carry-over stocks of cotton about
doubled between mid-1951 and mid-1956, and the proportion held in the
United States increased. However, the Commodity Credit Corporation
(CCC) has already sold more than 6 million bales for export in 1956-57,
and reductions in the domestic carry-overs of wheat and rice are also in
prospect for 1957.
Federal price-support activities were a major factor in sustaining farm
prices and income despite burdensome supplies. Of the 1955 crops, almost
half the rice and cotton, two-fifths of the grain sorghums and rye, and onethird of the wheat were afforded direct price support by CCC loans and
purchases. The CCC investment in price-support loans and inventories
declined through the third quarter of the year, from a peak of $8.9 billion
reached in February, but losses realized in disposing of surpluses have been
running higher in the current fiscal year than in fiscal 1956. Pricesupport levels for 1956 crops were raised in April above those originally
announced; dairy farmers in certain areas benefited from suspension of
seasonal price reductions under Federal milk-marketing orders; and special
purchase programs were undertaken for several perishable commodities in
exceptionally heavy supply. Government payments in excess of $235 million
under the Soil Bank Program made a sizable addition to farm income,
especially in the fourth quarter.
MOVEMENTS IN PRICES, COSTS, AND PROFITS

Prices of most commodities and services rose during 1956. Industrial
prices, which had begun to increase in the second half of 1955, continued
their upward movement into 1956. Prices of investment goods and semi-

manufactured materials and components rose quite rapidly, reflecting heavy
pressure of demand relative to supply. Manufacturers' prices of consumer
goods advanced slowly. During the spring and early summer, however,
reduced outlays on automobiles and housing resulted in price declines for
a number of important raw materials and a pause in the upward movement
of prices of materials, components, and supplies. Prices of consumer
finished goods also ceased to increase. The only major group of industrial
commodities whose prices continued to rise during this period was producer finished equipment, the demand for which was especially insistent
(Chart 12).
Although the advance in industrial prices ceased for a while, rising costs
became an increasingly pervasive factor. After the middle of the year, and
especially after steel prices were raised following the strike settlement,
industrial prices advanced again on a broad front. The combination of
heavy demands from the investment goods sector of the economy, rising
labor costs, and renewed advances in prices of many raw materials resulted
in price increases for a broad range of semimanufactured materials, components, and supplies. And these price increases became cost increases to
producers of finished goods, many of whom were also experiencing rising
labor costs. The increase in machinery and equipment prices was accelerated; manufacturers' prices of consumer appliances, which had been
under severe competitive pressure for several years, were raised moderately;
and automobile prices increased with the introduction of new models. By
December, prices of producer equipment had risen 13 percent above those
at mid-1955, intermediate materials for durable goods manufacturing 10
percent, construction materials prices 7 percent, consumer durables 6 percent, consumer nondurables 3 percent, and the average of all industrial
prices 8 percent.
Farm prices joined the advance of industrial prices during the first half
of 1956. Between December 1955 and June 1956 wholesale prices of farm
products increased 10 percent, and by September prices of processed foods
had risen 6 percent. Although these prices fell moderately thereafter, they
remained well above prices a year earlier. Thus, all three of the major
groups of wholesale pricesâ€”industrial, farm, and processed foodsâ€”contributed to an average rise in wholesale prices of more than 4 percent between
December 1955 and December 1956.
Reacting to developments in both the farm and industrial sectors, and
to the continued increase in rents and in costs of services, all major categories of consumer prices rose in 1956, the first significant general rise since
1952. After farm prices started to increase at the turn of the year, consumer food prices moved up with a few months' lag. And prices of many
other consumer commodities, which had been stable or declining for several years, rose gradually as retail distributors were confronted with higher
manufacturers' prices. By December 1956, the average of all consumer
prices was 2.7 percent above the average at the end of 1955 (Chart 13).

The general rise in costs during 1956 was in response to high raw material
prices and advancing labor costs. Even though many raw material prices
receded somewhat from the peaks reached at the turn of the year, they
remained high throughout 1956. Wage and salary rates advanced during
the year in industries producing both finished goods and parts and components, and also in many nonmanufacturing lines. For example, average
hourly earnings of production workers in manufacturing and building construction rose 6 percent and in retail trade 4 percent. While the increases
in wage and salary rates were only slightly greater than those in 1955, the
improvement in productivity appears to have been substantially less. Thus,
wage and salary costs per unit of output, which had been stable during most
of 1955, rose significantly last year.
It would appear that the improvement in output per employee man-hour
which occurred in 1956 was not only less than the rise in 1955 but less than
the average recorded for the postwar period. Total employment is estimated to have increased between 1955 and 1956 by about as much as the
physical output of goods and services. Even after account is taken of
changes in hours worked, only a very small gain in over-all productivity is
indicated. In interpreting these developments, however, it must be borne
in mind that productivity improvements are irregular from year to year
and vary from industry to industry. Nonetheless, the smallness of the 1956
gain contributed to the rise in unit labor costs and, in turn, to the increase
in prices.




34

In some industries the 1956 rise in prices matched or more than matched
advancing costs; but in others, especially during the first three quarters of
the year, costs rose relative to prices, and profit margins fell. This cost-price
relationship contrasted with that which characterized 1955, when prices
generally rose more rapidly than costs and profit margins of most industries
recovered from their 1954 recession lows. The reduction of profit margins
in 1956 was especially noticeable in the motor vehicle, lumber, stone, clay,
and glass, and electrical machinery industries. The renewed rise in industrial wholesale prices after midyear reflected in part an effort by many
sellers to preserve profit margins.
Total corporate profits before taxes fell from an annual rate of $45 billion
in the second half of 1955 to $43 billion in the first half of 1956 and, partly
because of the steel strike, to $41 billion in the third quarter. There are
indications that corporate profits improved substantially in the closing
months of the year, and that for the year as a whole they were slightly
larger than in 1955.

Financial markets were subject to continuous and heavy pressures in
1956. The financial requirements of business concerns increased sharply,
mainly because of the rapid rise in business capital outlays and to some
extent because of inventory accumulation and larger investment abroad.
At the same time, substantial demands for credit continued in other sectors
of the economy. Mortgage debt rose about $15 billion, an increase exceeded only in 1955. State and local governments issued more than
$5 billion in securities for new capital, only moderately less than in 1955.
Outstanding consumer credit rose about $3.4 billion, compared with an
increase of $6.4 billion in 1955 (Chart 14).
Two circumstances were primarily responsible for the strong demand of
business concerns for external funds. First, the internal funds available
to corporations in the form of retained earnings and depreciation charges
grew at a slower rate than plant and equipment expenditures and inventory investment. A small decline in retained earnings, which occurred
because of higher dividend payments, was more than offset by rising depreciation charges but not sufficiently to finance the increased expenditure requirements. Second, as the year progressed, business concerns found it
increasingly difficult to finance expenditures by further reductions in their
holdings of liquid assets.
These conditions led to a substantial increase in corporate security issues
and to large bank borrowings by business firms. Despite a smaller volume
in the first quarter, new money security issues totaled $9.6 billion in 1956,
or $1.7 billion above 1955 (Table 5). The rise in corporate security offerings was largely concentrated in manufacturing and mining, public utility,
and communications concerns. The reduced availability and higher cost
of funds in the capital markets led many concerns to resort to bank borrow-

ing to meet at least part of the requirements that would otherwise have been
financed on a long-term basis.
This large interim financing added to the usual working capital requirements led to heavy business demand for bank credit in 1956. Business loans
at commercial banks rose $5.5 billion, somewhat less than in 1955, but some
sectors of the business community, notably the capital goods industries, made
use of bank funds at a greatly increased rate. Borrowings of metal and
metal products companies from weekly reporting member banks were over
three times as much as in 1955, absorbing 39 percent of the increase in
loans to manufacturing firms and accounting for more than one-fourth of
the total rise in business loans at these banks. The increase in the borrowings of petroleum, coal, chemical and rubber companies as a group exceeded
by more than 50 percent the increase of their borrowings in 1955. Loans to
public utility and transportation concerns also rose considerably. Borrowings of food, liquor, and tobacco companies, which had been reduced in 1955,
increased substantially in 1956. Loans to commodity dealers also expanded.
Sales finance companies and construction firms reduced their bank borrowings, in contrast to the sharp increases of the previous year. Real estate and
consumer loans by banks rose somewhat less than in 1955, reflecting declines
in residential construction and automobile sales. Security loans declined.
The net result of these divergent demands was an increase of about
$8 billion in the total loans of all commercial banks, following the increase
of nearly $12 billion during 1955 (Table 6 ) .
To supply the funds needed to meet the demands, financial institutions
sold substantial amounts of securities, in many instances at a loss. Commercial banks, whose reserve position was under continued pressure, reduced
their holdings of United States Government securities by about $3 billion,
following a reduction of $7 billion in 1955. Accordingly, liquidity considerations became increasingly important in bank lending policy (Chart 15).

The sales of United States Government securities by commercial banks,
augmented by sales by insurance companies and mutual savings banks,
exerted considerable pressure on bond prices. The effect of these sales on
prices was moderated, however, by the use of the Federal budget surplus
to reduce the Federal debt, and by increased holdings of United States

securities by Government trust funds. In addition to proceeds from the
sale of securities, the supply of funds was enlarged by the rise in personal
savings.
The limited availability of funds relative to demand was also reflected in
the mortgage market, where downpayments on federally-underwritten
loans were increased and maturities were shortened as credit standards of
lenders became more exacting. Conventional mortgages claimed an increasing share of mortgage investment funds, since their interest rates more
nearly reflected changing market conditions, whereas the rates on VAguaranteed and FHA-insured mortgages were fixed during most of the year
at 4 / 2 percent. Insured and guaranteed mortgages, accordingly, were
sold in the secondary market at increasing discounts from par.
Interest rates rose sharply in both the short-term and long-term credit
markets (Chart 16). The prime loan rate at leading banks was raised in
April and again in August; and the rate on new Treasury bills, which averaged 1.753 percent in 1955, reached a high of 3.331 percent in the week
ended December 22, 1956. Yields on long-term Government and corporate
securities moved steadily upward, passing the 1953 peaks and continuing to
higher levels. Yields on high-grade State and local government bonds also
surpassed their 1953 highs. Although interest rates rose generally, the increase was more pronounced in the short-term than in the long-term market,
with the result that the spread of yields between the shortest and longest

any time since early 1930.
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RESPONSIBILITIES IN
A HIGH-EMPLOYMENT ECONOMY

In view of the pressures on prices, costs, and financial resources, there
was clear need for continuing in 1956 the fiscal and monetary restraints
initiated in the preceding year. The Federal Government's major contribution to this end was a budget surplus (Chart 17). This achievement
was the culmination of persistent efforts since 1953 to bring the Federal
budget into balance without impairing national defense or other essential
Government services. Total Federal expenditures remained below those
of 1953; their increase during the past year was held to modest proportions,
with the result that the larger tax revenues flowing from higher incomes
yielded a sizable surplus in the calendar year 1956. On a cash basis, receipts
of the Federal Government exceeded payments to the public by Â§5.5 billion,
against an excess of payments over receipts of $0.7 billion in 1955 (Table 7).
The gross public debt was reduced from nearly $281 billion at the end of
1955 to $277 billion, the first substantial decline in eight years.
These results were accomplished despite reductions in tax rates and other
adjustments of taxes that became effective in 1954, and in the face of necessary increases of expenditures during 1956. They were made possible by
the postponement of reductions of corporate and excise taxes scheduled first
for April 1, 1955 and then for April 1, 1956. Without these postponements, Federal tax receipts would have been reduced about $3 billion a
year. While tax reduction should continue to have high priority, achievement of a budget surplus was of greater urgency under recent conditions.
Fiscal policies during the past year prevented the additional strains on
the economy that would have occurred if taxes had been cut and private
expenditures had increased further.
The intensive use of resources and upward pressures on prices during
1956 required a monetary policy designed to prevent an undue expansion
in bank credit. A large over-all expansion of bank credit would not have
resulted in a significantly higher national output, but would instead have
led to a greater rise in prices. In pursuing a policy of restraint, Federal
Reserve authorities maintained pressure on the reserve position of banks
through open market operations and discount rate actions. Because the increase in bank reserves was relatively small, the rise in the total loans and
investments of commercial banks was held to about $4*4 billion, or 2.7 percent; and the money supply (demand deposits adjusted and currency)
increased only about 1 percent.
The discount rates of Federal Reserve Banks were raised twice in 1956,
following four such increases in 1955. The rates were increased in April
from 2)/% percent to 2% percent at ten Banks and to 3 percent at two, and

in August the rate became 3 percent at all Banks. These increases realigned the discount rate with market rates and exerted an independent
influence on the cost and availability of funds. Member bank borrowings
at Reserve Banks continued to be greater than excess reserves during 1956,
except for three weeks, although the volume of borrowed reserves tended to
decline in the latter part of the year (Chart 18).
In the course of the year it became increasingly apparent that tighter
credit conditions affected unevenly different sectors of the economy and
different types of businesses. New and smaller business firms appeared to
find it more difficult to satisfy their financing requirements than established
and larger concerns. Also, the changes in the cost and availability of credit
exerted especially severe effects on home building. Consequently, the
Administration took steps to moderate the adverse impact of credit stringency in certain areas but sought to do this without impairing the effectiveness of the general policy of credit restraint.
By early 1956 there was a distinct increase in applications to the Small
Business Administration (SBA) by qualifying small concerns that could not
obtain financing elsewhere. A supplemental appropriation of $20 million
to this agency's revolving fund was requested and approved by the Congress
in the fiscal year 1956. An additional $50 million was appropriated for the
fiscal year 1957. These actions enabled SBA to increase its lending to small
concerns. At the same time, efforts to increase the participation of private
financial institutions in the loan program of SBA were intensified.
Some of the restraints in the field of home building that had been initiated
in 1955 by Federal agencies were eased as the danger of local excess supplies
of new houses was moderated in most areas. In January, the maximum
maturity of Government-underwritten home loans was restored to the legal

limit of 30 years. In April and again in September, the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board relaxed its earlier limitations on ordinary borrowings by savings
and loan associations from the Federal Home Loan Banks. In September
the 1955 increase in minimum downpayments was revoked by the Federal
Housing Administration for homes appraised at $9,000 or less.
Additional actions were taken in the late summer to soften the cumulative impact of the credit stringency. In its secondary market operations,
the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) reduced the required subscription to its stock by sellers of home mortgages and raised the
price at which it issues advance commitments. By increasing the cash
proceeds from sales of mortgage loans, these measures facilitated access of
lenders to FNMA, whose purchases increased rapidly during the second
half of 1956. Finally, action was taken in December to help remove a
more basic impediment to home building and home financing. The maximum interest rate permitted on FHA-insured loans was raised administratively to place them in a better competitive position in the capital market
and thus to encourage a greater flow of funds into mortgage investment.
Economic developments in recent years show the basic role that monetary
and fiscal restraints must play if the excesses that often accompany prosperity are to be avoided. At the same time, this experience suggests that
fiscal and monetary policies must be supported by appropriate private policies to assure both a high level of economic activity and a stable dollar.
When production, sales, and employment are high, wage and price increases
in important industries create upward pressures on costs and prices generally. To depend exclusively on monetary and fiscal restraints as a means
of containing the upward movement of prices would raise serious obstacles
to the maintenance of economic growth and stability. In the face of a
continuous upward pressure on costs and prices, moderate restraints would
not be sufficient; yet stronger restraints would bear with undue severity on
sectors of the economy having little if any responsibility for the movement
toward a higher cost-price level and would court the risk of being excessively
restrictive for the economy generally.
These are not acceptable alternatives to stable and balanced economic
growth. The American economy possesses the potentials for expansion
and improvement. If these potentials are supported by proper fiscal and
monetary policies on the part of Government, and by appropriate private
policies, our economy can achieve and maintain high levels of production,
employment, and income with stable prices.
T H E CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION

The level of economic activity was high as 1956 ended. Business capital
outlays were still increasing in volume. Nonagricultural employment and
payrolls were growing, and unemployment was low. Retail sales were
rising during the final quarter of the year. Foreign trade and investment




44

remained high, and agricultural exports were particularly large. The steady
rise of expenditures by State and local governments was continuing, and
expenditures of the Federal Government increased moderately.
On the other hand, outlays for residential building, and the output of
some products dependent on it, were continuing their already extended
decline, although housing starts remained above an annual rate of 1 million
during the final months of the year. Prompted by persistent and heavy
competitive pressures, adjustments in output were being made by manufacturers of some of the major household appliances. The demand for
funds was generally heavy relative to the supply, and business concerns and
financial institutions were in a less liquid position as a result of the heavy
financing requirements they had met during the year.
Business inventories increased during the closing months of 1956, largely
reflecting additions to stocks by automobile dealers and manufacturers,
further acquisitions by the machinery and equipment industries, in which
output and sales were rising, and enlargement of stocks by steel users
generally. On the whole, however, inventories did not appear to be
excessive relative to sales.
How economic activity will move in the coming months cannot be confidently foreseen, but the likely direction of movement of certain major
categories of expenditure and demand is suggested by facts now available.
First, present indications are that business capital outlays will rise moderately
during the months ahead. Orders for durable goods have been exceeding
sales for some time, so that unfilled orders, particularly those for industrial
and electrical machinery, have continued to rise. Surveys of business plans
for capital expenditure in 1957 also point to some further increase above
current levels. However, these surveys suggest a lower rate of increase than
in 1956. Some of the unusually large expansion programs begun a year or
two ago are scheduled to be completed this year. Financing considerations
have prompted the postponement of some projects. And further increases
in the output of capital goods will inevitably be limited by the fact that some
of the industries producing capital goods are themselves operating at or near
capacity rates.
Second, the long-extended increase in State and local government expendituresâ€”nearly $3 billion per year in recent yearsâ€”can be expected to
continue as these units endeavor to meet the rapidly rising requirements for
their facilities and services. Federal spending also is expected to be somewhat higher during the calendar year 1957, because of defense needs and
obligations for essential civilian services.
Third, planned expansions in public projects, together with the large
capital outlays of businesses and increases in institutional building, favor a
high rate of total expenditure for new construction in the months ahead.
Home builders' plans for the new season, however, appear to have been
affected by the limited availability of mortgage investment funds, though
recent Government actions should help cushion the impact of credit re-




45

straints on home building. The reduced supply of new homes tends to
create market conditions favorable to the absorption of additional
construction.
Fourth, while the factors influencing our markets abroad are complex
and diverse, foreign trade and investment on balance appear likely to remain
high.
Finally, the positive elements in the current economic situation augur
well for high employment which, combined with good earnings, should
provide consumers with the means to spend more in the months ahead.
The confidence of the American people in the strength of the economy
remains high, favoring continued large consumer expenditures. The persistent drive of our people to improve their levels of living and their willingness to work hard to achieve this purpose are important for the near-term
economic outlook as well as for the vitality of our economic system in the
long run.
Uncertainties are always present, however, and allowances must be made
for them. One of the most important stems from the present international
situation. A second relates to the movement of prices. While the moderate upward drift of the price level may not yet have run its course, enlarged
output, improved productivity, and vigorous competition, supported by
appropriate public and private policies, can help counteract the forces
making for higher prices.
A third element of uncertainty pertains to the various factors that affect
the initiation of new programs of capital outlays by businesses. Although
there were indications of improvement at the close of 1956, profit margins
and total profits in many industries were reduced by rising costs. In some
cases, declining profits tend to accelerate capital outlays, as businesses seek
to reduce costs through the installation of more efficient productive facilities;
in others, capital outlays are adversely affected, as lower profits reduce both
the incentive and the financial ability to maintain or augment these expenditures. Finally, while the flow of new savings available for investment should
remain large, meeting the prospective heavy private demands for funds and
those of State and local governments will continue to pose problems of timing and balance in the capital markets.
These and other uncertainties and problems which inevitably arise in a
dynamic economy present a challenge to Government and to individuals and
economic groups to meet their respective responsibilities for maintaining
stable economic growth. If all live up to these responsibilities, there are
grounds for confidence that the over-all prosperity which the Nation has
been enjoying will be extended into the months ahead, and that the capacity
of our economy to provide the high levels of employment, production, and
purchasing power envisaged by the Employment Act will be further enhanced. Favorable attention by the Congress to the economic program
outlined in the next chapter can make a major contribution to achieving
these objectives.




Chapter 4

Extending and Broadening Economic Progress
HE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS presented in this chapter and in
the three preceding Economic Reports have been designed to implement
the Employment Act by fostering, guiding, and complementing private
economic activity. The accent and detail of these programs have varied
according to economic conditions and prospects. But in every case they
have been shaped by three common objectives: to strengthen our enterprise
system, to enlarge our national resources, and to improve our level of living.
The proposals put forward in this chapter seek to achieve the first of these
objectives by maintaining sound public finances, improving private financial
facilities, promoting thrift, strengthening competition, widening opportunities for small business, and strengthening economic ties with other
countries. The second objective leads to proposals for increasing our public
assets where needed, developing our human and natural resources, promoting agricultural adjustments, and assisting local areas that experience
persistent unemployment. As steps toward the third goal, proposals are
advanced for improving housing, health, and personal security. The program as a whole is designed to consolidate the economic gains already
achieved and to strengthen the base for further progress.

T

MAINTAINING SOUND GOVERNMENT FINANCES

Expenditures of all Federal, State, and local agencies currently account
for nearly one out of every five dollars spent on goods and services in the
United States. This fact provides a measure of the magnitude of governmental demands in our economy, whether or not they involve a budgetary
deficit, and emphasizes the importance of wise and responsible budget
policy at all levels of government.
Three fundamentals of budgetary policy have guided the Administration
in conducting the fiscal affairs of the Federal Government in the last four
years. First, there is the strict discipline which the budget properly exercises over expenditures. While adequate provision must be made for essential services that Government is in the best position to provide, the test of
essentiality should be firmly applied. This principle of budgetary policy
leaves no room for operations of the Federal Government that are not truly
necessary, or that can be performed better and more economically through
private efforts or by State or local governments. A second major principle




47

of budgetary policy derives from the fact that large governmental expenditures inevitably place a heavy burden of taxes on the economy. This burden
must ultimately be borne by the individual citizen, wherever and however the taxes are levied. Sound fiscal policy distributes the tax burden as
fairly as possible and imposes the least possible restraint on those incentivesâ€”to work, to save, and to investâ€”that are basic both to our system of
competitive enterprise and to the growth potential of the economy. A
third aspect of fiscal management, which has rightly received increased
attention in recent years, is that the financial affairs of Government should
be so administered as to help stabilize the economy and to encourage sound
growth. The principle of flexibility in fiscal policy calls for relating the
budget as far as feasible to economic conditions, helping to counteract
inflationary or deflationary tendencies as the situation requires.
These fundamentals of budgetary policy also provide sound guidance
today. The present situation requires that Government expenditures be
kept under close control. Increases should be limited to clearly essential
needs, and reductions should be achieved wherever possible. In this way
the Federal Government can avoid adding unnecessarily to the pressures
to which the economy is already subject. The legislative proposals presented here have been formulated with this consideration in view. The
Congress, also, should scrutinize with special care all suggestions for legislative action that would place additional burdens on the Federal budget.
In view of the budgetary outlook and prospective economic conditions,
present tax rates should be continued so as to preserve a high level of
revenue and to permit a further reduction of debt. The excise rates on
automobiles and parts, cigarettes, distilled spirits, wines, and beer, and the
tax rate on the income of corporations, should be retained at their present
levels for another year. Certain proposals for tax adjustments for small
business concerns are discussed in a later section of this chapter.
The maximum limit set by the Congress on the size of the Federal debt
is now $278 billion, but it will return to $275 billion on June 30, 1957, in
accordance with present law. The current outlook for budget surpluses
available for debt retirement both this year and next, together with a
steadily improving seasonal distribution of revenue, should permit the
Treasury to operate within the $275 billion ceiling during the fiscal year
1958. This will be true, however, only if expenditures are kept under close
control by both the Executive and the Congress and if tax revenues come
up to expectation.
The expenditures of State and local governments are now about half
those of the Federal Government, and their recent rate of increase has
been considerably higher. The principal objects of this increased spending
are schools, highways, and the variety of community facilities required by
population increase and the rapid growth of suburban areas. In view of
the exceptionally high demands for the labor, materials, and equipment
needed to carry out these projects, it is inevitable that not all of them




can go forward as rapidly, or on as large a scale, as may be desired. Financial considerations also may require some rescheduling of proposed projects,
since State and local governments with large borrowing requirements have
already encountered heavy competing demands in the capital markets.
Some improvement in the ability of these governmental units to finance
their projects would result from an amendment of the Internal Revenue
Code to extend the "conduit principle" to regulated investment companies
that hold their assets in State and local securities. The amendment, which
would involve no loss of revenue, would permit regulated investment companies of this type to pass through to their stockholders the tax-exempt
status of the income received on State and local securities. The Congress
is requested to enact legislation to accomplish this result.
The Economic Report of January 1956 recommended that State governments review State and local debt limits and other legal restrictions on
borrowing for public works. The pressures on debt limits have increased
in the past year. In view of the heavy prospective capital expenditures
required of State and local governments, and the fiscal capacities of these
governments, existing legal limits on the amount of debt and interest rates
may in some cases still not be realistic.
IMPROVING PRIVATE FINANCIAL FACILITIES AND PROMOTING THRIFT

The exceptionally heavy demands which economic expansion is placing
on credit and capital markets have directed attention increasingly to questions concerning the adequacy of our financial facilities, and of the laws
and regulations which govern their operation. Alert to these problems,
the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency during the past year made
an extensive and constructive investigation of Federal laws affecting financial institutions. The impact on the economy of monetary policies designed
to restrain inflationary pressures has also become increasingly a matter of
public concern. There is need at this time of a thorough study of recent
changes in our financial structure and practices, covering the activities
of public as well as private agencies, and of the legislative and administrative steps needed to improve our facilities for meeting credit and capital
requirements and for exercising appropriate controls over credit. The
State of the Union Message recommended that the Congress authorize a
National Monetary and Financial Commission to perform this important
task. The Commission should be composed of distinguished citizens of outstanding competence and experience in the range of questions to be studied.
Last year's Economic Report stated that the time was appropriate for
the Congress and the Executive Branch to study the need for stand-by
authority to set limits, whenever required by economic conditions, on the
downpayment and maturity terms of instalment credit for the purchase of
consumer durable goods. At the request of the President, the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System undertook a comprehensive study
of the subject early in 1956. The full results of this study will shortly




49

become available. They will serve as a useful guide in determining whether
legislative action is desirable.
The Congress is requested to give favorable consideration to proposals
that will be made for strengthening the Securities and Exchange Commission's authority to prevent certain remaining types of abuses in the distribution and sale of securities. Securities legislation must be guided by
twin objectives. It must afford adequate protection to the investor and at
the same time facilitate the flow of investment funds into legitimate business
undertakings. It is important in the latter connection to take due account
of the needs of small and medium-sized concerns for capital, and particularly
for venture capital.
If a vigorous rate of economic growth is to be realized without recourse
to inflationary finance, the supply of savings must be sufficiently high to
meet the heavy demands for funds for private, State, and local undertakings. The Federal Government is releasing funds for such purposes by a
budgetary surplus and reduction of its debt. But the individual occupies
a strategic position in the saving process. The most important contributions that the Federal Government can make toward encouraging individual thrift are to help sustain high levels of employment and income and
to preserve the buying power of the dollar. Government can also help by
making needed adjustments in the rate of return on savings, where maximum limits are set by law or by administrative action. The recent action
of the Federal Reserve authorities and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation in raising the upper limit of interest rates on time and savings
deposits at commercial banks was designed both to give positive encouragement to additional saving, and to place these forms of savings in a better
competitive position relative to other forms.
STRENGTHENING COMPETITION

The capacity of our free economy to grow and to spread its benefits widely
derives in large measure from the discipline provided by competitive
markets. It is this discipline that converts the natural drive for selfadvancement into a constructive social force and curbs the misuse of
economic power. The preservation and strengthening of competition
must, therefore, be a leading objective of public policy. It is not the role
of Government to regulate the size of business as such, for large as well as
small concerns serve socially constructive purposes in a competitive economy.
The essential function of Government in this sphere is to foster a competitive environment in which all segments of business can share fairly in
opportunities to realize their potentialities. Vigorous enforcement of the
antitrust laws is basic to the attainment of this objective, for threats of
encroachment on competition are always present and assume constantly
changing forms. Accordingly, the agencies of Government charged with




5Â°

enforcing the antitrust laws must be constantly alert and must have adequate
means to discharge their responsibilities.
Both the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have
in recent years increased the rate of filing new proceedings, many of which
affect broad and vital areas of the economy. They have done much also to
make Section 7 of the Clayton Act an effective antitrust weapon. The vigorous application of this law provides a strong deterrent to mergers, whether
accomplished through the acquisition of assets or by the purchase of stock,
that may tend substantially to lessen competition or to create a monopoly.
Steps have been taken by both agencies to expedite the disposition of
antitrust cases and to follow up on compliance. The Justice Department
has made effective use of prefiling negotiations and is making a continuing
effort to secure enforcement in actions successfully terminated. Similarly,
the Federal Trade Commission has screened over 2,000 cease-and-desist
orders since August 1954, to bring their compliance up to date.
To perform their purpose fully, the antitrust laws require not only vigorous enforcement but adaptation to changing economic conditions. This
fact was recognized by the appointment in 1953 of the Attorney General's
National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws, and by the enactment, in
substance, of three of the Committee's proposals. Further recommendations
were made last year in the Economic Report and in the Progress Report of
the Cabinet Committee on Small Business. The Congress is urged to take
favorable action on these proposals. First, to aid proper enforcement of
merger and other antitrust statutes, the Attorney General should have the
power, where civil proceedings are contemplated, to issue a civil investigative
demand, thus making possible the production of necessary documents without the need of grand jury proceedings. Second, cease-and-desist orders
of the Federal Trade Commission under the Clayton Act should be made
final, unless appealed to the courts. Third, a series of interrelated measures would strengthen the Government's ability to deal specifically with
mergers: requirement of advance notification of proposed mergers that are
likely to have significant effect on competition; extension of Federal regulation to cover bank mergers by asset as well as by stock acquisition; application
of the Clayton Act to mergers where either party is in interstate commerce;
and authorization of the Federal Trade Commission, in merger cases where it
believes violation is likely, to seek a preliminary injunction before a complaint is filed.
In the field of regulated industries we have departed to a degree from our
traditional reliance on competitive market forces and substituted direct
Government regulation as a means of protecting the public interest. The
Presidential Advisory Committee on Transport Policy and Organization has
made recommendations that would free common carriers from certain
administrative limitations on their ability to compete. The National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws called for Congressional inquiry to




determine whether greater application of antitrust laws to regulated areas
might be warranted. The recommendations of these two groups deserve
consideration by the Congress.
WIDENING THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMALL BUSINESS

An intensive and continuing study of the problems confronting small
business is being made by the Cabinet Committee on Small Business, which
was appointed by the President on May 31, 1956. The Committee is
charged with the task of formulating recommendations for administrative
and legislative actions to expand the opportunities of small firms to grow
and prosper. While policies that strengthen competitive forces and foster
stable economic growth are the surest means for improving the opportunities of small business in a free economy, specific, measures are needed to deal
with problems of special importance to this sector of the economy.
The first Progress Report of the Committee, which was submitted on
August 7, 1956, made 14 recommendations for action. The substance of
two of the Committee's recommendations, directed to the preservation and
strengthening of competitive markets, was dealt with in the preceding section of this Report; others concern financing and technical assistance, taxation, procurement, and paperwork.
Small businesses, particularly those that are new and growing, frequently
encounter difficulty in obtaining the amount and type of financing they
need. Several Government programs help meet this problem. First, the
Small Business Administration makes loans to qualifying small businesses
unable to obtain funds on reasonable terms from private sources. It has
performed this function as far as possible with the participation of private
financial institutions. In 1955, the continuation for two more years of
the Small Business Administration was approved, and its lending authority
was strengthened. At this time the Congress is requested to extend the
Small Business Act.
Second, the access of small and medium-sized businesses to the capital
markets is facilitated by the provision of a simplified notification procedure
for issues of securities that do not exceed $300,000, and by the examination
and processing of applications for such small issues by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in its field offices. In view of the increased needs
for capital which confront small business in a growing economy, the
Cabinet Committee recommended that the Congress authorize the extension
of these simplified procedures to issue of securities that do not exceed
$500,000. To avoid any lessening of protection to investors, the procedures
should be allowed only to seasoned businesses and withheld from so-called
"penny stocks." The Congress is urged to take favorable action on this
Cabinet Committee proposal.
Small businesses have benefited materially from recent tax law changesâ€”
the expiration of the excess profits tax, the 1954 reduction of the personal




income tax, and the extensive revision of the Internal Revenue Code.
However, the reliance of small concerns on self-financing is such that they
are especially sensitive to the burden of taxation. Certain adjustments in
the tax laws would ease their financing problems and help maintain their
independent status. The Cabinet Committee on Small Business made a
careful study of tax changes that would benefit small business concerns,
and presented a number of recommendations for such changes. The Congress should give early consideration to those Cabinet Committee recommendations for tax relief that would involve only a minimum loss of revenue.
Consideration of further changes should be deferred until such time as a
general tax reduction is possible.
Efforts to widen the participation of small business in Government procurement must continue. Under Defense Department programs, small
business suppliers are actively sought out and given an opportunity to
compete for contracts on fair terms with larger companies. The Department has cooperated with the Small Business Administration in a joint setaside program under which procurement contracts are screened for award
to small business. In the past year this program was extended to various
civilian executive agencies, following a successful pilot program conducted
by the General Services Administration in 1955 in cooperation with the
Small Business Administration. Also, the Defense Department, mindful
of the limited opportunities for prime contracting open to such businesses as
defense weapons become more complex, has initiated a program to stimulate
subcontracting with small businesses.
Three additional recommendations on procurement programs, which
were made by the Cabinet Committee on Small Business, have already been
given effect by administrative action. First, a comprehensive review of
procurement policies, procedures, and legislation, covering all departments
and agencies, is being conducted by the General Services Administration.
Second, regulations have been issued by those departments and agencies
responsible for substantial amounts of procurement to assure prompt availability of progress payments and to make certain that the need for advance or
progress payments will not handicap a qualified potential contractor in
competing for procurement. Third, through amendment of its regulations,
the Renegotiation Board has made it clear that subcontracting, especially
with small concerns, is given favorable consideration in the determination
of allowable profits, although the allowable profit to a prime contractor on
subcontracted work may not be as large as on the work that he does himself.
The Federal Government can save small businesses time and money by
reducing the paperwork required by its programs. In this connection, the
Congress is requested to authorize the consolidation of wage reporting by
employers for income tax withholding and old age and survivors insurance purposes. As recommended by the Cabinet Committee on Small
Business, the Bureau of the Budget is reviewing the reports and statistics
which small businesses must now maintain for, or supply to, Government,




53

in order to simplify them. This desirable objective must be weighed,
however, against the need for better information on the economic position
of small businesses.
The facilities of a commercial or industrial type that are owned and
operated by the Federal Government compete in many cases with private
enterprise, and particularly with small businesses. Each Government
agency has been instructed to examine its activities of this type and to discontinue or curtail them wherever feasible and consistent with the public
interest.
STRENGTHENING ECONOMIC TIES W I T H OTHER COUNTRIES

A major objective of United States foreign economic policy continues to
be to facilitate and increase the international flow of goods and capital on a
nondiscriminatory basis. Since the volume of our imports and the amount
of private funds available for investment abroad depend mainly on domestic
prosperity, a stable and growing economy at home is an essential foundation for a sound structure of world trade. But positive measures are needed
to help other nations participate in the growth and prosperity of the free
world. Considerable progress has been made in this direction in the last
four years, but important opportunities remain.
By multilateral reductions of trade barriers, the United States has promoted the nondiscriminatory flow of goods, while reserving the right to
prevent serious injury to domestic industries. The authority initially granted
by the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 was extended until
June 30, 1958, with some modifications, by the Trade Agreements Extension
Act of 1955. The 1955 legislation provided the President with certain
new authority. Specifically, it permitted the reduction of tariffs on a reciprocal basis by as much as 5 percent a year for three years, and made
possible the reduction, in annual stages, of rates in excess of 50 percent ad
valorem to the 50 percent level. In accordance with this legislation, reciprocal tariff concessions involving approximately $1 billion of United States
exports and imports were negotiated with 21 foreign countries in 1956 under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In 1955, prior
to the passage of the Trade Agreements Extension Act, the United States
and 16 other countries concluded substantial tariff negotiations with Japan
under the GATT, thereby bringing that country economically closer to the
rest of the free world. The "escape clause" and "peril point" provisions of
the Trade Agreements Act, which are designed to protect domestic industries against serious injury from tariff concessions, continue to serve as safeguards for domestic enterprise in a manner broadly consistent with trade
liberalization.
Multilateral negotiations under the GATT have been more effective than
bilateral negotiations in reducing trade barriers and discriminatory restrictions against our exports. To make the GATT an even more effective




54

instrument for removing discrimination against our exports, an administrative agencyâ€”the Organization for Trade Cooperationâ€”is required. In
order to enhance the advantages that the GATT now provides, Congress is
requested to enact legislation authorizing United States membership in the
Organization for Trade Cooperation.
The United States has provided large sums to assist the economic development of other countries through Government grants and loans and private
investment. The last three Economic Reports have emphasized the desirability of encouraging private investment in countries seeking to expedite
their development. Private investment is generally accompanied by technical and managerial services that are as necessary as capital funds but are
often more difficult to obtain. At present, foreign tax inducements to
attract capital are in some situations nullified by not allowing credit in
determining United States tax liability for income taxes waived by the country in which the investment is made. The investment of private funds
abroad would be facilitated by tax treaties which, subject to appropriate
safeguards, recognize the laws of other countries designed to attract new
investment.
The economic development of the free world has been materially aided
by grants and loans extended by our Government. For the current fiscal
year, $1.8 billion was appropriated for nonmilitary assistance under the
Mutual Security Program, including defense support, development assistance, technical cooperation, and other programs. Recommendations will
be presented to the Congress to continue this assistance and to provide the
flexibility needed to help meet the challenge of rapidly changing international conditions.
The Export-Import Bank has loaned substantial amounts to finance our
exports and to assist economic development abroad. Private capital has
been associated with many of these loans, thus augmenting the effectiveness
of the Bank's operations. The authority of the Export-Import Bank to
approve credits, which expires June 30, 1958, should be extended.
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the
International Monetary Fund, which rely in large part on the capital subscriptions and guarantees of the United States Government, increased their
dollar transactions markedly in 1956. The lending activities of the Bank
aid in the sound economic development of its member countries. The
International Monetary Fund helps member countries meet temporary
maladjustments in their balance of payments positions and promotes sound
international financial policies and freer foreign exchange transactions.
Recently, it provided funds to strengthen the reserve position of the United
Kingdom.
United States customs procedures were simplified and inequities removed
by legislation enacted in 1953 and 1956. In accordance with the 1953 law,
a series of administrative actions has liberalized import invoice requirements.




55

The Customs Simplification Act of 1956 is intended to reduce burdensome
delays and uncertainties by modifying the methods employed in the customs
valuation of imported merchandise. On the basis of other legislation, the
Tariff Commission is investigating ways to improve the present system of
commodity classification and the customs rate structure.
Two promising moves now under study would further the economic integration of Western Europe. One is the establishment of a common market,
without internal trade barriers, among the six continental nations comprising the European Coal and Steel Community. The second is the association of the United Kingdom with these countries and other continental
nations in a free trade area. These moves, if brought to a constructive
conclusion, should add much to the growing economic strength and political
unification of the area, with substantial benefits to the United States and
the entire free world.
The continued industrialization of Western Europe and of much of the
rest of the world requires the expansion of economical sources of energy.
Members of the European Steel and Coal Community are planning cooperative efforts in the field of atomic energy. Action should be taken by the
Congress to authorize full participation by the United States in the work of
the International Atomic Energy Agency of the United Nations, in order
to extend our program of helping free-world nations share in the benefits of
peaceful use of the atom.
ENLARGING PUBLIC ASSETS AND DEVELOPING NATURAL RESOURCES

Notable improvements have been made in the last four years in developing our natural resources and bringing the Nation's stock of public assets
more nearly into line with the expanded private economy and the requirements of improved levels of living. The amount spent on public construction, including State and local but excluding military and industrial-type
projects, increased steadily from $7.8 billion in 1952 to $11.6 billion in 1956.
In percentage terms, this increase outstripped the growth in national output
as a whole and exceeded the rise in private construction expenditures.
Three major public works programs, involving substantial Federal outlays, were initiated. First, work was started in 1954 on the St. Lawrence
Seaway, which will extend ocean transport into the heart of the Nation.
Construction of the United States sector of the Seaway proper is being financed through revenue bonds issued to the United States Treasury, while
associated storage dams and power installations will be financed by nonFederal agencies. The construction costs of these associated projects will
substantially exceed the outlays of the Federal Government. Second, the
Upper Colorado River Basin project was authorized in 1956. By providing
flood control, hydroelectric power, and water for irrigation and other uses,
this project will eventually transform an undeveloped area, comprising parts
of several States, into a major national productive asset. Third, few devel-




opments in our time offer greater promise for the Nation's future growth
than the $25 billion, 13-year program enacted by the Congress last year for a
national system of interstate highways.
A number of other actions have been taken in the last four years to add
to our public assets and improve our natural resources. Expenditures
for flood control have been increased. Specific Federal grants have been
authorized for assisting the construction of pollution abatement works and
sewage treatment facilities and for upstream watershed protection. Federal loans have been authorized for small irrigation projects. The tax laws
have been revised to encourage private expenditures for conservation. A
start has been made on Mission 66, a ten-year program of major improvements in our national parks. A unit has been established within the Executive Branch to encourage and coordinate long-range public works planning
at all levels of government. Urban planning has been strengthened
through grants to the States for assisting small municipalities and metropolitan or regional agencies in this activity and through the expanded Urban
Renewal Program. Provision has also been made for interest-free advances
for planning local public works and for loans to construct public works, if
financing on reasonable terms is otherwise unavailable. Priority for these
loans is given to smaller communities. Sound principles have been developed for sharing the responsibility for improving public assets and natural
resources among Federal and State and local governments. The Nation's
mineral resource base has been strengthened by a number of Federal programs, including those of the Department of Interior for mapping, exploration, and research in mining methods and metallurgy.
Special efforts have been made in recent years to develop nuclear technology as a constructive resource. Progress was accelerated by the 1954
amendment of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 and subsequent administrative actions of the Atomic Energy Commission. The new law has facilitated the advance of our international leadership along lines laid down
in the "Atoms for Peace" proposal made to the United Nations in
December 1953. Increasing use of radioisotopes is being made, here and
abroad, in research, medical therapy, and industrial processes and operations. Government policy places particular stress on private development
of large-scale reactors that use the heat of atomic fission in the generation
of electricity at competitive prices. This new source of energy will acquire
increasing significance as accessible and high-grade reserves of coal, oil,
and gas are progressively consumed. Other nations not so well endowed as
our own with relatively low-cost fossil fuels could benefit sooner from the
availability of atomic energy. The possibility of developing thermonuclear
(fusion) reactors for generating low-cost energy from abundant hydrogen
is also being explored.
On the whole, there appears to be adequate incentive for participation
by non-Federal interests in the development and application of nuclear
technology. But if there is a lag in the construction of large-scale commer-




57

cial power reactors by these interests, it may be necessary to request funds at
a later date for direct Federal construction.
The Congress is requested to authorize partial governmental insurance
against industrial atomic hazards. If provision were made for Federal
insurance of liability, in excess of the amounts covered by private companies, additional encouragement would be given to the private undertaking
of extensive projects, including the construction and operation of commercial reactors.
Federal assistance in the development of public assets must be extended
to help meet needs in certain areas of vital national interest. None of these
is more important than the speedy expansion of school classroom facilities.
The Congress was requested last year to enact a program of Federal assistance to help overcome the critical shortage of schoolrooms. This program
was designed to supplement the already large efforts of State and local
governments to the extent necessary to meet the backlog of these needs
within five years, after which time full responsibility for school construction
would revert to the State and local governments. The Congress is again
urged to act on these recommendations. To make up for lost time, provision
should be made for completing the program in four instead of five years.
The President's Advisory Committee on Water Resources Policy has
reported on the problems of providing the rapidly increasing amounts of
water required by population growth and economic expansion. It made
certain organizational proposals, urged the development of more consistent
policies of cooperation and cost-sharing with State and local governments
and other interests, and stressed the importance of long-range, basin-wide
planning. Recommendations for any legislation necessary to accomplish
these purposes will be submitted to the Congress as they are developed.
The partnership principle, which encourages local leadership and participation in the development of water and power resources, should
continue to receive close attention in current authorizations and appropriations. Federal responsibilities in specific projects should be so defined as
to stimulate and facilitate cooperative efforts with State and local governments and private enterprise. Except for complex multipurpose projects
of paramount national interest, for which local resources are clearly insufficient or in which local benefits cannot be clearly equated with local cost
burdens, the partnership principle assures maximum benefits and speed of
completion within appropriate limits of Federal participation. One such
multipurpose development which the Congress is requested to authorize
is the Fryingpan-Arkansas project. This undertaking would provide water,
supplemental irrigation, and power in parts of several States.
The prospects for long-term population growth present a challenge to
the numerous governmental units responsible for providing community
facilities. Large increases in population may be expected to occur mainly
in metropolitan areas, where they will intensify certain already familiar




difficulties of State and local governments. These difficulties include the
division of authority among governmental units and a lack of jurisdictions
furnishing area-wide services; the unequal distribution within metropolitan
areas of taxable capacity relative to needs for public services; State constitutional and other restrictions on local taxing and borrowing powers;
and inadequate provision for the preparation of long-range capital expenditure and revenue programs.
The main responsibility for resolving these difficulties lies with the State
and local governments. Tangible evidence of an increasing awareness of
this responsibility is provided by the recent report of the Council of State
Governments. This report, prepared at the direction of the Governors'
Conference, recommends specific approaches to solving the governmental
problems of metropolitan areas. Also, a few metropolitan areas are preparing to consolidate their planning or service functions, and a number of
private foundations and citizens' groups are working toward a better understanding of metropolitan problems. But still greater efforts are required to
arrive at early practical solutions.
The Federal Government has taken steps to assist these efforts in accordance with the recommendations of the President's Commission on Intergovernmental Relations. Consideration is being given to the need for better
coordination of Federal programs affecting urban areas. Ways of helping
State and local governments plan more adequately for future growth are
being explored. The initiative and major resources for solving the problems of urban growth must come, however, from the local government units
and, basically, from an enlightened citizenry.
IMPROVING SKILLS AND TECHNOLOGY

Shortages of trained manpower exist in virtually every field. Although
the supply of scientific, engineering, and other technical and skilled manpower has grown rapidly in recent decades, the demand has increased even
more rapidly. Present limitations on the supply of trained manpower are
traceable to many factors, including the low birth rates of the 1930's, the
failure of many talented youths to complete high school or college, relatively long training periods, shortages of qualified teachers, and inadequacies of facilities and equipment for research and training. Current
heavy demands for specialized personnel reflect the requirements of military and atomic programs, the increasing complexities of the underlying
technology, and the expanding needs of private industry as good times
sustain markets, encourage diversification of lines, and stimulate civilian
application of defense-related innovations.
The intensity of current operations on the technological frontier is indicated by the magnitude of research and development expenditures. Although estimates vary according to definition, the magnitude is notable by
reference to any standard. National Science Foundation figures show an




59

average annual expenditure of more than $3 billion by the Federal Government in the fiscal years 1955-57, if certain admissible Department of Defense
items not normally included are taken into account, A still broader definition would raise the 1957 estimate for the Department of Defense alone to
$5.2 billion. The 1954 revision of the Internal Revenue Code with respect
to treatment of research expenditures encouraged the formalization and
expansion of industry research programs. Since private outlays amount to
about $3 billion, the total annual national expenditure for research and
development now ranges from about $6 billion to about $9 billion.
The Federal Government has taken many steps to meet its specialized
manpower needs and to improve the supply in general. Various departments and agencies maintain training programs for essential skills, administer grants and fellowships, help provide necessary equipment and
facilities, and make research contracts with universities, other institutions,
and business concerns. The National Science Foundation is devoting increasing funds to the encouragement of education in the sciences. It pays
particular attention to the development of personnel for the basic research
on which applied science rests, and to the improvement of high-school and
university teaching of sciences and mathematics. Efforts are being made
to secure more effective use of scarce technical manpower in research
undertakings that received Federal financial support. The services of the
Department of Labor's apprenticeship and training programs are being
strengthened and broadened.
Two Presidential Committees were established last year to deal with
problems of improving our human resources. The Committee on Education Beyond the High School is focusing attention on the need for providing teachers and buildings for the expected rising tide of college enrollments
and on ways of reducing the loss of talent that results from premature
discontinuance of schooling by capable students. The National Committee
for the Development of Scientists and Engineers is assessing the occupational
shortages within its scope, exploring related problems, and enlisting the aid
of interested organizations in working out solutions. Legislative recommendations may emerge from the work of these two Committees.
Federal actions have been directed not only toward alleviating the current manpower shortages in particular fields but also toward strengthening
the Nation's basic educational system, which supports all subsequent instruction for working and living. In November 1955, a White House Conference
on Education reviewed the many facets of the public school problemâ€”
the provision of qualified teachers, the development of appropriate curricula, and the supply of needed classrooms. The Conference was the
culmination of a series of almost 4,000 State and local meetings attended
by a half million citizens. Prompt action is requested on the program of
Federal assistance for school construction recommended earlier in this
chapter.

PROMOTING AGRICULTURAL ADJUSTMENTS

A persistent tendency toward excessive carry-overs indicates that full
agricultural adjustment to peacetime conditions has not yet been accomplished. The Administration has made great efforts to move accumulated surpluses into consumption, at home and abroad, without seriously
disturbing commercial markets. The disposal overseas of surplus stocks
has received particular attention. This has involved direct and indirect
export aids, sales for foreign currencies under bilateral agreements, and
barter transactions. Although these programs have serious disadvantages,
they have been helpful as short-run measures. Accordingly, it is recommended that Title I of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act be extended by the Congress for one year beyond the current
expiration date of June 30, 1957, and the present limit on permissible losses
under this program be raised $1 billion. The short term of the extension
and the limited dollar authorization would serve to emphasize the temporary
nature of the program.
Greater progress must be made toward correcting the conditions that
generate surpluses if costly Government acquisition and disposal programs
are not to become permanent, if our relations with competing export countries are not to deteriorate, and if farmers' freedom of action is not to be
increasingly curtailed. The approach through severe restrictions on acreage planted to the basic crops has been only partially successful. Statutory
minimum allotments have prevented the full reductions in acreage warranted by carry-overs of wheat, cotton, and rice, and actual reductions have
been considerably offset by increases in yields per acre. The diversion of
considerable acreage from the basic commodities to other crops, notably
feed grains, has caused surplus conditions to spread. A new approach to
output adjustment was initiated in 1956 by the Soil Bank Act. Under this
Act, growers of basic crops are encouraged to plant less than their full
allotments and are compensated for part of the net income that they forego.
While participation in the program was encouraging, its net contribution to
reduction of output in 1956 was nominal. Most crops had already been
planted when the law was enacted, and the yield prospects on much of the
land placed in reserve had been reduced by drought.
The real test of the Soil Bank Program will come in 1957. Nearly 11
million acres of winter wheat land have already been placed in the 1957
acreage reserve, and participation by growers of other crops may raise the
total to 25 million acres. A 1957 goal of 20 million acres has been set for
the conservation reserve program, under which farmers may receive annual
payments for transferring cropland to specified conservation uses and may
be reimbursed for much of the initial cost incurred. If these targets are
reached, 1 out of every 9 acres of cropland would be taken out of production.
Output would not be reduced in the same proportion, however, since there
will be a tendency to put relatively low-yielding land into the soil bank




6i

while cultivation of the cropped acreage may be expected to be more intensive. Moreover, stocks carried over into the 1957-58 season will reflect the
large 1956 harvest, and reductions attributable to the 1957 soil bank will
not be fully evident until 1958.
In view of the gradual rise in crop yields and the rising productivity of
the land withheld from current cropping, the soil bank may be expected
to restrain output successively less in 1958 and 1959 than in 1957. One
attempt to meet this problem is being made by means of premium payments
for holding the same land in the soil bank for successive years. Any actions
that would diminish the Program's immediate impact must be avoided. In
order that growers of corn may have the opportunity of participating on
reasonable terms, recommendations will be presented to the Congress for
legislation along the lines of the program favored by a substantial majority
of the corn growers who voted in the recent referendum.
Price supports are a valuable instrument for moderating excessive fluctuations in prices and fostering stability in farm income. But experience shows
that they can be so used as to fail of their purpose and cause numerous
difficulties. The Administration has been gradually moving away from
supports at high, rigid percentages of parity originally introduced for the
purpose of stimulating output in wartime. As we make progress in the
essential task of reducing our huge accumulated surpluses, we must make
sure that statutory formulas do not operate to stimulate unneeded production and thus generate new price-depressing surpluses. The modernized
parity formula seeks to adjust the relationship among parity prices of individual commodities according to changing supply and demand conditions in the recent past. But the 10-year base for these adjustments is itself
distorted by exceptional demand conditions after World War II and during
the Korean conflict, as well as by the levels of support that have been in
effect for a number of commodities during some of these years. For certain
commodities, notably wheat and cotton, parity prices as now computed
under statutory formulas appear clearly out of line by any economic
standard.
The Secretary of Agriculture has been investigating possible revisions of
the parity formula, as required by the Agricultural Act of 1956. Not merely
the parity formula but also its application needs significant improvement,
and the concept of parity itself requires the closest scrutiny, if these devices
are to make the desired contribution to a prosperous, balanced, and free
agriculture.
The special needs of two sectors of the farm community have recently
called for new Government programs. First, emergency aid has been
given to farmers and stockmen in the drought-stricken regions of the Great
Plains. Since the beginning of 1953, more than $800 million of Federal
funds have been used for low-cost feed grain, subsidized hay and roughage,
emergency credit, distribution of free food, cost-sharing in projects to control wind erosion, and support purchases of cattle products. In designated




62

counties, permission was granted to graze land placed in the soil bank.
Benefits of a more permanent sort will be forthcoming from a program of
conservation and land-use adjustments in the Great Plains, authorized by
the Congress in 1956. The Administration will present recommendations
to the Congress for further steps to deal with problems of land use and water
shortage that have been accentuated by recent drought conditions.
Second, the Rural Development Program focuses on the 1 million farm
families and 1,000 low-income counties in rural areas that have shared only
partially in the general prosperity. The emphasis of this Program is on
mobilizing local, State, and Federal agencies, private industrial and commercial enterprises, and civic groups in a joint effort to promote balanced
economic growth in the communities involved. It is now in operation in
some 50 pilot counties or trade areas. Progress will come in part through
better farming, but education and vocational training, improvement of
health and personal security, information on full-time job opportunities off
the farm, and part-time farming supplemented by other employment, also
have important roles to play.
AIDING LOCAL AREAS OF PERSISTENT UNEMPLOYMENT

The high employment levels of the last few years have facilitated economic adjustments needed to correct persistent unemployment conditions
in various areas. Although the Federal Government makes its greatest contribution to the solution of local unemployment problems by following policies which promote stable growth for the economy as a whole, there are
many ways in which it helps local areas with more or less chronic unemployment. In awarding Federal procurement contracts, preference has been
given to businesses located in such areas. Also, defense facilities constructed
in the areas are accorded special accelerated tax amortization privileges.
Increased appropriations for the Office of Area Development in the Department of Commerce have made it possible to extend improved and augmented
services to many such areas. The Department of Labor, through affiliated
State agencies, has expanded community employment programs and services.
But greater efforts are needed to help certain localities strengthen their
economic base. In some cases the forces responsible for persistent unemployment are so strong and so varied that they will yield only to comprehensive measures taken jointly by private groups, State and local governments,
and the Federal Government. To supplement the efforts of local and State
groups, which in a number of areas have already achieved marked success
in stimulating sound economic development, an enlarged Federal program
of aid to areas of persistent unemployment was proposed to the Congress in
1956. The program provided for Federal loans to pay for part of the cost
of purchasing and developing land and facilities for industrial usage, for
grants for research to help communities evaluate their resources and needs
for economic development, and for an expanded program of technical assist-




ance through field consultation. In addition, the proposed legislation
would assure better coordination of existing Federal programs so as to make
them more useful in the revitalization of areas with longstanding unemployment. Under the proposed legislation an Area Assistance Administration
would be established in the Department of Commerce to administer the
expanded Federal services. The Congress is urged to enact legislation for
this program, including the necessary appropriations.
IMPROVING HOUSING STANDARDS

Better housing and better neighborhoods are essential elements in the
higher levels of living that our citizens continuously seek to achieve. A
variety of Federal programsâ€”including the insurance and guarantee of
home purchase and improvement loans, insurance of loans on rental housing
projects, and financial assistance to local governments for the rehabilitation
of urban neighborhoodsâ€”aid citizens in realizing these ambitions. TWQ
main principles guide the administration of these programs: they should
strengthen rather than supplant private and local government efforts and
should be limited to essential projects that citizens and business enterprises
or local governments, by themselves, cannot adequately carry out. The
soundness of these principles is manifested in the record volume of homes
built by private enterprise in the last four years, in the improved quality
of our stock of housing, in the more widespread ownership of homes, and
in the progress in slum clearance and urban renewal.
Several steps taken since 1953 have improved the Government's housing
and home financing programs. First, the Federal National Mortgage Association was reorganized in 1954 to provide for the use of private funds
in this important facility. At the end of 1956, $15 million of the Association's capital was held by private investors and $770 million of its borrowed
funds had been obtained in the private capital market. During the last year,
the Association rendered notable service in assisting a home mortgage
market that was subject to unusually heavy stress, and it continued to
support certain special housing programs. Second, a Voluntary Home
Mortgage Credit Program was established in 1954 to make private funds
more readily available in remote areas and for minority groups, thereby
reducing the need for direct Government lending. Through its services,
over 26,000 loans totaling over $230 million have been placed with private lenders. Third, the Urban Renewal Program of 1954 broadened
the earlier provisions for Federal aid to slum clearance by authorizing
assistance for the conservation and rehabilitation of urban areas. By
the end of 1956 about 250 projects in both small and large cities had been
approved for execution or final planning, and an additional 191 projects
were in more preliminary stages. Federal grants of $825 million disbursed
or set aside for this purpose have been, or will be, augmented by local contributions to a total of about $1.2 billion. Through projects now in advanced




stages, more than 9,000 acres of slums will be replaced by 75,000 new
housing units and by major industrial, commercial, and other facilities.
To encourage private investment in the rebuilding and rehabilitation
of blighted areas and in the provision of homes for persons displaced by
public programs, Federal mortgage insurance on favorable terms was made
available for residential projects in urban renewal areas and for persons
displaced from such areas. Other important changes in the Federal mortgage insurance programs included the equalization of downpayment requirements on new and used houses, which aids private construction by
improving the salability of existing homes, and provisions to help meet the
growing need for more adequate housing for the elderly.
Several legislative changes in Federal programs are needed at this time.
The effectiveness of the Federal mortgage insurance and guarantee programs has been seriously reduced of late, and home building has been
impeded, by ceilings on interest rates for Government-underwritten loans
that are below competitive market rates for comparable investments. This
condition has tended to diminish the flow of funds into the federally-sponsored programs on which large numbers of home purchasers and home
builders depend for low-downpayment and long-maturity mortgages. It
was partly corrected by administrative action in December 1956 when the
maximum interest rate on FHA-insured home loans was raised from 4J4
percent to 5 percent. The Congress is requested to amend the Servicemen's
Readjustment Act to permit a similar adjustment in the maximum interest
rate on VA-guaranteed home loans. This action would improve the competitive position of veterans' home loans in the capital market, and increase
the availability of credit for veterans desiring to exercise their right to
benefits under existing legislation.
The Congress is also requested to review other restrictive ceilings on
interest rates on Government-underwritten loans which are tending to defeat the purpose of encouraging private investment. Likewise, provisions
controlling the interest rate on Federal loans for college housing should be
amended to permit more frequent adjustments to the market yields on
long-term Government securities, and to bring forth a larger participation
of private capital in this rapidly expanding program.
To enable the Federal National Mortgage Association to continue purchases of mortgages in the secondary market, it is recommended that the
Treasury subscription to the Association's capital stock be increased by $100
million. Under existing law, this would add $1 billion to the Corporation's
authority to issue debentures and correspondingly augment its capacity to
buy mortgages. The Congress will be requested to make additional authorizations for the purchase by the Association of mortgage loans under
certain special-assistance programs.
Under legislation enacted last year, applications of World War II veterans
for home loan benefits will not be accepted after July 25, 1958. The Con-




gress may wish to consider changes in the Federal Housing Administration's
home mortgage insurance program to ease the adjustments in home building
and financing that are likely to accompany the expiration of these entitlements and to unify the mortgage insurance facilities available to veterans and
nonveterans.
The Voluntary Home Mortgage Credit Program, which has helped
channel private funds into home loans in remote areas, should be extended
beyond its scheduled expiration date of June 30, 1957.
Finally, the States can do much to improve the flow of funds into home
mortgages. Outmoded foreclosure laws, which add unnecessarily to the
risks and costs of mortgage lending, should be revised. Legal impediments
to investment by out-of-state institutions in federally-underwritten home
mortgages, which often result from undue restrictions on out-of-state corporations, should be removed. The investment of pension and welfare funds
in such loans should be encouraged within prudent limits. The States are
urged to give their early attention to these matters.
RAISING HEALTH STANDARDS

The Nation's material improvement has been accompanied by significant
gains in health and life expectancy. Progress in diminishing disease, disability, and premature death has enhanced our capacity for work, for enjoyment of the fruits of effort and enterprise, and for discharge of the military
obligations of citizenship. The struggle for better health and longer life is
a continual one, however, and huge returns are still to be expected from
relatively small outlays for additional research on crippling and killing
diseases.
The contributions of the Federal Government toward the health of
our people range over a wide area. The Public Health Service, through
the National Institutes of Health, is supporting a greater volume of medical
research than ever before. A law enacted in 1954 broadened a FederalState construction program, to give greater emphasis to hospitals for the
chronically ill, to nursing homes, and to diagnostic, treatment, and rehabilitation centers. In the same year, the Congress authorized expanded
Federal support of a joint program with the States for restoration of the
handicapped to more productive lives. In 1956, a three-year program of
grants-in-aid was established for the construction of public and nonprofit
health research facilities. The Water Pollution Act of 1956 provided for
intensified pollution research, matching grants for construction of watertreatment works, and cooperation to resolve serious interstate pollution
problems. In the same year, a program was enacted to help overcome the
shortage of graduate and practical nurses and other needed health personnel. Another law provided for surveys to determine the extent and
nature of illness and disability, to improve the information base for guidance
of health research.




66

For the further advance of our health standards, the Congress is again
requested to consider proposals for encouraging voluntary health insurance
plans. One such proposal seeks to facilitate the improvement of voluntary
plans by smaller health insurance companies and by nonprofit insurance
associations through pooling arrangements. The Congress is also requested
to authorize a temporary program of construction grants for expansion and
improvement of training facilities at medical and dental schools. Such a
program is needed to balance the legislative provision made last year for
Federal financial assistance in the construction of health research facilities.
STRENGTHENING PERSONAL SECURITY

The maintenance of high levels of employment and income in recent years
has been a powerful aid to Americans in making better provision for their
own and their families' security. Because good times and a stable dollar
are our best formula for accomplishing this result, Government makes its
greatest contribution to the strengthening of personal security when it pursues policies that promote stable economic growth and price stability. But
Government also contributes to the vigor and stability of the economy by
measures designed to assure retirement and survivorship incomes and to
alleviate certain severe forms of personal misfortune. The principal lines
along which this can be done have been set forth in the Economic Reports
of the last three years.
One set of proposals, aimed at reinforcing the Federal-State system of
unemployment insurance, has resulted in important actions. During 1954
Congress extended the coverage of unemployment insurance to 1.4 million
employees of firms with 4 to 7 persons on their payrolls and to 2.5 million
Federal civilian employees. In the last three years, 38 States have raised
weekly benefits, 12 have lengthened the potential duration of benefit payments, and 4 have extended coverage to firms with less than 4 employees.
Additional improvements are needed. First, benefits are still inadequate
in relation to wages. It is again suggested that the States raise the dollar
maximums so that the great majority of covered workers will be eligible
for payments equal to at least half their regular earnings. Second, the duration of benefits is still inadequate in many States. It is again suggested
that the States and Territories which have not yet done so lengthen the
maximum term of benefits to 26 weeks for every person who qualifies
for any benefit and remains unemployed that long. Third, important
classes of workers are still not covered. It is recommended that the Congress extend unemployment insurance to the 1.8 million employees of firms
with 1 to 3 persons on their payrolls who are still uncovered in many States,
to ex-servicemen, and to employees in Puerto Rico. Also, the States are
urged to include the 4.5 million persons who work for them or for their
political subdivisions.
Important changes have been made in laws affecting the economic status
of older persons. The Federal-State Employment Services are giving spe-




cial assistance toward finding employment for older persons, and the Department of Labor is studying the problem of enlarging their employment
opportunities. The Social Security Amendments of 1954 expanded the
number of jobs covered, raised benefits, and encouraged retired individuals
to engage in some remunerative work. By the end of 1956, 9 out of every
10 workers were covered or eligible for coverage under old-age and
survivors insurance; and roughly 45 percent of persons aged 65 or
more were receiving benefits, aggregating about $4.8 billion annually.
Benefits of about $800 million were paid in 1956 to 1.6 million children and
their widowed mothers, and to about 300,000 women aged 62-64 who became eligible for retirement benefits under legislation that became effective
in November of that year. The 1956 Amendments extended coverage to
an additional 900,000 workers and to 3 million servicemen, liberalized
provisions governing the eligibility of women for old-age benefits, and provided benefits for workers aged 50 and over who are totally and permanently disabled. In addition, by liberalizing the Federal grants that match
State payments, the 1956 Amendments encouraged more generous public
assistance and medical care for persons not adequately protected by social
insurance. The Railroad Retirement Act was amended in 1956 to increase by almost 10 percent the payments to more than 400,000 beneficiaries
of the railroad retirement program; and Civil Service retirement provisions were liberalized in important respects.
Private pension plans now cover about 13 million workers and provide
benefits to about 920,000 retired workers. Steps should be taken to deal
with two problems that arise in connection with these plans, as well as
private welfare funds. It would be desirable for business firms to make it
easier for a worker to terminate employment without losing part or all of
his accumulated rights in a pension plan. To help protect the beneficiaries
of private pension and welfare funds from loss through mismanagement, it
is again recommended that Congress require Federal registration of private
plans and the filing of reports on their administration and finances.
In addition to actions designed to help the unemployed and the aged,
measures have been taken to improve the income status of individuals.
Effective March 1, 1956, an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act
raised the minimum wage to $1.00 an hour, directly increasing the wages of
2 million covered workers. A number of administrative wage orders of the
Department of Labor, specifying various minimum wage rates, were issued
or became effective in 1956: for numerous Puerto Rican industries under
the Fair Labor Standards Act; for substantial numbers of workers and industries under the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act; and for large numbers
of Federal and federally-assisted construction contracts under the DavisBacon Act and related statutes. It is again recommended that the Congress and the States extend the coverage of minimum wage legislation to
additional workers needing this protection.




68

Although progress is being made toward equalizing economic opportunity
for all citizens, additional legislative steps are desirable. One such step
would be the enactment by the Congress of the principle of equal pay for
equal work without discrimination on account of sex.
Further improvements are needed in workmen's compensation insurance
against disabilities suffered on the job; this insurance is mainly the responsibility of the States. The relevant laws have been liberalized in recent
years, but those of many States still leave much to be desired in benefits,
administration, and provision for rehabilitation. Although great strides
have been made in safeguarding workers, occupational accidents still cause
almost two million injuries and deaths a year. A proposal will be presented
to the Congress for a new program to provide technical aid and limited
financial assistance to States for promoting occupational safety.
Another problem requiring attention is the loss of income caused by
temporary disabilities not related to the work of employees. For some years,
four States have had insurance programs covering such contingencies, and
many employers provide similar protection. A recommendation will again
be presented to the Congress to provide temporary disability insurance
benefits for employees in the District of Columbia. It is hoped that the
States that have not as yet done so will take the necessary legislative steps
to protect their workers against temporary off-the-job disabilities.
SOME CHALLENGES OF THE FUTURE

The proposals made in this chapter have been designed mainly with the
needs of the near-term future in mind, but Government has an obligation
also to look into the more distant future, although this can be done only
imperfectly. Even long-established trends are subject to change, and there
is much that cannot be foreseen at all; but certain factors that will influence
our economy in the years ahead can be discerned with some confidence.
Two of the most important of these factors are the growth and the changing
age composition of our population.
Before and shortly after World War II, the consensus of experts was that
the population of the United States would grow more and more slowly,
reach a peak within a few decades, and then begin to decline. Actually, the
population has grown in the last ten years at more than double the rate that
prevailed in the 1930's. There have also been notable and diverse changes
in the rates of population growth in different sections of the Nation. These
changes and the increase in total population have already exerted profound
influence on our economy. New challenges will arise in the future when
the sharp increase in the number of births since 1940, and especially since
1946, is reflected in the size of significant age groups. The number of young
people reaching their eighteenth birthday in the mid-1970's will be nearly
double what it was in 1956. The population of college age can be expected
to increase by something over 60 percent by 1970; but in that year enroll-




ments in the regular sessions of institutions of higher education are now
expected to be more than double the present figure. The number of first
marriages, which will be reflected in the rate of household formation, is
likely to be substantially larger in the mid-1960's than at present and very
much larger in the late 1960's and the 1970's. The actual size of the labor
force is unpredicably affected by the decisions of individuals in choosing, or
not choosing, to seek employment. Although the rates of labor force participation cannot be safely forecast, the number of persons available for work is
certain to grow substantially.
These few examples of results that can be expected from the growth and
changing age composition of our population suggest some of the challenges
in the years ahead for public and private policy. Pertinent population data
are presented and briefly discussed in Appendix G to this Report.
The extent to which the national output will be increased by the prospective enlargement of our population will depend in considerable part
on our ability to maintain a high level of employment and continue our gains
in productivity. Output per man-hour has increased over a long period at
an average rate of about 2 percent annually; since World War II it has
risen at an average of well over 3 percent a year. Productivity should
continue to increase at customary or recent rates, but such a pace cannot be
regarded as automatic and assured, without reference to any other factors.
Enormous increases in the supplies of skilled manpower, mechanical energy,
raw materials, and capital equipment will be needed if technological opportunities are to be realized, and if the demands of a vigorously growing population are to be satisfied at improved levels of living. These increases imply
very large requirements for savings and investment.
The opportunities and potentials of our free economy in the next quartercentury are very great, even when conservatively appraised. So also are
the responsibilities that must be borne by Government and by the citizen.
The primary objective of Government must be to encourage balanced and
sustainable economic growth in an environment favorable to the spirit of
enterprise. This effort must be supported by private policies that will help
assure the vigor of competitive enterprise and the achievement of steady
economic growth without price inflation. Our success in meeting these
responsibilities will go far to insure major further advances in the well-being
of our people, and it can have profoundly beneficial significance for the
peace and progress of the world.

The

1956.

PRESIDENT.

SIR: The Council of Economic Advisers submits this Annual Report for
calendar year 1956 in accordance with the requirements of Congress, as
set forth in Section 4 (d) of the Employment Act of 1946.
Respectfully,
RAYMOND J. SAULNIER, Chairman.

Report to the President on the Activities of the Council
of Economic Advisers During 1956
The year 1956 marked the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the
Council of Economic Advisers by the Employment Act of 1946. The
Council was created to help carry out the purposes of the Employment Act,
which include promotion by the Federal Government of maximum employment, production, and purchasing power by all means consistent with its
other obligations and in a manner calculated to foster free competitive
enterprise and the general welfare. This was also the third full year since
reconstitution of the Council under the President's Reorganization Plan
No. 9 of 1953. That Plan clarified the relationship between the Council
and the President by transferring to the Chairman of the Council the
function of reporting the Council's views and activities to the President.
It also strengthened the internal administration of the Council by transferring to its Chairman the responsibility for employing staff, specialists,
and consultants.
Advisory Board on Economic Growth and Stability
At the time the President transmitted the Reorganization Plan to the
Congress, he established an Advisory Board on Economic Growth and Stability, under the chairmanship of the Council Chairman. The members of
the Board are high-ranking officials of various departments and agencies
responsible for programs which have an important bearing on economic
developments. The present members of the Board are as follows:
Department of Stateâ€”Successor to Herbert V. Prochnow, Deputy
Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, not yet appointed
Department of the Treasuryâ€”W. Randolph Burgess, Under Secretary
Department of Agricultureâ€”True D. Morse, Under Secretary
Department of Commerceâ€”Walter Williams, Under Secretary
Department of Laborâ€”Successor to Arthur Larson, Under Secretary,
not yet appointed
Department of Health, Education, and Welfareâ€”Marion B. Folsom,
Secretary
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Systemâ€”Abbot L. Mills,
Member of the Board
Bureau of the Budgetâ€”Percival F. Brundage, Director




8x

The White House Officeâ€”Gabriel Hauge, Special Assistant to the
President
Council of Economic Advisersâ€”Raymond J. Saulnier, Chairman
The Advisory Board meets a distinct need of Government by providing
a forum for discussion and informal coordination of the economic policies
of various departments and agencies. The Board has met regularly at
frequent intervals since its establishment and has been of practical value to
the Council in evaluating economic developments and formulating policies
to promote stable economic growth.
Council Membership
Arthur F. Burns, who joined the Council on March 18, 1953 and served
as its Chairman, resigned on December 1, 1956. The President appointed
Raymond J. Saulnier, a member of the Council since March 23, 1955, to
succeed Mr. Burns.
The vacancy left by Mr. Burns' resignation and Mr. Saulnier's appointment as Chairman was filled by the nomination by the President of Paul W.
McCracken. Mr. McCracken is on leave from his position as Professor of
Business Conditions, School of Business Administration, University of
Michigan. Prior to his nomination, Mr. McCracken served as a member
of the senior staff of the Council. Joseph S. Davis, Emeritus Director of
the Food Research Institute, Stanford University, became a member of the
Council on May 2, 1955.
Council Activities
In carrying out its responsibility of advising the President on economic
policies and programs designed to achieve the objectives of the Employment Act, the Council gave special attention during 1956 to recent advances
in costs and prices and to problems of those parts of the economy which have
not shared fully in the general prosperity.
Consideration was given to measures for maintaining a satisfactory rate of
home building, promoting agricultural adjustments, and improving farmers'
income.
Extensive analyses were made of problems faced by communities experiencing persistent and relatively high unemployment. On the basis of
these analyses, measures were recommended for helping to reduce local
unemployment through joint programs of local, State, and Federal governments and civic groups.
Until his resignation Mr. Burns served as Chairman of the Cabinet
Committee on Small Business established by the President on May 31, 1956.
Later these duties were assumed by Mr. Saulnier. The Committee has
continuing responsibilities for making recommendations for legislative and
administrative actions to strengthen the economic position and to foster the




82

sound development of small businesses. The members of the Committee are
as follows:
Charles E. Wilson, Secretary of Defense
Sinclair Weeks, Secretary of Commerce
James P. Mitchell, Secretary of Labor
Arthur S. Flemming, Director, Office of Defense Mobilization
Albert M. Cole, Administrator, Housing and Home Finance Agency
Wendell B. Barnes, Administrator, Small Business Administration
Raymond J. Saulnier, Chairman, Council of Economic Advisers
In its first Progress Report, published on August 7, 1956, the Committee
recommended a number of specific policies that would aid small businesses.
Mr. Saulnier represented the Council on the Defense Mobilization Board
until December, when he was succeeded by Mr. McCracken. Mr. Burns
represented the Council of Economic Advisers on the Council on Foreign
Economic Policy; Mr. Davis usually served as his alternate.
Two Council members participated during the year in the Paris meetings
of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation. Mr. Burns
attended the April meeting, at which experts exchanged views on economic
conditions and prospects. Mr. Saulnier attended the September meeting
to participate in OEEC's comprehensive annual review of economic
developments.
As in previous years, the Council has handled a large volume of correspondence on economic questions. Some of the communications were
received directly. A considerable number were referred to the Council by
other agencies and by the White House.
Several interagency task forces were established by the Council during the
year. One examined ways and means by which the contribution of the
Federal-aid highway program to economic stability might be maximized.
Another examined debt developments bearing on economic growth and
stability. A third examined the problems of consumers and explored possible ways of improving Government protection of consumer interests.
Members of the Council's staff participated in training conferences and
seminars held by other Government agencies for new employees and visiting
foreign experts. Staff members also served on a number of interagency
committees organized by other agencies.
The Council assisted in the preparation of the Economic Report of the
President3 transmitted to the Congress on January 24, 1956. The Report
reviewed developments and policies during 1954-55 and made recommendations to the Congress and suggestions to State, local, and private groups for
actions designed to promote stable economic growth. In 1956, all of the
30,000 copies that were printed were distributed. Over half of the total
were sold to the public by the Superintendent of Documents.
Economic Indicators, a monthly compendium of current economic statistics prepared by the Council and published by the Joint Economic Com-




mittee, is being used more extensively each year. In addition to the copies
distributed to members of the Congress and to libraries, copies go to over
6,000 paying subscribers.
Staff and Organization
The total number of staff members of the Council is 31, of whom 16,
including part-time consultants, constitute the senior staff. All of the
senior staff members are economists with established reputations for judgment and skill in objective analysis. Staff assignments are made by subject
matter, so that developments in major fields embraced by the Council's
responsibilitiesâ€”national income, public finance, money and credit, business organization, manpower, agriculture, international trade and finance,
technology, social security, prices, productivity, etc.â€”are continually under
expert scrutiny. Each staff member cooperates closely with other agencies
of the Government. Contacts are maintained with business, labor, and
other pertinent private economic groups, as an aid in analyzing and evaluating economic developments.
The Council has continued the practice of rotating a part of its senior
staff, to take advantage of the services of university faculty members who are
not available on a permanent basis. Five members of the present senior
staff, on leave of absence from universities, are replacements for staff
members whose leaves from university posts expired earlier this year. In
addition, three members of university faculties serve the Council as Consultants while continuing in their university positions. The members of the
senior staff now include Leo Grebler, Frances M. James, Alfred E* Kahn,
Marshall A. Kaplan, Clarence D. Long, David W. Lusher, Daniel Marx, Jr.,
Raymond F. Mikesell, Frank E. Norton, Kenneth D. Roose, Charles L.
Schultze, Irving H. Siegel, Walter W. Stewart, Collis Stocking, Boris C.
Swerling, and Philip E. Taylor.
Budget for Fiscal Years 1956 and 1957
For the fiscal year 1956, the Council received an appropriation from
the Congress for $329,000. It finished the year with a small unobligated
balance.
For the fiscal year 1957, the Congress appropriated $365,700 for the
Council's activities. The increased appropriation was needed primarily to
enable the Council to meet the salary increases required by the Federal
Employees Salary Increase Act of 1955.

Population Changes and Prospects
Notable changes under way in the size and composition of our population have important implications for the future which are not yet widely
appreciated. A fuller understanding of their nature and meaning is essential for timely public and private action to promote and accommodate
economic growth.
CHANGE IN POPULATION OUTLOOK

By 1940 specialists had come to substantial agreement that our long
period of vigorous population growth was over, that the United States was
well advanced in a transition to a stationary or declining population, and
that the number of children of school age would not increase. With minor
modifications, this view was still widely held after World War II, when the
wartime increases in marriages and births from the lows of the prewar
decade were at first interpreted as temporary deviations from well-established trends. The forecast of September 1946 which then appeared reasonable pointed to a population of 153 million in 1960 (Chart C-l) and to
an ultimate peak of 164.5 million about 1990.

This prospect was gradually altered as postwar marriages, births, and
migration kept diverging widely from their prewar trends. "Illustrative
projections" released by the Census Bureau in August 1950 recognized that
a population upsurge of substantial magnitude and indefinite duration was
in progress. Subsequent revisions have strongly confirmed this generalization, and the actual population growth in 1950-56 has conformed most
closely to the highest projections. By mid-1955 the population of the Continental United States, including armed forces overseas, had passed 165
million, and the 1960 total now bids fair to approach 180 million.
After the end of the war there was a great increase in marriages, and
the wartime increase in births was followed by a much larger one. The
total of 38.8 million live births during 1947-56 (Table C - l ) was 10.5

million above the prewar 10-year high of 1915-24; and the rise of births
in the 1950's is in striking contrast to the decline in the decade following
1924 (Chart C-2). The annual number of deaths has continued to rise
very slowly, as widespread improvement in health has steadily raised average life expectancy at birth to the present 70 years (Table C-2). The
excess of births over deaths, which had fallen below 1 million in the mid1930's, has been above 2 million every year since 1946 and averaged
2.5 million a year in 1951-56, when successive high figures for births were
recorded annually. Net civilian immigrationâ€”including those technically
termed immigrants, other aliens, and American citizens from Puerto Rico
and elsewhereâ€”added an average of nearly 200,000 a year in the 1940's and
about 300,000 a year in 1947-56.
* As a result of these developments, the population increased in the past
decade at an average rate of 1.7 percent per year. Although this rate is

far below the average of about 3 percent maintained in 1790-1860, it is
extremely high in comparison with expectations and more than double the
rate in the prewar decade.
The radical changes sketched above have led to great efforts to enlarge
and improve the basis for assessing present and future needs for jobs, schools,
hospitals, homes, highways, and other public and private facilities. Examination of the abundant information now available reveals marked alteraTABLE C-2.â€”Average future lifetime expected at birth, selected years, 1900-54

firmly established. Some of the outstanding changes are summarized in
the following sections.
CHANGES IN RELATED

TRENDS

1. Married persons now comprise a much larger proportion of our population than before World War II (Table C-3). The 1940's saw not only
a pronounced rise in the percentages of married persons in the various age
groups, but also declines in median ages at first marriage. Smaller changes,
mostly in the same direction, have taken place in the 1950's.

Figures

2. The marked downtrend during the 1940's in the percentage of married
women with no children, and the rise in the number of children ever born
per 1,000 women in the 15-49 age group, have continued in the 1950's.
Declining proportions of couples have only one child and increasing proportions have two and three children, and there has been a marked increase
in the annual rate of third, fourth, and fifth births.
3. A rise in the number of children under 5 years of age in relation
to the number of women of childbearing age has been in progress for
nearly two decades, in contrast to the decline that had been evident since
early in the nineteenth century. Live births per 1,000 white women aged
15-44 have risen from an unprecedentedly low number in the mid-1930's to
the level of the early 1920's; the increase has been even greater for nonwhite
women. Because of the large increase in births and significant reductions
in infant and child mortality, the rising postwar generation is much larger
than that of the 1930's. Similar increases in higher age groups are in
prospect as today's children grow older.
4. The number of persons aged 18-64, from whom the labor force is
largely drawn, has risen steadily in recent decades (Chart C-3). By contrast, there has been a striking change in the trend of additions to the group
under age 18. Until the early 1940's, the total number of persons in the two

age groups, under 18 and 65 and over, had changed little for well over a
decade; as a percentage of the total population, this total was at an historic
low in 1942. Since then, however, the total has increased substantially, and
the percentage has recently risen above the level of 1910.
5. Between 1900 and 1950, when the population doubled, the number
of persons aged 65 and over quadrupled, and the percentage of the population in this age group rose from 4.1 to 8.1. The total number in the group
continues to mount, but the rate of increase is now declining, partly because
of reduced immigration since 1913 and partly because of declining rates of
increase in births in the nineteenth century.
6. Despite continued growth in the number of persons aged 65 and over,
the median age of the populationâ€”which had been rising ever since 1810
and had been expected to continue rising for decades to comeâ€”has
begun to decline from the high plateau of 30.2 years reached in 1950-53
(Table G-4). In this sense we are no longer an "aging" population.
7. Whereas before 1950 males had outnumbered females in the total
population, females have now become a majority, both in the total and in
all age groups above 20-24 years. This reversal is attributable chiefly to
the fact that the life expectancy of women has continued to improve more
than that of men. Reduction in immigration since 1924 has been an additional factor, since among immigrants the number of males has tended to

exceed the number of females. While the number of widows has increased,
the percentages of widows in the various age groups, and in the total female
population aged 14 and over, have been declining since 1890 (Table C-3).
8. The percentage of nonwhite persons in the total population has been
rising, after having declined for many decades. It fell from 12.5 percent
in 1890 to a low of 10.2 percent in 1930 and 1940, and then rose to 10.9
percent in mid-1956. Between April 1, 1940 and July 1, 1956, the white
population increased by 26 percent, the nonwhite by 35 percent. This
more rapid growth of the nonwhite population was due chiefly to much
higher birth rates, only partially offset by higher death rates. More than 40
percent of the nonwhite population today are under 18 years of age.
9. Notable shifts in the geographical distribution of our people occurred
in the period 1940-56. Florida and most of the Western and Southwestern
States experienced rapid growth; most of the Northeastern and Southeastern States grew by less than the national average of 27 percent; and
three States (Arkansas, Mississippi, and Oklahoma) lost population.
Suburban and outlying rural sections of the standard metropolitan areas
grew rapidly, while central cities gained very little and the rural-farm population declined greatly.
EDUCATIONAL TRENDS AND THE LABOR FORCE

The population changes discussed in the preceding sections have contributed to significant changes in still other trends and relationships, a few
of which should be mentioned here.
1. The decline in births after 1924 led to a fall in school enrollments in
kindergarten through grade 8 in 1930-44 (Chart C-4 and Table C-5).
Enrollments began to increase, however, late in World War II, in response

to the rise in births and to continued reductions in infant and child mortality. The increase became strong in the 1950's as the large numbers born
after the war reached school age. Fall enrollment through grade 8 in
October 1956 was 30.5 percent greater than in October 1950 (Table C-6).

2. The great expansion of high-school enrollments in the 1920's and
1930's was reversed during World War II, chiefly because many children of
high-school age were drawn into remunerative jobs. Since the war, these
enrollments have increased as the numbers of those aged 14-17 have risen
and there has been a resumption of the prewar trend for rising proportions
of this age group to remain in school. Fall enrollment in these grades
increased by 28.4 percent between October 1950 and October 1956, and the
percentage of those in the 14-17 age group who were enrolled in school rose
from 83.3 to 88.2.
3. For a century or more, and especially after 1900, the average length of
terms in public schools was increased; the percentage of those in age groups
5-17 who were enrolled in public schools rose; and the average daily attendance improved (Table C-7). The war interrupted these trends; and the
recovery in the postwar years has been slow and incomplete, partly because

of the lag in expanding public-school facilities and qualified staffs and of
increasing enrollments in nonpublic schools.
4. Before World War II the growth of enrollments in schools of higher
education was much slower than in secondary schools, and war service
interrupted college and graduate work for many students. A marked bulge
occurred after the war under the stimulus of veterans' educational benefits;
and in the present decade, participation in higher education has been growing rapidly. Some 7 million persons in today's adult population have spent
four years in college; this is twice the number in 1940. Between October
1950 and October 1956, fall enrollments in colleges and professional schools
increased by more than 30 percent. A similar increase was shown for all
levels of schooling for those in the 18-34 age group, although the total number of persons in this group changed little.
5. The labor force increased by 9.4 million between 1946 and 1956 in
spite of the fact that the number of boys and girls aged 18â€”a common age
of entrance into full-time jobsâ€”was lower in the postwar decade than in
the 1930's and early 1940's and slightly lower in mid-1956 than in mid-1946.
There has been an extraordinary increase in the number of womenâ€”
especially the number of married womenâ€”who have taken jobs; and the
increase since the war has been especially pronounced for older women.
Accordingly, the median age of women in the labor force rose from 33.3
years in 1945 to 39.0 years in 1955, while the median age of male workers
rose by less than two years, from 37.2 to 39.1 (Table C-4). Within a few
years, as young entrants into the labor force increase, the median age of the
labor force is expected to begin an extended fall, for the first time in our
history.
POPULATION PROJECTIONS

The postwar upset of apparently well-grounded expectations and the
radical changes in long-established trends warn of the serious risks in forecasting total population and many related magnitudes for even 10-20 years
ahead. Certain basic projections, however, can be made and used with a
high degree of confidence on the assumption that we experience no extreme
disaster.
Although future births defy prediction, the course of actual births in
past years has forecasting value for successive waves of various significant
age groups. Birth registration had been made compulsory in all States by
1930, underregistration has been gradually reduced, and reasonable allowances can be made for unregistered births. Also, infant, child, and youth
mortality has been reduced to low levels. For all the younger age groups,
uncertainties about the future course of deaths and net civilian immigration
have relatively small influence.
Projections of the numbers who will reach significant "threshold" ages
can therefore be made with only a small margin of error for as many years
in the future as involve no forecast of births (Table C-8). Similarly, the

size of many significant age groups can be projected with considerable assurance for several years into the future, as long as only future survivors of
those already born are included. Barring catastrophe, it can thus be confidently stated that by 1961 the number of children aged 5 will be about
twice the number in the two or three very low years before World War II,
and that by 1968 the number aged 12 will be roughly double what it was
in the late 1940's.
The changing number of 18-year-olds has special significance because at
this age young people typically complete high school and enter college or
the labor force, except that some young men are drawn into military service.
A series, actual through 1956 and projected through 1974, is shown for this
age group on Chart G-2, along with the series of births 18 years earlier.
The narrowing gap between the two curves reflects the marked reduction
in mortality up to age 18 during the past 40 years. Largely because of this
reduction, the 1940-52 decline in the number of 18-year-olds was much
less than the fall in the number of births in 1922-34, and the prospective
increase in the number of 18-year-olds in 1958-74 exceeds the actual
increase in births between 1940 and 1956.
The college-age population (ages 18-24) declined from a 1943-44 peak
of about 16.9 million to about 15.1 million in mid-1955, the lowest point in
25 years. According to recent Census Bureau projections, small gains
during the next few years will be followed by larger gains in 1960-64 and by




still sharper increases from 1964 through 1973, when the number will be
roughly 75 percent larger than in 1955. Though by no means all of those
aged 18-24 will continue their schooling, the enrollment in institutions
of higher education in 1973 seems likely to be more than double the 1955
figure if faculties and facilities are enlarged to meet the demands.
Projections of the number of women aged 20 may give some clue to the
future course of first marriages, since 20.1 years has recently been the
median age at first marriage and a slight fall appears more likely than a rise.
After declining for several years, the number of women aged 20 has recently
begun to increase, broadly following the series for 18-year-olds, and by 1975
the number is expected to be nearly double the low figure of 1954.
The number of women aged 20-34 is of special importance for population
forecasts, since this is the group in which the number of births is greatest.
The number of women in this age group has been high in the postwar
decade, although it has declined since 1950. It is expected to rise moderately in the early 1960's, and sharply from 1967 to beyond 1975. The
projected number for 1975 is 38 percent above the high figure for 1950.
While this series gives no solid basis for forecasting births, as experience
in the postwar decade has shown, it can be said that the age distribution
of women after 1962 will be increasingly favorable to a new increase of
births.
Reliable projections of the younger age groups provide a basis for estimating future high-school and college enrollments, additions to the labor
force, and the number of families and households. But such derived estimates have a wide margin of error when made years in advance because
they are necessarily based upon rough assumptions as to the choices that
individuals and groups will make.
While the numbers that may be in the upper age groups 20 years in
the future are not influenced by future births, they are subject to changes
in health conditions, which are unpredictable. Moreover, inaccuracies in
age reporting affect the reliability of present figures for age groups 60 and
over. Undue reliance should therefore not be placed on the projections
that the number reaching age 65 will rise from 1.2 million in 1955 to 1.6
million in 1975, and that the numbers aged 65 and over will increase from
14.1 million in 1955 to 20.7 million in 1975. The implied increase in the
proportion of these older people in the total population, from 8.5 percent
to 9-10 percent, is even more provisional because the total population cannot be safely forecast.
The latest illustrative projections of the total population (published in
October 1955) point to a range of 206.9-228.5 million in 1975. These projections incorporate the very conservative assumption that there will be no
improvement in mortality experience after 1960. Only a guess can be made
about such improvement, however, chiefly because future progress in medical research cannot be predicted. Furthermore, special conditions and
legislative changes may affect the volume of net civilian immigration.




97

Finally, the actual course of births may differ widely from any assumed
course, as has been true during and since the war. For such reasons, projections of the total population, though embodying a combination of expert
knowledge and careful judgment, require frequent revision as additional
evidence becomes available. They can serve many useful purposes, however3 if their limitations are clearly recognized.

Statistical Tables Relating to the Diffusion of Well-Being,
1946-56
The following tables present certain indicators of the improvement
of well-being that has been attained in the United States in the last decade.
Necessarily, they are limited to those aspects and conditions of personal
welfare that can be expressed in quantitative terms. Although they fail
to reveal, excep indirectly, the qualitative aspects of welfare, they may be
useful indicators of some of the material conditions on which improvements
in the quality of living are based. Tables are included on production and
employment; personal income and its distribution; consumption; material
comforts and conveniences; conditions of work; education; leisure and
recreational activities; personal financial security; and health.

Figures beginning with 1955 are not strictly comparable with the earlier data because of a change in the
method of estimation. The result of this change in procedure was to raise the 1955 figure by 6 or 7 percent
over the figure that would have been obtained by the old method.

i The Social Security Amendments of 1950 expanded by more than 10 million the number of jobs eligible
for coverage by old-age and survivors insurance in a given month. The Social Security Amendments of
1954 extended coverage to an additional 7H million jobs eligible for coverage on the average monthly basis;
while the 1956 Amendments of the Social Security Act further extended coverage to nearly 1 million jobs, so
that today, 90 percent of all civilian gainfully employed persons are covered or eligible for coverage.
The expansion in the number of jobs eligible for coverage did not result in an equal number of additional
covered persons, for three reasons. First, many persons holding these newly covered jobs had been working
at some time during the year in other jobs already covered; for these, the coverage was strengthened rather
than extended. Second, a substantial number of persons affected by the amendments were eligible for coverage on a group elective basis, and not all of these groups had elected coverage by the end of 1956. Data
on covered workers in this table include only those workers in the voluntary coverage group who had elected
to be covered. As of December 1956, there were about 6H million persons in jobs subject to coverage on a
group elective basis. Approximately half the number of persons in this group, comprised primarily of
ministers (eligible on an individual elective basis) and employees of State and local governments, and
nonprofit organizations, had elected coverage. Third, even in those jobs for which coverage was compulsory, some persons had not reported their earnings for social security tax purposes.
a Beginning 1951, monthly averages are based on four calendar months: March, June, September, and
December.

1 These estimates represent an approximate conversion of the Department of Commerce series in 1947
prices. (See Table E-4.) This was done by major components, using the implicit price indexes converted
to a 1956 base. Although it would have been preferable to redeflate the series by minor components, this
would not substantially change the results except possibly for the period of World War II, and for the
series on change in business inventories.

Gross national product less compensation of general government employees, i. e., gross product accruing
from domestic business, households, and institutions, and from the rest of the world.
2
See Survey of Current Business, August 1954, pp. 20-24, for estimates in both current and 1947-49 prices
and for the implicit price deflators for 1929-51. Estimates for 1952-56 are based on unpublished data.
3
Includes compensation of general government employees and excludes compensation of employees in
government enterprises. Government enterprises are those agencies of government whose operating costs
are at least to a substantial extent covered by the sale of goods and services, in contrast to the general activities of government which are financed mainly by tax revenues and debt creation. Government enterprises, in other words, conduct operations essentially commercial in character, even though they perform
them under governmental auspices. The Post Office and public power systems are typical examples of
government enterprises. On the other hand, State universities and public parks, where the fees and admissions cover only a nominal part of operating costs, are part of general government activities.

1 National income is the total net income earned in production. It differs from gross national product
mainly in that it excludes depreciation charges and other allowances for business and institutional
consumption of durable capital goods, and indirect business taxes. See Table E-10.
2
Wages and salaries and supplements to wages and salaries (employer contributions for social insurance;
employer contributions to private pension, health, and welfare funds; compensation for injuries; directors'
fees; pay of the military reserve; and a few other minor items).
3 Excludes income resulting from net reductions of farm inventories and gives credit in computing income
to net additions to farm inventories during the period.
* See Table E-50 for corporate tax liability (Federal and State income and excess profits taxes) and
corporate profits after taxes.
6
Less than 50 million dollars.

1
Individuals' saving, in addition to personal holdings, covers saving of unincorporated business, trust
and pension funds, and nonprofit institutions in the forms specified. Prior to 1951, separate data on corporate pension fund investments are not available and are reflected in the various components of individuals' saving.
2
Includes currency, demand deposits, and time and savings deposits.
3 Does not include net purchases by brokers and dealers or by other individuals financed by bank loans.
* Includes armed forces leave bonds and other U. S. Government bonds (except savings bonds) and
all securities issued by State and local governments.
Â« Mortgage debt to institutions on 1- to 4-family nonfarm dwellings.
â€¢ Largely attributable to purchases of automobiles and other durable consumers' goods, although including some debt arising from purchases of other consumption goods. The other segmentsjof individuals'
debt have been allocated to the assets to which they pertain, viz, saving in insurance and securities.
7 Not available separately. See footnote 1.
8
Less than 5 million dollars.
NOTE.â€”In addition to the concept of saving shown above, there are other concepts of individuals'
saving, with varying degrees of coverage, currently in use. The series with the most complete coverage, the
personal saving estimates of the Department of Commerce, is derived as the difference between personal
income and expenditures. Conceptually, Commerce saving includes the following items not included
in Securities and Exchange Commission saving: Housing net of depreciation, and farm and unincorporated business investment in inventories and plant and equipment, net of depreciation and net of increases in mortgage and other debt to corporations and financial institutions. Government insurance is
excluded from the Commerce saving series. For a reconciliation of the two series, see Survey of Current
Business, July 1956.
Revisions for 1948-56 in the consumer credit statistics of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System have not yet been incorporated into these estimates.
Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding.

1 Data for 1940-52 revised to include about 150,000 members of the armed forces who were outside the
continental United States in 1940 and who were, therefore, not enumerated in the 1940 Census and were
excluded from the 1940-52 estimates.
2 Includes part-time workers and those with jobs but not at work for such reasons as vacation, illness,
bad weather, temporary layoff, and industrial disputes.
3
Not available.
NOTE.â€”Civilian labor force data beginning with May 1956 are based on a 330-area sample. For January
1954-April 1956 they are based on a 230-area sample; for 1946-53 on a 68-area sample; for 1940-45 on a smaller
sample; and for 1929-39 on sources other than direct enumeration.
Beginning July 1955, labor force data are for the calendar week containing the 12th of the month; previously, for week containing the 8th.
Annual population data are as of July 1; monthly data are as of the 1st of the month.
For the years 1940-52, estimating procedures made use of 1940 Census data; for subsequent years, 1950
Census data were used. For the effects of this change on the historical comparability of the data, see
Annual Report on the Labor Force, 1954, Series P-50, N o . 59, April 1955, p . 12.
Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding.

Includes all full- and part-time wage and salary workers in nonagricultural establishments who worked
during, or received pay for, any part of the pay period ending nearest the 15th of the month. Excludes
proprietors, self-employed persons, domestic servants, and unpaid family workers. Not comparable with
estimates of nonagricultural employment of the civilian labor force (Table E-17) which include proprietors,
self-employed persons, domestic servants, and unpaid family workers, which count persons as employed
when they are not at work because of industrial disputes, bad weather, or temporary layoffs, and which
are based on a sample survey of households, whereas the estimates in this table are based on reports from
employing establishments.
2 Beginning with 1939, data are not strictly comparable with data shown for earlier years because of the
shift of the automotive repair service industry from the trade to the service division.
3 Not available.
* Preliminary.

Averages are based upon monthly data (exclusive of switching and terminal companies) summarized in
the M-300 report by the ICC and relate to all employees who received pay during the month, except executives, officials, and staff assistants (ICC group I). Beginning September 1949, data reflect a wage rate
increase and reduction in basic workweek from 48 to 40 hours.
2
Prior to April 1945, data relate to all employees except executives; from April 1945-May 1949, mainly to
employees subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act; and beginning June 1949, to nonsupervisory employees
only.
3 Not available.
4
Data beginning with January of year noted are not comparable with those for earlier periods.
5
Nine-month average, April through December, because of new series started in April 1945.
6
Preliminary.
NOTE.â€”Data are for production workers in manufacturing and mining, construction workers in building
construction, and for all nonsupervisory employees in other industries (except as noted). Data are for payroll periods ending closest to the middle of the month.
The annualfiguresfor 1956 are simple arithmetic averages of the monthlyfiguresshown and not strictly
comparable with the averages for earlier years, which have been weighted by data on man-hours.

1 Excludes agriculture.
Commercial and other includes trade, service,finance,communications, and construction.
3 Annual total is sum of seasonally unadjusted quarterly expenditures; it does not necessarily coincide
with average of seasonally adjusted figures, which include adjustments, when necessary, for systematic
tendencies in anticipatory data.
* Estimates for fourth quarter 1956 and first quarter 1957 based on anticipated capital expenditures reported by business in late October and November 1956.
NOTE.â€”Thesefiguresdo not agree precisely with the plant and equipment expenditures included in the
gross national product estimates of the Department of Commerce. The main difference lies in the inclusion
in the gross national product of investment by farmers, professionals, and institutions, and of certain outlays charged to current account.
This series is not available for years prior to 1939 and for 1940 to 1944.
Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding.

* Beginning in 1951, the estimates of retail sales and inventories are based on a new method of estimation adopted by the Bureau of the Census. For a description of the retail sales and inventories series, see
Survey of Current Business, September and November 1952 and January 1954.
2
Monthly average shown for year and total for month.
3 Seasonally adjusted, end of period.
4
Inventory/sales ratio. For annual periods weighted average inventories to average monthly sales;
for monthly data, ratio of average end of current and previous month's inventories to sales for month.
Â» Where December data not available, data for year calculated on basis of no change from November.
6
Preliminary.
NOTE.â€”The inventory figures in this table do not agree with the estimates of change hi business inventories included in the gross national product since thesefigurescover only manufacturing and trade rather
than all business, and show inventories in terms of current book value without adjustment for revaluation.

1 This does not replace the former index (1926=100) as the official index prior to January 1952. These
data from January 1947 through December 1951 represent the revised sample and the 1947-49 weighting
pattern. Prior to January 1947 they are based on the month-to-month movement of the former index.
The only official index up to and including December 1951 is the former monthly index (1926=100).
2 The data from January 1947 through January 1953 differ from the official series due to a change in the
method of eliminating excise taxes and discounts.

1 June, December, and end-of-year figures are for call dates. Other data are for the last Wednesday of
the month.
2 Data are shown net, i. e., after deduction of valuation reserves. Includes commercial and industrial,
agricultural, security, real estate, bank, consumer, and other loans.
3 Beginning with 1948, data are shown gross of valuation reserves, instead of net as for previous years.
Prior to June 1947 and for months other than June and December, data are estimated on the basis of reported
data for all insured commercial banks and for weekly reporting member banks.
* Figures in this table are based on book values and relate only to banks within the continental United
States. Therefore, they do not agree with figures in Table E-46, which are on the basis of par values and
include holdings of banks in United States Territories and possessions.
6 June data are used because complete end-of-year data are not available prior to 1935 for U. S. Government obligations and other securities.
6 Not available.
7 Preliminary; December estimates by Council of Economic Advisers.
s For October 1955, certain loan items are available on two bases because of a reclassification resulting
from reporting errors. The business loans figure shown above is after reclassification. The figure before
reclassification is 30.8 billion.

1 Net public and private debt outstanding is a comprehensive aggregate of the indebtedness of borrowers
after elimination of certain types of duplicating governmental and corporate debt. For a further explanation of the concept, see Survey of Current Business, October 1950.
2
Data for State and local government are for June 30 of each year.
3 Farm mortgages and farm production loans. Farmers' financial and consumer debt is included in the
nonfarm categories.
4 Financial debt is debt owed to banks for purchasing or carrying securities, customers' debt to brokers,
and debt owed to life insurance companies by policyholders.
5
Preliminary estimates by Council of Economic Advisers.
NOTE.â€”Data for 1948-55 for consumer debt (and related subtotals and totals) have been adjusted by
the Council of Economic Advisers to reflect revisions for 1948-56 in the consumer credit statistics of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. No attempt has been made to reconcile other debt
items with the adjustments in consumer debt.
Detail will not necessarily add to totals because of rounding.

Commerce Commission (except as noted).

These accounts, like the cash budget, include the transactions of the trust accounts. Unlike both the
conventional budget and the cash statement, they exclude certain capital and lending transactions. In
general, they do not use the cash basis for transactions with business. Instead, corporate profits taxes are
included in receipts on an accrual instead of a cash basis; expenditures are timed with the delivery instead
of the payment for goods and services; and CCC guaranteed price-support crop loans financed by banks are
counted as expenditures when the loans are made, not when COC redeems them.
2 Seasonally adjusted annual rates.

Preliminary; fourth quarter estimates by Council of Economic Advisers.
NOTE.â€”Federal grants-in-aid to State and local governments are reflected in Federal expenditures and
State and local receipts and expenditures. Total government receipts and expenditures have been adjusted

these samples and, therefore, are not strictly comparable with data for later periods. For comparative
purposes, the second quarter of 1956 is shown on the basis of the two later samples. For explanatory notes

1 Commodity data for 1936-38 and 1952-55 have been adjusted to conform as nearly as possible to 1956
statistical classifications. The distributions of nonagricultural exports by principal commodities, however,
are based on total exports for 1936-38 and on exports excluding "special category" items in 1952 and later
periods. (See note 3.)
2 Data represent total exports minus shipments of military equipment and supplies by the Department
of Defense under the Mutual Security Program. Commodity breakdowns of nonmilitary exports are not
available.
* "Special category" commodities are those to which security restrictions apply as regards publication of
detailed export statistics.
4
Data exclude essential oils.
Â« Data for 1952 and later periods exclude "special category" exports.

continental OEEC countries and dependencies. Figures represent (1) reported and estimated gold reserves
of central banks and governments, and (2) official and private short-term dollar holdings reported by banks
in the United States, including foreign-held deposits, U. S. Government securities and certain other
short-term liabilities to foreigners, and (3) estimated holdings of U. S. Government bonds and notes with
original maturities of more than one year. Figures for 1937 are not strictly comparable with those for
subsequent years owing to exclusion of long-term U. S. Government bonds and notes.
