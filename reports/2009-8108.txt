ECONOMIC REPORT
OF THE PRESIDENT

ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT

To the Congress of the United States:
The American economy has consistently proven its strength and resilience
in the face of shocks such as natural disasters, high energy prices, and the
terrorist attacks of September 11. The economy experienced 6 years of
uninterrupted expansion, which included a record stretch of 52 consecutive
months of job creation. The past year saw this growth cease as several forces
that developed over many years in the credit and housing markets converged.
The combination of these factors, coupled with a sustained period of rising
energy prices, was sufficient to threaten the entire financial system and
generated a shock so large that its effects have been felt throughout the
global economy.
Under ordinary circumstances, it would be preferable to allow the free
market to take its course and correct over time. But the Government has a
responsibility to safeguard the broader health and stability of our economy.
Under the extraordinary circumstances created by the financial crisis, the
potential damage to American households and businesses was so severe that
a systemic, aggressive, and unprecedented Government response was the
only responsible policy option.
The actions taken by my Administration in response to the financial crisis
have laid the groundwork for a return to economic growth and job creation,
and they are beginning to show some early results. A measure of stability
has returned to the financial system. There will, of course, continue to be
challenges. Temporary Government programs must remain temporary and
be unwound in an orderly manner as soon as conditions warrant. Financial
regulations must be modernized to reflect the realities of the 21st century,
and these efforts should ensure that the objective of protecting consumers
and investors does not come at the expense of the flexibility required
for innovations to come to the market. We must also continue to trust

Americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to
weather turbulent times in the market by helping creditworthy homeowners
avoid foreclosure.
As the country navigates through this trying period, we must never lose
sight of the enormous benefits delivered by the free enterprise system.
Americans have good reasons to be confident about the long-term health of
our economy. Despite the current difficulties, there are a number of positive
economic factors. Inflationary pressures have moderated as record high prices
for oil and gasoline have retreated. Productivity growth, which helps to
increase our standard of living and improve our international competitiveness,
remains solid. The American economy continues to be the largest and most
dynamic in the world, and its solid foundation of flexible labor markets, low
tax rates, and open trade and investment policies all contribute to its ability to
recover fairly quickly from shocks. Over the past 8 years, my Administration
has worked to strengthen this foundation by adopting pro-growth, marketoriented policies, and our policies will position the economy for a strong
rebound and continued long-run growth.
Sound economic policy begins with keeping taxes low. The tax relief enacted
by my Administration was the largest in a generation. Tax rates have been
lowered for every American who pays income taxes. More than 13 million
Americans had their Federal income tax liability completely eliminated, and
individuals and businesses have kept $1.7 trillion of their own hard-earned
money. Raising taxes at any time reduces our international competitiveness
and further distorts the decisions of individuals and businesses; doing so in
the current environment would have serious consequences for the economy.
This tax relief has been a key factor in promoting the economic growth and
job creation of recent years, and it should be made permanent. Unless the
Congress acts, most of the tax relief that we have delivered over the past
8 years will be taken away, and 116 million American taxpayers will see their
taxes rise.
The Government also has a responsibility to spend the taxpayers’ money
wisely. Over the course of my Administration, the rate of growth in nonsecurity
discretionary spending has steadily decreased from more than 16 percent
in 2001 to below the rate of inflation today. While the financial crisis has
required significant taxpayer investments that will increase the budget deficit,
we expect that most or all of those investments will be paid back to taxpayers
over time. The greatest challenge to the fiscal health of the country remains
the unsustainable growth in entitlement programs such as Social Security,

4  |  Economic Report of the President

Medicare, and Medicaid. I have laid out responsible, innovative solutions to
address these challenges, which will otherwise only grow more difficult to solve
over time. The Congress has an obligation to confront these issues.
Government does have a role to play in health care, but a robust private
market is critical to ensuring that health care is affordable and accessible
for all Americans. My Administration has sought to balance public and
private roles in health care with market-oriented policies that increase the
efficiency of health care delivery, encourage competition, and leave decisions
in the hands of individuals and their doctors. For example, enactment of
the Medicare prescription drug benefit program has provided more than
40 million Americans with better access to prescription drug coverage,
expanded competition in Medicare, trusted consumers to make their own
health care decisions, and the costs have been much lower than originally
estimated. The introduction of Health Savings Accounts has also provided
consumers with greater access to affordable health care plans. There is much
more that can be done to improve health care, such as adopting medical
liability reform, eliminating the bias in the tax code against those who do not
receive health insurance through their employers, and increasing the power
of small employers, civic groups, and community organizations to negotiate
lower-priced health premiums. These policies would help reduce frivolous
lawsuits that increase patients’ costs, promote the use of health savings
accounts, and encourage competition among health plans across State lines.
To be competitive in the global marketplace, the United States must remain
open to international trade and investment and reject the false promise offered
by protectionist policies. American workers and businesses can compete
with anyone in the world, as evidenced by the remarkable performance of
American exports in recent years. When I took office, the United States had
free trade agreements (FTAs) in force with only three countries. Today, we
have FTAs in force with 16 countries. I thank the Congress for its approval of
these agreements and strongly encourage prompt approval of the agreements
with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea that will benefit our country.
These agreements will provide greater access for our exports, support good
jobs for American workers, and promote America’s strategic interests. We
also have an unprecedented opportunity to reduce barriers to global trade and
investment through a successful conclusion to the World Trade Organization
Doha Round negotiations. In addition, the Congress should reauthorize and
reform trade adjustment assistance so that we can help those workers whose
jobs are displaced to learn new skills and find new jobs.

Economic Report of the President  |  5

The rapid increase in energy prices in the past year exposed just how
dependent our economy is on oil. We must continue taking steps to
increase our energy security. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy
Independence and Security Act of 2007 were major steps toward this goal,
but in the short term, our country will continue to rely on fossil fuels for
most of its energy supply. I am pleased that the Congress recognized this
reality and agreed to remove restrictions that will allow responsible oil and
gas exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf and expanded access to oil
shale to help meet America’s energy needs. In the long run, our energy
security will require advances in clean and renewable energy technologies.
My Administration has worked to reduce gasoline consumption and promote
alternative fuels to transform the way Americans power their cars and trucks.
We have also worked to develop cleaner energy sources to power Americans’
homes and places of work, such as clean coal, nuclear, solar, and wind power.
At home, we are on the path to slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth
of greenhouse gas emissions, but substantial reductions in global greenhouse
gas emissions are only possible with the concerted action of all countries.
The Major Economies Process launched by my Administration in 2007 has
brought all major economies together to discuss a common approach to a
global climate agreement that includes the meaningful participation of all
major economies.
The creativity, ingenuity, and resourcefulness of the American people
is our country’s greatest strength, and a vibrant education system is key
to maintaining our Nation’s competitive edge and extending economic
opportunity to every citizen. Workers who invest in their education and
training enjoy higher incomes and greater job security. The No Child
Left Behind Act has succeeded in bringing greater accountability to schools,
and the results are clear; as one example, African American and Hispanic
students are posting all-time high scores in a number of categories. The
Congress should reauthorize this vital law, and our Nation must continue
to demand results and accountability from our educational system. To be
competitive in the global economy, American workers also need to continually
update their skills. To that end, my Administration has invested nearly
$1 billion in new job training initiatives to ensure our workforce has the skills
required of 21st century jobs. We have also nearly doubled support for Pell
Grants to help millions of low-income Americans afford college tuition. The
technological innovation that drives our global economic leadership depends
on continued scientific discoveries and advancements, and I am pleased that
6  |  Economic Report of the President

the Congress authorized the doubling of basic research in key physical science
and engineering agencies as I proposed in my American Competitiveness
Initiative (ACI). I urge the Congress to appropriate these ACI funds promptly
to help sustain our economy’s long-term competitive position.
Many of these issues are discussed in the 2009 Annual Report of the
Council of Economic Advisers. The Council has prepared this Report to help
policymakers understand the economic conditions and issues that underlie my
Administration’s policy decisions. Free market policies have lifted millions of
people out of poverty and given them the opportunity to build a more hopeful
life. By continuing to trust the decisions of individuals and markets and
pursuing pro-growth policies, Americans can be confident that the economy
will emerge stronger than ever from its current challenges, with greater
opportunity for prosperity and economic growth.

Overview

T

he U.S. economy has proven itself remarkably resilient over the past
8 years, having withstood a number of major shocks throughout
the period. During the last few months of 2008, however, the economy
encountered major shocks in the financial sector that it could not shake
off. Those financial shocks combined with other factors—record high
commodity prices earlier in the year, natural disasters, and continued weakness in the housing market—to cause the economy to contract modestly
in the third quarter and what appears to be a sharp decline in the fourth
quarter (see Chapters 1 and 2). The contraction will likely last into
early- or mid-2009. Despite rapid fiscal and monetary policy action in
response to weakening economic conditions, the economy entered into
recession at the end of 2007, ending 6 years of expansion and a record
52 months of uninterrupted job growth. Several factors contributed over
many years to create the credit difficulties that reached crisis proportions
late in the year. The magnitude of the crisis required unprecedented policy
responses to reduce the extent of the damage to the economy. These policy
actions have laid a foundation for a strong economic recovery early in the
term of the next Administration. Most market forecasts suggest the weakness
will continue in the first half of 2009, followed by a recovery beginning in the
second half of 2009 that will gain momentum in 2010 and beyond.
Despite the risk that recent events may overshadow the many positive
developments of the past 8 years, there have been major policy advances that
have improved the long-term prospects of our economy and strengthened its
foundation. Much of this Report examines the effects of pro-growth economic
policies and market-based reforms adopted during the Administration, as well
as policy considerations that will further improve the long-term position of
our economy and allow more Americans to realize the benefits of economic
expansion in the future.
Record-high energy prices in 2008 highlighted our economy’s dependence
on fossil fuels and underscored the need to diversify our national energy
portfolio. Although it will take time and major technological breakthroughs
to substantially reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, the Administration has
invested unprecedented levels of Federal resources and adopted a number of
policies that have helped advance the economy’s transition to new sources of
energy while reducing local and regional pollutants in responsible ways that
do not threaten our economic well-being (see Chapter 3).

19

Export performance was one of the bright spots in the economy over the
past several years, and played an important role in offsetting other areas of
weakness in the economy. The United States’s continued commitment to
open trade and investment policies will be an important factor in maintaining
the international competitiveness and the dynamic nature of our economy
(see Chapter 4). Lower tax rates have also contributed to economic performance by easing the burden on labor and capital and enabling firms, investors,
and consumers to allocate resources more efficiently (see Chapter 5). These
policies, which contribute to the increased flexibility of the economy, will
be important in facilitating the economic recovery going forward. There
remains considerable opportunity  to strengthen our economic position by
eliminating the uncertainty surrounding tax relief that is scheduled to expire.
In addition, rising health care costs and spending on entitlement programs
are ongoing areas of concern, and the Administration has offered reforms that
could substantially lower costs and improve our fiscal position (see Chapters
6 and 7). Education is essential to future prosperity, and the Administration
has taken several steps to improve kindergarten through twelfth-grade
education and to make college more affordable (see Chapter 8). Finally, as
highlighted by the recent financial crisis, there are several areas in which regulatory reforms are necessary and appropriate to address market failures. The
Administration has pursued market-oriented regulatory reforms that favor
individual choice over Government decision making wherever appropriate,
and this approach has proven effective in addressing market failures without
imposing excessive costs on society or the economy (see Chapter 9).

Chapter 1: The Year in Review
and the Years Ahead
Following 6 consecutive years of expansion of the U.S economy, the
pace of real GDP expansion slowed in the first half of 2008 and turned
negative in the second half. The Business Cycle Dating Committee of the
National Bureau of Economic Research declared that the economy peaked
in December of 2007, then began a recession that continued throughout
2008. Falling house prices initiated a cascade of problems that threatened the
solvency of several major financial institutions and resulted in a major decline
in the stock market. To respond to these problems, policymakers undertook
a wide range of fiscal and monetary policy actions. Chapter 1 reviews the
economic developments of 2008 and discusses the Administration’s forecast
for the years ahead. The key points of Chapter 1 are:

20  |  Economic Report of the President

•	 Real GDP likely declined over the four quarters of 2008, ending a 6-year
run of positive growth, as the slow growth in the first half of the year was
eclipsed by what appears to be a sharp decline in the fourth quarter.
•	 Financial distress, which first became evident in mid-2007 in the market
for mortgage-backed securities (MBS), continued through 2008 and
affected a variety of markets. In the wake of the failure and near-failure
of several major financial institutions in September 2008, financial
stresses increased sharply to levels not seen during the post–World
War II era.
•	 Payroll jobs declined during 2008, having peaked in December of
2007. Employment losses averaged 82,000-per-month during the first
8 months of 2008, before accelerating to a 420,000-per-month pace
during the next 3 months. The unemployment rate was at 5 percent
rate though April—a low rate by historical standards—but increased to
6.7 percent in November. Initial and continued claims for unemployment
insurance moved up sharply over the course of the year.
•	 Energy prices dominated the movement of overall inflation in the
consumer price index (CPI), with large increases through July, followed
by a sharp decline during the latter part of the year. Core consumer
inflation (which excludes food and energy inflation) edged down from
2.4 percent during the 12 months of 2007 to a 1.9 percent annual rate
during the first 11 months of 2008. Food prices rose appreciably faster
than core prices.
•	 Nominal hourly compensation increased 2.8 percent during the
12 months through September 2008 (according to the employment cost
index), a gain that was undermined by the rise in food and energy prices,
so that real hourly compensation fell 2 percent. In the long run, real
hourly compensation tends to increase with labor productivity, although
the correlation can be very loose over shorter intervals. Nonfarm business productivity has grown at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent
since the business cycle peak in 2001.
•	 An economic stimulus was proposed by the President in January and
passed by Congress in February, authorizing about $113 billion in tax
rebate checks to low- and middle-income taxpayers and allowing 50
percent expensing for business equipment investment. The stimulus likely
boosted GDP growth in the second and third quarters above what it might
have been otherwise, but its influence faded by the end of the year.
•	 The Administration’s forecast calls for real GDP to continue to fall in
the first half of 2009, with the major declines projected to be concentrated in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. An
active monetary policy and the Treasury’s injection of assets into financial institutions are expected to ease financial stress and to lead to a

Overview  |  21

rebound in the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy in the second
half of 2009. Also supporting growth during 2009 is the substantial
recent drop in petroleum prices, which offsets some of the effects of the
recent decline in household wealth. The unemployment rate is expected
to increase to an average of 7.7 percent for 2009. The expansion in
2010–11 is projected to be vigorous, bringing the unemployment rate
down to 5 percent by 2012.

Chapter 2: Housing and Financial Markets
In the summer of 2008, the disruptions in credit markets that began in
2007 worsened to the point that the global financial system was in crisis.
The magnitude of the crisis required an unprecedented response on the part
of the Government to limit the extent of damage to the economy and restore
stability to the financial system. Chapter 2 reviews the origins of the crisis,
its consequences, the Government’s response, and discusses several policy
challenges going forward. The key points of Chapter 2 are:
•	 The roots of the current global financial crisis began in the late 1990s.  
A rapid increase in saving by developing countries (sometimes called the
“global saving glut”) resulted in a large influx of capital to the United
States and other industrialized countries, driving down the return on safe
assets. The relatively low yield on safe assets likely encouraged investors to look for higher yields from riskier assets, whose yields also went
down. What turned out to be an underpricing of risk across a number of
markets (housing, commercial real estate, and leveraged buyouts, among
others) in the United States and abroad, and an uncertainty about how
this risk was distributed throughout the global financial system, set the
stage for subsequent financial distress.
•	 The influx of inexpensive capital helped finance a housing boom.  House
prices appreciated rapidly earlier in this decade, and building increased
to well-above historic levels. Eventually, house prices began to decline
with this glut in housing supply.
•	 Considerable innovations in housing finance—the growth of subprime
mortgages and the expansion of the market for assets backed by
mortgages—helped fuel the housing boom. Those innovations were
often beneficial, helping to make home ownership more affordable and
accessible, but excesses set the stage for later losses.
•	 The declining value of mortgage-related assets has had a disproportionate
effect on the financial sector because a large fraction of mortgage-related
assets are held by banks, investment banks, and other highly levered
financial institutions. The combination of leverage (the use of borrowed

22  |  Economic Report of the President

funds) and, in particular, a reliance on short-term funding made these
institutions (both in the United States and abroad) vulnerable to large
mortgage losses.
•	 Vulnerable institutions failed, and others nearly failed.  The remaining
institutions pulled back from extending credit to each other, and interbank lending rates increased to unprecedented levels. The effects of
the crisis were most visible in the financial sector, but the impact and
consequences of the crisis are being felt by households, businesses, and
governments throughout the world.
•	 The U.S. Government has undertaken a historic effort to address the
underlying problems behind the freeze in the credit markets. These
problems, the subject of much of this chapter, are a sudden increase in
the desire for liquidity, a massive reassessment of risk, and a solvency
crisis for many systemically important institutions. The Government
has worked to preserve the stability of the overall financial system by
preventing the disorderly failures of important financial institutions;
taken unprecedented action to boost liquidity in short-term funding
markets; provided substantial new protections for consumers, businesses,
and investors; and cooperated closely with its international partners.
•	 Looking forward, the global financial crisis presents several additional
challenges for the U.S. Government. Among them are the need to
modernize financial regulation, unwind temporary programs in an
orderly fashion, and develop long-term solutions for the governmentsponsored enterprises (privately-owned, publicly-chartered entities)
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Chapter 3: Energy and the Environment
Although fossil fuels will continue to constitute a large share of the
Nation’s energy portfolio for some time, the Administration has taken major
steps to increase and diversify the Nation’s energy supply and to improve the
environment. Since 2001, significant investments have been made to develop
cleaner and more reliable energy sources, and several regulatory changes
are expected to deliver dramatic improvements in air quality nationwide.
Chapter 3 reviews recent advances in energy and environmental policy and
discusses several challenges associated with efforts to diversify the Nation’s
energy portfolio, to increase energy security, and to reduce emissions related
to fossil-fuel based energy use. The key points of Chapter 3 are:

Overview  |  23

•	 Because of innovative regulations promulgated under this Administration,
there should be substantial improvements in air quality over the next
few decades. Two rules that implemented cap-and-trade programs in
the electricity sector represent a significant step in using cost-effective,
market-oriented policy instruments to dramatically reduce power plants’
emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury.
•	 Despite widespread support for using market-based approaches to
achieve our environmental and energy policy goals going forward,
challenges remain in realizing the full potential of these approaches.
•	 There is an increasing need to reassess how well existing laws can address
the environmental problems associated with fossil fuel use in more costeffective ways. For example, it may become increasingly costly to make
additional reductions in traditional air pollutants, and existing statutes
that focus on local or regional pollutants were not designed to address
global problems such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
•	 Substantial reductions in global GHG emissions will require participation
by all large emitters (countries and sectors within countries).

Chapter 4: The Benefits of Open Trade and
Investment Policies
The United States has one of the most open economies in the world, ranking
very high in common measures of openness to trade and investment. In the
long run, the benefits that open economic policies generate far outweigh the
narrow, short-run perceived benefits of protectionist or isolationist policies.
The more diffuse but larger benefits of open trade and investment policies
to the general economy are often difficult to discern, especially in the short
run, and are sometimes obscured by the more visible effects of protectionist
policies on favored groups. This chapter discusses several key facts about
trade and investment in the United States, the benefits of free trade and open
investment, and the policies that the United States has taken to enhance both.
The key points of Chapter 4 are:
•	 Openness to trade and investment has boosted U.S. economic growth.  
Openness can also reduce the impact of shocks and increase the resilience
of the U.S. economy.
•	 The number of U.S. free trade agreements has increased greatly during
this Administration, and these agreements have contributed to the
growth in U.S. exports.

24  |  Economic Report of the President

•	 Portfolio and direct investments into the United States reached historic
levels over the past decade, in part due to the depth, diversity, and openness of U.S. financial markets and the competitiveness of U.S. firms.
•	 The United States has maintained an open investment policy, facilitating
foreign direct investment flows between the United States and the world
while addressing legitimate national security concerns.
•	 U.S. development and trade initiatives, as well as U.S. engagement in
multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization and
the World Bank, have helped increase growth and foster political and
economic stability in developing countries throughout the world.
•	 Continued commitment to open economic policies throughout the
world will help ensure continued economic gains for the United States
and the rest of the world.

Chapter 5: Tax Policy
Several policy changes over the past 8 years have resulted in lower tax rates
for both individuals and businesses, and specific incentives have been established to reduce the adverse tax consequences of certain desirable activities,
such as running a small business or buying an alternative-fuel vehicle. Lower
tax rates have increased the benefit of working and investing; in particular,
lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains helped business investment
expand, thereby helping firms increase worker productivity. Tax relief has
contributed to the solid economic growth and job creation that prevailed over
most of the past several years. The expiration of these tax reductions would
have serious consequences for the U.S. economy. An additional challenge is
to further reduce business tax burdens to encourage business investment in the
United States in order to develop new jobs for U.S. workers and to continue
improving our standard of living. The key points of Chapter 5 are:
•	 Taxes alter individual and business incentives and thus have the potential to distort their behavior. This Administration consistently fought
to reduce tax burdens on individuals and businesses; tax rates are now
much lower than they were just 8 years ago.
•	 Tax reductions over the past 8 years have improved incentives to work,
save, and invest.
•	 Globally, nations compete for businesses and the associated jobs; the
United States may need to reduce tax rates on businesses to remain
competitive in today’s world.

Overview  |  25

•	 Future goals should include permanently extending the tax relief of the
past 8 years and reforming the Alternative Minimum Tax.

Chapter 6: The Long-Run Challenges of
Entitlement Spending
Federal spending on entitlement programs is expected to increase
dramatically in the coming decades, particularly for Social Security, Medicare,
and Medicaid. Taken together, these programs currently constitute
45 percent of Federal non-interest spending, and assuming no major changes
to these programs, this share is projected to rise dramatically in coming
decades. An aging population and rising health care spending per person are
major reasons for these projected increases. The primary objective of this
chapter is to highlight the budgetary challenges facing each of the three major
entitlement programs and to outline possible strategies for addressing these
challenges. The key points of Chapter 6 are:
•	 Federal entitlement spending is on an unsustainable path.   Spending
on the three major entitlement programs—Social Security, Medicare,
and Medicaid—is projected to increase much faster than tax revenues
or than the overall economy over the coming decades.  Paying all scheduled benefits would eventually require substantial reductions in other
Government spending, or major tax increases, or both.
•	 The aging population is a major cause of the expected increase, especially
for Social Security, representing a permanent, as opposed to temporary,
shift in the entitlement landscape. Currently, one out of six adults is age
65 or older; by 2020, one out of five adults will be 65 or older; and, by
2030, one out of four adults will be age 65 or older.
•	 The pay-as-you-go financing structure of Social Security, coupled with
the aging population, creates a sizeable structural imbalance that will
cause current and future generations of workers to bear increasing costs
or receive smaller benefits than now scheduled, or both.
•	 Over the past 30 years, real per capita health care spending has grown
considerably faster than real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.
Real growth in Medicare spending is being driven by increasing enrollment, greater utilization of more expensive high-technology medical
treatments, and expansion of the goods and services covered by the
program.
•	 Long-term care expenditures for low-income elderly and disabled
persons represent a large and growing share of total Medicaid spending.
The demand for long-term care is expected to grow in the United States

26  |  Economic Report of the President

as a result of the aging population. In turn, this will place even greater
financial strain on Federal and State budgets.

Chapter 7: Balancing Private and
Public Roles in Health Care
Health care is one of the largest and fastest-growing sectors of the U.S.
economy. While modern health care provides substantial benefits, there are
growing concerns that its rising cost poses a threat to Americans’ access to
health insurance and medical care. The Administration has pursued several
initiatives to encourage the efficient provision of health care through private
markets and to improve access to affordable health care for individuals in the
United States. This chapter provides an overview of U.S. performance with
respect to the population’s health status and spending on health care and
discusses key efforts by the Administration to address issues of health care
quality, cost, and access. The key points of Chapter 7 are:
•	 Health care spending is expected to grow rapidly over the next several
decades, a trend that is driven by the increased use of high-technology
medical procedures, comprehensive health insurance that decreases
consumer incentives to shop for cost-effective care, rising rates of chronic
disease, and the aging of the population in the United States.
•	 Markets for health care services can function more efficiently when
payers, providers, and consumers have more complete information as
well as incentives to use medical care that is clinically effective and of
high value.
•	 Health insurance improves individuals’ well-being by providing financial protection against uncertain medical costs and by improving access
to care. Market-based approaches and innovative benefit designs can
enable people to select coverage that best fits their preferences and to
more actively participate in their own health care decision making.
•	 The Federal Government has an important role in investing in public
health infrastructure, particularly with respect to improving the availability of community-based health care for the underserved, preparing
for possible public health crises, supporting health-related research and
development, and promoting global health improvement.

Overview  |  27

Chapter 8: Education and Labor
Long-term economic growth requires a productive workforce with the
skills necessary to compete in a global labor market. The Administration’s
commitment to maintaining the high productivity of American workers is
evident in successful education and training policies. A continued commitment to broader access to quality education and training will be required to
meet the increasing worldwide demand for highly skilled labor. A workforce
with better and more widely dispersed skills will ensure that workers enjoy
higher incomes and will be a force in reducing income inequality in the
United States. The United States also needs comprehensive reform of its
immigration policies. The key points of this chapter are:
•	 Education benefits individuals through higher earnings, and it benefits
society as a whole. Administration initiatives to improve kindergarten
through twelfth-grade education, most notably the No Child Left
Behind Act, are demonstrating clear, measureable results.
•	 Access to higher education was maintained through an expanded Pell
Grant program and proactive efforts that helped protect Federally
subsidized student loans from recent credit issues faced elsewhere in
the economy.
•	 Despite a small decline in real median household income, which had
begun prior to the Administration taking office, hourly earnings of
workers outpaced inflation, and real per capita disposable income
rose substantially during the past 8 years. Median household income
increased steadily after the recovery began in earnest in 2004. Also,
pension reforms were enacted to help protect retirement income.
•	 Income inequality and immigration reform must still be addressed.  
Strong support for education and a focus on workers’ skills can help
close income gaps. Reform of immigration policies must provide border
security while allowing the economic benefits that immigrant labor
provides to the economy.

28  |  Economic Report of the President

Chapter 9: Economic Regulation
The private enterprise system, supported by consistent enforcement of laws
protecting property and contracts, has been at the heart of the American economy’s tremendous prosperity and growth. Although free markets produce
the most efficient outcome in most cases, there are instances where government intervention can increase economic efficiency. Government regulation
can improve economic outcomes where there are specific market failures that,
for example, create negative externalities that impose costs on society or create
harm from natural monopolies. At the same time, the Government’s ability
to create efficient regulation is limited and may create significant costs, which
must be weighed against the potential benefits of addressing market failures.
This chapter reviews several areas in which markets have been affected by
Government policy in the past 8 years. The key points of this chapter are:
•	 Regulation is appropriate when, and only when, there is an important
market failure that can be effectively addressed by the Government.
For example, the Administration has taken steps to reduce restrictive
regulation of broadband markets, preserving an environment conducive
to innovation and new investment. Conversely, the Administration
supported new rules for financial reporting when it became clear that
existing laws did not adequately reduce information asymmetries
between investors and management.
•	 When the Government intervenes to address market failures, it should
attempt to take advantage of market-based incentives whenever possible.
The Administration has helped ensure that scarce spectrum licenses
are allocated more efficiently by increasing the amount of bandwidth
allocated through auctions rather than through arbitrary allotments.
In transportation, the Administration has supported market-based
approaches to financing infrastructure such as roads and the air traffic
control system.
•	 The Administration has endeavored to ensure that, when the government
does intervene in markets, it does so in a way that supports the operation
of competitive markets. When the market for terrorism insurance was
disrupted following the attacks of 9/11, the Administration supported
a temporary program of Federal support for terrorism insurance, and
the Administration has insisted that subsidies be phased out as private
insurers adapt and return to the market. By supporting tort reform, the
Administration has helped reduce the scope for class action lawsuits that
create costs that outweigh their social benefits.

The Year in Review and the Years Ahead

F

ollowing 6 consecutive years of expansion of the U.S economy, the
pace of real GDP expansion slowed in the first half of 2008 and turned
negative in the second half. Payroll jobs began to decline in January,
following a record 52 months of continuous growth. The observed pattern
of output, employment, and other key indicators led the Business Cycle
Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research to declare
that the economy peaked in December of 2007, beginning a recession that
continued throughout 2008. The reorientation of the U.S. economy—which
had been underway in 2006 and 2007—away from housing investment and
consumer spending and toward exports and investment in business structures
continued through the first three quarters of 2008. However, the reorientation was neither smooth nor graceful, as falling house prices initiated a
cascade of problems beginning with mortgage delinquencies and falling prices
of mortgage-backed securities. This eventually threatened the solvency of
several major financial institutions and ultimately resulted in several failures
and forced mergers along with a major decline in the stock market beginning
in late September. To respond to these problems, policymakers have undertaken a wide range of actions during the year, including: personal tax rebates
and bonus depreciation allowances for business (the Economic Stimulus Act
of 2008, enacted in February); support for the housing market (the Housing
and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 in July); large-scale investment in financial assets (the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 in October); a
reduction in the Federal funds rate from 5¼ percent in August 2007 to almost
zero by December 2008; and the implementation of a variety of programs by
the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC), and other agencies to provide liquidity to financial institutions and
to mitigate strains impairing the functioning of the overall financial system.
In the wake of mounting problems with the performance of subprime
(higher risk) mortgages, financial markets became stressed beginning about
August 2007 and became substantially more stressed after mid-September
2008. After a slight decline in real gross domestic product (real GDP, the
total value of all goods and services produced in the United States after
adjusting for inflation) in the fourth quarter of 2007, policy actions—
including the enactment of a fiscal stimulus program and the initial round of
Federal Reserve rate cuts—helped maintain positive real GDP growth in the
first half of 2008. These actions likely delayed the downturn in output but
were not sufficient to prevent the steep falloff in employment, production,
31

and aggregate spending that appears to have begun in mid-September. After
the mid-September failure of Lehman Brothers (an investment bank), the
emergency loans to AIG (an insurance company with extensive involvement
in insuring mortgage-related securities), and the takeover of Washington
Mutual (a savings bank with extensive mortgage-related assets), the global
financial markets showed a sharp increase in perceived risk, and the stock
market tumbled.
Inflation figures were mixed, with notable rises through mid-year in indexes
that included food and imported energy products such as the consumer price
index (CPI) and the price index for gross domestic purchases. A sharp decline
in petroleum prices brought these prices down substantially by the end of
the year. In contrast, inflation was less volatile for the broadest index of the
goods and services produced in the United States (the GDP price index) and
for most measures of wages and hourly compensation.
This chapter reviews the economic developments of 2008 and discusses
the Administration’s forecast for the years ahead. The key points of this
chapter are:
•	 Real GDP likely declined over the four quarters of 2008, ending a
6-year run of positive growth, as the slow growth in the first half
of the year was eclipsed by what appears to be a sharp decline in the
fourth quarter.
•	 Financial distress, which first became evident in mid-2007 in the market
for mortgage-backed securities (MBS), continued through 2008 and
affected a variety of markets. In the wake of the failure and near-failure of
several major financial institutions in September 2008, financial stresses
increased sharply to levels not seen during the post–World War II era.
•	 Payroll jobs declined during 2008, having peaked in December of
2007. Employment losses averaged 82,000-per-month during the first 8
months of 2008 before accelerating to a 420,000-per-month pace during
the next 3 months. The unemployment rate was at 5 percent though
April—a low rate by historical standards—but increased to 6.7 percent
in November. Initial and continued claims for unemployment
insurance moved up sharply over the course of the year.
•	 Energy prices dominated the movement of overall inflation in the
consumer price index (CPI), with large increases through July, followed
by a sharp decline during the latter part of the year. Core consumer
inflation (which excludes food and energy inflation) edged down from
2.4 percent during the 12 months of 2007 to a 1.9 percent annual rate
during the first 11 months of 2008. Food prices rose appreciably faster
than core prices.
•	 Nominal hourly compensation increased 2.8  percent during the
12 months through September 2008 (according to the employment cost
index), a gain that was undermined by the rise in food and energy prices,
32  |  Economic Report of the President

so that real hourly compensation fell 2 percent. In the long run, real
hourly compensation tends to increase with labor productivity, although
the correlation can be very loose over shorter intervals. Nonfarm business productivity has grown at an average annual rate of 2.6  percent
since the business-cycle peak in 2001.
•	 An economic stimulus package was proposed by the President in January
and passed by Congress in February, authorizing about $113 billion in
tax rebate checks to low- and middle-income taxpayers and allowing
50 percent expensing for business equipment investment. The stimulus
likely boosted GDP growth in the second and third quarters above what it
might have been otherwise, but its influence faded by the end of the year.
•	 The Administration’s forecast calls for real GDP to continue to fall in the
first half of 2009, with the major declines projected to be concentrated
in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. An active
monetary policy and Treasury’s injection of assets into financial institutions are expected to ease financial stress and to lead to a rebound in
the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy in the second half of 2009.
Also supporting growth during 2009 is the substantial recent drop in
petroleum prices, which offsets some of the effects of the recent decline
in household wealth. The unemployment rate is expected to increase
to an average of 7.7  percent for 2009. The expansion in 2010–11 is
projected to be vigorous, bringing the unemployment rate down to
5 percent by 2012.

Developments in 2008 and the
Near-Term Outlook
During the first three quarters of 2008, the economy continued the rebalancing that began in 2006, with strong growth in business structures investment
and exports offsetting pronounced declines in homebuilding, while consumer
spending edged lower by 0.6 percent at an annual rate. By the fourth quarter
of 2008, however, most major indicators became sharply negative.

Consumer Spending and Saving
Real consumer spending stagnated in the first half of 2008 and then fell
sharply in the third quarter in what was the largest quarterly decline since
1980. This was a major deceleration after the 2.8 percent average annual rate
during the 2001–07 expansion. During these three quarters, motor vehicle
purchases fell to 12.9 million units at an annual rate, a drop of 19 percent
at an annual rate, having fluctuated around a 16-17 million unit average
annual pace during the expansion. Energy purchases (which had edged up at
Chapter 1  |  33

a 0.7 percent annual rate) declined at a 9 percent annual rate, finally reacting
to the enormous increase in energy prices (relative to the price of the overall
consumer basket) during the preceding 3 years. Other consumer spending
(that is, outside of motor vehicles and energy) slowed to only a 1  percent
annual rate of growth following a 3 percent average rate of growth during the
preceding expansion. Consumer spending has continued to fall in the fourth
quarter. Key factors influencing the evolution of consumer spending during
the past year were the response to the multiyear increase in energy prices, the
February stimulus package (see Box 1-1), and most importantly, the decline
in household wealth during 2008.
Box 1-1: The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008
Policymakers moved quickly to address the slowing economy early
in the year. The Federal Reserve cut the target Federal funds rate by
1¼ percentage points in January (following 1 percentage point of earlier
cuts from August through December of 2007). The economic effects of
monetary policy emerge more gradually then those of tax rebates, and so
some fiscal stimulus from rebates was judged to be useful in supporting
the economy in the short term. The Congress passed and the President
signed the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 in early February, only a few
weeks after the President proposed it. The Act was designed to place
money in the hands of those individuals and households who were most
likely to spend it. The amount to be dispensed was about $113 billion, or
about 0.8 percent of GDP. Most of the money was dispensed between
late April and early July, with the bulk of the disbursements ($78 billion)
in the second quarter.
Under this Act, the Treasury mailed checks ranging between $300 and
$600 to taxpayers filing as individuals. Individuals who earned $3,000
(the minimum amount under this Act) received a $300 check; those who
earned between $3,000 and $75,000 received a check for up to $600.
The formula phased out the payments at a rate of $50 for every $1000
of income in excess of $75,000. (The figures for those filing as married
couples were doubled.) Social Security and veterans payments were
counted as earned income. The Act also included an allowance of $300
for each child (under the age of 17 as of the end of 2007). Those who did
not qualify for payments based on their 2007 income could qualify based
on their 2008 income, with the benefit to be paid in early 2009.
Some academic studies, however, suggest that individuals would
realize that these checks were a one-time event and that they would
choose to spend this windfall over many years. Other studies suggest
that individuals, especially those who were credit-constrained, would

Box 1-1 — continued
spend most of the money as it came in. A macroeconomic model
simulated the expected boost to the profile of real GDP on the estimate
that about 70  percent of the funds would be considered temporary
income (to be spent over a long time) and the remaining funds would be
regarded as immediately spendable. The profile from that simulation,
which also showed the boost from bonus depreciation (discussed below),
is shown in chart 1-1. The model simulation suggests a 2¼ percentage
point boost to the annual rate of real GDP growth in the second quarter.
Because many of the rebate checks were delivered late in the second
quarter, however, some of the second-quarter stimulus shown in the
chart was considered likely to spill over into the third quarter.

The Act also authorized businesses to deduct 50  percent of the cost
of investment equipment installed during 2008 from their 2008 taxes,
a policy that is often referred to as bonus depreciation. The Act also
expanded the limits for small business expensing, a policy that was
expected to boost real GDP growth by about 0.2 percentage point during
2008. Bonus depreciation is valuable only to firms with positive profits,

Chapter 1  |  35

Box 1-1 — continued
however, and so the fourth-quarter plunge in output will likely reduce
the ability of firms to take advantage of this program.
Whether or not the fiscal stimulus produced the intended effect cannot
be determined from observed macroeconomic data alone because the
path that GDP would have taken without the stimulus remains unknown.
However, a recent study that examined the nondurable purchases of a
large sample of consumers found that the spending of individuals rose
at the time rebate checks were received. The study concluded that the
stimulus checks had a significant effect on purchases and that these
effects were more pronounced among low-income consumers.

Energy Expenditures
Real energy consumption (that is, adjusted for increases in prices) increased
slightly (4 percent) from 2001 through 2007, despite a cumulative 66 percent
increase in the relative price of energy. The resulting increase in nominal
energy spending through 2007 was not offset by a decline in nonenergy
spending, and was one force that lowered the personal saving rate during
these 6 years. As the relative price of energy increased another 15  percent
during the first three quarters of 2008, real energy consumption finally fell
7 percent.
Oil prices skyrocketed to a peak monthly average of $134 per barrel in
June for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) (a benchmark grade of crude oil),
almost double the price of a year earlier. The sharp rise in the price of oil
(see Chart 1‑1) reflected roughly unchanged world oil production in the face
of rapid global economic growth. More than half of the increase in world oil
demand over the past 5 years is accounted for by China. Over that period,
production increases in Brazil, China, Canada, the Sudan, and the former
Soviet Union were mostly offset by a large decline in North Sea production
and reductions in U.S. and Mexican production. By December the price of
WTI oil had fallen to about $41 per barrel.
Because the U.S. imports about 3.7 billion barrels of oil per year, each
$10‑per‑barrel increase adds about $37 billion to the national oil import bill.
However, the economic consequences of the higher oil import bill during
2003–07 (when the price of WTI crude oil increased from a $31‑per‑barrel
annual average to a $72‑per‑barrel annual average) were partially offset by an
increase in demand for our exports (which grew at an average of 9 percent
per year over this period). This increase in exports was partly a consequence
of the same rise in foreign economic growth that caused the price of oil to
increase. The additional $66‑per‑barrel increase in the price of oil from June

36  |  Economic Report of the President

2007 to June 2008 was larger than the entire increase during the preceding
4 years and added roughly $245 billion to the national import bill. This rise
in cost was reversed by an even larger decline from June through December,
with the price decline attributable to the drop in energy demand due to a
worldwide decline in economic activity.

Wealth Effects on Consumption and Saving
The decline in value for housing wealth and, even more importantly,
stock-market wealth were among the most important influences on consumer
behavior during 2008. Changes in real wealth and real consumer spending
are correlated, as can be seen in Chart 1-2. The interrelationship between
wealth and consumer spending is far from perfect (at least in part because
many other factors influence spending). The relationship is nevertheless
statistically significant whether or not other related factors such as income
and lagged values are included. Household wealth peaked in the second
quarter of 2007, when it reached a level that was worth 6.3 years of disposable
income. Housing and stock market wealth fell over the next five quarters; by
the end of the third quarter of 2008 (the most recent official data available),
the wealth-to-income ratio had fallen by 1.0 year of income. The continued
stock market declines in October and November, together with the downward trend in house prices, suggest that the wealth-to-income ratio dropped

Chapter 1  |  37

a further 0.5 year in the fourth quarter. As a result, the cumulative decline in
the wealth-to-income ratio now appears to be about 1.5 years of income.
Most of the drop in household wealth is related to the stock market decline.
In dollar terms, household net worth fell about $7 trillion between the
second quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2008. Most of this decline
was accounted for by the stock market, while the erosion of housing wealth
was about one-half as large as that of the stock market. Other components
of wealth (a category that includes consumer durables, credit market instruments, and equity in nonfinancial business, among others) were roughly
unchanged over this five-quarter period.

Projected Consumer Spending
Consumer spending tends to rise and fall along with wealth (as illustrated
in chart 1-2). A statistical analysis of the relationship between consumer
spending, income, wealth, and other variables suggests that about 5 percent
of wealth is spent every year. If this is so, the recent decline in the wealthto-income ratio (of about 1.5 years of income) appears likely to reduce
the consumption-to-income ratio and to raise the saving rate by roughly
7 percentage points over time. During the three years from 2005 to 2007,
the saving rate averaged 0.5 percent, and so it appears that the saving rate will

38  |  Economic Report of the President

probably move up gradually towards 7 percent—barring any sizable recovery
in the stock market. A saving rate at this level would return the saving rate
to the same level as for the 10-year period through 1985 (that is, before the
run-up in the stock market in the late 1990s). To get there from the third
quarter saving rate of 1.1 percent, however, would require substantially slower
growth in consumer spending than in income. Thus, it seems likely that real
consumer spending will continue to fall during the fourth quarter of 2008
and early in 2009. A rebound in the stock market would, of course, make
this adjustment easier, as the saving rate would not have to rise by the full
7 percentage points. If a stock market rebound does not occur, consumption
growth will likely remain weak into 2010.

Residential Investment
Residential investment continued into its third year of decline in 2008.
Major measures of housing activity moved lower over the course of the year,
with housing starts falling to an average annual rate of 740,000 units during
the three months through November, a huge decline from the 2.1 million
unit annual rate at its peak in the first quarter of 2006. The drop in home
construction now appears to have subtracted an average of 0.75 percentage
point from the annual rate of growth of real GDP, similar to the subtraction
during 2006 and 2007.
Housing prices peaked in the second quarter of 2007, as measured by the
purchase-only index published by the Federal Housing Finance Authority
(FHFA, formerly the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight).
From that peak through the latest available data (the third quarter of 2008),
housing prices have declined 6.5 percent (see Chart 1-3). According to the
S&P/Case-Shiller index, which peaked earlier (in the second quarter of 2006)
and subsequently declined 21 percent, the recent decline, as well as the earlier
run-up, is more accentuated. (See Box 1-2 on the relative merits of the two
house price indexes).
Further declines in home construction seem likely through at least the first
half of 2009, as builders’ confidence has fallen to the lowest level on record and
the secondary market for housing-related securities continues to be thin. The
Administration forecasts a steady uptrend in housing starts during the next
5 years, with the annual rate of starts gradually increasing so that by 2013 starts
would reach 1.8 million units. This reflects, among other factors, a return to
steady income growth, an easing of lending standards, and improved credit
availability. The pace of the expected housing recovery has some upside risk.
The number of unsold new houses has fallen to about 400,000 units, about
the level of 2003 and 2004, even though the ratio of unsold new homes to
the current selling pace remains near its record high. If and when aggregate
demand accelerates, housing starts would easily be pulled upward.
Chapter 1  |  39

Box 1-2: Different Measures of House Prices
Both the FHFA purchase-only index and the S&P/Case-Shiller index
have merit and use similar methods, but they cover different types
of mortgages and have different regional coverage. As a result, each
may have advantages in different contexts. Both are based on a methodology of observing pairs of sales of the same house over a span of
years. The FHFA index is limited to homes purchased with conforming
mortgages (that is, mortgages that conform to the maximum size and
minimum downpayment standards set by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac).
In contrast, the S&P/Case-Shiller index collects data from a sample of
homes that includes nonconforming as well as conforming mortgages.
Each house gets an equal weight in the FHFA index, while more expensive houses are assigned larger weights in the S&P/Case-Shiller index.
Of the two indexes, the FHFA index has the broadest national geographic
distribution, while the Case-Shiller index has no data for 13 States and
incomplete data for another 29 States.
continued on the next page

40  |  Economic Report of the President

Box 1-2 — continued
The contrasting path of house prices as measured by these two indexes
during the past decade is informative. By relying on conforming mortgages only, the FHFA index may provide a more stable picture of house
prices during a period when the mix of mortgages changed toward the
nonconforming types (subprime and jumbo, for example) and then back
again. (This may be relevant if the type of mortgage is correlated with
the price of the house.) On the other hand, the S&P/Case-Shiller index
better illustrates the price path of all houses regardless of mortgage type
and mortgage size. The contrast between the two indexes suggests that
the runup in housing prices may have been larger for homes purchased
with nonconforming mortgages and perhaps with jumbo mortgages.
As the share of nonconforming mortgages fell sharply over the past
2 years, the two indexes are likely relying on more similar samples
in 2008, and as a result, the recent larger decline in the S&P/CaseShiller index may partly reflect a falling back to earth after having been
temporarily elevated by higher prices for homes purchased with nonconforming mortgages. One study suggests that the inclusion of subprime
mortgages in the S&P/Case-Shiller index accounts for a substantial share
of the index’s deeper decline. The larger increase and subsequently
larger decline in the S&P/Case-Shiller index may also reflect larger price
movements among more expensive homes.

Business Fixed Investment
During the first three quarters of 2008, real business investment in equipment
and software fell 4.4 percent at an annual rate, down from 2.8 percent growth
in 2007. Growing categories included software (2.4 percent), communication
equipment (5.2  percent), and agricultural equipment (27  percent), while
investment in industrial equipment fell 4.0 percent. Investment in transportation
equipment (which includes motor vehicles and aircraft) was particularly weak,
falling 37 percent at an annual rate through the third quarter, with the sharpest
drop seen in the light trucks category.
In contrast to residential investment, real business investment in nonresidential structures grew at a strong 12 percent annual rate through the third
quarter of 2008. The gains during 2008 made it the third consecutive year
of strong growth, which was a marked reversal from the weakness during the
period from 2001 to 2005. Nearly 65 percent of total growth in nonresidential structures was accounted for by manufacturing structures and petroleum
and natural gas exploration and wells.

Chapter 1  |  41

Access to the credit markets to support investment became more difficult
for nonfinancial corporations during 2008. The flow of new external funds
(credit market instruments such as bond issues, commercial paper, and bank
loans) in the fourth quarter of 2007 was about $1.9 trillion (the positive
bars in Chart 1‑4); it then fell by $1.3 trillion by the third quarter of 2008.
Despite this drop in the flow of external funds, firms were able maintain solid
investment by cutting back on programs to buy stock in their own company
(by $700 billion, the negative bars in Chart 1-4) so that the total funds raised
in all capital markets fell only $600 billion (the solid line in Chart 1-4).
These share buyback programs had reached record levels during the period
from 2004 through 2007. However, by the third quarter of 2008—when the
major financial stress began—share buybacks had diminished to only $410
billion, so that this “source” of internal funds had been mostly exhausted.
Business investment growth is projected to decline in 2009, a projection
that is based partially on the high level of interest rates on corporate bonds.
It is also partially based on the pattern of business investment reacting to the
change in output growth. That is, following the decline in output in late
2008, investment in 2009 is likely to fall. Later, the expected acceleration
of real GDP in late 2009 and 2010 is expected to result in rapid growth of
business investment. In the longer run, real business investment is projected
to grow at about the same rate as real GDP.

42  |  Economic Report of the President

Business Inventories
Inventory investment fell during the first three quarters of 2008 and
had a noticeable influence on quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in real GDP,
subtracting 1½  percentage points from growth in the second quarter.
Inventories of motor vehicles on dealer lots were an important contributor
to these fluctuations as these inventories were liquidated during the first half
of 2008 and were increased slightly in the third quarter. Inventories of other
goods outside of the motor vehicle sector were liquidated in each of the first
three quarters of the year.
The overall ratio of inventories to sales has come down substantially since
2001. The inventory-to-sales ratio for manufacturing and trade (in current
dollars) fell in the first half of 2008 before rising during the 3 months through
October. Firms could soon find themselves with more inventory than they
need if (as expected) sales continue to fall over the next few months. As a
consequence, inventories are likely to be liquidated in the near term. Even so,
a drop in inventory investment is not likely to be as dominant in the current
downturn as it was in most of the post–World War II recessions because of
the fairly lean inventory position relative to sales at the outset of this recession.
In the long term, inventory investment is projected to be fairly stable, and the
overall inventory-to-sales ratio is expected to continue to trend lower.

Government Purchases
Nominal Federal revenues (that is, in current dollars) fell 2 percent in fiscal
year (FY) 2008, following 7 percent growth in FY 2007. The decline in revenues can be attributed partly to slowing economic growth (a key determinant
of tax receipts), as well as reduced Federal tax revenues due to the tax rebate
provisions of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. Coupled with declining
revenues, a 9 percent increase in outlays resulted in an increase in the Federal
budget deficit to 3.2  percent of GDP in FY  2008, up from 1.2  percent in
FY 2007.
Through several appropriations acts, the Congress provided a total of
$192 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in FY 2008. One of these
acts, the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008, also provided $68 billion
in bridge funding for FY 2009.
Real State and local government purchases rose at a 1.2  percent annual
rate during the first three quarters of 2008, down from 2.4 percent in 2007.
State and local tax revenues slowed in 2008, as receipts from personal income
taxes, sales taxes, and property taxes decelerated, while corporate tax receipts
fell. Notably, property tax revenue, which had grown at a 6 percent annual
rate each year in 2004, 2005, and 2006, slowed to a 2.6 percent annual rate
of growth through the third quarter of 2008. Over the same period, receipts
from sales taxes edged up only 0.1 percent at an annual rate.
Chapter 1  |  43

The State and local government sector fell into deficit during 2008,
reaching $109 billion or 0.8 percent of GDP, by the third quarter, the largest
operating deficit on record. On average, State and local government operating budgets have been in surplus during the post–World War II period.
In 2009 and 2010, only slow growth—if any—can be anticipated for this
sector’s consumption and gross investment. This decline results from the
deterioration in their tax base, as reflected in falling home prices, declining
consumer spending, and slowing growth in personal income. Property tax
receipts and sales tax revenues each represent slightly more than 20 percent
of State and local government revenues: Federal grants constitute another
20 percent; personal income tax receipts account for about 15 percent, while
corporate tax collections constitute only 3 percent. A variety of fees, transfers,
and incomes account for the remaining 18 percent.

Exports and Imports
Real exports of goods and services grew at a 7 percent annual rate during
the first three quarters of 2008, following solid growth of at least 7 percent
over the preceding 4 years. The rapid pace of export expansion over the
past 5 years coincided with strong foreign growth from 2003 to 2007, as
well as changes in the terms of trade between 2002 and mid-2008 that
made American goods cheaper relative to those of some other countries.
Recently, however, economic growth among our major trading partners has
slowed considerably, with the Euro zone, Japan, and Canada posting negative growth. Because foreign growth and U.S. exports are closely related, the
global economic slowdown will likely weigh on U.S. exports in the future.
By region, export growth during 2008 was strongest to Latin American
countries, rising at a 24 percent annual rate through the third quarter. The
European Union (EU) remains the major overseas destination for U.S. products and services, consuming about 25 percent of our exports. By country,
Canada accounts for the largest share of U.S. exports, at about 16 percent.
Mexico purchases 10  percent of our exports; Japan, 6  percent; and China,
5 percent.
Real imports fell at a 3.9 percent annual rate during the first three quarters of 2008; the last year of decline before that was 2001. The decline in
real imports was especially pronounced among petroleum products, which
fell 12 percent at an annual rate, pushed down by high prices and slowing
domestic economic activity over this period. Due to rapidly rising petroleum prices through the first half of the year, nominal imports of petroleum
products rose at a 46  percent annual rate. Oil prices have since receded
dramatically, which will greatly reduce growth in nominal petroleum imports
in coming quarters. Nonpetroleum import prices also increased substantially

44  |  Economic Report of the President

(6.6  percent during the four quarters through the third quarter of 2008),
which may also have restrained the level of imports.
The current account deficit (the excess of imports and income flows
to foreigners over exports and foreign income of Americans) averaged
5.0 percent of GDP during the first three quarters of 2008, down from its
2007 average of over 5.3 percent. The decline in the current account deficit
reflects faster growth in exports relative to imports, although domestic investment continues to exceed domestic saving, with foreigners financing the gap
between the two.

Employment
The employment situation deteriorated during 2008, mirroring weakness
in other sectors. The pace of job growth appears to have had two phases: a
period of moderate job losses, at an average rate of 82,000 per month from
January through August, followed by a steeper decline at an average rate
of 420,000 per month in September, October, and November. Nonfarm
payroll employment fell 1.9 million jobs during the first 11 months of the
year. The unemployment rate rose 1.7  percentage points over the same
period, reaching 6.7 percent. Initial claims for unemployment insurance rose
to an average of about 550,000 per week in December, up from the 2007
average of 320,000 per week.
Job losses during the first 11  months of 2008 were concentrated in
construction, manufacturing, and temporary help services. Although
manufacturing and construction account for only about 15 percent of total
employment, they accounted for nearly 60 percent of the overall decline in
nonfarm jobs during 2008. Construction employment has been declining
as a result of continued weakness in the housing market, and manufacturing
employment has been on a downward trend as a share of overall employment
for the past five decades. Temporary help services, which account for only
2 percent of employment, accounted for 21 percent of the year’s job losses.
Retailing also posted a notable decline. One bright spot in the employment
picture has been education and health services, which added 505,000 jobs
through November.
Changes in unemployment differed by education level, race, and gender
over the year. Through November, the unemployment rate had risen for
workers of all education levels; it increased 0.9  percentage point for those
holding at least a bachelor’s degree, 1.8  percentage points for those with
some college, 2.1  percentage points for those whose education ended with
a high school degree, and 2.9  percentage points among those who did not
finish high school. By race and ethnicity, the unemployment rate for African
Americans rose by 2.2 percentage points and was about 5 percentage points

Chapter 1  |  45

above the rate for Caucasians, a smaller margin than during most of the past
35 years. The unemployment rate among Caucasians rose 1.7  percentage
point, among Hispanics rose 2.3  percentage points, and among Asian
Americans rose 1.1 percentage points. By gender, the jobless rate for adult
men rose 2.1 percentage points to 6.5 percent, and the rate for adult women
rose by 1.1 percentage point to 5.5 percent. The median duration of unemployment increased to 10.0 weeks in November from 8.4 weeks at the end
of 2007. The number of long-term unemployed (those who are jobless for
15 weeks or more) rose by 1.4 million over the same period.
The Administration projects that employment will decline during the four
quarters of 2009, with the job losses likely to be largest early in the year. As
the expected recovery strengthens in 2010, job growth is anticipated to pick
up to 222,000 jobs per month. In the longer run, the pace of employment
growth will slow, reflecting diminishing rates of labor force growth due to the
retirement of the baby-boom generation. The Administration also projects
that the unemployment rate will increase from 2008 to a 7.7 percent annual
average in 2009 as a whole, before returning to roughly 5 percent in 2012, the
middle of the range consistent with stable long-run inflation.

Productivity
Nonfarm productivity growth has averaged 2.5 percent at an annual rate
since 1995 (see Chart 1‑5). The best estimate of the productivity growth rate
over the next 6 years is 2.4 percent, which is slightly below the 2.5 percent
long-term (that is, post-1995) rate. Different measures of recent productivity
growth are discussed in Box 1-3. Compared with last year’s projection, this
projected rate of growth has been revised down 0.1 percentage point. The
downward revision is a consequence of the downward adjustment to output
and productivity in the annual revision to the national income and product
accounts.

Prices and Wages
Headline inflation rose and then fell during 2008, although key indicators
of inflation trends were fairly stable. As measured by the overall consumer
price index (CPI), the 12-month rate of inflation moved up to 5.6 percent for
the 12 months through July, up from the 4.1 percent during the 12 months
of 2007 (Chart 1-6). The acceleration was due to increases in food and
energy price inflation. By November, however, the 12‑month rate of overall
CPI inflation had fallen to 1.1 percent. The 12-month change in the core
CPI (which excludes the volatile food and energy components) fluctuated in
a more narrow range, peaking at 2.5  percent during the third quarter, but
edging down to 2.0 percent by November.

46  |  Economic Report of the President

Box 1-3: Alternate Measures of Productivity Growth
Productivity growth can be projected by extrapolating its behavior
over the recent past. But using which measure? According to the official
index, which measures output from the product-side (spending) components of GDP, productivity growth picked up slightly from the 1995–2001
period (2.4 percent) to the 2001–08 period (2.6 percent at an annual rate),
as shown in the following table. In contrast, an alternative measure of
nonfarm output, derived from the income side of the national income
and product accounts, shows a deceleration in productivity between
the two periods to a 2.1 percent annual rate of increase over the period
2001–08. The income- and product-side measures of GDP differ by
measurement error only, and the truth is likely to be somewhere in
between. Both measures show a 2.5 percent annual average growth rate
over the entire 1995–2008 interval.

Energy prices increased rapidly in the second half of 2007 and in the early
part of 2008 before peaking in July, when the 12-month rate of change
reached 29 percent. Among the various energy products, prices of gasoline
and heating oil increased the most rapidly during this period (reflecting the
price of crude oil on world markets), but prices of electricity and natural
gas also moved up sharply. Energy prices came down sharply during the
4 months from July to November, when consumer prices of petroleum
products fell 41 percent (not at an annual rate). The rapid decline reflects
the sharp fall in the price of crude oil; prices of West Texas Intermediate
plunged from an average of $134 per barrel in June to roughly $41 per barrel
in December.
Rapidly rising import prices were another factor boosting inflation early in
the year and also holding it down later. Nonpetroleum import prices rose
nearly 8 percent during the twelve months though July, before falling during
the next 4 months. The pattern reflects the exchange value of the dollar,
which depreciated in 2006, 2007, and during the first 3  months of 2008
before rebounding later in the year.
The effect of import prices appears clear in the contrast between the rate
of inflation for the goods and services that Americans buy and the rate of
inflation for what Americans produce (see Chart 1-7). The rate of inflation
for the goods and services that Americans buy (measured by the price of gross
domestic purchases) moved up from the year-earlier pace, in contrast to the
less volatile rate of inflation for gross domestic product.

Chapter 1  |  49

Food prices advanced notably faster than core prices for the second
consecutive year. During the first 10 months of 2008, food prices increased
6.5  percent at an annual rate following a 5  percent increase during the
12 months of 2007. The increase was a worldwide phenomenon and likely
reflects several factors, including rapid growth in developing countries in the
first half of 2008, crop shortages and increased production of biofuels as well
as higher energy prices being passed through to consumers.
Growth in nominal hourly compensation edged down slightly. Privatesector hourly compensation increased at a 2.6  percent annual rate during
the first 9 months of 2008, down slightly from 3.1  percent during 2007.
Slightly diminished gains in benefits as well as wages and salaries account
for the deceleration. Gains in real hourly wages of production workers rose
3.4 percent at an annual rate during the first 11 months of the year, following
a 0.7  percent decline during the 12  months of 2007, when nominal wage
gains were undermined by rapidly rising food and energy prices.
Despite the relative stability of several key measures of inflation (hourly
compensation, the core CPI, and the GDP price index), a measure of
consumers’ inflation expectations moved up and down during the year in a
way that suggests that it was influenced by volatile energy and nonpetroleum
import prices. One‑year‑ahead median inflation expectations (as measured by
the Reuters-University of Michigan survey) rose from 3.4 percent at the end of
2007 to about 5 percent in midyear, before falling to 1.7 percent in December.
Longer-term inflation expectations were less volatile but also moved up and
then down in a similar fashion in the 2.6 to 3.4 percent range.

Financial Markets
The Wilshire 5000 (a broad stock market index) fell 39  percent during
2008, and the Standard and Poor (S&P) 500 (an index of the 500 largest
corporations) suffered a similar decline. This decline erased the cumulated
increases over the preceding 5 years. The Wilshire index slipped 16 percent
through September 16, but then tumbled another 40  percent through
November 20, before recovering a bit in late November and December. The
S&P index of financial stocks fell by 57 percent in 2008.
Yields on 10-year Treasury notes ended 2007 at 4.10 percent—at the low
end of the historical range—and fell another 170 or so basis points during
2008 with much of the decline coming in November and December. The
low level of these long-term interest rates was due in part to a likely flight to
the quality of these secure assets relative to others in the private and international markets during the recent market turmoil. Rates also fell toward the
end of the year as market participants revised down the expected path of the
Federal Reserve’s target rate.

50  |  Economic Report of the President

The Administration’s forecast of short-term interest rates was roughly
based on the expected path of Federal funds rates in the futures market (where
participants place “bets” on future rates) as of November 10, the date that
the forecast was developed. The near-term interest rate forecast has been
overtaken by more recent events as interest rates have fallen notably since
the forecast was finalized. Whatever the starting point, the Administration
projects the rate on 91-day Treasury bills to edge up gradually to 3.9 percent
by 2012 and then remain at that level. At that level, the real rate (that is, the
nominal rate less the rate of inflation) on 91-day Treasury bills would be close
to its historical average.
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes on November 10 was 3.8  percent.
The decline in this yield during the subsequent month means that this nearterm forecast has also been overtaken by events. The Administration expects
the 10-year rate to increase, eventually reaching a normal spread of about
1.2  percentage points over the 91-day Treasury-bill rate by 2012. Market
participants also appear to expect an increase in yield as evidenced by the
higher-than-average spread between the rate on 20-year Treasury notes over
rates on notes with 10-year maturities. As a result, yields on 10-year notes are
expected to increase, to 5.1 percent by 2012 and then to plateau at this rate
for the remainder of the forecast.
One measure of increasing financial stress is the premium that private
borrowers have had to pay relative to the rates on 10-year government notes (see
Chart 1-8). This premium began rising around August of 2007. Rates on the
highest-quality corporate bonds have increased 170 basis points since August
2007. Rates on BAA-rated corporate borrowers have increased more than
400 basis points, while rates on high-risk (“junk”) bonds have skyrocketed.
Financial stress also became evident in other ways. The rate that international banks lend to each other (as measured by the London interbank
offered rate, LIBOR) soared to an unprecedented premium over Treasury
rates beginning in September. For 3-month maturities, this premium that
had averaged 114 basis points during the first 8 months of the year jumped
to 273 basis points in the second half of September and remained high in
October and November, but fell to 135 basis points by year-end. The Federal
Reserve’s survey of senior loan officers also shows a tightening of lending
standards for all private borrowers.
One consequence of the rising spreads for corporate debt is that the sharp
drop in the target Federal funds rate (from 5.25 percent in August 2007 to a
range of 0 to 0.25 percent in December 2008) has not translated into lower
rates for corporate borrowers. The rising rates for corporate bonds and the
troubled market for interbank lending means that two major channels for
monetary policy (lower interest rates to encourage investment and lower rates

Chapter 1  |  51

to boost consumer spending indirectly by raising the value of fixed income
and equity assets) are not working as they have in the past. Chapter 2 of this
Report discusses financial market developments in greater detail.
In view of how the stress in financial markets has interfered with the Federal
Reserve’s primary policy tool (the Federal funds rate), the Federal Reserve has
responded by developing a range of programs to provide liquidity to support
market functioning, thereby improving credit conditions for businesses
and households. These include programs to provide liquidity directly to
nondepository financial institutions (such as the Primary Dealer Credit
Facility and the Term Securities Lending Facility) and programs to support
the functioning of particular financial markets (such as the Asset-backed
Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the
Commercial Paper Funding Facility, and the Term Asset-Backed Securities
Loan Facility). These programs are allowed under section 13-3 of the Federal
Reserve Act, which authorizes the Federal Reserve banks to make secured
loans to entities under “unusual and exigent circumstances,” provided that
these entities are not able to secure funding from other banking institutions.
In addition, the Federal Reserve has announced programs to buy substantial
quantities of securities, including direct obligations of, and mortgage-backed

52  |  Economic Report of the President

securities issued by, the housing-related government-sponsored enterprises
(GSEs). The Federal Reserve has also indicated that it is evaluating the
potential benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities.

The Long-Term Outlook Through 2014
After 6 years, the expansion ended in December 2007, and real GDP fell in
the second half of 2008. Real consumer spending—a sector that constitutes
two-thirds of GDP—is in the process of reacting to the substantial declines
in wealth that began earlier in the year and cascaded in the fourth quarter.
As a result, the Administration projects that after recording modest growth
in the first half of 2008, real GDP contracted in the second half, with a sharp
decline in the fourth quarter. The contraction is projected to continue into
the first half of 2009, followed by a recovery in the second half of 2009 that
is expected to be led by the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. The
overall decline, from the second-quarter level of GDP to the quarter with
the lowest real GDP, is projected to slightly exceed the depth of the average
post–World War II recession. This pattern translates into a small decline
during the four quarters of 2008, followed by a small increase during 2009
(see Table 1-1). Reflecting the drop in real GDP, the unemployment rate is
projected to increase to an annual average rate of 7.7 percent in 2009. The
higher-than-normal level of slack is expected to put some downward pressure
on the rate of inflation. Overall CPI inflation is projected at 1.7 percent in
2009 and 2010, a rate that appears plausible in view of the 2.0 percent change
for the core CPI over the 12 months through November. Payroll employment
is projected to fall during 2009 before rebounding in 2010. The 2009
forecasts for real GDP and inflation are similar to the consensus forecasts for
those variables.
Downturns are eventually followed by recoveries, and historically the
strength of a recovery appears to be loosely correlated with the depth of the
preceding recession (see Chart 1‑9). Moreover, the slope of the regression line
in the scatter diagram indicates that—to the extent that a recession is deeper
than the average—most of the excess depth is offset within the first four
quarters of the recovery. During the 2 years following a recession, real GDP
growth has averaged almost 5 percent, similar to the recovery anticipated in
the Administration forecast for 2010 and 2011. The 5 percent growth rates
in 2010 and 2011 would lower the unemployment rate from its projected
2009 peak to 5  percent, the center of the range consistent with stable
inflation, in 2012.

Growth in GDP over the Long Term
The Administration forecast is based on a projection that sees the U.S.
economy fluctuating around a long-run potential rate of growth of 2.7 percent.
(Potential real GDP growth is a measure of the sustainable rate of growth of
productive capacity.) The path of real GDP growth in the current downturn
and projected recovery fluctuates around this long-term trend.
Over the next 6¼ years, real GDP growth is projected to increase
2.9 percent (see Table 1‑2), a growth rate that is faster than the 2.7 percent
long-term rate because the current level of the unemployment rate has considerable room to fall before the economy is again operating at its potential. Real
GDP growth in 2013 and 2014, at 2.7  percent, is almost identical to the
consensus projection of long-run growth.
The growth rate of the economy over the long run is determined by its
supply-side components, which include population, labor force participation,
the ratio of nonfarm business employment to household employment, the
length of the workweek, and labor productivity. The Administration’s forecast for the contribution of the growth rates of different supply-side factors to
real GDP growth is shown in Table 1-2.
Over the next 6 years, the working-age population (line 1) is projected
to grow 1.0  percent, the rate set in the Census Bureau’s newly revised
projection. The labor force participation rate (line 2), which edged down
at a 0.2  percent annual rate during the past 8 years, is expected to decline
even faster (0.3 percent per year) during the projection period. The further
projected deceleration is a consequence of the aging baby-boom generation (born between 1946 and 1962) entering their retirement years. For
example, the 1946 birth cohort reached the early-retirement age of 62 in
2008. Over long periods of time the employment rate (defined as 100 less the
unemployment rate) is usually stable, but the elevated jump-off level of the
unemployment rate makes room for some growth in this component (line 4).
The ratio of nonfarm business employment to household employment (line
6), which has accounted for a puzzling subtraction from real GDP growth
since 2001, is projected to edge down only slightly (0.1  percent per year)
over the projection interval. The workweek (line 8) is projected to edge up
slightly, in contrast to its general decline over the past 50 years. The slight
upward tilt is projected to be a labor market reaction to buffer labor supply
against the projected falling rates of labor force participation. Productivity
growth (line 10) is projected to grow 2.4  percent, our best estimate of the
trend rate of growth during the recent business cycle (accounting for some
measurement issues, as noted earlier). The ratio of real GDP to nonfarm
business (line 12) is expected to continue to subtract from overall growth as
it has over most long periods.

A Perspective on the Past Eight Years
The past 8 years began with a mild recession and then shifted into a
slow-growth recovery that only gradually gained momentum. Throughout the
first 7 years, consumer spending provided a solid base for economic growth,
and that base was fortified by housing investment. As residential construction
fell in 2006 and 2007, it was replaced by export growth as a major contributor
to overall GDP growth. In 2008, the combination of falling construction,
losses in housing-related securities, rising oil prices, and a falling stock market
eventually tipped the economy into recession. Inflation as measured by the
four-quarter change in the price index for GDP fluctuated between 1.6 and
3.5 percent, a fairly narrow range in a broad historical context.
The economy showed signs of slowing in 2000: the dot-com bust was
already underway, and GDP growth in the third quarter of 2000 was negative. In response to the incipient downturn, the Federal Reserve slashed its
target rate early in January 2001. The economy began to shed jobs steadily
56  |  Economic Report of the President

in March 2001. The Administration and Congress responded proactively
with EGTRRA (The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act
of 2001) which delivered about $36 billion of stimulus checks in 2001 and
phased in cuts in marginal tax rates over several years. The recession of 2001
was particularly severe in business investment, a demand component that
had been particularly strong in preceding years. Low interest rates during this
period boosted demand for housing and consumer durables, both of which
were substantially stronger than during an average recession. The recession
of 2001 was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of September 11, and several
widely publicized accounting scandals also contributed to the economic
uncertainty of the time. All told, however, the 2001 recession turned out to
be the shallowest of the post–World War II period (the most that real GDP
declined in a single quarter during the recession was 0.4 percent), with some
of the credit attributable to the quick action of monetary and fiscal policy.
The unemployment rate continued to rise following the official end of the
recession. To address the lagging recovery, the Administration and Congress
instituted JCWAA (the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act), which
allowed firms to expense 30  percent of their equipment investment and
extended unemployment compensation to laid-off workers, and JGTRRA
(the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act), which boosted the
expensing rate on investment to 50  percent and extended the duration of
this provision. JGTRRA also cut the tax rate on dividends and capital gains.
These Acts helped speed up economic growth soon after their implementation. The relative strength of the U.S. economy, evident in the demand
for imports and in foreigners’ desire to invest in the United States, helped
maintain world demand during this early-recovery period. It also resulted in
a large increase in the U.S. current account deficit.
Late in 2003, the economy shifted from a period of slow recovery to a
period of broad economic expansion, marked by a decline in the unemployment rate and rapid growth in economic activity. The recovery was led by
robust growth in consumer spending, equipment and software investment,
exports, and residential construction, and coincided with spectacular house
price appreciation. With the benefit of hindsight, house prices climbed too
high. As home prices began to recede beginning in early 2006, so did the
pace of housing starts. Housing starts continued to decline over the next
2½ years, eventually reaching an all-time low in November 2008.
During 2006 and 2007, rapid export growth and growth in investment of
nonresidential structures replaced residential investment as the main drivers
of aggregate demand. The economies of our trading partners, especially
those in developing countries, picked up and boosted the demand for our
exports—and also boosted the demand for petroleum. The rise in petroleum
prices, which moved up again toward the end of 2007, added to the cascade
of problems caused by falling house prices.
Chapter 1  |  57

Although growth slowed to a crawl in early 2008 and employment edged
down, fiscal stimulus and monetary policy actions held real GDP growth
in generally positive territory through the first half of the year. The sharp
declines in consumer spending in the third quarter and the stock market drop
in September and October finally confirmed that the decline was a recession.
Until the second half of 2008, the economy was resilient, weathering many
shocks including the 2001 recession, the terrorist attacks of September 11, some
widely publicized accounting scandals, and the 2005 and 2008 hurricanes. The
most damaging event was the decline in the housing market that began in early
2006. Even after the onset of the housing market decline, however, real GDP
growth remained positive until the fourth quarter of 2007.
The business-cycle expansion lasted 73 months, the fourth longest postWorld War II expansion. The growth rate of real GDP per labor force
participant averaged 1.5  percent at an annual rate from the business-cycle
peak in 2001 to the business-cycle peak in the fourth quarter of 2007,
identical to its average growth over the period from 1953 to 2001.

Conclusion
The economy was weakening as it entered 2008, but was temporarily
sustained at generally positive growth by the 2008 fiscal stimulus package
and monetary policy actions. Consumer spending declined sharply in the
third quarter, and mounting stress in financial markets reached a crescendo
in September, triggering a decline in stock market wealth that further reduced
consumer spending. Because of the large declines in wealth from September
to December, the saving rate is likely to rise in 2009, which will continue to
cause a decline or slow growth in consumer spending. The large September
to December declines in wealth imply that an upward movement of the saving
rate is likely in 2009, with further constraint on consumer spending as the
increase plays out. The monetary and financial agencies of the Government
have recently been particularly active with the Federal Reserve implementing
a variety of new programs to provide liquidity to financial institutions and
to support the functioning of financial markets. The Treasury, empowered
by the recently passed Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, has also been
active over this period and has strategically allocated funds to support financial sector solvency and liquidity (discussed in more detail in Chapter 2).
These vigorous measures are expected to increase confidence in the financial
sector over the next several months, leading to a rebound in output sometime
in 2009.

58  |  Economic Report of the President

Beyond the next few years, the economy is projected to settle into a steady
state in which real GDP grows at about 2.7  percent per year, the unemployment rate stays around the level consistent with stable inflation (about
5.0 percent) and inflation remains moderate and stable (about 2.1 percent on
the CPI). Economic forecasts are subject to error, and unforeseen positive
and negative developments will affect the course of the economy over the next
several years. Given the economy’s strong basic structure (that is, free mobility
of labor, relatively low taxes, and openness to trade), prospects for a resumption of steady growth in the years ahead remain good. Later chapters of this
Report explore how market-based reforms and pro-growth policies such as tax
reform and open commerce can enhance our economic performance.

Housing and Financial Markets

I

n the summer of 2008, the disruptions in credit markets that began in
2007 worsened to the point that the global financial system was in crisis.
The crisis was sparked by substantial declines in house prices, rising default
rates on residential mortgages, and a resulting sharp decline in the value of
mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, in part created by excesses in the
mortgage market. These assets were held by institutions that play a vital role
in the functioning of financial markets.
Many of those institutions were vulnerable to these losses because they
were highly levered and, in particular, were highly dependent on short-term
funding. In other words, those institutions had borrowed extensively against
their long-term assets, and a large part of their debt was short-term, so that
their existing debt needed to be paid off and replaced with new short-term
debt with some frequency. As their losses mounted, those firms attempted
to deleverage by selling assets or raising new capital. But several major firms
failed in these efforts, either because their losses made them fundamentally
insolvent or because their reliance on short-term funding did not give them
enough time and flexibility to strengthen their financial positions.
The failure and near-failure of these firms, combined with broad-based
declines in asset prices, including assets with little or no relationship to
the mortgage market, placed enormous stress on world financial markets.
Credit markets froze, and confidence in the financial system eroded. The
Federal Reserve and the Administration acted aggressively to restore stability
to the U.S. financial system; the Federal Reserve injected massive amounts
of liquidity into the markets through existing and new facilities, and the
Administration took several actions, including the creation of new authorities
under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA). These
unprecedented efforts laid the foundation for a recovery in credit markets.
The key points of this chapter are:
•	 The roots of the current global financial crisis began in the late 1990s.  
A rapid increase in saving by developing countries (sometimes called the
“global saving glut”) resulted in a large influx of capital to the United
States and other industrialized countries, driving down the return on
safe assets. The relatively low yield on safe assets likely encouraged investors to look for higher yields from riskier assets, whose yields also went
down. What turned out to be an underpricing of risk across a number of
markets (housing, commercial real estate, and leveraged buyouts, among

61

others) in the United States and abroad, and an uncertainty about how
this risk was distributed throughout the global financial system, set the
stage for subsequent financial distress.
•	 The influx of inexpensive capital helped finance a housing boom.  House
prices appreciated rapidly earlier in this decade, and building increased
to well-above historic levels. Eventually, house prices began to decline
with this glut in housing supply.
•	 Considerable innovations in housing finance—the growth of subprime
mortgages and the expansion of the market for assets backed by
mortgages—helped fuel the housing boom. Those innovations were
often beneficial, helping to make home ownership more affordable and
accessible, but excesses set the stage for later losses.
•	 The declining value of mortgage-related assets has had a disproportionate
effect on the financial sector because a large fraction of mortgage-related
assets are held by banks, investment banks, and other highly levered
financial institutions. The combination of leverage (the use of borrowed
funds) and, in particular, a reliance on short-term funding made these
institutions (both in the United States and abroad) vulnerable to large
mortgage losses.
•	 Vulnerable institutions failed, and others nearly failed.  The remaining
institutions pulled back from extending credit to each other, and interbank lending rates increased to unprecedented levels. The effects of
the crisis were most visible in the financial sector, but the impact and
consequences of the crisis are being felt by households, businesses, and
governments throughout the world.
•	 The U.S. Government has undertaken a historic effort to address the
underlying problems behind the freeze in the credit markets. These
problems, the subject of much of this chapter, are a sudden increase in
the desire for liquidity, a massive reassessment of risk, and a solvency
crisis for many systemically important institutions. The Government
has worked to preserve the stability of the overall financial system by
preventing the disorderly failures of important financial institutions;
taken unprecedented action to boost liquidity in short-term funding
markets; provided substantial new protections for consumers, businesses,
and investors; and cooperated closely with its international partners.
•	 Looking forward, the global financial crisis presents several additional
challenges for the U.S. Government. Among them are the need to
modernize financial regulation, unwind temporary programs in an
orderly fashion, and develop long-term solutions for the governmentsponsored enterprises (privately-owned, publicly-chartered entities)
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Origins of the Crisis
The roots of the global financial crisis can be traced back to before the
beginning of this decade and were, in part, caused by a rise in saving by
developing economies.

The Global Saving Glut
Countries in Asia and the Middle East started saving enormous sums in the
late 1990s. This increase in saving was primarily due to two factors. First, a
number of developing countries experienced financial crises in the 1990s. As
these crises abated, these countries began accumulating extensive savings as
a buffer against any future crises. Second, sharp increases in oil prices over
the past few years generated large revenues for oil exporters, including Russia,
Nigeria, Venezuela, and countries in the Middle East. With productive
economies and strong legal regimes, the United States and other industrialized countries attracted a good portion of that saving, and foreign investors
purchased low-risk assets such as Treasury bonds, debt issued by governmentsponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and mortgage-backed
securities, as well as riskier assets. From 1996 to 2007, industrialized
countries went from a current account surplus (recording a surplus in net
trade in goods and services, and net income and transfers from abroad) of
$14 billion to a current account deficit of almost $500 billion. At the same
time, developing countries went from a current account deficit of $82 billion
to a surplus of $760 billion.
As this influx of capital became available to fund investments, interest rates
fell broadly. The return on safe assets was notably low: the 10-year Treasury
rate ranged from only 3.1 percent to 5.3 percent from 2003 to 2007, whereas
the average rate over the preceding 40 years was 7.5 percent. While to some
extent the low rates reflected relatively benign inflation risk, the rate on risky
assets was even lower relative to its historical average: the rate on a 10-year
BAA investment-grade (medium-quality) bond ranged from only 5.6 percent
to 7.5 percent from 2003 to 2007, whereas the average over the preceding
40 years was 9.3 percent. The net effect was a dramatic narrowing of credit
spreads. A credit spread measures the difference between the yield on a risky
asset, such as a corporate bond, and the yield on a riskless asset, such as a
Treasury bond, with a similar maturity. Risky assets pay a premium for a
number of reasons, including liquidity risk (the risk that it will be difficult to
sell at an expected price in a timely manner) and default risk (the risk that a
borrower will be unable to make timely principal and interest payments).
Credit spreads declined as these premiums shrank. From 2003 to
mid-2007, for example, credit spreads on junk bonds fell by 5.5 percentage

Chapter 2  |  63

points, to a historical low of 2.4 percent. Credit spreads on AAA (highquality) and BAA investment-grade bonds also fell over this time period.
(See Chart 1-9 in Chapter 1.) While some market participants may have
argued that declining credit spreads reflected an actual decline in the level
of risk, we see in hindsight that many of these assets continued to be quite
risky. Declining spreads reflected, at least in part, a temporary increase in
demand for risky but higher-yielding assets. The underpricing of risk across
a number of markets—including housing, commercial real estate, and leveraged buyouts—in the United States and abroad set the stage for a subsequent
financial crisis.

The Global Credit Boom and the Housing Market
The underpricing of risk made loans readily available to borrowers,
especially to riskier borrowers, and gave rise to a global credit boom. At
the epicenter of the global credit boom was the U.S. residential housing
market. During the credit boom, the ease of credit financing encouraged
rapid increases in demand for housing, leading to extraordinary house price
increases. According to the S&P/Case-Shiller National Index, house prices
increased by 11 percent in 2002, 11 percent in 2003, 15 percent in 2004,
and 15 percent in 2005—stunning rates by historical standards. The Federal
Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) purchase-only price index, which covers
only homes purchased with conforming mortgages (that is, it excludes
both subprime and large “jumbo” mortgages), rose more moderately but
still climbed an impressive 9 percent in 2004 and 9 percent in 2005 (see
Chart 2-1).
Measures of long-term balance in the housing market, such as the ratio
of home prices to rents, reached record highs over this period. The components of this ratio are shown in Chart 2-1. As home prices rose much faster
than rents after 2000, the ratio (not shown) of the two lines climbed beyond
its historical range. This ratio had remained relatively stable from 1982 to
1999, but as house prices began to climb, the ratio of prices to rents soared
to unprecedented heights, suggesting that owner-occupied housing became
more expensive relative to rental housing.
In addition to expanded credit availability, the price increases reflected a
number of other factors, such as income growth and extremely optimistic
expectations about future house price gains. All of these factors likely
increased demand for housing, which put upward pressure on house prices.
Dramatic house price increases encouraged well-above-average residential
investment and a decline in underwriting standards in the mortgage market.

64  |  Economic Report of the President

Excesses in the Primary Mortgage Market
Over the past decade, there has been tremendous innovation and expansion
in the market in which borrowers obtained loans from mortgage originators,
also known as the primary mortgage market. Some innovation was beneficial,
increasing mortgage affordability and structuring payment terms that fit
borrowers’ individual circumstances. For example, the increase in subprime
lending, defined as lending to higher-risk groups, usually at interest rates
high enough to imply a large risk premium, opened up new opportunities
for borrowers with weaker or limited credit histories to purchase a home.
Subprime lending expands access to credit to previously underserved households—albeit at restrictive and expensive terms.
The very competitive lending environment encouraged and intensified
myopia among both lenders and borrowers, both of whom took on too
much risk. For example, both likely assumed that risky mortgages could
be easily refinanced or that homes could be easily sold if borrowers found
themselves unable to afford their mortgage payments. Underwriting
standards were loosened, even for subprime borrowers, and terms became
less restrictive. In some cases, down payment requirements were relaxed
to the point that borrowers’ mortgages were greater than the value of their

Chapter 2  |  65

homes, as apparently both lenders and borrowers expected near-term house
price appreciation. Furthermore, increasing numbers of mortgage loans were
originated with limited documentation; that is, the mortgage lenders did not
require borrowers to provide evidence (such as previous years’ tax returns) of
income or assets to affirm their ability to repay the loans.
Products appropriate for a limited group of borrowers were also offered
to borrowers for whom these products were not well suited. For example,
payment-option adjustable-rate mortgages (“option ARMs”), which allow
monthly mortgage payments to vary so that the payment may cover only the
interest owed or some of the principal owed as well, were initially targeted
to borrowers with variable income, such as the self employed. Most option
ARMs allowed minimum monthly payments below accrued interest so that
borrowers choosing to make the minimum payment would have negative
amortization, or rising loan balances. During the credit boom, option ARMs
were offered to a much broader class of borrowers as a way of stretching loan
affordability.

Excesses in the Market for Mortgage-Related Assets
Other developments helped set the stage for mortgage defaults. The rise
of mortgage securitization, led both by government-sponsored enterprises
(GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as private institutions, reduced
the incentive for originators (which increasingly included non-bank mortgage
specialists) to properly evaluate risk.
For many years, lenders followed an “originate-to-hold” model in which
they kept the loans they originated. Securitization allowed lenders to move to
an “originate-to-distribute” model by transforming collections of individual
mortgages into mortgage-backed securities (MBS)—tradable securities backed
by the loans—and selling the MBS to other investors. (Box 2-1 defines
“mortgage-backed securities” and other financial terms.) Lenders that sold
MBS used the cash to originate more loans and create new MBS, benefiting
themselves as well as borrowers and investors. Securitization under the
originate-to-distribute model seemed to work well. Borrowers benefited from
lower mortgage rates, and investors benefited from being able to diversify
their investments across a wider set of assets.
Lost in the frenzy of lending, borrowing, and securitization was the fact that
the benefits of securitization come with a cost. In an originate-to-hold model,
the loan originator will lose if the borrower defaults, and so the originator has
the incentive to gather information on the borrower to be sure the borrower
can afford to pay the mortgage. In contrast, in an originate-to-distribute
model, the private-label MBS investor, not the originator, bears the default
risk. Because originators do not expect to bear the risk, they do not have as
much incentive to make sure the borrowers can pay. Moreover, the incentive
for lenders to originate excessively risky loans becomes tempting. Because

Box 2-1: Definitions of Select Financial Terms
Asset-backed security (ABS): A security whose cash flows are backed
by the principal and interest payments of a collection of loans, such as
credit cards, automobile loans, and student loans.
Auction rate security (ARS): A long-term debt instrument whose
interest rate is reset periodically (typically every 7, 28, or 35 days)
through an auction process.
Collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO): A complex mortgage-backed
security in which cash flows from the mortgage payments are split into
tranches (slices), and each tranche is sold as a separate security.
Commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS): A mortgage-backed
security backed by mortgages on commercial property.
Commercial paper (CP): Short-term loans issued by corporations.
CP terms range from 1 day (“overnight”) to 270 days. Asset-backed
commercial paper (ABCP) is commercial paper that is secured by assets.
Commercial paper can be issued by financial institutions as well as nonfinancial institutions.
Government-sponsored enterprise mortgage-backed security (GSE
MBS): A mortgage-backed security that includes a credit guarantee from
a government-sponsored enterprise (Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac).
London interbank offered rate (LIBOR): The interest rate at which
banks offer to lend unsecured funds to other banks. The 3-month LIBOR,
the rate at which banks offer to lend for a 3-month term, is a key reference rate used for many financial contracts.
Mortgage-backed security (MBS): security whose cash flows are
backed by the principal and interest payments of a collection of mortgage loans.
Mortgage-related asset: Any original mortgage loan or MBS.
Non-agency mortgage-backed security (non-agency MBS): A mortgage-backed security that does not include a credit guarantee from a
government agency or government-sponsored enterprise. Also known
as private-label MBS.
Residential mortgage-backed security (RMBS): A mortgage-backed
security backed by mortgages on residential property.
Secured debt: A loan that is backed by collateral. If the borrower
defaults on repayment, the lender can seize the collateral, sell it, and use
the proceeds to repay the debt.
TED spread: The difference between the 3-month LIBOR and the
3-month Treasury Bill rate, a commonly used indicator of financial
market distress.
Unsecured debt: A loan that is not backed by collateral. The loan is
supported only by the borrower’s creditworthiness.

Chapter 2  |  67

MBS are complex securities, many investors relied on credit rating agencies
to provide them with information on default risk rather than conducting
their own due diligence. For their part, credit rating agencies made initial
assessments that, in hindsight, used faulty assumptions and led to a significant
number of downgrades. To their detriment, many market participants relied
heavily on ratings that turned out to be overly optimistic.
Chart 2-2 shows the fraction of total mortgages outstanding that are
securitized by private institutions (private-label MBS) as well as the share of
total mortgage originations accounted for by subprime mortgages. Data on
subprime mortgages have a limited history, which is perhaps not surprising
given how recently this market became important. While a number of factors
led to the surge in subprime lending, the increase in privately-issued MBS, and
the increase in securitization more generally, likely played an important role.
Mortgage-backed securities were often repackaged into even more complex
securities, reflecting an increased demand from investors for customized
investment products called structured products. A collateralized mortgage
obligation (CMO), for example, is a mortgage-backed security in which cash
flows from the mortgage payments are ordered into “tranches” (slices), and
each tranche is sold as a separate security. The tranches are typically ranked in
descending order of repayment from highest (super senior) to lowest (equity).
Senior tranches have a priority claim on the cash flow from the underlying

68  |  Economic Report of the President

collateral and must be paid before junior tranches. The middle tranches of a
CMO could be repackaged yet again into even more complex securities.
A combination of overreliance on credit rating agencies’ assessments of
complex securities and flaws in the assumptions underlying those assessments,
along with insufficient risk management at financial firms and regulatory
policies that failed to mitigate risk-management weaknesses, created a situation in which many financial firms held mortgage-related assets that turned
out to be far more risky than anticipated.

The Credit Crunch
Eventually, the number of houses on the market began rising faster than
sales, and prices started to fall. Nationally, home price appreciation began
to slow in 2005, and price levels began to fall in the third quarter of 2007,
according to the FHFA purchase-only house price index. In some mortgage
markets and in some regions, prices began their decline a year before the
national average. The inventory of new homes for sale rose rapidly relative
to the pace of new home sales, contributing to price declines. The residential
construction industry reacted to a decline in housing demand, and by 2006,
this sector experienced job losses as new housing starts plunged (Chart 2-3).

Chapter 2  |  69

As house prices faltered, borrowers with little or no equity in their homes
quickly found that they owed more to lenders than their homes were now
worth in the market. Such borrowers are often referred to as being “underwater.” Some borrowers were unable to afford their mortgage payments either
because of financial circumstances or because their mortgage payments rose,
as their mortgage contract included a sizable increase in monthly payments
over the life of the loan. If these borrowers were also underwater, they were
not able to refinance, making them likely to default. In fact, among subprime
loans that were securitized in the second half of 2006, over 7 percent of these
loans were at least 60 days past due within the first 6 months, exposing the
weakening in underwriting standards over time and the effect of house prices
faltering. By way of comparison, among subprime loans securitized in the
first half of 2005, less than 3 percent of these loans were at least 60 days past
due within the first 6 months.
Chart 2-4 shows that the rates of serious delinquency (defined as 90 days
past due or in default) for both prime and subprime mortgages have risen
since 2005. Rates for both fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) and adjustable-rate
mortgages (ARMs) have increased. Delinquency rates are considerably higher
in the subprime market than in the prime market; however, rates of serious
delinquency in both the subprime and prime mortgage markets have reached
their highest levels since the Mortgage Bankers Association began collecting
these data in 1979.

70  |  Economic Report of the President

Lenders and investors that held mortgages and mortgage-backed securities,
particularly risky subprime mortgages, incurred losses as default rates rose.
Lenders demanded higher risk premiums in the form of higher mortgage
spreads (mortgage interest rates charged in excess of long-term Treasury
rates), and the supply of mortgage credit—at any given spread—decreased.
In fact, new subprime lending began to dry up altogether beginning in 2007.
With the unexpected increase in default rates, the value of the mortgages
declined, and uncertainty over the future value of the complex securities that
were backed by, or derived from, these mortgages increased. Demand for
mortgage-related assets plummeted, particularly for subprime mortgages held
as whole loans (original mortgage loans) and non-agency mortgage-backed
securities for which uncertainty was the greatest. As a result, the market price
for these assets fell dramatically.
Mortgage-related assets are very widely held. Domestic and international
banks hold about three-fourths of the whole loans held outside of the GSEs,
and banks hold about one-half of mortgage-related securities held outside
of the GSEs. Insurance companies hold some whole loans and hold almost
one-fourth of mortgage-related securities. Pensions and hedge funds also
have substantial positions in mortgage-related securities. As of the end of
2008, global financial institutions that invested in these assets reported over
$1 trillion in losses.

Leverage and Reliance on Short-Term Funds
The declining value of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities threatened
the ability of systemically important financial institutions to meet their
financial obligations (that is, their “solvency”) because portions of the
financial system are highly exposed to shocks. That exposure takes two basic
forms: high leverage and reliance on short-term funding. Leverage is the use of
borrowed funds (debt), as opposed to investment capital (equity), to finance
assets. Short-term funding is the use of debt financing that must be paid back
within a short period of time.
Before the financial crisis, the major investment banks were levered roughly
25 to 1. This means that every $100 in assets was funded by $96 in debt,
leaving only $4 in equity. In other words, investment banks owned complex
investment portfolios with only 4 percent down. Such leverage was a fundamental source of fragility—the capital base of those institutions would be
eliminated by just a 4 percent decline in asset values. (Commercial banks, in
contrast, were levered about 12 to 1.)
In addition, many major financial firms rely on short-term funding,
requiring them to continually replace existing debt with new debt (a process
called “rolling over” debt) and thereby putting them at the mercy of changes
in the availability of liquidity. Put another way, if a bank is levered using
Chapter 2  |  71

long-term debt, it can survive as long as it can make debt service payments;
if a bank is levered using short-term debt, it has to pay off the entire debt
every few weeks, which it typically does by taking out new short-term debt.
During the credit boom, liquidity was easily available, and firms could roll
over enough debt to satisfy their short-term funding needs. Firms began to
rely even more heavily on short-term debt and created financial innovations,
such as auction rate securities (ARS) and structured investment vehicles
(SIVs), to address those demands. But, when doubts arose about the availability of liquidity, those financing methods broke down, and firms faced a
considerable risk of not being able to roll over their financing.
The collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008 provides an example of how
high leverage, combined with a heavy reliance on short-term term funding,
can make a financial institution more fragile than it ought to be. In 2007,
Bear Stearns was one of the largest global investment banks. Bear Stearns’s
assets were highly concentrated in mortgage-backed securities. In fact, two
of Bear Stearns’s managed hedge funds collapsed in June 2007 because of
subprime mortgage losses.
During the week of March 10, 2008, rumors spread about liquidity
problems at Bear Stearns, resulting in a “run.” As the rumors spread, Bear
Stearns was unable to borrow funds from other financial institutions, despite
the fact that Bear Stearns pledged high-quality financial assets as collateral
to secure repayment of many of its short-term loans. In a secured funding
arrangement, the borrower agrees to forfeit the collateral if it defaults on the
loan. However, possibly because the legal process of transferring ownership
of collateral is quite lengthy, many of Bear Stearns’s secured lenders refused
to continue (“roll over”) their short-term lending arrangements. As a result,
Bear Stearns could not meet its short-term funding needs.
On Friday, March 14, 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
(FRBNY) provided emergency funding to Bear Stearns. However, the
FRBNY funding could not stop Bear Stearns’s downward spiral, and Bear
Stearns concluded that it would need to file for bankruptcy protection,
unless another firm purchased it. On Sunday, March 16, 2008, Bear Stearns
announced that it would be acquired by JP Morgan Chase, with financing
support from the FRBNY.

Macroeconomic Consequences of the Crisis
The effects of the crises in the housing and financial markets were most
visible for Wall Street firms like Bear Stearns, but their impact has been felt
by businesses, consumers, and governments throughout the world. The

72  |  Economic Report of the President

precipitous drop in the stock market has drastically eroded the value of
Americans’ stock portfolios, 401(k) accounts, and other retirement accounts.
The tightening of credit has made it more expensive and difficult for many
families to borrow money for cars, homes, and college tuition. Many healthy
businesses have found it harder to get loans to expand their operations and
to create jobs.

Banks Reduced Lending to Consumers and Businesses
As default rates for household debt rose, lenders became increasingly
reluctant to make any but the least risky loans. Many banks and other
creditors tightened standards on mortgages and consumer debt. The Federal
Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer Survey on Bank Lending Practices reports
changes in the supply of bank loans to businesses and households. As Chart
2-5 shows, the net percent of domestic lending institutions reporting that
they tightened lending standards began rising at the end of 2007. Tighter
standards reduce the availability of credit for households and, as a result,
hinder households’ ability to maintain spending in difficult economic times.

Chapter 2  |  73

Similar survey responses on banks’ standards for commercial and industrial
loans show that banks tightened lending standards for business loans starting
in mid-2007. The weakness in the business sector seen in business investment and outlays reflects, in part, this reduced access to credit from banks
and other lenders, forcing businesses to tap cash reserves to fund investment
and expenditures.

The Onset of the Crisis
Within a 9-day period in September 2008, the crisis deepened abruptly
with a series of stunning events. On Sunday, September 7, 2008, the Federal
Housing Finance Authority (FHFA) placed the ailing mortgage giants Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship because the FHFA determined
that the values of Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s mortgage-related assets
had deteriorated to the point that these institutions could no longer operate
safely and soundly. Conservatorship gave the FHFA powers typically
associated with Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s directors, officers, and shareholders, including all actions necessary and appropriate to put each company
in a sound and solvent condition, carry on each company’s business, and
conserve the property and assets of each company. In addition to the FHFA
conservatorship, the Treasury Department entered into commitments to
inject up to $100 billion in capital into each firm in exchange for preferred
stock and warrants (options to buy equity shares at a predetermined price)
for common stock, created a temporary lending facility to provide secured
funding for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in exchange for governmentsponsored enterprise mortgage-backed security (GSE MBS) collateral, and
initiated a program to purchase GSE MBS in the open market.
One week later, on Sunday, September 14, 2008, the investment bank
Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, and another investment bank, Merrill
Lynch, negotiated an acquisition by Bank of America. Both investment
banks suffered billions of dollars of writedowns (losses from declines in value)
of mortgage-related assets.
Two days later, on Tuesday, September 16, 2008, the Federal Reserve
announced the creation of a credit facility (lending arrangement) in exchange
for a majority equity stake in the insurance giant American International
Group (AIG). AIG suffered billions of dollars of losses from entering into
credit default swap (CDS) contracts to insure against losses on complex MBS.
A credit default swap is a type of derivative contract that has become very
popular in recent years. The value of a CDS contract is “derived from” an
underlying credit instrument, such as a bond or an MBS, where one party—
say a borrower—owes money to another party. The buyer of a CDS contract
agrees to make a series of payments (similar to an insurance premium) to

74  |  Economic Report of the President

the seller over time. If the borrower who owes money according to the
underlying credit instrument defaults, the seller of the CDS agrees to make a
pre-specified payoff to the buyer. Essentially, the buyer of the CDS has taken
out insurance on the default risk of a credit instrument, and the seller of the
CDS is the insurance provider.
In the case of AIG, most of its CDS counterparties were banks that bought
CDS contracts because they wanted to hedge against declines in the MBS
held on their balance sheets. Contractual features in AIG’s CDS required
AIG to post cash collateral to their counterparties as the values of the MBS
declined. The collateral calls were so large that AIG did not have the cash to
post, and AIG faced a liquidity crisis. The increased burden to honor CDS
contracts also undermined AIG’s solvency.

Credit Market Investors Reduced Lending to Businesses
Following these events, reassessments of risk led to a flight to quality.
This flight to quality extended beyond mortgage-related assets and affected
a number of non-bank institutions and assets that businesses use to pledge
as collateral for secured funding. For long-term debt funding (and equity
funding), businesses rely on capital markets, where mutual funds, hedge
funds, and pension funds, for example, invest in long-term bonds issued
by corporations and State and local governments. For short-term funding,
businesses rely on the money market. An important source of lending in the
short-term credit markets are money market mutual funds (or money funds),
which often invest in instruments called “paper.” Commercial paper (CP)
is short-term funding used by corporations, and it is often issued as assetbacked commercial paper (ABCP), which is secured by collateral. Other
money market instruments include Treasury bills and repurchase agreements
(or repos), where a borrower agrees to sell securities to a lender for cash and
simultaneously agrees to buy back those securities at a later date at a higher
price. A repo is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer/lender
receiving securities as collateral to protect against default.
As lenders sacrificed yield for the safety of Treasury securities, interbank
lending rates rose to unprecedented levels. Financial institutions pulled back
from extending credit to each other, except at the very shortest maturities,
because of an aversion to counterparty risk or concerns about their own
liquidity needs. As shown in Chart 2-6, the TED spread increased dramatically in September 2008 above already elevated levels. The TED spread is
the difference between the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
and the 3-month Treasury Bill rate. LIBOR is the rate at which banks offer
unsecured loans to other banks. The dramatic increase in the TED spread
indicates considerable distress in interbank lending.

Chapter 2  |  75

When large financial institutions faced perceptions of insolvency, creditors
became less willing to lend to them, even in the very short term. Companies
that relied on what had been perceived as low-risk secured funding, such as
ABCP and repos, were also affected by the freeze in lending. Left unchecked,
the progression would have led to “runs.” Institutions that were not able to
obtain funding due to perceptions of insolvency would have faced a liquidity
crisis. Without the ability to roll over their short-term debt, institutions that
relied heavily on short-term financing would have to sell their assets at “fire
sale” prices to meet their financial obligations. Such actions can lead to an
actual (rather than perceived) insolvency crisis, which would likely have led
to widespread financial and economic failure.
Money funds themselves can face a run if investors lose confidence in the
fund’s ability to protect them from a loss of principal. Principal protection
is most visible in the fact that money funds seek to maintain a stable $1.00
net asset value (NAV). While money funds are required by law to invest in
short-term low-risk securities, investment losses are possible. In September
2008, money market funds that had invested in Lehman Brothers commercial paper faced losses when Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. Over
time, investment gains in other securities held in the diversified portfolios of

76  |  Economic Report of the President

money funds are usually big enough to offset the rare loss in an individual
security. However, if an increase in investor anxiety causes a run in the form
of large-scale redemptions, the money fund may be forced to liquidate other
assets at below-market prices. If that happens, the fund may be unable to
support a $1.00 NAV and thus “break the buck.”

The Effect of the Crisis on the Non-Financial Economy
The financial crisis spread beyond financial institutions. It also affected
households and non-financial businesses in the non-financial (“real”)
economy.

The Effect of the Crisis on Households
The financial crisis has affected households through a number of channels,
including a sharp loss in stock market wealth (as discussed in Chapter 1),
a further tightening in household credit markets, prospects for a slower
recovery in the housing market, and increased pessimism regarding current
and future economic conditions.
In the wake of the financial crisis, banks also began to further restrict
households’ access to credit. As mentioned earlier and shown in Chart 2-5,
banks began tightening standards on household loans by the end of 2007.
As the financial crisis deepened in September 2008, credit became even more
expensive and less available. For example, interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate
mortgages rose 0.7 percentage point by the end of October 2008 from their
September weekly low of 5.8 percent. Continued tightness in mortgage
credit markets could reduce demand for housing and could slow the recovery
in this market.
Chart 2-7 shows measures of consumer confidence from both the Reuters/
University of Michigan survey and the Conference Board survey, which
reveal substantial pessimism among consumers in the recent data. In fact,
in October 2008 the Conference Board measure of confidence reached the
lowest level ever seen in the index’s 51-year history.

The Effect of the Crisis on Businesses
The financial crisis has also affected non-financial businesses through a
number of channels, including a tightening in business credit markets and
weaker demand both domestically and abroad. As mentioned above, businesses on the whole have had a difficult time raising funds in private debt and
equity markets because of more expensive financing terms and reduced access.
As a result, businesses’ ability to finance ongoing operations, to invest, and to
increase hiring has been curtailed, particularly beginning in the fall of 2008.

Chapter 2  |  77

However, businesses have also reduced their demand for funds to expand
operations. As consumer demand has weakened, businesses have become less
willing to make investments to expand production. In addition, the crisis
in credit markets has made it more difficult for consumers to finance some
purchases, especially of “big ticket” durable goods such as automobiles. These
difficulties result from disruptions in the market for asset-backed securities
(ABS). Like mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities are tradable
financial instruments that are backed by pools of individual loans—in this
case, consumer loans. Since the financial crisis deepened in the fall of 2008,
the demand for ABS has notably declined. These consumer credit market
disruptions have led to a decline in consumer purchasing that has further
reduced business demand for credit.
Businesses also have faced weaker demand abroad as the financial crisis has
worsened the outlook for global economic growth. As a result of all these
factors, business confidence has fallen notably since the fall of 2008.

Policy Responses to the Crisis
The global financial crisis is massive in scale and far-reaching in scope. The
complexity of the financial system, as well as the financial instruments that
are traded in various markets, has meant that the Government has had to take
many new and drastic actions very quickly to limit further turmoil. While
many different responses have been undertaken by different Government
agencies, all of the responses have been designed to achieve the overarching
goals of preserving the stability of financial institutions and boosting liquidity
in financial markets.

Policy Responses in 2007
After the disruption in credit markets in the summer of 2007, the
Administration and the Federal Reserve responded through a series of coordinated actions aimed at providing liquidity to financial markets and stabilizing
housing markets. In the second half of 2007, for example, the Federal
Reserve lowered interest rates and injected liquidity into financial markets by
taking the following steps:
•	 Lowering the target for the Federal Funds rate (the interest rate at which
U.S. banks lend to other banks overnight) by a total of 1 percentage
point between September 2007 and December 2007 to reduce banks’
funding costs.
•	 Expanding the Federal Reserve’s lending through the discount window
(the lending facility of last resort for depository institutions such as
banks) to provide term financing for periods as long as 90 days, and
establishing a Term Auction Facility (TAF) to further increase the availability of liquidity for depository institutions. Longer financing terms
allow borrowers to roll over debt less frequently.
•	 Establishing reciprocal currency arrangements (“swap lines”) with the
European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to
facilitate those banks’ provision of dollar liquidity to institutions in their
jurisdictions.
The Administration also took several steps to address difficulties in the
housing market:
•	 In August 2007, the Administration launched a new program at the
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) called FHASecure. The FHA
insures (but does not originate) mortgages for qualified low- and
moderate-income borrowers who have less-than-perfect credit and little
savings for a down payment. The FHASecure initiative offers homeowners who have adjustable-rate mortgages, current or delinquent, the
ability to refinance into a fixed-rate FHA-insured mortgage.

Chapter 2  |  79

•	 In August 2007, the Administration repeated its call for Congress to
pass a reform package for the GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Congress ultimately passed the Housing and Economic Recovery Act
of 2008 (HERA) in July 2008 to strengthen the regulator charged with
overseeing the GSEs.
•	 In October 2007, HOPE NOW, a private sector alliance of mortgage
industry participants, was launched to encourage servicers, housing
counselors, and investors to work together to help streamline the process
of modifying mortgages for borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages
who can afford their current mortgage payments but will have trouble
when their interest rates rise.

Policy Responses in 2008
As the crisis worsened over the course of 2008, the Administration and
the Federal Reserve took additional and extraordinary steps to prevent
systemwide failures in financial markets, provide protections for households’
savings, and encourage the renegotiations of mortgages to prevent unnecessary
foreclosures.

Intervention in Troubled Institutions
The Government has focused on preserving the stability of the overall
financial system and acted to prevent disorderly failures of several large, interconnected firms—and did so in a way that protects taxpayers. For example,
the failure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would have materially exacerbated financial market turmoil and added to the disruptions in the mortgage
market, putting more downward pressure on house prices. Examples of interventions in other troubled institutions are discussed above.

Injecting Liquidity
The Government has taken unprecedented action to inject liquidity—
the grease that keeps the gears of the financial system turning. The Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has temporarily guaranteed most
new unsecured debt issued by insured banks; that is, the FDIC has agreed to
make scheduled principal and interest payments in the event the issuer fails to
make those payments. As a result, banks have found it easier to borrow.
The Federal Reserve has used a variety of tools to inject hundreds of billions
of dollars in new liquidity into the financial system. The Federal Reserve has
expanded the availability of term financing provided to depository institutions through the discount window and the Term Auction Facility (TAF).
To support the liquidity of primary dealers, the Federal Reserve expanded
its securities lending program by broadening the securities that can be used
as collateral as well as extending the terms of the loans. More information
80  |  Economic Report of the President

on the securities lending program is on the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York’s website. In addition, the Federal Reserve established a Primary Dealer
Credit Facility (PDCF) to meet the short-term funding needs of primary
dealers, which are banks and securities broker-dealers that are authorized
to trade directly with the Federal Reserve. Over the course of 2008, the
Federal Reserve further reduced the target for the Federal Funds rate by over
4 percentage points. Moreover, it expanded its swap lines with foreign central
banks and established a number of special programs designed to address
strains in financial markets, including facilities structured to provide support
to money market mutual funds, the commercial paper market, and the assetbacked securities markets.

Protecting Consumers, Businesses, and Investors
The Government has provided substantial new protections for consumers,
businesses, and investors. The FDIC has temporarily expanded the amount
of money insured in bank and thrift checking accounts, savings accounts,
and certificates of deposit from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. The
FDIC has also temporarily removed insurance limits for non-interest-bearing
transaction accounts, which are used by many small businesses to finance
daily operations. The Treasury has offered temporary government insurance
for money market mutual funds. The Securities and Exchange Commission
is vigorously investigating fraud, manipulation, and abuse in the securities
markets, with an emphasis on abusive practices involving “short sales” (see
Box 2-2). The programs being undertaken by Federal agencies are aimed at
providing greater stability for the financial system.
Box 2-2: Short Sales
A short sale involves the sale of a stock by an investor who does
not own it. To deliver the stock to the purchaser, the short seller must
borrow the stock from a broker or from another investor. Later, the
short seller closes out the position by purchasing the stock on the open
market. Short sales are profitable if the stock price declines, because the
short seller can buy the stock at the lower price. But if the price rises,
the short seller will need to buy the stock at a higher price and, therefore,
incur a loss.
Short sales are a part of many useful investment and trading strategies. Short sales are valuable to an investor who believes that the stock
price will fall because the stock is overvalued. In this case, the short sale
is used in the same way that an investor who believes that a security
is currently undervalued will buy the stock. Short sales can be used
continued on the next page

Chapter 2  |  81

Box 2-2 — continued
by market-makers in response to buyer demand for a stock that they
do not currently own. Market-makers provide liquidity to other market
participants by quoting buying prices (bids) and selling prices (asks) on
stocks. They hope to profit on the difference, or spread, between the bid
and ask prices, rather than on any price movement. Thus, short sales
provide the market with an important benefit—liquidity. Short sales also
provide the market with a second benefit—pricing efficiency—because
efficient markets are characterized by prices that fully reflect both buying
and selling interests.
Although short selling serves useful market purposes, in some rare
instances it may be used to illegally manipulate stock prices (just as
stock purchases may, in rare instances, be used to manipulate stock
prices). One example is the “bear raid” in which a trader engages in
heavy short selling in an attempt to drive down prices in the hope of triggering a cascade of sell orders from others that depresses prices further.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the primary overseer
of U.S. securities markets, has promulgated many rules to prevent
stock price manipulation and has aggressively pursued abusive shortselling practices that involve insider trading and other federal securities
law violations.
At the same time, the SEC has adopted a balanced approach in pursuit
of its mission to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient
markets; and facilitate capital formation. For example, the SEC has
suspended short sale price restriction rules (for example, the uptick rule,
which requires that a short sale must occur at a price above the most
recent different transaction price) after carefully considering the solid
empirical evidence based on research conducted by the SEC and independent academic economists that shows that the purported benefits
of the rules no longer justify the costs. Also, the SEC has enacted rules
that govern short sales immediately before stock offerings in an effort to
maintain the integrity of the capital-raising process.

Stabilizing the Housing Market
The Administration continued its efforts to mitigate effects of the declining
housing market and to help responsible homeowners in danger of defaulting
on their mortgages. The FHA has provided countercyclical support for
the mortgage market as conventional financing has partly withdrawn from
the market. Between the time FHASecure was launched in August 2007
and December 2008, FHA helped more than 450,000 families, many of
whom were facing the loss of their homes, refinance into a more affordable
FHA-insured mortgage. In the midst of all of this, the FHA has been a leader
82  |  Economic Report of the President

in contacting FHA-insured homeowners in trouble to work out solutions. In
2008, FHA servicers completed more than 100,000 loss-mitigation actions.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) also launched
the Neighborhood Stabilization Program in September 2008, which provides
emergency assistance to State and local governments to acquire and redevelop
foreclosed properties that might otherwise be abandoned and become blight.
In September 2008, the Treasury began purchasing GSE MBS and related
products to support the mortgage financing market, as authorized by the
Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA). More recently, the
Federal Reserve announced its intentions to purchase large volumes of agency
debt and MBS backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae (a
government-owned corporation within HUD) in an effort to lower mortgage
rates and increase the availability of mortgage credit.
In October 2008, additional mortgage assistance for homeowners at risk
of foreclosure was introduced. The HOPE for Homeowners program, also
authorized by HERA, refinances mortgages for borrowers who are having
difficulty making their payments but can afford a new fixed-rate mortgage
insured by the FHA. That refinancing is available, however, only if lenders
are willing to write down the existing mortgage to below the new appraised
value of the home, creating home equity for a borrower who may have
been underwater. Some lenders may be willing to do so in order to avoid
foreclosures that might be even costlier. In return, the borrower agrees to
share the equity created at the beginning of this new mortgage and any future
appreciation in the value of the home if the home is sold or refinanced.
Unfortunately, some limitations of the program that were written into
the law have limited the program’s flexibility and made it less attractive to
participants than it otherwise might be.
The HOPE NOW Alliance launched a new program in November 2008
that will make it easier and faster for the most at-risk homeowners to modify
their mortgages and stay in their homes. The Streamlined Modification Plan
expands upon the existing efforts of many lenders. Under the plan, lenders
use an expedited process to modify, or restructure, a mortgage so that the
homeowner can afford the monthly payments. The streamlined process will
apply to at-risk borrowers who are at least 90 days late on their existing mortgages and whose loans are owned by a lender or servicer in the HOPE NOW
alliance or are owned by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. The Streamlined
Modification Plan also applies to all mortgage types.
In November 2008, HUD published a final rule reforming the regulations
for the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) to simplify the
mortgage settlement process and improve consumers’ ability to knowledgeably
shop for mortgage loans. Included in the RESPA reform, which will become
fully effective in January 2010, is a new uniform Good Faith Estimate (GFE)
form that will inform borrowers of the charges they should expect at loan
Chapter 2  |  83

settlement and identify key features of the loan being offered, including
whether the interest rate, monthly amount owed, and loan balance can rise,
and if so, by how much. These disclosures will inform borrowers about
potentially risky features of loan offers and vastly improve consumers’ ability
to compare loan offers, which should lead to improved loan terms and lower
origination fees.

International Cooperation
The United States has also been at the forefront of a number of international reform efforts. U.S. Government officials have played leading
roles in advancing reform measures that are being undertaken at the
Financial Stability Forum, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision,
the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, and the International
Organization of Securities Commissions. Since the onset of the global crisis,
the Administration and the Federal Reserve have been cooperating even more
closely with overseas partners. For example, in October 2008, the Federal
Reserve and other central banks around the world enacted a remarkable coordinated cut in interest rates, which will help ease the pressure on credit markets
around the world. In addition, starting at the end of 2007, the United States
bolstered U.S. dollar liquidity in European financial markets by setting up
dollar swap facilities (or swap lines) with European central banks, including
the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National
Bank, among others. A dollar swap facility allows a foreign central bank to
swap its currency for U.S. dollars from the Federal Reserve at a predetermined
exchange rate. European central banks use swap lines to provide dollars to
European commercial banks to help them meet their dollar-denominated
funding needs during a period when investors are unwilling to be counterparties to dollar-denominated liabilities. European central banks swapped local
currency for dollars with the Federal Reserve in order to limit disruptions
to financial and currency markets. Starting in October 2008, the Federal
Reserve removed the limits on swap lines for a number of foreign central
banks and provided limited swap lines to other countries, including new
$30 billion swap facilities for Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, and South Korea.
On November 15, 2008, the United States hosted the first of what is
expected to be a series of summits of leaders of major developed and developing countries to move forward in addressing the financial crisis in its
international dimensions. These efforts build on the ongoing international
efforts to better coordinate financial disclosure and regulation standards. To
this end, the United States has participated fully in the efforts of a special
working group of the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) formed in 2007. (For
an explanation of the FSF, see “Looking Forward” below.)

84  |  Economic Report of the President

Recapitalizing the Financial Sector
The Government has undertaken a historic effort to address the underlying
problem behind the freeze in the credit markets. In October 2008, Congress
passed bipartisan legislation, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act
of 2008 (EESA), authorizing the Treasury Department to use up to $700
billion in a Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to stabilize financial
markets. Under its authority, the Treasury Department announced that it
would purchase up to $250 billion in non-voting preferred stock (a stock
that represents ownership in a corporation with a higher claim on assets and
earnings than common stock) in Federally regulated banks and thrifts in a
Capital Purchase Program (CPP). In addition to stock, the Treasury would
also receive warrants (options to buy additional shares of stock at a predetermined price) from the participating institutions. By the end of December
2008, Treasury had invested $177.5 billion in 215 U.S. financial institutions
through the CPP. The new capital will help banks fill the gaps created by
losses during the financial crisis, so that the banks can resume lending to
businesses and consumers. In addition to banks, the Treasury has purchased
preferred stock in systemically important non-bank financial institutions,
which have also experienced large losses. For example, $40 billion of the
$700 billion TARP fund has been used to purchase preferred shares in insurance giant AIG.

Results So Far
Although it is much too soon to be able to conduct a complete evaluation
of the results of government responses to the global financial crisis, some signs
of improvement in financial conditions are already emerging. The first, and
perhaps most important, sign is that the financial system is noticeably more
stable than just a few months ago. Ongoing capital injections under the
TARP are providing necessary capital as banks begin to decrease their reliance
on financial leverage, a process called “deleveraging.”
TARP-provided capital is also addressing concerns about the potential
insolvency of systemically important financial institutions. Government guarantee programs are providing confidence in money funds and FDIC-insured
deposit accounts. As a result, the uncertainty that led to runs has abated and
financial institutions now can rely on a more secure deposit base.
The increased confidence in a more stable financial system has laid the
foundation for credit market improvements. Although conditions are
still strained, banks are beginning to lend to each other again. Interbank
lending rates, while still elevated, have fallen dramatically since mid-October

Chapter 2  |  85

(see Chart 2-6). Credit spreads on bank debt are declining from their
recent peaks. Federal Reserve credit facilities are providing the necessary
liquidity for money funds to invest in commercial paper. Chart 2-8 shows
that commercial paper spreads have been decreasing and that volumes are
beginning to recover. These trends suggest that firms relying on access to
short-term funding are able to borrow at reasonable rates again.
As shown in Chart 2-9, mortgage rates have also declined from their recent
peaks. Rates on conforming mortgages, which are mortgages that conform to
loan purchasing guidelines set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have benefited the most from recent actions such as the Federal Reserve’s announced
intentions to purchase large volumes of agency debt and MBS backed by
agencies. Rates on non-conforming mortgages, such as “jumbos” (mortgages
that exceed the conforming loan limits), have also benefited. However, rates
still appear high relative to long-term Treasury rates, suggesting that investors continue to attach a substantial risk premium to risky assets, such as
mortgage-related assets.
Improvements in long-term capital markets have been slower. The stock
market is still volatile. However, highly rated corporate and municipal bond
issuers have been able to issue bonds at slightly lower interest rates than before
the crisis came to a head in the summer of 2008.

86  |  Economic Report of the President

Looking Forward
The current global financial crisis will create challenges for some time to
come. These challenges include developing a new regulatory structure for
financial markets, carefully unwinding programs put in place to stem the
crisis, and developing a sustainable framework for mortgage financing.

Developing a New Regulatory Structure for Financial
Markets
The current financial system has outgrown its supervisory and regulatory
structures, which were designed decades ago. The new structure requires
balancing the need to encourage vital innovation with the need to deter
excessive risk taking. The new structure also requires the flexibility to adapt
to market innovations.

The Treasury Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Structure
In March 2007, the Treasury convened a panel to discuss the competitiveness
of U.S. capital markets. Industry leaders and policymakers alike agreed that
the competitiveness of our financial services sector is constrained by an
outdated financial regulatory framework. The panel released its blueprint
Chapter 2  |  87

in March 2008, which presents a series of recommendations for reforming
the U.S. regulatory structure. These recommendations include merging of
some of the regulatory agencies that oversee banks with some of the agencies
that oversee other financial institutions, taking into account the blurring
distinctions between types of financial products; creating an optional Federal
charter for insurance to encourage a more competitive U.S. insurance industry;
and creating an objectives-based regulatory approach. More information on
these recommendations is on the Treasury’s website.

PWG Initiatives to Strengthen Oversight and the Infrastructure of
the OTC Derivatives Market
The President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG), which
consists of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chair of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Chair of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and the Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, announced a series of initiatives to strengthen oversight and
the infrastructure of the over-the-counter derivatives market. Many derivatives are traded over the counter (OTC), which means that they are privately
negotiated and traded between counterparties, without going through an
organized exchange or intermediary. One type of derivative contract that has
become very popular in recent years is the credit default swap (CDS). (See the
section “The Onset of the Crisis” earlier in this chapter for an explanation of
CDS contracts.) While appropriate use of CDS contracts can help market
participants manage some risks, these contracts bring with them exposure to
additional firms and additional risks.
On November 14, 2008, the PWG established four specific policy objectives
for the OTC derivatives market, with a primary focus on credit default swaps.
The first objective is to improve market transparency and integrity for CDS
so regulators and investors can access information that could help them
effectively monitor the CDS market and make efficient investment decisions.
The second objective is to enhance risk management of OTC derivatives by
encouraging market participants to adopt standard best practices, including
public reporting, liquidity management, senior management oversight, and
counterparty credit risk management. The third objective is to strengthen
the derivatives market infrastructure. For example, the PWG is supporting
industry efforts to establish a central counterparty clearing facility for
derivatives that would help to reduce systemic risk and make clear how a
major participant’s failure would be addressed. The fourth objective is to
continue cooperation among regulatory authorities by expanding existing
frameworks for cooperation, coordination, and information sharing among
U.S. regulatory agencies, as well as international jurisdictions with significant
OTC derivatives activity.

88  |  Economic Report of the President

Developing Common International Principles
Leaders from the United States and other major nations are holding a series
of summits to discuss efforts to strengthen economic growth, respond to the
financial crisis, and lay the foundation for reform to help ensure that a similar
crisis does not happen again. The initial “Summit on Financial Markets and
the World Economy” took place on November 15, 2008, in Washington,
D.C., and the leaders from the participating countries agreed on common
principles for reforming financial markets and keeping international markets
open to trade and investment. The leaders agreed to implement financial
market reforms that include addressing weaknesses in accounting and disclosure standards for “off-balance-sheet vehicles” (explained in the next section);
ensuring that credit rating agencies avoid conflicts of interest, provide greater
disclosure to investors, and differentiate ratings for complex products;
ensuring that firms maintain adequate capital; developing enhanced guidance to strengthen banks’ risk-management practices; establishing processes
whereby national supervisors that oversee globally active financial institutions
meet and share information; and expanding the Financial Stability Forum
(FSF) to include a broader membership of emerging economies.
The Financial Stability Forum is an organization whose members are
senior representatives from national financial authorities (Australia, Canada,
France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States), international
groups (for example, the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank), and central bank committees. The FSF’s stated mandate is to assess
vulnerabilities affecting the international financial system, to identify and
oversee action needed to address these, and to improve coordination and
information exchange among the various authorities responsible for financial
stability. Leaders at the November 15, 2008, financial summit called upon
the FSF to take an active role in drawing lessons from the current crisis,
improving transparency in accounting standards, and strengthening prudential
regulatory standards.

Unwinding Temporary Programs
The Government’s efforts to restore stability and provide liquidity to
the financial system introduced many programs whose continued existence
the Government must evaluate as the crisis abates. Some programs should
be phased out according to a preannounced schedule, while others should
be phased out naturally as the costs of participation come to outweigh
the benefits.

Chapter 2  |  89

One program that is set to end in less than 1 year is the Treasury temporary
guarantee program for money market funds that were deposited before
September 19, 2008. This program was set up with an initial term of several
months, after which the Secretary of the Treasury would review the need and
terms for the program and the costs to provide the coverage. If the program
is extended, funds will have the opportunity to renew their purchase of
ongoing coverage. The Secretary has the option to extend the program until
September 2009 at the latest.
Two programs that will likely be phased out over the next 5 years are the
Federal Reserve’s new credit facilities and the Treasury’s Capital Purchase
Program (CPP). Aside from the Federal Reserve’s term auction facility,
the new credit facilities’ preannounced termination dates are all within the
next 2 years, unless the Federal Reserve determines that conditions warrant
postponing these dates. The Treasury’s authority to make additional capital
purchases expires at the end of 2009. In addition, the CPP provides a strong
incentive for participants to raise private capital to pay off the Government
capital injection within 5 years, as the cost of these funds rises over time.
That is, the senior preferred shares issued to the U.S. Treasury in the program
carry a 5 percent dividend for the first 5 years, rising to 9 percent thereafter.
The FDIC has several programs with preannounced end dates in 2009.
The Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program is a new program that guarantees the unsecured medium-term debt of all FDIC-insured institutions and
grants unlimited insurance for non-interest-bearing transaction accounts used
by many small businesses. Another program is the expansion of the existing
deposit insurance program for savings accounts, checking accounts, and
certificates of deposits from $100,000 to $250,000.

Modernizing Financial Regulation
The global financial crisis revealed that current financial regulation
standards and practices, in the United States and throughout the world,
are ineffective in preventing a major financial crisis that spans countries
and different institutions. While no practical system of regulation could
likely have prevented such a crisis altogether, a number of important lessons
are clear.

Addressing Innovation and Restructuring in Financial Markets
First, financial regulation must be adapted to account for the major innovations and restructuring in financial markets in recent decades. The current
U.S. financial regulatory framework is fraught with redundancies and gaps, in
part produced by more than one regulator overseeing individual institutions.

90  |  Economic Report of the President

Depository institutions, such as commercial banks and savings associations,
are overseen by five Federal regulators as well as State regulators. Large
holding companies with depository institutions, investment banks, and insurance companies may face a complex system of multiple regulators.
While it is clear that an overhaul of financial regulation is necessary, what
is less clear is exactly how a new regulatory framework should be structured.
The new financial regulatory framework needs to balance several objectives.
Protecting investors and consumers and establishing a stable financial system
are two necessary requirements for any successful regulatory system, but
regulators must be careful to balance these goals against potential detrimental
effects on capital formation and the desire to promote beneficial innovation.

Strengthening Disclosure Requirements
Second, regulators need to strengthen disclosures related to complex
financial instruments, particularly those that are held “off balance sheet.” A
firm’s balance sheet is one of many financial statements the firm prepares
to provide useful information to investors, creditors, and regulators. The
purpose of a balance sheet is to present a snapshot of the firm’s financial
position. The basic components of a balance sheet are assets, liabilities, and
equity. Assets are things that provide probable future economic benefit to the
firm. Liabilities are claims on those assets, such as debt issued to finance the
purchase of assets. Equity is the residual interest in the assets that remains
after deducting the liabilities.
While the above definitions appear straightforward, many questions and
issues arise regarding whether certain items should be reported as liabilities or
as equity. In addition, questions arise in determining which items should be
reflected on the balance sheet at all. The formal accounting standards that are
used to distinguish between on- and off-balance-sheet items are very complicated and are open to judgment. As a result, some companies may hold
large amounts of off-balance-sheet items that do indeed affect a company’s
health and stability. For example, at the outset of the financial crisis, some
large financial institutions had structured investment vehicles (SIVs) holding
billions of dollars in mortgage-related assets that were not reflected on their
balance sheets.
SIVs are investment funds that issue short-term debt, such as commercial
paper, to finance the purchase of long-term assets, such as mortgage-backed
securities. Leading up to the financial crisis, SIVs were often highly levered
with a great deal of debt relative to their capital. In fact, some SIVs were used
to circumvent regulatory capital requirements that restricted the amount of
leverage that could be used by the parent financial institutions. In the end,
the SIVs’ combination of leverage and reliance on short-term funding made

Chapter 2  |  91

their parent financial institutions vulnerable to large mortgage losses. Many
investors were surprised because institutions had disclosed little about the
risks posed by the off-balance-sheet SIVs.
The challenge for financial market regulators is to address weaknesses
in accounting and disclosure standards for off-balance-sheet items. Once
complete and accurate information on the financial condition of firms is
disclosed, regulators can more effectively measure firm-specific and systemwide risks. Then regulators can prudently manage those risks as appropriate.

Addressing the Pro-Cyclicality of Regulatory Capital Requirements
Third, problems with pro-cyclical regulatory capital requirements need to
be addressed. During good economic times, values of financial assets increase,
thus increasing a firm’s capital and its ability to increase its liabilities, which
helps to feed credit booms. During difficult times, values of financial assets
decline. The firm’s capital declines in value, and it is forced to reduce its
liabilities or somehow increase its capital to satisfy regulatory requirements,
which feeds the economic downturn.
The combination of mark-to-market accounting, illiquid markets, and
forced sales to satisfy regulatory capital requirements during a downturn can
lead to a vicious cycle. Mark-to-market accounting is one method for determining an asset’s fair value. A fair value is the price that would be received
if an asset were sold in an orderly transaction between market participants.
The mark-to-market approach uses observable market prices to calculate
an asset’s fair value. An alternative valuation method is the mark-to-model
approach, which relies on standard financial models that use factors such as
interest rates, the probability of default, and related cash flows to calculate an
asset’s fair value.
Some observers have blamed mark-to-market accounting for driving asset
prices well below the values determined by the asset’s underlying fundamentals, such as interest rates and probabilities of default. These observers argue
that understated asset values undermine investor confidence and have forced
many firms to raise capital or sell assets to satisfy regulatory requirements.
However, as discussed previously, problems at many financial institutions
today are due less to their asset values being undervalued and more to the
firms having too many troubled assets (such as MBS), engaging in poor
risk management, and becoming too dependent on short-term borrowing.
Mark-to-market accounting has helped bring attention to these problems by
exposing which firms were very heavily invested in these troubled assets, but
it did not cause them.
Investors and regulators can best evaluate a firm when they are aware
of the market value of a firm’s assets. Transparency is vital to the healthy
functioning of financial markets. To effectively address the pro-cyclicality

92  |  Economic Report of the President

problem, in which firms may be forced to undertake actions in a downturn
that worsen the downturn, financial accounting rules should be distinguished
from the regulatory policies that establish standards for capital requirements.
The purpose of financial accounting is to provide reliable information about
a firm’s financial situation so that investors and creditors can make sound
economic decisions. From that perspective, mark-to-market accounting is
useful because it improves the quality of information in the marketplace.
As noted earlier, some observers have argued that falling asset prices in
acutely distressed markets have led firms to report reduced levels of capital.
Then, in order to comply with regulatory capital requirements, firms
have sold assets, thus driving prices lower. Even if this selling of assets in
order to comply with requirements is responsible for the subsequent asset
price declines, mark-to-market accounting is not the root cause. Instead,
the problem lies with a regulatory policy that is too rigid in determining
capital requirements. When most asset values are falling, massive sales of
assets to meet the required ratio of capital to assets are likely to be destabilizing. To reduce this problem, regulators could maintain more flexible and
forward-looking standards in distressed markets, so that capital requirements
themselves do not create unhealthy firms.

The Future of Mortgage Financing and Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac
Over the first half of 2008, investors became increasingly concerned about
the capital positions of the GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, following a
string of quarterly losses by both firms due to reductions in the value of their
portfolio holdings of MBS and mortgage loans, and because of greater-thanexpected credit losses. Eroding investor confidence in the GSEs endangered
not only the U.S. mortgage market but the global financial system more
generally, given the central role the GSEs play in mortgage financing and how
broadly their debt and MBS are held around the world. At the recommendation of the Administration, Congress passed a bill in July 2008 that, among
other things, created a new and stronger regulator for the GSEs, the Federal
Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and provided the Treasury with powers to
purchase GSE debt and equity.
In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed under
conservatorship of the FHFA as serious concerns surfaced about the financial stability of these systemically important financial institutions. (See
“Onset of the Crisis” above.) While conservatorship can provide necessary
stability over a period of months, a long-term plan to reestablish the link
between mortgage lenders and financial markets is critical to the future of the
mortgage market.

Chapter 2  |  93

Any plan for the long-term restructuring of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
should have at its core at least three goals: to promote the efficient functioning
of the mortgage market, even during periods of systemwide financial stress; to
minimize systemic risk, which likely implies that government support should
be either explicit or absent; and to protect the taxpayer.

Liquidation of the GSEs and Replacement by a Fully Private
Market
One approach is to liquidate the GSEs and allow the private market alone
to handle mortgage financing, maximizing the benefits of private market
competition. The structure would be one in which private banks and
other financial institutions securitize mortgages as a part of their business
model, but no single firm would be a dominant player in this market, and
the mortgage securitization business would make up only a fraction of the
total business of each institution. This solution would dramatically reduce
taxpayer risk, maintain a functioning mortgage market in most situations,
and eliminate distortions. The elimination of any implicit or explicit government guarantee would, however, increase mortgage interest rates somewhat.
This is one reason that the full privatization of mortgage financing may not
be the best option in the near term, despite its attractive features.
Importantly, recent experience suggests that fully private financing may not
be viable under stressed financial conditions. As an example, the recent financial crisis led to a near-halt in private mortgage securitization in the United
States. In contrast, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continued to produce
and sell large quantities of MBS throughout 2008, with private demand
remaining somewhat secure. Apparently, investors valued GSE MBS because
of the instruments’ implied government support, suggesting that some form
of backstop provided by the Government or widely dispersed private reinsurers may be necessary to maintain mortgage financing during periods of
systemwide financial stress.

Government-Provided Insurance of MBS
The Government could sell insurance to GSEs and other financial institutions
that apply for a charter to create MBS from conforming mortgages. This
structure would foster competition among institutions, as the GSEs would
have no institutional advantage over private institutions. Such a structure,
with its explicit but limited role for government involvement, may be a good
near-term solution for mortgage financing. Taxpayers would bear risk, but
would be compensated by the insurance premiums paid by participating
institutions. Depending on where the price of the insurance is set, the private
sector could eventually compete with the Government by offering alternative
mortgage products that could replace the Government insurance.

94  |  Economic Report of the President

Nationalizing the GSEs
Another GSE structure that has been proposed by some but poses many
challenges is nationalization. In this alternative, the GSEs could be taken out
of conservatorship and be fully nationalized. As government corporations,
they would be set up to guarantee conforming mortgages or MBS directly.
What is less clear is how nationalization would be accomplished: Would
the GSEs’ debt become the Government’s debt? What would happen to
the equity held by existing shareholders? In addition, if Government prices
for this guarantee were below the costs incurred by private markets, private
competition for securitization would be precluded. Although systemic risk
would be eliminated and the GSEs would have little incentive to engage in
excessively risky behavior for short-run profits without shareholders, taxpayers
could bear substantial risk. Finally, the terms of mortgage financing would be
set by the Government, a role that can be fulfilled by the private sector.

Turning the GSEs into a Public Utility
Alternatively, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could be combined and turned
into one public utility. This regulated private corporation would directly
issue MBS, presumably with some government backing. Prices of the MBS
and their rates of return would be set by a commission, and regulations would
place tight limits on the company’s investment portfolio. Public utilities are
generally established in natural monopoly settings (because, for example,
building duplicate telephone or power lines is inefficient) as a second-best
solution to prevent monopoly pricing and guarantee public service. The
mortgage market is not a natural monopoly, however, and can be easily served
by many firms without duplicative inefficiency. As a consequence, a public
utility would result in many distortions and disadvantages without significant
offsetting positives.

Implicit Guarantees
The issue of distortions arising from implicit government guarantees is not
limited to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. An increasingly important source
of financing for depository institutions in recent years has been the Federal
Home Loan Banks (FHLBs). As of the third quarter of 2008, the FHLBs
had granted nearly $1 trillion in loans. These loans, often backed by real
estate–related collateral, have been extended to the majority of depository
institutions in the United States. The FHLBs raise funds at below-market
rates because they have advantages over other debt issuers, such as certain
exemptions from State and local taxes and an assumed implicit government
guarantee even though the FHLBs are private member-owned cooperatives.
Some of these savings are passed along to member banks, who, as a result,

Chapter 2  |  95

rely—in some cases very heavily—on financing from the FHLBs. Any
long-term plan for mortgage financing must eliminate the distortions in
credit markets created by implicit guarantees of this nature.

Conclusion
The United States experienced a crisis in both financial markets and housing
markets in 2008. One factor that led to this crisis was an abundance of inexpensive capital that helped finance a housing boom. This boom was fueled by
the growth of subprime mortgages and expanded mortgage securitization. As
the boom proved unsustainable, the crisis was exacerbated by unprecedented
declines in house prices, rising default rates on residential mortgages, and a
resulting sharp decline in the value of mortgage-related assets. The assets
were held by a wide range of institutions, some of which were highly levered
and highly dependent on short-term funding. The resulting failure and nearfailure of some of these firms, combined with broad-based declines in asset
prices, placed enormous stresses on world financial markets. Credit markets
froze, and confidence in the financial system eroded.
The Administration and the Federal Reserve aggressively responded to restore
stability to the U.S. financial system and support the functioning of financial
markets and firms. The Government has taken unprecedented action to boost
liquidity in short-term funding markets; provided substantial new protections for consumers, businesses, and investors; and cooperated closely with
its international partners. Looking ahead, the global financial crisis presents
several challenges for the United States. Among them are the need to improve
financial regulation, unwind temporary programs in an orderly fashion, and
develop long-term solutions for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Energy and the Environment

A

lthough fossil fuels will continue to compose a large share of the U.S.
energy portfolio for some time, the Federal Government has taken major
steps to increase and diversify the Nation’s energy supply and improve the
environment. Since 2001, the Government has made significant investments to develop cleaner and more reliable energy sources. Several regulatory
changes are expected to deliver dramatic improvements in air quality nationwide. The President has signed two major pieces of energy legislation, the
Energy Policy Act (EPACT) of 2005 and the Energy Independence and
Security Act of 2007 (EISA). EISA was enacted in response to the President’s
“Twenty in Ten” goal, issued in the 2007 State of the Union Address, of
reducing U.S. gasoline usage by 20 percent in the next 10 years by improving
fuel economy and increasing the production of alternative fuels. EISA also
includes numerous energy efficiency mandates that are projected to result
in substantial reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition,
the Nation is on track to meet—and currently projected to exceed—the
President’s 2002 goal of reducing U.S. GHG intensity (emissions per unit
of GDP) by 18 percent by 2012. This spring, the President set a new goal
of stopping the growth in total U.S. GHG emissions by 2025 and to begin
decreasing them thereafter. The Administration has also recently led efforts
to encourage wider international action on addressing GHGs, including
action in developing countries.
Despite these steps by the Administration to address the problems
associated with the country’s reliance on fossil fuel–based energy sources,
major challenges remain. For public health and environmental reasons, the
United States must continue to improve air quality by ensuring that State and
local areas come into compliance with Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements.
Additional steps should be taken to mitigate the global problem of rising
GHG emissions associated with fossil fuel–based energy consumption.
Furthermore, diversifying the Nation’s portfolio of energy sources and
increasing domestic production may reduce vulnerabilities associated with the
U.S. dependence on imported fossil fuels.
This chapter discusses policies for addressing the Nation’s energy needs
in the context of both global climate change and the reduction of local and
regional pollution associated with fossil fuel–based energy use. It reviews
some of the steps this Administration has taken to advance the transition to
new sources of energy with fewer environmental and security concerns, and
to find cleaner, more efficient methods of using existing energy sources. It
97

also identifies some of the overarching challenges that lie ahead in developing
any comprehensive energy policy.
The key points in this chapter are:
•	 Because of innovative regulations promulgated under this Administration,
there should be substantial improvements in air quality over the next
few decades. Two rules that implemented cap-and-trade programs in
the electricity sector represent a significant step in using cost-effective,
market-oriented policy instruments to dramatically reduce power plants’
emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury.
•	 Despite widespread support for increased use of market-based approaches
to achieve our environmental and energy policy goals going forward,
challenges remain in realizing the full potential of these approaches.
•	 There is an increasing need to reassess how well existing laws can address
the environmental problems associated with fossil fuel use in more costeffective ways. For example, it may become increasingly costly to make
additional reductions in traditional air pollutants, and existing statutes
were not meant to regulate global problems such as GHG emissions.
•	 Substantial reductions in global GHG emissions will require participation
by all large emitters (countries and sectors within countries).

U.S. Energy Use and Policy Goals
Fossil fuels continue to satisfy the majority of the Nation’s demand for
energy. Petroleum accounts for about 40 percent of total energy consumption; 70 percent of this petroleum is used for transportation. Coal and
natural gas are the next most commonly used fuel types, representing
22 percent and 23 percent of consumption, respectively. Coal is used almost
exclusively for electricity production; approximately a third of natural gas
consumption is also used in electricity production, with the remaining twothirds being used directly by residential, commercial, and industrial sources.
Finally, nuclear power and renewable energy sources such as hydropower,
biomass, geothermal, wind, and solar power remain a small but growing
share of our energy consumption, with nuclear power accounting for approximately 8 percent of U.S. energy consumption in 2007 and renewable energy
accounting for approximately 7 percent. (See the 2008 Economic Report of the
President for more details on U.S. energy sources.)
The Nation’s current patterns of energy use pose a number of problems
that warrant government involvement in energy markets. One is the concern
over the public health and environmental effects of fossil fuel–based energy
production and use. In particular, the emission of many common air pollutants that are created by the combustion of fossil fuels increases the risk of

98  |  Economic Report of the President

premature mortality and numerous acute and chronic health conditions.
Additionally, these emissions damage ecosystems, impair visibility, and have
a substantial impact on water and soil quality. In this chapter, “common air
pollutants” refers to the so-called criteria pollutants (particulate matter (PM),
ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO),
and lead), although much that is written about the criteria pollutants also
applies to hazardous air pollutants or air toxics.
As in many other countries, anthropogenic (human-made) U.S. GHG
emissions continue to increase. Because of the environmental risks posed by
climate change and the national security implications of events like droughts
and rising sea levels, many countries have grown more aware of the need to
slow and reverse the growth of global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2)
and other greenhouse gases. In 2007, total U.S. GHG emissions were 7,282
million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (MMTCO2e), a 3-percent increase
over 2000 levels; this increase is mainly attributable to energy use. Energyrelated CO2 emissions account for 98 percent of U.S. CO2 emissions and
more than 80 percent of total U.S. GHG emissions. The United States
represented about 17 percent of world GHG emissions in recent years.
For energy security reasons, concerns also remain about the U.S. reliance
on imported fossil fuels. Net oil imports to the United States account for a
substantial share of national oil consumption, which many argue makes the
United States economy more vulnerable to oil price shocks that are the result
of supply disruptions in unstable exporting regions. However, as economists
have pointed out, it is important to remember that it is primarily U.S. oil
dependence, rather than U.S. dependence on imported oil, that exposes the
country to turmoil in world oil markets. Given the integrated nature of the
oil market, a supply disruption in one region still removes oil from the world
market causing the price of oil to rise regardless of where it was produced.
Despite a weak economic outlook for 2009, projections indicate that
energy consumption in the United States and around the world will continue
to grow in the long run. Thus, we will need to continue to determine how
to meet these needs while both addressing energy security concerns and
improving environmental protection. It is clear that long-term policies aimed
at reducing the Nation’s overall reliance on fossil fuels can help to advance
both goals. However, taking intermediate steps that help us use fossil fuels
in more responsible ways during the transition to alternative sources of
energy is still consistent with this long-term objective. For example, this
Administration has supported removing regulatory impediments to bringing
domestic energy sources, including fossil fuels, to market, to advance energy
security objectives. It has also supported finding cleaner ways of using fossil
fuels. Some of the Administration’s efforts on each of these fronts are covered
later in this chapter. Before that, the next section provides a brief overview of
policy approaches for addressing these objectives.
Chapter 3  |  99

The Promise of Market-Oriented
Policy Approaches
This section reviews the advantages of market-oriented policies, while
noting some of the challenges that must be overcome to use them most effectively in tackling some policy objectives such as climate change. This section
also discusses the role for policies supporting research and development and
widespread adoption of new technologies that pose fewer environmental or
security concerns.

Market-Oriented Environmental Regulation
Regulatory approaches for addressing the policy goals outlined above
are often grouped roughly into two categories: conventional, or command
and control approaches, and market-oriented approaches. Conventional
approaches to reducing pollution, for example, tend to involve policy instruments that mandate the amount individual entities can emit or prescribe
which abatement behaviors or technologies should be adopted. These types
of policies are often called command and control approaches because they
offer little flexibility about how a particular environmental goal may be met
(although, among command and control approaches, performance-based
standards can offer a bit more flexibility in achieving abatement goals than
do technology-based standards). Market-oriented approaches, by contrast,
encourage behavior through price signals rather than with explicit standards
on pollution-control levels or methods. Policy tools such as tradeable permits
or taxes, for example, offer firms an incentive to reduce their pollution by
placing a price on each ton of pollutant emitted.
The primary advantage of market-oriented policies is that, if they are
designed well and properly implemented, they have the potential to achieve
environmental goals at a lower cost to society than traditional command
and control policies. This is because of the greater flexibility they offer in
determining how to reduce emissions. If emitters can choose the method of
pollution reduction, they have an incentive to find the lowest-cost way to
meet the regulatory requirement. For example, policymakers could require
producers and consumers to take into account the environmental and public
health effects of a criteria pollutant like sulfur dioxide by imposing a tax on
emissions that is equal to the incremental damage caused by a unit of emissions or by establishing a cap-and-trade program, under which policymakers
set an overall cap on emissions but allow regulated entities to trade rights
(called allowances) to those limited emissions. Since the cost of reducing
emissions may vary across firms and sectors, what may be the least expensive
approach for one firm may be a relatively high-cost approach for another

100  |  Economic Report of the President

firm. Emitters that can reduce emissions most inexpensively will do so and
then sell allowances to those who face much higher abatement costs. As a
result, the most economically efficient allocation of the pollution-control
burden among emitters can be achieved without requiring the policymaker to
make assumptions about how compliance costs may vary across firms.
Another significant advantage of market-oriented approaches is that they
can provide a greater incentive to develop new ways to reduce pollution than
can command and control approaches. Command and control policies often
offer incentives to abate only to the level of the standard, whereas a pricing
approach encourages emitters to continue to innovate as long as they find it
relatively cheap to do so. Well-designed pricing of CO2 emissions through a
tax or cap-and-trade program, for example, would give firms a direct incentive to invest in developing new low- or zero-carbon technologies based on
their expectations of the increases in the costs of emissions. It would also
encourage competition in making incremental innovations in existing emission reduction options. Of course, it will be important to address hurdles in
providing the infrastructure necessary to allow large-scale deployment of new
technologies, a point to which we return below.
Both of these advantages have created widespread support among economists
for greater use of emission pricing policies to address environmental
problems, including those problems associated with fossil fuel–based energy
use. However, it is important to emphasize that challenges remain in
realizing the full potential of market-oriented policy approaches. This is
especially true in the context of climate change. Carbon pricing through a
cap-and-trade system or, closely related, by taxing fossil fuels in proportion to
their carbon content, will require broad-based participation to be effective in
addressing global GHG concentrations. Limited action that does not result
in emissions reductions from countries that contribute a significant share
of world emissions will not lead to significant progress on climate change
goals, since the majority of the future growth in emissions will come from
developing nations. Absent action by all major emitting countries, it will
be impossible to have a meaningful impact on the problem. Also, without
similar policies across these countries, firms in energy-intensive industries that
face high regulatory costs in the U.S. could have an incentive to move their
operations to unregulated foreign markets. These issues and other challenges
in implementing more economically efficient policies are discussed in greater
detail below.

The Role for Technology Inducement Policies
Another method policymakers often use to give incentives for taking into
account the environmental or security consequences of a particular behavior
is to subsidize behavior that poses fewer environmental or security concerns.
Chapter 3  |  101

For example, similar to the way a business reacts to a price signal such as an
emissions tax, a profit-maximizing business will abate pollution or invest in
research and development (R&D) in cleaner technologies up to the point
where the cost is more than the subsidy or reward earned for doing so.
This is not to imply that a tax and subsidy are equivalent policies. A tax
generates revenue that can be used to offset other preexisting distortionary
taxes (such as payroll taxes) in the economy, whereas a subsidy requires that
revenue be raised by increasing existing taxes or requires reducing spending
in other areas. Still, many economists maintain that, as a complement to
any pricing policy, governments will need to support R&D for alternative
energy sources and ensure that any R&D support is managed efficiently and
effectively. These policies may be justified on economic grounds primarily
because the process of generating and diffusing new energy technologies is
characterized by imperfect market outcomes. The most significant of these
is the general underinvestment in innovation due to the pure public-good
nature of R&D. Because devoting a firm’s resources to innovation may yield
knowledge spillovers—benefits to society that do not translate into profits
for the innovating firm—there may be an inefficient, low level of R&D in
alternative energy technologies. This problem has long been recognized in
all industries, and there are numerous policies in place to help innovators
reap the rewards of their innovations (for example, patents, copyright laws,
funding for general science research).
In assessing the desirability of public sector support for research and
development, one might consider the extent to which private sector incentives for R&D already exist. Private incentives for R&D investment may vary
across categories of prospective R&D:
•	 Emission control for currently regulated pollutants. In this case, there are
regulatory incentives for the private sector to develop technologies that
control emissions, but there will only be incentives to develop technologies that reduce emissions in ways captured by regulation.
•	 Energy efficiency, new energy sources, and alternative energy. Since energy
is an expensive input, there are strong private sector incentives to develop
new or improved technologies even without any government regulation.
Support for public sector R&D in this area would be specifically justified
if individual producers and consumers do not account for the broader
value of energy security or of positive spillovers to others from the technology that goes with the new alternative.
•	 Emissions from pollutants that are not currently regulated. In this case, the
incentive for private sector R&D is very limited, because prospective
developers are not only uncertain about whether their new invention will
work, but also must consider if or when the pollutant will be regulated,
and whether their technology will be acceptable under future regulations.

102  |  Economic Report of the President

Technologies to reduce emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases are
among those that are not currently regulated, as are technologies that
would capture and store such gases to prevent them from entering the
atmosphere.
It is important to highlight that domestic R&D support for alternative
technologies may also help create incentives for action on climate change
by other major emitting countries that are unwilling or unable to adopt
GHG-reducing regulations. For example, investment in developing low-cost,
low-carbon technologies could lead to inventions that such countries would
adopt voluntarily. Additionally, it is often argued that production costs of
new, unproven technologies fall as manufacturers gain production experience.
If the gains from such “learning by doing” experience can be captured by
other producers without compensating the early adopters, then there may be
inefficient, low deployment of new technologies.
The difficulty in promoting technology adoption through subsidies and
other tools lies in designing policies that are neutral across all alternative
technologies. Weighting the size of a subsidy by the degree to which each
technology reduces environmental and security concerns would help to
ensure that the Government is not in the position of picking winners. In
April 2008, the President called for a reform of the existing low-carbon
technology deployment tax incentives into a single, expanded incentive with
such features. We return to this issue below. Overall, there is less agreement
among economists about the justification for these types of policies that target
the commercial use of a technology than those that target the R&D stage
of the technology innovation process. Many argue that once fundamental
research is no longer necessary, the market should decide how widely a new
technology is adopted.

Increasing Use of Alternative Energy Sources
There are many alternatives to fossil fuels available for meeting our energy
needs in the electricity, transportation, and other sectors. Electricity may
be generated using renewable sources (such as wind, solar, geothermal,
biomass, and hydropower) or nuclear power. In the transportation sector,
solutions range from finding new fuels for traditionally gas-powered vehicles
to designing different types of vehicles such as those that run on electricity
or hydrogen. Policy tools used under this Administration to promote the
transition to some of these alternatives can be grouped into two categories:
technology policies that provide incentives to encourage R&D and deployment of new technologies, and mandates that require increases in alternative
energy use.

Chapter 3  |  103

Generating Electricity
In the electricity sector, the Administration has supported development of
alternative energy technologies through a mix of incentives, including both
basic research investment and technology deployment policies. Department
of Energy funding for electricity-related R&D, for example, totaled
$11.5 billion (2007 dollars) from fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2007.
This section reviews some of the existing incentives for promoting electricity
generation from renewable energy sources and nuclear power.

Renewable Energy
Renewable sources of energy such as wind, solar, and geothermal power
are desirable for generating electricity because, despite their high initial fixed
costs, they are domestic sources of power with no fuel costs or emissions except
those involved in building the infrastructure required to generate the power.
Biomass-fired electricity, which is derived from sources such as wood, waste,
and alcohol fuels, is also a renewable source. While not technically a zeroemission process, biomass energy produces fewer common air pollutants than
coal and, depending on the feedstock and firing process, has the potential to
create fewer GHG emissions than either conventional coal or natural gas. This
Administration has encouraged deployment of renewable energy technologies
in electricity generation primarily through tax incentives. For example, the
renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) has been important in encouraging the growing market for wind power. Although wind still provides only
1 percent of the United States’s electricity, wind generation has grown by
about 400 percent since 2001 and, in 2007, made up 10 percent of electricity
generation from renewable energy sources (see Chart 3-1). This growth is in
part because, in some areas, the PTC makes the cost of wind more competitive
with other energy sources such as natural gas. Incentives and requirements for
renewable energy use in numerous States are also contributing to the increase.
The Federal PTC has been renewed and expanded several times since its
original enactment in 1992, including by EPACT 2005 and again in October
2008. It is currently available for a broad range of renewable sources such
as solar power; certain geothermal, landfill-gas, and biomass projects; ocean
energy; and livestock methane-based power.
Renewable energy deployment is also encouraged through tax credits for
investments in renewable energy equipment and property. For example, the
Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT) increased the solar investment tax credit
(ITC), which offers businesses a tax credit for investments in solar energy equipment and installations. The 21-percent increase in solar powered electricity
generation capacity between 2006 and 2007 may indicate that the solar ITC
is having some effect. In order to provide clear and consistent incentives for
technology investment, policies such as the PTC should be maintained for a
104  |  Economic Report of the President

reasonable length of time but be phased out once they are no longer warranted
to address barriers associated with the early commercialization of a technology.
It is worth noting that renewable energy sources, especially wind and solar,
face infrastructure obstacles because many large-scale renewable energy installations are most likely to be built in remote areas. Also, neither wind nor solar
can currently be relied on as a consistent means to produce energy 24 hours a
day. The challenges of bringing these resources to market and finding better
ways to store energy are discussed in more detail later in the chapter.

Nuclear Power
In addition to renewable energy sources, the Administration has promoted
increased use of nuclear power as a clean, efficient energy source to meet the
Nation’s growing need for electricity. Nuclear power is not a new technology.
Currently, 104 commercial nuclear generating units (reactors) in the United
States supply approximately 20 percent of the country’s electricity. Nuclear
power generation makes no contribution to global CO2 emissions and
produces no notable emissions of SO2, NOX, and particulates. In addition,
nuclear plants have low operating costs and are able to operate at close to full
capacity all the time, thus providing a reliable, constant supply of electricity.
Despite these advantages, high construction costs, investment risks, longterm management of spent fuel generated by nuclear plants, and regulatory
Chapter 3  |  105

hurdles have deterred any new commercial reactors from being ordered and
approved for construction since 1978. The last new nuclear plant came on
line in 1996.
The Administration has taken several steps to address some of the concerns
that are barring greater use of nuclear energy. EPACT 2005 provided a
new production tax credit to reward investments in the latest developments
in advanced nuclear power generation. Since then, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission has received 17 applications for combined construction permit
and operating licenses for 26 new nuclear generating units.
As part of EPACT, the President also authorized the creation of loan
guarantee programs to encourage commercial use of new or significantly
improved energy related technologies, including nuclear power. In 2008,
Congress authorized loan guarantees worth over $18 billion to support
construction of new plants and enable nuclear plant owners to reduce their
interest costs. A loan guarantee is a promise by the Government to take
responsibility for a certain portion of a loan in case the debtor defaults.
By assuming some of the risk associated with loans for new projects, these
guarantees are implicit subsidies for new nuclear energy projects. If priced
appropriately, loan guarantees can help to encourage early commercial use
of new technologies that had been hampered by informational asymmetries
between project developers and lenders. However, such guarantees should be
used with caution. If the Government assumes too much of the financial or
political risk associated with a new project, investors may attempt to embark
on speculative projects that could end up being costly for taxpayers. This
same caution applies to loan guarantee programs available to support other
energy sources such as renewable and/or energy-efficient systems, cleaner
coal-based power, and other technologies.

Alternative Transportation Fuels
Petroleum use in road travel dominates energy consumption in transportation. In recent years, tax incentives have increased the use of some
alternatives to petroleum, especially corn-based ethanol, but there has been an
increasing emphasis on promoting alternatives that do not rely on food crops
and have greater promise for significantly reducing GHG emissions. The
Administration’s efforts in this area have focused on providing incentives and
funding to develop new vehicle technologies and reliable, low-cost alternative
fuels to conventional gasoline and on mandating increased use of renewable
fuels, including biofuels from non-food sources.

Incentive-Based Promotion of Alternative Fuels
Federal R&D support for alternative fuels has been led by a $1.2 billion
investment (over 5 years) in hydrogen-based fuel cell vehicles and about
106  |  Economic Report of the President

$1 billion since 2001 in cellulosic ethanol—an ethanol produced from wood,
grasses, or the nonedible parts of plants. These fuels face significant cost
hurdles which currently prevent them from being commercially viable. The
benefits of R&D in hydrogen vehicles will take a long time to be realized
because the vehicles still face formidable technological obstacles that may
take decades to resolve. The projected cost of cellulosic ethanol, however,
has dropped by more than 60 percent since 2001. If these cost reductions
continue, cellulosic ethanol may become a viable transportation fuel more
quickly than alternatives like hydrogen. Aided by the Corporate Average Fuel
Economy (CAFE) credit given to manufacturers for producing “flex-fuel”
vehicles that can run on either all gasoline or up to 85 percent ethanol, the
number of light-duty vehicles that can accommodate large amounts of ethanol
has grown by more than 5 million since 2001 (see Chart 3-2). However, as
with other types of biofuels, significant economic, scientific, environmental,
and logistical challenges remain with incorporating nationally significant
volumes of cellulosic ethanol into the market. Fuel distributors and gas
station owners will need to make significant investments in the infrastructure
for new fuel distribution and manufacturers will need to make changes to
vehicles to accommodate substantially larger biofuel volumes; existing gas
station infrastructure and non-flex-fuel vehicles are currently only compatible
with gasoline blends consisting of up to 10 percent ethanol.

Chapter 3  |  107

Another alternative technology that shows more near-term promise in
reducing gasoline consumption is electricity for powering vehicles. The
consumer tax credits created under EPACT in 2005 for purchasing electric—
gasoline hybrid vehicles have helped to encourage hybrid sales, and there are
now more than 1 million hybrid vehicles on the road. The so-called “plug-in
hybrid” design takes this technology a step further by using the gas engine
only for back-up status and letting the electric motor do most of the work.
This is possible because the large battery pack of the plug-in hybrid can be
recharged using a standard household outlet. The cost of the battery pack is
a major hurdle to widespread commercialization of these vehicles. Between
2001 and 2008, the Department of Energy helped to advance battery technology with about $230 million in funding for energy storage R&D.
Replacing gasoline with electric power helps address energy security
concerns by increasing the use of domestic, non-petroleum energy sources
to meet our transportation needs. It does not eliminate GHG concerns or
emissions of many local pollutants if the electricity is generated using fossil
fuels, but it does reduce these concerns as well. Electric vehicles with more
efficient alternating current systems would produce fewer CO2 emissions per
mile than most conventional gasoline vehicles if powered by electricity from a
coal-fired power plant. CO2 emissions per mile driven would be significantly
lower than with gasoline if the electricity were generated with natural gas.
This would also result in fewer emissions than powering a car directly with
natural gas, which has shown greater use as an alternative to diesel in heavier
trucks or buses. It will still be necessary to modernize and expand the electricity grid to accommodate substantial increases in electric power usage in
the transportation sector. The challenge of expanding electricity transmission
is discussed in more detail below.

Renewable Fuels Standard
In addition to using incentives to promote alternative fuels, the
Administration has also acted to mandate increased use of alternatives
to petroleum in transportation. In 2007, the President announced the
Twenty in Ten goal to reduce U.S. gasoline use by 20 percent in 10 years.
The passage of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA)
represents a major step toward this goal by requiring substantial increases in
light-duty vehicle fuel economy standards and an increase in the production
of renewable fuels.
The renewable fuels standard (RFS) portion of EISA is an expansion of
the first RFS the President signed into law as part of Energy Policy Act of
2005 (EPACT), which required a minimum volume of renewable fuel to
be sold or blended with gasoline in the United States. EISA raises the 2008
standard from 5.4 billion gallons to 9 billion gallons and increases the requirement each year thereafter, until reaching 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel
108  |  Economic Report of the President

by 2022. Beginning in 2009, about 5 percent of the RFS must be met with
advanced biofuels—such as cellulosic ethanol made from switchgrass or wood
chips or biodiesel made from leftover restaurant grease. By 2022, nearly
60 percent of the RFS-mandated volume must come from advanced biofuels.
These advanced biofuels hold greater potential for reducing GHG emissions
than current U.S. biofuels and are also less likely to affect future food prices
because they are not reliant on food crops as feedstock, although some advanced
biofuels may compete for land and other inputs with food crops. However,
minimizing the negative environmental impacts (for example, on soil, water
quality, forest cover, habitat diversity, and increased GHG emissions from landuse changes) of biofuel production is likely to remain a significant challenge
regardless of the type of feedstock. Furthermore, while the RFS will lead to an
increase in the use of biofuels, the expected reduction in gasoline consumption
(and associated emissions) will likely be dampened due to unintended consequences. For example, gasoline consumption may increase in other countries
due to a rebound effect from lower demand in the United States.
The risk of food-price spikes resulting from a binding RFS mandate could
be mitigated by establishing a “safety valve” mechanism that would effectively
cap the cost of meeting the mandate. With such a mechanism, a refiner or
fuel blender would be allowed to purchase credits from the Government
to satisfy its RFS requirement if biofuel prices exceeded a predetermined
safety-valve price. This would prevent drastic shocks in food prices and also
offer more regulatory certainty to refiners, blenders, and biofuel producers.
Despite the Administration’s support for a safety valve in the RFS mandate,
the final version of EISA did not include such a provision.

Harnessing Existing Energy Sources
More Responsibly
Given the economy’s overwhelming reliance on fossil fuels, it is reasonable
to assume that it will take some time to transition to alternative sources of
energy. Therefore, in addition to supporting the development of alternatives described above, the Administration has led a parallel effort to promote
cleaner, more efficient, and more reliable use of existing sources, including
fossil fuels.

Increasing Efficiency
Efforts to use existing energy sources more efficiently have focused on
improving efficiency in vehicle fuel use and in electric energy consumption
through fuel economy standards on new cars and light trucks and through
various lighting and appliance standards.
Chapter 3  |  109

Vehicle Fuel Economy Standards
The EISA Vehicle Fuel Economy Mandate builds on the Department of
Transportation’s 2003 and 2006 fuel economy rules for light-duty trucks and
requires that the light-duty vehicle fleet (new cars and light trucks) meet a
Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard average of 35 miles per
gallon (mpg) by 2020. The 2003 rulemaking increased fuel economy standards of new light trucks by 7 percent between 2004 and 2007 model-years,
and the 2006 rulemaking required an additional 8 percent increase, bringing
fuel economy of new light trucks to 24 mpg by model year 2011. The 2020
requirement represents approximately 40-percent increase in miles per gallon
over 2008 standards: 27.5 mpg for passenger cars, and 22.5 mpg for light
trucks. Several new credit trading and banking provisions will help reduce
the cost to manufacturers of meeting the new standards and are an example
of the use of market-based mechanisms. Under EISA, manufacturers whose
vehicles exceed minimum CAFE standards can sell credits to other manufacturers below the standards, and companies can transfer credits between
their car and light truck fleets. Companies are also permitted to carry credits
forward for 5 years (instead of the current 3 years), which should encourage
earlier introduction of new technologies and overcompliance in the initial
years. In addition, EISA provides $25 billion in loans to the auto industry to
assist in meeting the new CAFE standards. In April 2008, the Department
of Transportation issued a proposal to raise fuel economy standards more
rapidly than required by EISA.
In addressing potential energy security concerns, the advantage of CAFE
over some other policies is that it encourages reductions in gasoline consumption, thus reducing not only oil imports but also the economy’s overall
reliance on oil. However, increased CAFE standards do nothing to reduce
externalities related to miles driven (congestion, accidents, noise, local pollution) and will in fact increase these slightly as the per mile cost of driving falls.
In addition, since regulations like CAFE standards that differentiate based
on a vehicle’s age make new vehicles less attractive than existing vehicles, the
regulation may delay the turnover of the vehicle fleet and reduce the realized
environmental benefits of the tighter standards. For such reasons, many
economic analyses suggest that higher fuel taxes may be a more efficient solution to the negative externalities related to fuel consumption. As noted in
Chapter 9, congestion pricing may also be a better way than CAFE to address
many of the negative externalities associated with driving.
In the absence of other policies, increasing fuel economy standards will help
reduce gasoline consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. It is also likely,
as recent trends suggest, that higher fuel prices may persuade consumers to
buy more fuel-efficient vehicles even before the higher mileage standards take
full effect.

110  |  Economic Report of the President

In addition to increasing the fuel economy of our vehicles, fuel efficiency
may be increased by targeting inefficiencies at other points in the transportation
network. For example, municipalities have saved millions of gallons of
fuel and abated associated CO2 emissions by monitoring and retiming
their traffic signals  and have seen significant returns on their signalmanagement investments (see Chapter 9).

Electric Energy Efficiency
The final set of mandates included in EISA is aimed at improving energy
efficiency in electricity use. The Lighting Efficiency Mandate will essentially
phase out the sale of incandescent light bulbs by 2014 and improve lighting
efficiency by more than 65 percent by 2020. The Appliance Efficiency
Mandate sets over 45 new standards for appliances. The Federal Government
Operations Mandate requires Federal agencies to reduce the energy intensity
of their facilities by 30 percent from 2003 levels by 2015 (an increase over the
20 percent reduction requirement set by EPACT 2005). EISA also revised
the Federal Building Energy Efficiency Performance Standards so that fossil
fuel-generated energy use is phased out of new Federal building designs by
2030. While these requirements will undoubtedly deliver efficiency improvements, reductions in fossil fuel use through these and other types of efficiency
standards will be dampened by population and economic growth. In fact,
the Energy Information Administration projects that net electricity consumption will still increase nearly 30 percent by 2030 even after accounting for
the EISA efficiency standards. Furthermore, as in the case of vehicles, it is
important to remember that improvements in electric efficiency will reduce
energy cost per kilowatthour, resulting in some increased use of lighting, air
conditioning, and other electricity-using activities. This rebound effect thus
dampens somewhat the overall impact of the EISA mandates.
There are numerous other promising opportunities to make our
electricity generation, distribution, and consumption more efficient and
reliable. According to the Energy Information Administration, the U.S.
electricity-generation system converts only one-third of total energy inputs
into usable electricity, and about 9 percent of this electricity is lost during
transmission and distribution. One way to increase the efficiency of the
system would be through the use of a so-called “smart electricity grid.” A
smart grid could be able to receive power back from clients. It would thereby
allow greater integration of renewable generation resources and facilitate
distributed electricity generation from small-scale sources such as home
photovoltaic panels and micro-turbines during peak demand times. Using a
two-way communications system, a smart grid would also allow consumers in
areas where electricity prices rise and fall based on real-time demand to shift
energy consumption from high-priced peak demand periods to low-priced
off-peak periods. Finally, by enabling near real-time monitoring of electricity
Chapter 3  |  111

use, a smart grid would give utility companies more time to detect faults and
take steps to prevent the possibility of a blackout. These steps could include
alerting consumers about reducing energy consumption during emergency
periods of peak energy usage. Recent estimates suggest that deployment of
smart-grid technologies could potentially reduce America's annual electricity
usage by up to 4.3 percent by 2030.
The Department of Energy is undertaking many smart-grid planning,
implementation, and awareness activities. EISA also authorized up to $100
million per year over the next 5 years for a smart-grid demonstration initiative
to demonstrate the potential benefits of advanced grid technologies; to facilitate commercial transition from the current system to advanced technologies;
and to improve system performance, power flow control, and reliability.

Cleaner Use of Fossil Fuels
The recent mandates for increased energy efficiency have been further
supported by policies promoting cleaner use of fossil fuels, including numerous
regulations targeting local and regional air pollution and technology deployment incentives, such as tax incentives for advanced coal technologies.

Regulating Local and Regional Air Pollutants
Regulations directed at local and regional air quality problems are and will
continue to be linked to policies to reduce GHG emissions. These policies
often provide co-benefits to each other. For example, to the extent that regulations that target common air pollutants in the transportation sector lower
fossil fuel use and make fossil energy cleaner, they also contribute to more
secure energy with less environmental harm. Similarly, significant air quality
benefits can be expected from climate change mitigation policies. (Note that
the reverse may not be true, since pollution-control equipment consumes
power, which requires greater fossil fuel use (and CO2 emissions) to generate
the same amount of usable energy.) There may be additional savings from
reduced investment in local air pollution controls (such as equipment to
reduce the amount of nitrous oxide (NOX) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) released
into the air from coal-burning power plants) under a future GHG emission
pricing policy that reduces the use of fossil fuels.
According to a number of indicators, air quality has improved dramatically over the past few decades. As shown in Chart 3-3, emissions of many
common air pollutants have decreased, and these trends have continued
through this Administration. For example, between 2000 and 2007, NOX
and volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions (the primary precursors to
ground-level ozone) fell by 23 percent and 12 percent, respectively, and SO2
emissions fell by 19 percent.

112  |  Economic Report of the President

Over the past decade, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
finalized—and is implementing—a suite of regulations on light- and heavyduty vehicles and engines and nonroad mobile sources (such as construction,
agricultural, industrial equipment, locomotives, and marine engines) that are
transforming the diesel engine. The 2004 Clean Air Nonroad Diesel Rule,
for example, is expected to reduce emissions from new nonroad diesel equipment (such as tractors and bulldozers) by over 90 percent from 2004 levels
by 2014 and to reduce sulfur levels in nonroad diesel fuel by 99 percent from
2004 levels by 2010. The Administration has also strengthened the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for three out of the six common air
pollutants: fine particulate matter (PM2.5), ground-level ozone (the primary
component of smog), and lead. Emissions of these pollutants stem from a
wide range of sources and State plans for complying with the new standards
will vary. Unfortunately, several areas, such as parts of California, remain
grossly out of compliance with current NAAQS, and it will be difficult for
some of them to reach compliance within the next couple of decades.
The President’s 2002 Clear Skies Initiative called for using cost-effective,
market-based policy instruments to dramatically reduce power plants’ emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury. Although Clear Skies
legislation did not pass the Congress, in 2005 the EPA took a major step

Chapter 3  |  113

toward a more efficient multipollutant policy in the electricity sector by
finalizing two rules, the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) and the companion
Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), which echoed many features of the Clear
Skies Initiative.
The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) received broad support from
economists, environmental groups, states, policymakers, and the regulated
industry for promoting significant environmental improvements at a lower
cost to society than a traditional command and control type of regulation.
CAIR was designed to provide states with a solution to the problem of
pollution that crosses State boundaries. Covering 28 eastern States and the
District of Columbia, the rule requires the steepest emissions cuts from coalfired power plants required in over a decade implemented in two phases by
2015. When fully implemented, caps on annual NOX and SO2 emissions
would permanently reduce NOX and SO2 from coal-fired power plants in the
eastern United States by more than 60 percent and 70 percent, respectively,
from 2003 levels. The rule is projected to achieve over $100 billion in net
benefits by 2015 (see Table 3-1). In addition to the cost savings from using
a more market-based approach, CAIR’s cap-and-trade program has other
beneficial effects. For example, the cap on NOX would prevent any increases
in aggregate NOX emissions in the East that might otherwise arise from
electricity sector restructuring.
In February 2008, the United States Court of Appeals ruled CAMR to be
unlawful because the EPA had not taken the appropriate steps to regulate
mercury emissions from power plants under a more flexible portion of the
Clean Air Act (CAA) that allows for a cap-and-trade program. Then in July
2008, the Court ruled that the CAIR rule was fundamentally flawed, and
it vacated the entire rule. The ruling was based on several issues, including
that the cap-and-trade program was too focused on regionwide emission
reductions and did not adequately factor in each State’s significant contribution to air pollution issues. For example, the Court deemed that CAIR did
not provide adequate protection for downwind areas. While both rulings
have been appealed through the courts and contested and debated on many
fronts, their invalidation would have substantial consequences because the
underlying requirements of the Clean Air Act remain in place. For example,
all States would have to redo their State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to
demonstrate compliance with CAA requirements and would not be able to
rely on the cost-effective controls built into CAIR. The thousands of premature deaths avoided annually and other significant health and environmental
gains would come at a higher price, if at all, in the absence of a fix for these
rules that retains their trading provisions. After receiving petitions from a
range of industry groups, States, and the Administration, in December 2008
a Federal appeals court reversed the earlier decision on CAIR, allowing for the

reinstatement of the rule until EPA crafts a replacement. This reversal helps
to avoid a prolonged period of regulatory uncertainty that may result in the
reduction or elimination of pollution-control construction projects.

Developing Cleaner Fossil Fuel Technology
In addition to regulating local and regional air pollutants, the Administration
has promoted cleaner ways to use our domestic fossil fuels through the use of
tax incentives. For example, EPACT broadened the scope of the investment
tax credits (ITCs) for renewable energy production to apply to investments in
certain clean coal facilities, such as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle
(IGCC) power plants, which rely on a two-stage process in which pollutants

Chapter 3  |  115

are removed before combustion occurs. Recent research shows that the
20 percent ITC for new IGCC plants potentially could make this technology
cost-competitive with new conventional coal plants. Because of their
inherently higher operating efficiency, IGCC plants are estimated to
produce up to 8 percent fewer CO2 emissions per megawatt hour (mWh)
than conventional coal plants. Furthermore, capturing and store the CO2
emissions underground (known as carbon capture and sequestration, or
CCS) would be less expensive in an IGCC plant than in a conventional
power plant. Also, the IGCC process produces very low levels of common air
pollutants (NOX, SO2, and PM) and volatile mercury, which reduces the cost
of compliance with regulations of these emissions. To date, two 260–290
megawatt (mW) IGCC power plants are in operation in the United States
and others are in the pipeline. A third, larger facility (with 630 mW capacity)
received approval in January 2008.

Removing Regulatory Impediments to Domestic
Production
Finally, the Administration has worked to remove regulatory impediments
to bringing domestic energy sources, including fossil fuels, to market. In July
2008, the President lifted the Executive restriction on offshore exploration and
requested that the Congress also lift its ban. On September 30, 2008, the ban
on offshore domestic exploration of natural gas and oil was allowed to expire,
a decision that would allow open access to an estimated 14 billion barrels of
oil and nearly 55 trillion cubic feet of gas off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.
These previously restricted areas represent a sizable portion of the estimated
101 billion barrels of oil and 480 trillion cubic feet of natural gas untapped
on the outer continental shelf. While we strive toward the long-term goal of
reducing the economy’s overall reliance on oil for environmental and security
reasons, expanded domestic oil and gas production in these areas will help reduce
the $300 billion Americans spend each year on net petroleum imports.

Overarching Challenges
Despite widespread support for increasing the use of market-oriented
approaches to achieve our environmental and energy policy goals going
forward, numerous challenges remain in realizing the full potential of these
types of policies.

116  |  Economic Report of the President

Balancing Local, Regional and Global Goals
First, any future comprehensive national energy policy will need to address
potential tradeoffs between environmental and security goals, as well as
tradeoffs between competing environmental goals. As noted earlier, policies
aimed at mitigating local air pollution can at times reduce GHG and vice
versa. For example, the clean diesel programs may provide climate change
benefits by reducing black carbon (soot), the climate change effects of which
require further study but many argue could be quite substantial. (The clean
diesel rules will also likely become more significant if there is an increase
in the number of diesel vehicles due to policies aimed at improving fuel
economy and reducing GHG emissions from mobile sources.) However,
some air quality policies may result in “technology lock-in” that could cause
major delays in the implementation of GHG control technologies because of
the investment in capital and other resources to meet the air quality control
requirements. Policies aimed at GHG mitigation may also at times increase
emissions of traditional pollutants. For example, technology standards
that require increasing the thermal efficiency of engines may lead designers
to achieve the regulatory objective by raising combustion temperatures, a
strategy that would tend to increase NOX emissions unless countered by other
control methods. The challenge going forward will be to design comprehensive policies that enhance synergies and reduce the degree to which policies
may work at odds with one another.
There are additional conflicts that will continue to arise in achieving long
term environmental goals. For example, in the transition to alternative energy
sources, where will new facilities and transmission infrastructure for different
types of electricity generation be built? This issue is especially contentious
when talking about new nuclear facilities, large scale CCS facilities, and
renewable sources such as off-shore wind turbines. Renewable energy facilities generally face greater siting hurdles than their conventional counterparts
because they can only be located at certain sites. The most highly valued
renewable resources are often in pristine, isolated parts of the country (like
mountain ridges, open plains, and coastal waters) with significant environmental and aesthetic value. Siting hurdles are compounded by the additional
transmission and distribution infrastructure that is needed to bring the electricity from remote generation sites to population centers. States will have
to balance renewable energy goals with other environmental concerns in
deciding whether to support investment in new transmission infrastructure,
such as new regional transmission corridors. Similarly, there are significant
challenges that must be faced in expanding or reconfiguring existing fuel
distribution systems to accommodate the large volumes of ethanol and other
biofuels required by EISA.

Chapter 3  |  117

Obstacles to increased nuclear power generation extend beyond the hurdles
of siting power plants. There is also a concern about the lack of long-term
storage for the spent fuel generated by nuclear plants. To reduce the amount
of spent fuel that must be properly contained for centuries, efforts may also
be made to increase recycling of this fuel within the generation process, but
without producing weapons-grade material. The Administration has laid the
groundwork for tackling this issue through efforts such as the Global Nuclear
Energy Partnership (GNEP) and the Nuclear Power 2010 joint government–
industry effort to develop advanced nuclear plant technology and reduce
technical, regulatory, and institutional barriers to nuclear deployment.

Efficient R&D Support for Alternative Energy Sources
Technology policies will continue to be an important component of any
energy policy portfolio going forward. Many economists maintain that, as a
complement to any pricing policy directed at environmental problems, governments will need to support R&D for alternative energy sources. The challenge
will be to ensure that any R&D support is managed efficiently and effectively.
As discussed above, an emission pricing policy is a key step in inducing
technological change at low cost because the emissions price provides the
private sector with a direct incentive to invest in and deploy new environment-friendly innovations. Well-targeted technology policy can reinforce
these incentives for private R&D and thus reduce future costs. Basic and
applied energy-related research as well as the education of the next generation
of researchers will continue to be in particular need of government support,
because these areas are the least likely to be undertaken by the private sector.
It will also be crucial to expand the use of more flexible research policy instruments that allow the market, rather than government, to pick technology
winners. For example, the Government could award prizes for basic research
advancements in energy storage, which would help to spur innovation in
a wide range of low-carbon technologies. Efforts are already underway to
expand the use of prizes in some areas. EISA provided authorization for an
L-prize for high-efficiency solid-state lighting products and an H-prize for
advancements in hydrogen technology.
Current policies that target the adoption or deployment phase of the
technological development process also need reviewing. Many of the existing
tax credits have been found to be costly ways of making renewable sources
competitive with fossil fuel sources. However, if technology deployment
incentives are needed, they should be applied in a way that is neutral across
all alternatives. Existing subsidies such as the ethanol blender’s tax credit,
flex-fuel vehicle credits, and subsidies for alternative electricity generation,
in combination with the growing use of existing residential deductions and
credits for energy-efficient home improvements, have created a patchwork
118  |  Economic Report of the President

of incentives that send an inconsistent message about how much the
abatement of a ton of carbon is worth. In addition, there are opportunity
costs associated with resources devoted to any area of research or deployment
support. For example, in the context of renewable fuels, additional support
for first-generation biofuels such as corn ethanol reduces the amount of
funding available for the development of other alternatives and could make
it more difficult for second-generation biofuels (with potentially significantly
lower GHG emissions) to become viable.
Going forward, it will be important to reform these subsidies so as to
minimize market distortions. One way existing tax incentives could be
simplified is to offer a single subsidy in which the payment is weighted by the
extent to which petroleum consumption and/or carbon is reduced relative to
a baseline technology. In April 2008, the President voiced strong support
for such a reform of the current complicated mix of incentives to make
the commercialization and use of new, lower emission technologies more
competitive. Another policy instrument that could encourage commercial
use of new energy-efficient technology at a lower cost to the taxpayer is the
reverse auction, in which would-be subsidy recipients (such as a renewable
energy project developer) submit proposals for new projects and bid the
minimum price they would accept for zero- or low-carbon electricity generation. However, such technology adoption policies may still favor what are
currently the least expensive technologies, rather than technologies that may
have greater potential to reduce cost and improve environmental performance
through learning by doing.

Economically Efficient Regulation Under Existing
Statutes
Another significant challenge in realizing the full potential of marketoriented policy approaches is likely to be the ability of existing laws to address
old and new environmental problems in more efficient ways.

Local and Regional Air Pollutants
Although there have been great gains in reducing common air pollutants
under the Clean Air Act, air pollution will continue to be a problem in the
future, and the importance of finding economically efficient ways to further
improve air quality will only increase. As seen in the 2008 National Ambient
Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone, stricter standards have moved the
private sector up the marginal cost-of-control curve. That is, it is becoming
more costly to reduce each additional ton of NOX and VOC emissions (the
precursors to ground-level ozone). Upcoming reviews of the NAAQS for
other pollutants will undoubtedly reveal a similar trend. These trends do
not shed light on the relative cost of controlling one pollutant over others,
Chapter 3  |  119

due to the sequential nature of the individual NAAQS reviews. However, it
is likely to spark debate about the benefits of moving either toward a more
integrated multipollutant approach to controlling emissions of pollutants
that pose the most significant risks or toward a more goal-oriented standard
setting, as there may be no level that adequately protects human health and
the environment for some pollutants (for example, lead), and currently costs
cannot be considered in setting a NAAQS.
A multipollutant approach can help reduce the costs of meeting standards
in regulated industries, such as the electricity sector, in which power plants
face an increasingly complex set of requirements under the current Clean
Air Act (CAA) (see Chart 3-4). The President’s Clear Skies Initiative was an
important first step in establishing a multipollutant approach. It is important
that the market-oriented aspects of the CAIR and CAMR rules not be lost
upon being remanded to the EPA for revision. The Administration has also
made efforts to reform the complex requirements for upgrading or building
new power plants under the New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air
Act. Such age differentiated regulations can create a disincentive to invest in
energy efficiency improvements, thus slowing turnover in the capital stock
(equipment and facilities) and pollution abatement. The debate over how
best to reduce such counterproductive incentives will undoubtedly continue
in the future.

120  |  Economic Report of the President

Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Existing statutes are not well suited to tackling problems that were not
considered when the original laws were written. In the context of climate
change, the unique characteristics of GHGs and the ubiquity of GHG
emission sources present significant challenges for economically efficient regulatory design under the existing Clean Air Act or other statutes. Unlike most
traditional air pollutants, GHG emissions become well mixed throughout
the global atmosphere, so a unit of GHG emissions has the same effect on
environmental quality regardless of where it comes from, and, once emitted,
GHGs can remain in the atmosphere for decades to centuries. Therefore,
while policies can control the flow of GHG emissions, the ultimate concern is
the stock—the cumulative concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere. These
characteristics suggest that GHGs are particularly well suited to marketoriented policies that do not dictate the exact location and timing of emission
reductions as opposed to the command and control type of regulation under
the CAA that is used for some other pollutants.
There are examples of CAA regulations in which market-oriented
approaches have been used for groups of mobile or stationary sources, such
as in the Acid Rain Control Program, and even some cases in which multisector trading programs have been established. However, economists have
demonstrated that taking a more integrated approach to control GHGs,
such as through a common cap or price on emissions across sectors, would
allow the market to identify a combination of methods to reduce the cost of
achieving a given emission reduction. For example, expanding the coverage
of such a market-oriented policy to include the industrial, electricity, and
transportation sectors has been found to substantially decrease the cost of
achieving a given emission reduction compared to one that is limited to the
electricity and transportation sectors. However, if a policymaker’s goal is to
transform technology in a single area to the point where developing countries
would voluntarily adopt the new low-carbon technology, then the advantage
of a sector-specific approach is that it may help to ensure that technology
investment remains within that sector.
It is unclear whether it would be legally possible to implement an
economy-wide system for GHGs under the CAA. However, any economywide program under one provision of the CAA would likely trigger additional
source-specific or sector-based requirements as a result of other CAA provisions, thus resulting in multiple programs affecting a particular sector, source
category, or GHG. With multiple market-oriented policies focused on the
same problem, the overall emissions reductions may not be achieved in the
least costly way because there would not be a common price of pollution
across all activities that directly result in GHG emissions. Without such a
common price, full trading opportunities to reduce control costs will not be

Chapter 3  |  121

realized. In addition, emissions leakage across sectors and countries can occur
when the cost of reducing one ton of emissions differs across them. When
faced with a high cost of complying with new environmental regulations, a
firm may move its operations to a jurisdiction with less stringent (and less
costly) emissions controls. Current requirements under the CAA do not
consider the actions (or inaction) of other countries or allow for consideration
of unequal treatment of emissions across different types of emitters.
The Clean Air Act is also not designed to implement any carbon-pricing
policy so that it operates in an efficient and transparent manner. For example,
economists suggest that it would be economically efficient to employ a broadbased emissions tax, using the proceeds to decrease distortionary taxes. A
well designed cap-and-trade system can have much in common with a well
designed tax, but policy considerations should weigh heavily on how emissions allowances would be distributed under such a program. The economic
literature broadly finds that there are significant efficiency advantages to
auctioning emissions allowances, particularly if the revenues are used for
reducing existing distortionary taxes. Also, cost-containment provisions in a
cap-and-trade program, such as a safety valve allowance price, help to prevent
caps from resulting in allowance prices that are higher than the social cost
of the emissions. However, the CAA does not authorize the EPA to impose
taxes or to administer a broad cap-and-trade program with auctioning and
cost-containment provisions, making the Act ill suited to address the unique
challenges posed by GHG emissions.
The globalized nature of GHG emissions is also likely to create difficulties
in other statutes, such as the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which were designed to address local
or regional concerns. For example, the ESA requires consultation between
Federal agencies when a Federal action is likely to cause effects that pose a
threat to a listed species.   However, because the effects of GHG emissions
have global repercussions, any causal connection between the effects of any
particular action and the loss of a listed animal or its habitat is not discernible,
or at least not significant or proximate enough to warrant such consultation.
Similarly, the types of environmental impacts included in NEPA analyses
are local or regional in nature and do not fit into the complexities related
to global climate change effects.
Given the difficulties in applying existing statutes to the unique problems
presented by GHGs, policymakers should seek new approaches for enacting
comprehensive and market-oriented solutions. The scientific debate over
the specific GHG concentrations needed to affect global temperatures and
the probability of catastrophic damages will continue for some time, and the
policy debate over tough questions such as to how to value future emissions
reductions is far from settled. In the face of such uncertainty and discussion

122  |  Economic Report of the President

of numerous other policy design issues, flexibility and transparency will be
vital to the success of any policy designed to address global climate change.

Global Action on Climate Change
Finally, perhaps the most significant challenge in tackling climate change
is developing broad-based global action to make meaningful progress in
reducing GHG emissions.
As shown in Chart 3-5, U.S. greenhouse gas intensity (as measured by GHG
emissions per unit of GDP) has been improving over time. In 2002, the
President set a goal of reducing U.S. GHG intensity by 18 percent by 2012,
and the Nation is on track to meet and exceed this target. Between 2002 and
2007, both energy-related CO2 emissions per unit of GDP and total GHG
emissions per unit of GDP declined by about 10 percent. In the spring of
2008, the President also set a new goal to stop U.S. growth in total GHG emissions by 2025. Despite U.S. action toward meeting these or future domestic
GHG reduction targets, it is important to understand that U.S. action alone
will not reverse global emission growth or stabilize global atmospheric GHG
concentrations. Many assert that it is the responsibility of developed countries to reduce GHG emissions, since they have a longer historical record of
emissions and therefore are responsible for most of the existing atmospheric
concentrations. This formulation does not account for the reduction in the

Chapter 3  |  123

natural absorption of CO2 (for example, in forests) due to land-use change that
has occurred throughout the world. More important, actions by developed
countries alone will not stabilize atmospheric concentrations given the recent
and projected emissions growth in large rapidly developing economies.
Chart 3-6 provides one example of why it is important for all countries,
particularly major economies involved in negotiations, to limit GHG emissions. The chart shows the future path of global CO2 concentrations if the
United States takes action to reduce GHG emissions under various cap-andtrade bills recently debated in Congress. One of the main reasons why future
global concentrations do not decrease substantially compared to the reference
case (which is a business-as-usual case that includes current international
efforts to address climate change) is that major emerging economies represent
a large and growing share of global GHG emissions. In addition, international emissions leakage may reduce global mitigation if only a handful of
countries take action. Just as sector-based regulation of GHG emissions
under the CAA raises worry about potential leakage of emissions across source
categories, there are concerns about potential shifts in GHG emissions to
countries where GHGs face no regulations. Energy-intensive industries in
which domestic firms would face significantly higher costs due to regulation
may move operations to unregulated foreign markets where costs are lower.
International sectoral agreements in energy-intensive industries can help
alleviate some of these competitiveness concerns.

124  |  Economic Report of the President

It is clear from the projections above, as well as other recent analyses of
climate mitigation scenarios, that climate change requires a global solution,
with participation by all major economies. The Administration has recently
taken several steps to encourage wider international action to address GHGs,
including promoting consensus toward commitments in developing countries. In 2007, the Administration launched the Major Economies Meeting
(MEM) process, involving those of the world’s major economies that use the
most energy and emit the most GHGs, to help promote international action
to slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of GHGs. This process is
intended to support the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) negotiations by elaborating on areas of shared understanding among the major GHG emitters. At the July 2008 MEM meeting
in Japan, leaders issued a Leaders Declaration that emphasizes “ambitious,
realistic, and achievable” steps toward achieving these goals and agreement
to take near-term actions. Leaders agreed to continue to work together to
promote the success of the negotiations under the UNFCCC.
In addition to achieving commitments by all major economies, accelerating
the deployment of clean energy technology in emerging economies is critical
to mitigating climate change. To this end, the United States has taken several
steps to form international partnerships to support national climate change
efforts. In 2007, the Administration led efforts to produce an international
agreement to accelerate the phase-out of the hydrochlorofluorocarbon
(HCFC) refrigerants—a potent GHG—under the Montreal Protocol on
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Under this agreement, both
developed and developing countries explicitly agreed to accept binding
and enforceable commitments that have climate change benefits. In 2008,
the President launched the Clean Technology Fund to help bridge the gap
between current technology and cleaner, more efficient ways of fueling
the world’s growth. The President has asked Congress for an initial U.S.
commitment of $2 billion, and many other nations have pledge support.
Altogether, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany,
Sweden, Australia, and Spain have pledged over $5 billion to the Fund, which
will be housed at and overseen by the World Bank.
To be eligible for funding, a project must be consistent with the recipient
country’s national low-carbon growth strategy and must help move the relevant industry or sector toward a clean-energy path. Competition is intended
to be technology-neutral, with projects competing for financing based on
lifetime GHG reductions compared to the baseline technology and relative to
the Fund’s investment. The recipient country would contribute public and/
or private capital to meet the project’s baseline costs. The Clean Technology
Fund would help finance the cost difference between the clean energy
technology and the standard baseline, higher-emissions technology.

Chapter 3  |  125

In partnership with the European Union, the United States also
proposed the Environmental Goods and Services Agreement in the
World Trade Organization (WTO) to eliminate tariff and non-tariff
barriers to environmental technologies and services. This proposal included an
agreement in the WTO to eliminate tariffs worldwide on 43 climate-friendly
technologies identified by the World Bank. It also included a higher level
of commitment from developed and most advanced developing countries to
eliminate trade barriers across a broader range of goods and services. Global
trade in the environmental goods covered by the proposal totaled approximately
$613 billion in 2006, and global exports of these goods have grown annually
by an average of 15 percent since 2000. The World Bank suggests that
by removing trade barriers on key technologies, trade could increase by an
additional 7 to 14 percent annually.
Other international partnerships to pursue development and diffusion of
clean energy include the 21-member Global Nuclear Energy Partnership
(GNEP) and the 7-country Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development
and Climate (APP). These are primarily sectoral efforts to support national
climate change efforts. The GNEP, announced by the President in 2006,
focuses on promoting technology breakthroughs to support the long-term
expansion of clean, safe, proliferation-resistant nuclear power here and
abroad. As mentioned earlier, safer ways to deal with storage of nuclear waste
are crucial to this effort. The APP has a somewhat broader mission. It aims
to promote coordination among different sectors to create new investment
opportunities, build local capacity, and remove barriers to the introduction
of a wide range of cleaner, more efficient technologies.

Conclusion
Energy policy will continue to be one of the major challenges facing the
United States for many years to come. As the Federal Government moves
toward a more integrated approach in confronting energy security, climate
change, and other environmental challenges, we will need to ensure that we
consider the economic efficiency of future laws and regulations. In addition
to advancing clean and renewable energy technologies, a key challenge going
forward will be leading all countries to work cooperatively to achieve global
climate goals with meaningful participation by all major economies.

The Benefits of Open Trade and
Investment Policies

A

n open economy is characterized by receptiveness to foreign ideas,
technology, products, services, and investment. The United States has
one of the most open economies in the world, ranking very high in common
measures of openness to trade and investment. As a large and diverse
economy, the United States engages in more trade and investment than any
other country in dollar terms, and it also has, on average, very low barriers to
cross-border flows of goods, services, and capital.
In the long run, open economic policies generate many benefits. Trade
and investment linkages with other countries increase competition in
domestic industries; enhance the purchasing power of consumers; provide
exposure to new products, services, and ideas from abroad; and give domestic
firms wider markets in which to sell goods and services. In the short run, the
interdependence among open economies generally provides benefits—open
economies may rely on foreign borrowing or foreign demand for domestically
produced exports to cushion an economic downturn—but may also create
visible costs that obscure these benefits, as when foreign investment shifts
abruptly out of certain sectors or when foreign demand for domestic exports
falls. Nevertheless, any potential negative effects from our openness to trade
and investment do not outweigh the enormous gains society has realized over
decades from this openness.
This chapter begins with a discussion of key facts about trade and investment
in the United States, followed by a discussion of the benefits of free trade and
open investment, and the policies that the United States has taken to enhance
both. These policies include an increased number of free trade agreements
(FTAs) and the strong commitment of the United States to maintain openness
to foreign direct investment (FDI) while still addressing legitimate national
security concerns. The chapter continues with a discussion of international
development assistance, and concludes with a review of issues that could affect
future U.S. trade policy. The key points of this chapter are:
•	 Openness to trade and investment has boosted U.S. economic growth.
Openness can also reduce the impact of shocks and increase the resilience
of the U.S. economy.
•	 The number of U.S. FTAs has increased greatly during this
Administration, and these agreements have contributed to the growth
in U.S. exports.

127

•	 Portfolio and direct investment into the United States reached historic
levels over the past decade, in part due to the depth, diversity, and openness
of U.S. financial markets and the competitiveness of U.S. firms.
•	 The United States has maintained an open investment policy, facilitating
FDI flows between the United States and the world while addressing
legitimate national security concerns.
•	 U.S. development and trade initiatives, as well as U.S. engagement in
multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization and
the World Bank have helped increase growth and foster political and
economic stability in developing countries throughout the world.
•	 Continued commitment to open economic policies throughout the
world will help ensure continued economic gains for the United States
and the rest of the world.

Trade and Investment in the United States
Trade in goods and services has played an increased role in the U.S.
economy over the past decade. As seen in Table 4-1, in the first half of 2008,
the United States exported goods and services equivalent to 13.0 percent of
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and imported goods and services equal to
18.1 percent of GDP. These figures are the highest on record, considerably above figures from 2000, when exports were equal to 10.9 percent, and
imports 14.8 percent, of GDP. The current account, which measures the net
value of the flow of current international transactions, is chiefly composed
of the difference between exports and imports. The U.S. current account
deficit widened over this period from 4.1 percent of GDP in the first quarter
of 2000 to a peak of 6.6 percent of GDP in the final quarter of 2005. The
current account deficit then narrowed to 4.8 percent of GDP at the end of
2007 before expanding slightly over the first half of 2008.

As a matter of accounting, the current account deficit is mirrored by net
inflows of capital into the United States, which have provided the financing
that has allowed us to purchase more in imports than we sell in exports. From
Table 4-1, we can see that net capital inflows into the United States were equal
to 4.7 percent of GDP in the first half of 2008, a figure that approximately
matches the current account deficit, with a discrepancy caused by measurement errors, omissions, and the exclusion of certain types of capital flows for
which only partial data are available. The increase in net capital inflows looks
modest compared with the huge increase in capital inflows to and outflows
from the United States from 2000 to 2007, although the data for 2008 imply
a sharp decline to levels lower than those of 2000 as a percentage of GDP.

Openness to Trade and Investment Has Substantially
Contributed to U.S. Growth
Many studies have shown that greater openness to trade and investment
is associated with faster growth in the long run. There are many ways to
measure openness, including by looking at both the extent of trade and
investment and the size of barriers to these flows. By either measure, countries that increased openness have grown faster and have had greater increases
in living standards than countries that have remained less open. Research
has not yet conclusively determined the incremental gain in income that a
country receives from a specific increase in trade because the exact change can
depend on particular policies and circumstances.
In the current U.S. downturn that began at the end of 2007, trade has
improved the resiliency of the U.S. economy. Strong global demand for U.S.
goods and services in 2007 and the first half of 2008 boosted U.S. GDP
growth in this period. As the trade deficit declined, the improvement in net
exports (exports minus imports) became a sizeable contributor to U.S. growth
in this period. Chart 4-1 shows real GDP growth and the contribution of net
exports to that growth since 2001. Net exports have accounted for over half
of real GDP growth in the past 2 years. Some of the recent U.S. strength in
net exports has likely been driven by the depreciation of the dollar. The value
of the dollar declined fairly steadily from its peak in 2002 to the summer of
2008, when it reached a level last seen in the mid-1990s. The depreciated
dollar contributed to the increase in exports and the decline in real imports.
In the second half of 2008, however, the value of the dollar increased, in part
reflecting increased international demand for U.S. Treasury bonds in a time
of global turmoil and rapidly deteriorating global growth.
The deteriorating performance of foreign economies in the second half of
2008 has recently reduced demand for U.S. exports. In the most recent U.S.
data through October, both imports and exports have begun to decline, as
they did during the global slowdown of 2001–02. The decline in exports will
Chapter 4  |  129

likely reduce the contribution of trade to GDP growth in the short term, and
net exports may provide no boost to growth in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Trade may still hold up better than other components of GDP, however, as
consumption and investment are expected to decline enough to make overall
GDP growth negative in the short term (see the discussion of the near-term
macroeconomic environment in Chapter 1).
Strong global demand for goods drove up prices of a broad range of
commodities through the middle of 2008, but global weakness in the second
half of the year has reversed most of these gains. This is good news for users,
both consumers and producers, but raises some concerns for the exporters
that had benefited from the higher prices. However, the broad-based decline
in prices of oil, food, and agricultural commodities has considerably eased
earlier fears of inflation.

The Benefits of Free Trade
Free trade contributes to economic prosperity in many ways. One of
the greatest benefits of trade is that international differences in prices allow
countries to utilize their comparative advantage, because trade gives a country
access to goods and services at relatively low prices, while simultaneously

130  |  Economic Report of the President

allowing domestic producers to find profitable export markets in which to
sell goods that can be produced at lower prices at home than abroad. Trade
allows a nation to achieve higher overall consumption of goods and services
than would be possible if no trade occurred. Trade also benefits consumers
by increasing the number and variety of goods available domestically.
Trade raises the productivity of domestic firms in multiple ways: (1) Trade
shifts production toward goods in which the country has a comparative
advantage, so that over time, capital and labor will become concentrated in
relatively more productive sectors, raising national income; (2) trade connects
domestic producers to new technology and a greater variety of inputs, and
it exposes them to more competition; and (3) firms that gain access to new
markets can increase average productivity as unit costs fall, thus benefiting
from what economists call economies of scale in production. Because trade
allows the most productive firms and sectors to increase their share of U.S.
production, trade makes possible increases in productivity, profitability, and
wages that raise national standards of living.
Firms engaged in export trade provide important benefits to the economy.
Exporting firms are a large engine of growth and employment in the U.S.
economy. In 2006, 20 percent of manufacturing jobs were generated directly
or indirectly by exports. Not only do exporters play a major role in job
creation, but on average, productivity per worker is up to one-quarter higher
in exporting firms than in nonexporters, and exporters pay each worker 13–18
percent more. Some of this exceptional performance occurs because exporters
tend to concentrate in productive industries, but exporters also have higher
productivity and higher wages than nonexporting firms in the same sector.
Among exporting firms, multinational enterprises, which own and control
business operations in more than one county, account for an important share
of U.S. trade and productivity growth. In the United States, U.S.-owned
multinationals account for over one-half of total exports, and over 90 percent
of U.S. exports to manufacturing affiliates were inputs for further processing.
The extent of trade in intermediate inputs is an indication that trade is part
of an increasingly complex chain, and companies have substantially improved
productivity through the development of these global supply chains. Research
shows that multinationals in the United States, both U.S.-owned and U.S.
affiliates of foreign companies, were responsible for more than half of the
increase in U.S. nonfarm labor productivity between 1977 and 2000.
Trade, while broadly beneficial, does not reward all people equally, and
changes in trade can negatively affect some workers. In some cases, workers
can receive lower wages when trade liberalization reduces the price of goods
and services that they produce, and workers can lose jobs when imports
reduce domestic production or jobs are relocated overseas. Over time,
however, increased trade has made the United States more productive and
has contributed to large increases in the U.S. standard of living. Estimates
Chapter 4  |  131

of the gains to the United States from the postwar increase in global trade
and the reduction in global trade barriers range up to $1 trillion dollars per
year, or about $10,000 per household. In other cases, the use of global
supply chains has led to the displacement of some U.S. workers, but as
noted above, multinational companies generate considerable benefits for
U.S. workers, generating high-wage jobs, substantial employment, and
considerable improvements to U.S. productivity.
Although some jobs are lost due to trade, there are many other reasons
for job loss in the United States, such as technological change and domestic
competition. The United States has several programs to help workers adjust
to displacements caused by trade. Chief among these programs is Trade
Adjustment Assistance (see Box 8-2 in Chapter 8), which provides benefits
and training to workers whose jobs are affected by trade and promotes their
rapid reemployment.

Free Trade Agreements
Trade policy is an important determinant of a country’s openness to trade,
and hence of its growth. In the past 8 years, U.S. policy has supported
engagement in global free trade, which has been most evident in the increase
in the number of U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs). FTAs are agreements that eliminate tariffs on substantially all trade between two or more
countries; U.S. FTAs also reduce other barriers, such as restrictions on
services trade and investment. Before 2001, the United States had implemented FTAs with three countries. To date, the United States has concluded
FTAs with 20 countries, including 16 in force, one approved by Congress but
not yet in force, and three concluded but not yet approved by Congress. The
United States has concluded FTAs with trading partners on five continents
and with three of our top 10 trading partners. In addition, the United States
is currently negotiating FTAs with Malaysia and the members of the TransPacific Strategic Economic Partnership. Chart 4-2 illustrates the progress
of U.S. FTAs since 2000, from negotiation to the President’s signature to
enactment by Congress to being fully in force.
FTAs can dramatically increase trade. U.S. exports to countries whose
FTAs came into force during this Administration increased 61 percent
from 2000 to 2007, while U.S. imports from these countries increased
26 percent. Recent research shows that, on average worldwide, FTAs increase
trade among member countries by about a third after 5 years and more than
double trade after 15 years. Because many U.S. FTAs have been in force for
less than 5 years, the experience of other countries suggests that these FTAs
may continue to expand trade for another decade.
Increased duty-free trade has substantially reduced costs to U.S. importers
and exporters and also lowered prices for U.S. consumers. In 2007, 41 percent
132  |  Economic Report of the President

of U.S. exports went to FTA partners, and over 98 percent of U.S. products
were eligible to enter these foreign markets duty free. In the same year,
31 percent of U.S. imports came from FTA partners, and 95 percent of
these imports entered the United States duty free. The reduction in tariffs
and quantitative limits, such as quotas, on goods trade in FTAs provides
important benefits. Countries gain over time when they liberalize their own
market, because capital and labor relocate to sectors in which they will be
used more efficiently. Countries also gain immediately when FTA partners
liberalize, because this liberalization lowers trade costs and improves the
competitive position of exporters.
The size of initial foreign trade barriers is an important determinant
of potential export gains from FTAs. One reason that U.S. exports to
recent FTA partners increased more than imports from them did, is that
in most cases, prior to these agreements, foreign tariffs were higher than
U.S. tariffs. Many of these countries apply relatively high tariffs to imports
from non-FTA partners, so U.S. FTAs considerably reduced costs to U.S.
exporters and improved their competitive position. In contrast, goods from
these countries were often already eligible to enter the United States duty
free. Several FTA partners also had prior preferential access to the U.S.
market under programs such as the Andean Trade Preferences Act and the
Generalized System of Preferences, which are discussed in the development
assistance section below.
Chapter 4  |  133

U.S. FTAs also contain many beneficial nontariff provisions; particularly
important are investment and services liberalization. Because of investment
provisions in U.S. FTAs, U.S. companies that operate abroad benefit from
more transparent and less burdensome regulation and greater certainty for
investors. Developing countries can benefit from an improved legal framework at home and from the stability of permanent preferential access to
U.S. markets, which can make the countries more attractive to international
investment in all sectors. Liberalization of foreign services markets can
improve access to the telecommunications, financial services, professional
services, and other sectors. This access can generate large trade and welfare
gains because of the high barriers to services trade in many countries.
Reducing barriers to investment and services can have large effects on trade
and even greater effects on economic welfare than tariff liberalization does.
FTAs have dramatically increased trade in some sectors with preexisting low,
or even zero, tariff rates, demonstrating the positive effects of nontariff liberalizations. International data on barriers to services trade and investment flows
are less precise than data on goods trade, so estimates vary, but recent research
on U.S. FTAs shows that increased investment and reductions in services
barriers can each provide more than twice the gains in purchasing power than
can tariff liberalizations alone.
Quantifying the gains from FTAs is difficult because of the many uncertainties involved in estimating the effects that these agreements have on trade
flows and on the behavior of producers and consumers, and because data limitations make some benefits currently unquantifiable. One series of reports that
has focused on only the gains from tariff liberalizations under all U.S. FTAs
finds that U.S. consumers gain about $22 billion in increased purchasing
power annually. Other studies, though necessarily more speculative, have
also included the gains from greater economies of scale, more product variety,
long-run gains from capital accumulation, and reduced services barriers.
These studies suggest that cumulatively, U.S. FTAs, both those in force and
those pending, could increase U.S. purchasing power by about $150 billion,
equivalent to about $1,300 per U.S. household, annually.

Reductions in Tariffs
The United States has one of the lowest average tariff rates in the world.
U.S. average tariff rates have been steadily decreasing as duty-free imports
from FTA partners have increased in the past decade. The trade-weighted
average tariff rate, which gives each of over 11,000 tariff rates a weight equal
to the value of U.S. imports in that sector, has been below 2 percent since
1999, and has now fallen below 1.4 percent. Trade-weighted averages can
be misleading, however. Because high tariffs reduce trade, sectors with high
tariffs are counted less when weighting by trade. The restrictiveness of U.S.
134  |  Economic Report of the President

tariffs is better measured by calculating a single, “uniform” tariff that would
produce the same volume of trade (or the same purchasing power for U.S.
consumers) if applied to all sectors. Recent estimates of such a uniform
tariff have been near 5 to 6 percent for the United States. This higher value
captures a number of relatively high U.S. tariffs, particularly in agriculture,
that are not well represented by the average rate.
The U.S. “uniform” tariff rate of 5 to 6 percent is lower than comparable
estimates of tariff protection in major U.S. trading partners, both developing
and developed. As in the United States, agricultural tariffs are a major
source of other countries’ high rates of protection. Because high agricultural protection is a global concern, efforts to reduce it are best negotiated
in multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO),
which is currently negotiating the Doha Round of trade liberalizations (initiated in Doha, Qatar). The United States and numerous other countries
have proposed ambitious reductions in both agricultural tariffs and tradedistorting agricultural subsidies (see Box 4-1) that are critical to a successful
market-opening outcome of the Doha Round.
Box 4-1: Farm Subsidies
Government payments to the farm sector have been part of U.S. farm
policy since the 1930s, with the goal of increasing the standard of living
of American farmers. Although they benefit some farmers, government payments can induce economically wasteful overproduction by
encouraging production of higher-cost goods that would be unprofitable
without subsidies. Thus, subsidies can generate costs to taxpayers that
exceed the benefits received by U.S. producers and consumers. Due to
the rise of large commercial farms, subsidies have also become increasingly directed toward high-income farmers. In 2006, farm households
with an income over $100,000 received the majority of government
payments (compared with the median U.S. household income of
approximately $48,000). In addition to monetary costs, farm subsidies
can also raise other concerns. Some subsidies require that land be
reserved for specific crops, potentially limiting the variety of foodstuffs
in local communities, and subsidy-induced production may raise fertilizer use, which contributes to environmentally damaging runoff.
Despite the fact that farm income in the United States is forecast to
reach record levels in 2008, taxpayers will provide a projected $13 billion
in payments to U.S. farmers this year. In real terms, direct government
payments have come down by over half since 2000, when they were
the highest ever, even exceeding payments during the farm debt crisis

Box 4-1 — continued
of the 1980s. This decline was driven primarily by higher market prices
for agricultural commodities, rather than by policy initiatives to reduce
support. For example, government payments under several programs
that provide support when commodity prices drop below a threshold
level have declined over 80 percent since 2005, while farm bills, such as
the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, continue most existing
support programs.
Agricultural subsidies are widespread in developed countries, although
they represent a lower share of gross farm receipts in the United States
than in the EU and in many other countries, including Japan, Korea,
and Canada. Because subsidies can impose greater costs than benefits,
reducing subsidies would increase incomes and economic welfare;
indeed, research suggests eliminating agricultural subsidies in developed countries would increase U.S. welfare by several billion dollars
per year. In developing countries, reducing subsidies would raise agricultural prices and improve the lives of producers, although it could
also raise the cost of some food for consumers. Given the prevalence
of agricultural support, multilateral agreements are the single most
effective way to address this issue. The Doha Round of the WTO trade
talks has included negotiations on limiting subsidies with the greatest
potential to stimulate overproduction and distort trade. In July 2008, as
part of the Doha talks, the U.S. Trade Representative announced that the
United States was prepared to limit this subset of subsidies to $15 billion
annually, down from the $22 billion limit offered in 2005. In the United
States, these subsidies have exceeded the proposed new $15 billion limit
in seven of the last 10 years.

The Benefits of Open Investment
The ability to either export excess savings in return for foreign assets or to
borrow savings and invest more than is saved within the country can allow
nations both to achieve higher income growth than would otherwise be
possible and to cushion temporary shocks to the economy. Over time, the
United States has benefited in both ways. For example, foreign demand for
secure investments has lowered borrowing costs for the U.S. Government.
There have also been benefits from accumulating assets overseas: U.S. businesses and investors have been able to make use of their foreign asset holdings
to diversify, reduce risk, and raise overall returns on investments.
Economic growth has likely been supported by openness to foreign
investment in a variety of ways, including an increase in the amount of

136  |  Economic Report of the President

capital available for investment; greater transfer of technology; increased
employment; and greater access to global capital, goods, and services by
domestic firms. Although still a matter of debate among economists,
foreign direct investment is generally considered to convey all of these
benefits in a particularly straightforward fashion. According to the latest
data available from the Commerce Department, in 2006, U.S. affiliates of
foreign companies accounted for 6.1 percent of U.S. nonbank private sector
production, provided more than 5.3 million jobs to American workers
(4.6 percent of the U.S. workforce), spent $34.3 billion on research and
development (14 percent of U.S. expenditure on R&D), and accounted for
19 percent of U.S. exports.
The benefits that a country receives are related to the volume and composition of its investment flows. The net flow of investment across borders is equal
to the gap between the value of goods and services that a nation exports and
the value of the goods and services it imports. This is also equal to the difference between a nation’s savings and its domestic investment. Nations that save
more than they invest domestically invest these extra savings in the rest of the
world, and in the process purchase foreign assets, including bonds, equities,
and FDI. Nations whose domestic investment exceeds their savings receive
investments from abroad and, in doing so, sell assets to foreign residents.
The composition of investment flows is in part determined by the willingness of the investor to accept greater risk in exchange for a potentially
higher return. Chart 4-3a provides a breakdown of types of foreign assets
accumulated by U.S. investors (including the government), and Chart 4-3b
shows the types of U.S. assets accumulated by foreign investors. Relative to
foreign investors in the United States, U.S. private investors have been relatively risk-tolerant in their holdings of foreign assets, particularly in holdings
of private portfolio stocks and FDI. Portfolio stocks constituted 30 percent
of total private foreign investment by U.S. investors in 2007, whereas they
constituted 17 percent for foreign investors in the United States. Likewise,
U.S. investors allocated 19 percent of their foreign holdings to FDI, whereas
private foreign investors only allocated 14 percent of their U.S. investments to
FDI. In keeping with their lower risk appetite, foreign private investors held
twice the share of bonds, including U.S. Treasury bonds, in their U.S. asset
holdings (24 percent of private investment) than U.S. investors held in their
foreign asset holdings (9 percent of private investment). There was also a
pronounced difference in official government holdings. Foreign governments
and official institutions held 17 percent of all U.S. assets owned by foreigners,
whereas the U.S. Government held only 2 percent of the total foreign assets
in U.S. residents’ possession. The majority of foreign official holdings of U.S.
assets in 2007 were U.S. Treasury bonds and bonds issued by governmentsponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

U.S. Investment and Investment Policy
Since the early 1980s, the United States has received more capital from
foreign investors than U.S. residents invested abroad. Table 4-2 provides
capital flow data for the years 2000 through 2007, the latest available data.
There are many aspects about the United States that have proved attractive
to foreign investors, including the size, diversity, liquidity, and depth of
U.S. financial markets. According to one estimate, U.S. financial markets
accounted for approximately one-third of the world supply of financial assets
in 2006 (the latest year for which data are available). The U.S. share of the
world supply of securities available to investors may even be much higher,
given that in many countries the fraction of a company’s shares available
on the market may be much lower due to the large controlling stake in the
company held by the government, a financial institution, or a family. In
addition, U.S. markets offer strong minority shareholder rights and other
property rights, a large domestic market, opportunities to invest in technological innovation, and demographic trends that result in a younger and
faster-growing population than in most other advanced nations.
Much attention has been given to the large purchases of U.S. assets by
foreign governments (primarily central banks and sovereign wealth funds;
see Box 4-2). Although official flows (primarily foreign exchange reserves
invested in the United States) are important, private flows are much larger.
In 2000, for example, total foreign capital inflows into the United States
were $1,038 billion of which private capital flows were $995 billion, or
96 percent of the total. Since then the share of private flows has not fallen
below 68 percent, and it stood at 80 percent in 2007, the last year for which
data are available. FDI and other investment flows are likely to be affected,
even if only in the short to medium term, by the current financial crisis. This
is the subject of Box 4-3.

Box 4-2: Sovereign Wealth Funds
A sovereign wealth fund (SWF) is a state-owned investment fund.
While there is no widely recognized definition of a SWF, typical hallmarks include that it holds foreign financial assets; makes some long- or
medium-term investments that are riskier than the safe, liquid assets
that make up official foreign currency reserves held for balance of
payments or monetary policy purposes; and has few or no defined
obligations, such as paying pension benefits or other specific liabilities.
Nations may create SWFs for many purposes, including to earn higher
returns on foreign currency holdings in excess of desired reserve assets,
stabilize fiscal revenues, save wealth across generations, or fund development projects. SWFs are typically funded through commodity exports
such as oil, gas, or diamonds, or through transfer of official foreign
reserves accumulated as a result of large trade surpluses. Examples
of some large SWFs include the United Arab Emirates’ Abu Dhabi
Investment Authority, Norway’s Norges Bank Investment Management,
the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, and the China
Investment Corporation.
Sovereign wealth funds have existed at least since the 1950s, but the
amount of money estimated to be in such funds has increased dramatically in the past 10 to 15 years. One recent study estimates that SWFs
currently manage $3.6 trillion in assets, and that total could rise to
$10 trillion by 2015, although recent decreases in commodity prices will
lower this projection. In 2006–2007, the amount of assets held by SWFs
was large compared to the amounts held by private equity ($0.8 trillion)
and hedge funds ($1.9 trillion), but was dwarfed by the assets held by
insurance companies, mutual funds, and pension funds (on the order of
$20 trillion each).
Sovereign wealth funds have the potential to promote global financial
stability by acting as long-term, stable investors that provide significant
capital to the system. They are not typically highly leveraged and would
therefore not be under pressure to sell off assets for the purpose of
meeting debt obligations. At the same time, the performance incentives
that SWFs face remain opaque, and like all large, concentrated investors,
SWFs could cause market volatility by abruptly shifting their asset allocations to avoid losses. The extent to which SWFs act as a stabilizing force
in financial markets is an open empirical question that may be difficult to
answer due to the lack of transparency of many SWFs.
Foreign investment, including investment by SWFs, provides capital
to U.S. businesses, improves productivity, and creates jobs. The United
States is currently the largest recipient of SWF investment. Investment
continued on the next page

140  |  Economic Report of the President

Box 4-2 — continued
from SWFs has helped to shore up financial institutions during the credit
crisis: sovereign wealth funds invested an estimated $92 billion in global
financial institutions from January 2007 to July 2008.
The increasing size of SWFs in global financial markets has prompted
some concern, however. For recipient countries, ownership of sensitive
assets by foreign governments may pose national security concerns.
High-profile investments by SWFs may also provoke a protectionist
backlash against foreign investment. In April 2008, the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published investment
policy principles for countries that receive SWF investment, endorsing
long-standing OECD principles against protectionist investment barriers
and for nondiscriminatory treatment of investors. The principles stress
that when additional investment restrictions are required to address legitimate national security concerns, then investment safeguards by recipient
countries should be transparent and predictable, proportional to clearly
identified national security risks, and supportive of accountability.
Countries that own SWFs have also raised concerns about the governance and accountability of these funds, and recognize that it is in their
interest to ensure that their money is invested well. In October 2008,
a group of 23 countries with SWFs published the Generally Accepted
Principles and Practices, known as the “Santiago Principles,” for sovereign wealth funds. The voluntary principles stress that SWFs should
be transparent and accountable and should make investment decisions
based on commercial principles. Adherence to these principles not only
will help ensure that SWFs are well managed, but will have the additional benefit of reassuring recipient countries that SWF investments are
financially stable and are economically and financially motivated.

Box 4-3: The Effect of the Current Economic Slowdown on
Foreign Investment into the United States.
The large capital inflows into the United States over the past decade
have led to many benefits described in this chapter. It is too early to
say definitively how the financial crisis will affect these inflows. There
are two aspects to this issue. First, there is the question of whether the
supply of credit that net-saver nations provide to the rest of the world
will be reduced. This credit has primarily flowed from Asian economies
continued on the next page

Chapter 4  |  141

Box 4-3 — continued
(including Japan’s), whose combined current account surplus (a measure
of capital outflows) was $608 billion higher in 2007 than it was in 1997,
and Middle East economies, whose combined current account surplus
was $253 billion higher in 2007 than in 1997. To the extent that the
recent slowdown in global economic activity reduces demand for Asian
exports and petroleum products (as well as other commodities), the net
savings available from these nations may fall if savings rates do not rise
sharply. Moreover, foreign countries’ savings are also likely to decline if
governments decide to engage in higher spending to boost their flagging
economies, thereby lowering the amount of government saving. Such
spending would reduce the gap between national saving and domestic
investment and reduce the supply of credit to the rest of the world, raising
world interest rates.
The second question is whether the cost of foreign savings to the
United States will rise. This depends on U.S. demand for foreign savings
and the relative desirability of U.S. assets for foreign investors. The
rising U.S. demand for foreign savings over the past decade is evident
in Table 4-2. To add further evidence, the current account deficit of the
United States (equal to net capital inflows) was $591 billion higher in
2007 than in 1997, and the United States received net investment from
the rest of the world equal to 1.3 percent of world GDP in 2007, compared
with average net foreign investment in the United States equal to
0.7 percent of world GDP from 1994 to 2001. Although predictions
vary, U.S. imports and exports are both anticipated to fall sharply, likely
leading to continued high levels of net capital inflows, and therefore
high demand for foreign savings. If other nations that have relied on
net capital inflows also maintain their same level of demand for foreign
savings as well, unchanged demand in the United States for a potentially shrinking supply of global savings would tend to raise the cost of
obtaining these inflows.
Yet the cost of foreign savings has not increased for the United States,
and this primarily reflects an increase in the relative desirability of U.S.
Treasury bonds for global investors. The net inflow of foreign savings
into U.S. Treasuries has permitted the U.S. Government to borrow at a
relatively low cost, and this has so far helped cushion the impact of the
crisis on the U.S. economy. The relative desirability of U.S. Government
bonds reflects a seismic decrease in global investors’ appetite for risk.
This has generated enormous demand for low risk assets such as U.S.
Treasuries. If global investors’ appetite for risk returns, demand for
Treasuries will likely fall and whether the cost of foreign savings will rise
for the United States will depend on the relative attractiveness of U.S.
investments compared to opportunities abroad.

142  |  Economic Report of the President

Foreign Direct Investment into the United States
For statistical purposes, the United States defines foreign direct investment
(FDI) as the acquisition of at least 10 percent of an existing U.S. business,
or the establishment of a new business, by a foreign person. The business
acquired or formed as a result of the FDI is known as a U.S. affiliate of the
foreign parent. Outlays for new FDI into the United States rose in 2006
and 2007, and the rate of increase of spending for new FDI greatly exceeded
the rate of increase of U.S. merger and acquisition activity. Of total new
FDI outlays into the United States of $277 billion in 2007, $255 billion
(92 percent) was for the acquisition of existing U.S. firms, while $22 billion
(8 percent) was for the establishment of entirely new businesses, according to
preliminary data. In 2006, the three countries with the greatest production
(or value added) by U.S. affiliates as a share of total U.S. affiliate production
were the United Kingdom (19.6 percent), Japan (12.3 percent), and Germany
(11.0 percent). The three biggest industry recipients of FDI new investment
outlays in 2007 were manufacturing (49 percent), finance and insurance
(9 percent), and real estate and rental and leasing (7 percent).
U.S. affiliates of foreign businesses are a large force in the U.S. economy,
and their importance has increased in certain ways. Over the past 20 years,
U.S. affiliates have increased their contribution to U.S. production from
3.8 percent of U.S. private sector production in 1988 to 6.1 percent of
production by 2006 (the latest year available). The employment share of
U.S. affiliates reached 4.6 percent in 2006. In 2007, newly acquired or
established U.S. affiliates employed 487,600 people (including 147,500 in
manufacturing and 143,600 in retail).
Although U.S. affiliates of foreign businesses are distinguished by relatively
high wages and productivity, these attributes may reflect the nature of the
industries to which FDI is attracted rather than any special attribute of foreign
ownership itself. However, the ability to sell a business to foreign investors
interested in acquiring new technology creates an incentive for entrepreneurs
to innovate by increasing the potential rewards. There are other benefits as
well. Studies that investigate the unique benefits of FDI, as opposed to other
forms of foreign financing, typically claim that FDI can introduce new technologies to domestic industries and increase the nation’s growth rate as these
new technologies are adopted and spread throughout the economy.
Efforts to measure technological spillovers have often come to conflicting
conclusions about the extent of these benefits. Many studies indicate that the
benefits of FDI for the host country depend heavily on context. One recent
study, for example, finds results that are sensitive to the level of worker education in the region where the investment is being made. Its findings indicate
that FDI stimulates economic growth most for U.S. States where worker
education exceeds certain threshold levels.

Chapter 4  |  143

U.S. affiliates may be most productive if they are located near other firms
with similar technical and knowledge requirements, or near a large number of
workers with specialized skills and suppliers with specialized inputs. A recent
study that finds that U.S. affiliates tend to cluster in specific areas (often
with other U.S. affiliates with parents from the same country). For example,
Connecticut and South Carolina tied for the largest U.S. affiliate share of
private industry employment at 7.1 percent. Most of the U.S. affiliates in
Connecticut were controlled by Dutch businesses, whereas the U.S. affiliates
in South Carolina were heavily associated with German businesses.

Foreign Investment Policy
The perception that openness to foreign investment must be traded off
against security is misguided. Foreign investment gives investors in other
countries an economic stake in the prosperity of the United States, creating
an incentive to support policies that are good for U.S. growth and stability.
Nonetheless, foreign acquisition of assets or businesses may create a risk
to national security if production of key resources could be disrupted or if
sensitive information or technologies may be disclosed. The Exon-Florio
provision of the Defense Production Act of 1950, which became law in 1988,
provides for the President or the President’s designee to review certain foreign
investments in the United States. If a transaction threatens to impair national
security, the President is authorized to prohibit the transaction.
In October 2007, the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of
2007 (FINSA) became effective, amending Exon-Florio in various ways,
including by codifying the structure, role, process, and responsibilities of
the interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States
(CFIUS), which has been designated by the President to undertake ExonFlorio reviews since 1988. Although FINSA expands government oversight
of some foreign acquisitions, it also increases the transparency and predictability of the CFIUS process. With the publication of final regulations in
November 2008, FINSA is now fully implemented.

Development Assistance Initiatives
The United States benefits from increased trade as other economies
grow and become more open, but the main benefits of development assistance programs include improving the lives of disadvantaged populations,
increasing economic and political stability abroad, and fostering closer ties
to the United States. The United States has many long-standing economic
assistance commitments, including those funded through the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID), the Departments of State
144  |  Economic Report of the President

and Defense, and funding for multilateral development institutions such as
the World Bank. Under this Administration, the United States has initiated and expanded specific economic assistance programs in developing
economies, particularly those that practice good governance; make trade a
prominent feature of their development plans; and demonstrate a commitment to taking ownership of the reforms, planning, and logistics required
for the success of development programs and projects. Economic assistance
programs, including trade capacity building (TCB) programs, are provided
primarily by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and USAID,
and investment promotion programs are provided by the Overseas Private
Investment Corporation (OPIC). The United States offers developing countries, particularly the least developed, preferential access to the U.S. market
through several preferential trade programs. The United States also has
health and education initiatives such as the President’s Emergency Plan for
AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).
To put these programs in context, U.S. spending on four of these initiatives
from fiscal year 2000 to 2007 is shown in Chart 4-4. MCC has had a steady
increase in funding since its inception in 2004. Spending on “Other TCB” in
Chart 4-4 does not include TCB funds that are already included in spending
by MCC and OPIC; overall, TCB funding rose to $2.3 billion in 2008.
The highest spending from 2004 through 2006 was on PEPFAR, reaching
$4 billion in 2007. The MCC, TCB, and OPIC, in addition to trade preference

Chapter 4  |  145

programs, are each discussed below, while PEPFAR is described in the section
on health programs in Chapter 7.

Millennium Challenge Corporation
In 2002, the President announced the creation of the Millennium Challenge
Account (MCA), a new bilateral initiative aimed at reducing poverty through
investment programs, or compacts, of up to five years with countries that
practice good governance, provide economic freedoms, and invest in their
people’s health and education. The Millennium Challenge Corporation
(MCC) was set up to administer the MCA, and the importance of the MCC’s
focus on reducing poverty through economic growth is supported by research
showing that economic growth is an important precursor for poverty reduction. In recognition of this relationship, before approving projects, MCC
gathers evidence that the problems to be addressed by potential MCC-funded
projects are indeed critical constraints to a country’s growth. The strong
commitment by MCC to near-universal application of cost–benefit analysis
and rigorous, state-of-the-art project evaluation will allow the development
community to better understand and learn important lessons about the
effectiveness of various types of aid projects. Without making advances in
knowledge about which projects are effective, U.S. efforts to improve the
lives of targeted populations may not ultimately succeed. Given that most of
MCC’s compacts are currently in progress, it is too early to evaluate whether
MCC has met its objectives.

Trade Capacity Building
An important goal of U.S. trade policy is to create opportunities for individuals and companies in developing countries. Trade capacity building
(TCB), also called Aid for Trade, helps developing countries build capacity
so that they can take advantage of global markets and implement trade rules.
Top priorities for this aid are to develop infrastructure, strengthen financial
markets, improve customs operations, develop sound business environments,
and facilitate trade. The United States is the largest single-country donor
of TCB assistance, spending $2.3 billion in the 2008 fiscal year, and it has
committed to provide $2.7 billion in annual spending by 2010.
A key component of TCB is improving key physical infrastructure needs—
such as transportation, ports, telecommunications, electricity, and water—in
developing regions. In recent years, the United States has supported road
building in rural Colombia, pipeline rehabilitation in Georgia, and the
construction of a new international airport in Ecuador. TCB funds also
strengthen developing countries’ financial infrastructure. A number of
programs are aimed at improving the productivity and business practices in

146  |  Economic Report of the President

micro-, small-, and medium-sized businesses, and at improving lending to
these businesses.
Trade facilitation is another important part of TCB. Trade facilitation
funds are used chiefly to modernize customs practices, promote exports from
developing countries, and provide business support and training to help firms
participate in global markets. Improvements in these areas are often key to
generating new trade and investment flows in these countries. For example,
trade may increase because improved customs practices reduce costs and
shorten delivery times. The United States has supported projects to improve
the flow of goods at the Kenya-Uganda border and along the route from
coastal Namibia to South Africa. Investment may increase because trade
facilitation addresses areas of chief concern to many international investors;
a 2007 survey reported that customs and ports improvements are the highest
priority for international investors in some emerging markets.
Recent U.S. trade agreements, such as the Dominican Republic-Central
America-United States Free Trade Agreement, include a formal Committee
on TCB to help trading partners implement the agreement and to smooth
the transition to new trading regimes. The United States also promotes
TCB more broadly. For example, the United States supports efforts by the
WTO and the OECD to expand worldwide funding for Aid for Trade. 
This aid helps developing countries, particularly least-developed countries,
enhance trade-related skills and improve infrastructure needed to expand
trade and benefit from trade agreements. Along these lines, the Africa Global
Competitiveness Initiative, announced by the President in 2005 to build on
the African Growth and Opportunity Act, provides technical assistance to
bolster the trade competitiveness of African countries. This initiative has
been credited with supporting $35 million in exports by African Growth and
Opportunity Act beneficiaries in 2007. The United States also supports the
Integrated Framework that coordinates efforts by six multilateral organizations (including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the
WTO, and other organizations) to reduce poverty in developing countries by
better integrating trade into national development strategies.

Investment Promotion Programs
The United States also facilitates investment in emerging and developing
countries by U.S. companies through the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation. According to the corporation’s 2007 annual report, it
has supported over $177 billion in U.S. investment abroad through its
pioneering use of U.S. Government-backed political risk insurance, direct
loans, guaranties, and equity funds. These investments, which help provide
crucial opportunities to households and firms in developing economics, also
contribute to increased foreign asset holdings of U.S. residents.
Chapter 4  |  147

In addition, bilateral investment treaties foster market-oriented investment
policies in partner countries, and support international standards for investment protection. In February 2008, the Administration signed a bilateral
investment treaty with Rwanda. When implemented, it will bring the
number of U.S. bilateral investment treaties in force to 41. The U.S.
Government is pursuing investment treaties with key emerging markets, as
demonstrated by the 2008 announcements of treaty negotiations with China,
India, and Vietnam.

Trade Preference Programs
Four U.S. preference programs are among the central elements of U.S.
trade policy to promote growth and stability in developing countries. These
programs provide preferential duty-free access for thousands of products
that would otherwise be subject to duty upon entry to the United States.
The U.S. Generalized System of Preferences, for example, provides dutyfree access to the U.S. market for over 3,400 products from 132 beneficiary
developing countries, and provides even broader duty-free access for products
from 44 least developed countries. In addition to the Generalized System
of Preferences, U.S. preferential trade programs include the African Growth
and Opportunity Act, the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and the Andean Trade
Preference Act. These programs have been successful in increasing and diversifying developing countries’ exports, which better integrates these countries
into the global trading system and expands choices for U.S. manufacturers and
consumers. These programs have also improved economic stability, promoted
internationally recognized labor rights, and provided adequate and effective
means to secure and enforce property rights, including intellectual property
rights. Researchers have cautioned that preference programs can have negative
consequences if preferences divert limited resources in developing countries to
sectors that would not otherwise be competitive. Research on specific U.S.
programs, however, suggests that in general these programs have increased
exports and improved welfare.
These programs have generated many successes. The Generalized System
of Preferences has a large and geographically diverse impact. For example, for
15 beneficiary countries, more than one-third of their exports to the United
States received preferential duty-free access under the program in 2007.
Under the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the associated Haiti Hope Act,
Haiti—the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere—increased apparel
exports to the United States by 75 percent between 2000 and 2007. These
benefits helped to preserve an important sector of the Haitian economy. The
African Growth and Opportunity Act has also been successful in increasing
trade. For January to October 2008, exports from the original African beneficiary countries to the United States increased over 250 percent compared to
148  |  Economic Report of the President

the same period in 2001, and exports that entered the United States duty
free under the program exceeded $50 billion, up almost 700 percent. U.S.
exports to sub-Saharan Africa more than doubled in the same period, totaling
over $15 billion in 2008 through October.

Trade Policy Going Forward
Notwithstanding the rapid increase in U.S. regional and bilateral trade and
investment agreements, the multilateral trading system remains at the heart
of U.S. trade policy. The rules-based multilateral system of the WTO is the
essential foundation of an increasingly integrated global economy, and the
WTO remains the single best forum to generate progress on many global
trade and investment issues. Such issues include reducing trade-distorting
support and protection for agricultural sectors maintained by many countries,
both developing and developed; and liberalizing trade barriers and burdensome restrictions on FDI in services sectors in developing countries.
The United States must continue to lead international efforts to address
these and similar issues in order to expand the benefits of open markets and
economic integration. In particular, the WTO Doha Round remains a top
U.S. trade policy objective, with the goal of concluding an agreement that
creates new trade flows in agricultural, industrial, and services markets that
will expand global economic growth, development, and opportunity. The
United States and many other countries remain committed to reaching
a successful final agreement that achieves an ambitious market-opening
outcome for both developed and developing countries.
In the history of global trade liberalization, there has not been smooth and
uniform progress toward ever lower barriers. There have been long periods
of inactivity or, worse, periods of rising protectionism. Previous periods of
economic hardship have often coincided with an increase in protectionism
and economic isolationism; for example, the use of nontariff barriers such
as quotas rose in the 1970s and 1980s. In the current troubled economic
environment, an increase in protectionism at home or abroad could further
slow global economic progress. Limiting trade would jeopardize the strongest
engine of growth of the past 2 years in the U.S. economy. In the short term,
the United States must provide global leadership to oppose any resurgence
of protectionism, while continuing to recognize and support the extensive
benefits that an open trade and investment environment conveys.
In the longer term, the forces of greater global economic integration appear
strong. During this Administration, as the United States implemented FTAs
with 13 countries, more than 100 other countries put more than 75 other
FTAs into force. Other nations will press forward and so must the United

States to avoid becoming economically disadvantaged in foreign markets.
The United States should continue to pursue free trade agreements and,
in particular, put into force those that have already been negotiated. The
growth in bilateral agreements further emphasizes the importance of multilateral initiatives such as the WTO Doha Round, which can magnify gains by
simultaneously reducing barriers in many countries, ensure that the benefits
of market access are shared more widely among nations, and lead to transparent and less complex global trading rules.

Conclusion
The United States’ commitment to openness in trade and investment and
promotion of open markets abroad has led to a greater diversity in consumer
choices, more exposure to new technologies and ideas, and higher levels of
investment and economic growth than would otherwise have been possible.
Openness to trade and investment has contributed to higher U.S. standards
of living and has allowed the United States some structural flexibility to
cushion economic shocks. On balance, strong links to other economies are
likely to increase the resilience of the U.S. economy in the short and long
term, even taking into account the potential for negative shocks, such as a
decline in demand for U.S. exports. Short-run hardships will surely occur,
and it may take some time for current weaknesses to be resolved, but the U.S.
commitment to openness provides substantial benefits in both the short and
long run.
With regard to trade, the U.S. commitment to openness has been most
evident in the increased number of U.S. free trade agreements. These
agreements have improved the competitiveness and performance of U.S.
producers abroad and have provided substantial savings for U.S. producers
and consumers at home. In investment, the United States has benefited from
inflows of capital from abroad. Although it is unclear how future flows will
be affected by the current crisis, U.S. investors have historically earned high
returns on their investments abroad. The recent reform of the Committee on
Foreign Investment in the United States represents a careful effort to remain
open to foreign investors while safeguarding national security.
U.S. development assistance has supported openness in developing and
emerging economies through investment in infrastructure, trade capacity
building, trade preference programs, and investment promotion. U.S. efforts
to relieve poverty and promote economic growth and stability have helped
numerous developing countries. In addition, the United States’ continued
promotion of trade with developing countries will improve their access to,
and ability to benefit from, global markets.

Tax Policy

E

conomists agree that taxes affect people’s incentives and behavior. For
example, allowing tax deductions for educational expenses makes it
cheaper to go to college, which may encourage more people to go to college.
Taxes can also discourage people from engaging in certain activities. Taxes on
cigarettes, for example, make them more expensive to purchase, which may
discourage people from buying them. Similarly, taxes on dividends (periodic
distributions of a firm’s profits to stockholders) and capital gains (the growth
in value of an asset, such as corporate stock) decrease the return people receive
from investing their money, which might cause them to invest less. When a
higher tax rate is imposed on an activity, people have less incentive to engage
in that activity. To encourage people to work and invest more, the tax rates
on labor and investment income should be reduced. Over the past 8 years,
several policy changes have resulted in lower tax rates for both individuals
and businesses.
Individual income tax rates for all income levels are lower now than they
were in 2001. Also, specific incentives have been established to reduce the
adverse tax consequences of certain desirable activities, from running a small
business to buying an alternative-fuel vehicle. Lower tax rates have increased
the benefit to these activities; in particular, lower tax rates on dividends
and capital gains helped business investment expand, thereby increasing the
amount of capital per worker which improves worker productivity. Tax relief
has contributed to the solid economic growth and job creation that prevailed
over most of the past several years.
However, important challenges remain. Foremost among these is the fact
that most of these tax reductions are scheduled to expire at the end of 2010.
Allowing them to expire would constitute one of the largest tax increases in
history and could have serious consequences for the U.S. economy. Another
challenge is to further reduce business tax burdens and thereby encourage business investment in the United States. The United States should continue to
attract such investment in today’s global economy in order to develop better
jobs for U.S. workers and to continue improving our standard of living.
Of course, individuals and businesses would prefer not to be taxed at
all. Yet governments perform many functions desired by citizens—such as
building roads and bridges, maintaining law and order, and providing for
the national defense—and impose taxes to raise revenue for these activities.
While this chapter focuses on the economic effects of taxes, it should be noted
that this is only one side of the Government’s budget; a complete analysis of
151

fiscal policy should consider the economic effects of both the revenue and
spending sides of the budget.
The key points of this chapter are:
•	 Taxes alter individual and business incentives and have the potential
to distort their behavior. This Administration consistently fought to
reduce tax burdens on individuals and businesses; tax rates are now
much lower than they were just 8 years ago.
•	 Tax reductions over the past 8 years have improved incentives to work,
save, and invest.
•	 Globally, nations compete for businesses and the associated jobs; the
United States may need to reduce tax rates on businesses to remain
competitive in today’s world.
•	 Future goals should include permanently extending the tax relief of the
past 8 years and reforming the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).

Individual Income Tax Reform
Governments impose taxes to obtain the revenue needed to perform their
duties. The transfer of resources from individuals to the government does
not directly impose a burden on the overall economy because the ability to
purchase goods and services shifts from the individual to the government—
there is no net loss for the economy as a whole. However, taxes can impose
a considerable burden on the economy for other reasons. Most significantly,
taxes interfere with the efficient allocation of resources by altering the rewards
from working, saving, and investing.
Resources are allocated efficiently when individuals and firms allocate them
to the activities for which they are best suited, thus achieving the highest
possible output for the economy. Without taxes, individuals and firms can
allocate resources in the most efficient manner possible. With taxes, people
receive lower benefits from taxed activities and adjust their behavior accordingly. (In some cases, such as when people engage in an activity that produces
negative consequences for others, imposing a tax can improve economic efficiency; for example, high taxes on cigarettes can reduce the damage caused
by secondhand smoke.)
High tax rates on labor income can induce people to reduce the time they
spend working. This is particularly true for people with flexible work weeks
and in households with a second worker. High tax rates on dividends and
capital gains discourage people from investing and reduce the funds available in financial markets. In turn, this reduces business investment, which
reduces the amount of capital available in the economy. Less capital means
less machinery and equipment for each worker to use, making workers less

152  |  Economic Report of the President

productive and leading to reductions in wages. The net result of these taxcaused changes is an inefficient allocation of resources: output is lower than
it would have been in the absence of taxes. Economic research indicates
that the total economic burden imposed on the economy for each dollar of
income tax revenue collected actually exceeds 1 dollar, but estimates of the
exact burden vary widely.
A second problem arises when people engage in activities to avoid paying
taxes. The possibilities here include both legal activities, such as using
complicated tax shelters to prevent income from being taxed, and illegal
activities, such as not filing a tax return. While the great majority of people
pay the taxes they owe, the latest Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimate
suggests that the gap between the amount of tax people owed and the amount
actually paid was approximately $290 billion in 2001, or 13.7 percent of all
taxes owed. One consequence of people failing to pay their fair share of taxes
is that a higher tax rate must be imposed on those who do comply with tax
laws in order to collect the desired amount of revenue.

Lowering Tax Rates Stimulates Economic Growth
Taxing earned income reduces incentives to work because it reduces the
return from work. Similarly, taxing capital income (such as interest, dividends, and capital gains) reduces the return from saving and investing and
therefore reduces the incentive to save and invest. The changes in incentives, along with any associated behavioral changes that result from changes
in tax rates, are what economists mean when they assert that taxes “distort”
the normal operation of labor and capital markets. When taxes are imposed
on choices people make, distortions tend to occur and markets operate at
less than peak efficiency. Because different types of taxes create different
types and sizes of distortions, one goal of tax policy should be to choose
tax rates that minimize the distortions and the accompanying inefficiencies
whenever possible.
Key determinants of the effect a tax system has on the economy are the
average tax rate—the fraction of income paid in taxes—and the marginal tax
rate—the amount of tax owed on an additional (that is, marginal) dollar of
income. A high average tax rate tends to discourage people from engaging
in an activity at all. For example, a high average tax rate on labor income
can reduce the total after-tax return so much that it discourages people from
working at all. In contrast, a high marginal tax rate on labor income reduces
an individual’s after-tax return from increased work effort and from investing in
additional education. The example in Box 5-1 examines this particular issue in
more detail. Because education levels positively affect productivity, economic
growth will generally be higher when people acquire more education.

Chapter 5  |  153

By reducing both average and marginal tax rates on labor and capital income
at almost every income level, the tax policies of the past 8 years reduced the
distortionary effects of these taxes and thereby improved the efficiency of the
labor and capital markets and of the U.S. economy as a whole.

Box 5-1: Encouraging Human Capital Investment
High marginal tax rates can discourage people from pursuing
additional education and improving their skills to qualify for a higherpaying job. To see this, consider a high school teacher who is choosing
between continuing to work for about $50,000 per year (the median
salary for high school teachers in 2007), and getting additional education so he can become a school principal and earn $80,000 per year (the
median salary for elementary and secondary education administrators in
2007). Although there may be other factors, suppose this worker’s main
concern is his after-tax income.
Consider the impact of two different tax regimes: In the first regime,
assume the high school teacher would owe $5,000 per year in income tax
and the principal would owe $12,500 per year in income tax. The difference, $7,500, is the additional tax he would owe if he were to acquire the
skills needed to be a principal. Comparing this amount to the expected
increase in income ($30,000), we see that the marginal tax rate imposed
on the additional income is 25 percent ($7,500/$30,000). In the second
regime, assume an alternate tax system in which the high school teacher
owes $3,000 per year in tax and the principal owes $15,000 per year in
tax. Under this new system, the tax impact of acquiring additional skills
is $12,000. Comparing this to the expected increase in income (still
$30,000) reveals that the marginal tax rate imposed on the additional
income is 40 percent ($12,000/$30,000).
The larger marginal tax rate in the second regime means the worker
experiences a smaller increase in after-tax income; thus, his incentive to
acquire the skills necessary for the higher-paying job is smaller in this
regime and may cause him not to pursue additional education.
As an aside, notice that if the worker chooses to stay a high school
teacher, he pays more in income tax in the first regime ($5,000) than he
would in the second ($3,000). Part of the reason the first regime has a
lower marginal tax rate for additional education is that there is a higher
average tax rate on lower-earning individuals than in the second regime.

154  |  Economic Report of the President

Increased Work Incentives
A labor income tax decreases the incentive workers have to supply labor to
the market by reducing their take-home pay. Workers may choose to work
fewer hours, and some may even choose not to work at all. These behavioral
changes reduce the efficiency of the labor market and of the economy as a
whole. The tax relief of 2001 reduced tax rates on labor income and thereby
reduced the distortions and efficiency losses created by taxing wages.
Economists have found that different people can be affected differently by
taxes. Some people exhibit very little change in labor supply as tax rates vary,
while others may enter or exit the workforce entirely. Consider a married
couple in which one person works at a full-time job; call this person the
primary breadwinner for the family and assume he makes $50,000 per year
and works a fixed 40-hour week. The other person has the option of working
at an hourly job and can earn up to $10,000 per year, depending on how
many hours she works; call this person the secondary earner. When there is a
change in tax rates, the breadwinner will probably continue to work the same
amount of time because of the importance of his income to the family and his
fixed work hours. However, the work decisions for the secondary earner are
not as clear. Because married couples are taxed on their combined income,
any income earned by the secondary earner will be taxed at the marginal tax
rate facing the couple. Because an income tax lowers the reward for working
outside the home, it makes other activities (such as leisure or raising a family)
look relatively more attractive compared to work. An increase in the marginal
tax rate facing the couple could reduce the return the secondary earner
receives from working by enough to cause her to choose not to work at all.
Alternatively, if a worker wants to earn a specific amount of income, higher
tax rates could cause her to increase work time.
In practice, economists find the labor supply of married men to be
relatively stable regardless of changes in tax rates. Research shows, however,
the labor supply of married women to be quite sensitive to changes in tax
rates, although this sensitivity has declined over the last few decades as labor
force participation by women aged 25–54 increased from about 50 percent
in 1970 to over 75 percent in 2008.
The tax relief of the past 8 years reduced marginal tax rates at almost every
income level, reduced the distortions inherent in taxing earned income, and
thereby increased the rewards from working and encouraged more people to
work. In addition, tax relief that reduced marriage penalties improved the
incentives for secondary earners to participate in the labor force.

Chapter 5  |  155

Increased Saving and Investment Incentives
When individuals receive income, they can either spend it for current
consumption or save it to finance future consumption. Financial intermediaries, such as banks and insurance companies, pool individual savings to
finance capital investments. For example, a bank may combine the savings
deposits of many individuals to make a loan to a small business owner. The
business owner plans to make a profit so she can pay interest on her loan,
which the bank uses to pay interest to the depositors. Similarly, when people
purchase stock in a company, the company can use the funds to invest in
new machinery and equipment. These new assets generate income for the
company that gets returned to the investor in the form of dividends or capital
gains. These investments increase the amount of machinery and equipment
used by each worker, raising the productivity of workers; this helps to increase
workers’ wages and, ultimately, increases the average standard of living
for Americans.
An important tax policy issue is the double taxation of income earned from
saving and investing. Taxing this income discourages individual saving and
investment, which reduces the funds available to finance new businesses and
for existing businesses to expand. Currently, corporations first pay tax on their
profit, then the after-tax profit is either distributed to shareholders as dividends
or reinvested in the company by retaining it and allowing shareholders to
benefit via capital gains (that is, increased equity); either way, the shareholder
then pays taxes on the income he or she earns. As a result, income from new
capital investment by corporations, financed by individual equity investment,
is taxed twice—once by a tax on the corporation’s profit, and again by a tax
on the dividends and capital gains earned by the individual investor. This
double taxation of corporate income generates an effective tax rate on equity
investment that is greater than either the statutory corporate tax rate or the
individual income tax rate. Ultimately, such taxes lower the capital-to-labor
ratio, suppress wages, and harm long-run economic growth. Box 5-2 gives an
example of how double taxation can slow economic growth.
The tax reductions of the past 8 years increased individual incentives to
save and invest. In 2001, the top marginal income tax rate was reduced from
39.6 percent to 35 percent, thus reducing the tax on flow-through businesses
(businesses whose profits are not taxed directly; instead, any profit they
earn “flows through” the business to the owners, who then pay individual
income tax on it). Before 2003, capital gains were taxed at a maximum of
20 percent, and dividends were taxed as ordinary income (at a maximum rate of
38.6 percent in 2002). As part of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA), the maximum tax rate for long-term
capital gains and dividends was reduced to 15 percent. (The next section
elaborates on the significance of reducing tax rates on dividend income.)

156  |  Economic Report of the President

Box 5-2: Double Taxation Slows Economic Growth
From an individual perspective, the act of saving reduces consumption
today so more can be consumed in the future. Similarly, when firms
invest they reduce present production so they can be more productive
and profitable in the future. Taxing capital income lowers the return
to saving and investment, which encourages current consumption and
discourages future consumption. For example, suppose a corporation is
considering selling additional stock to finance the construction of a new
plant. The corporation expects that the net return on this investment
(the return after subtracting depreciation) will be 10 percent. Suppose
further that individuals will purchase the shares if they receive a return
of at least 6 percent. The investment is socially beneficial because it
generates a higher return (10 percent) than the savers providing the
funds require (6 percent).
When the new plant begins operating, the income it generates for
the firm is subject to the corporate income tax; currently, the corporate
income tax has a top marginal rate of 35 percent. Similarly, individuals
investing in the firm owe tax on the income they receive from their
investments; currently, the top marginal rate on dividends and long-term
capital gains is 15 percent.
Now consider an individual who invests $1,000 in the company’s new
stock. The new plant generates $100 of net income on this investment.
The firm owes 35 percent in tax, leaving $65 of after-tax profit for the firm.
Suppose the firm immediately returns all of this money to the investor
as a dividend. The investor owes 15 percent in tax, leaving about $55 for
her to use. That is, after applying the two taxes, the investor receives a
return of only 5.5 percent on her initial investment. Because this is less
than her required return of 6 percent she will choose not to invest in this
company’s stock and the new plant would not be built. In summary,
taxing both corporate income and individual capital income can produce
an effective tax rate high enough to alter saving and investment decisions
enough to cause socially beneficial projects to go unfunded.

Dividend Tax Relief
A major Administration accomplishment was reducing the tax rate applied
to corporate dividends. JGTRRA reclassified dividends so they are taxed at
the same rate as long-term capital gains, currently a maximum of 15 percent.
As Chart 5-1 shows, the change appears to have been effective in expanding
dividend payments: since 2003, real dividend income has grown at an average
of 11.1 percent per year, while from 1983 until 2003, real dividend income
grew at an average of only 5.8 percent per year. (The 2004 spike in the chart
reflects a special one-time dividend paid by Microsoft Corporation.)

Chapter 5  |  157

Reducing tax rates on corporate dividend payments directly reduces the
double taxation of corporate income. It also reduces the incentive corporations have to use debt, rather than equity, to finance purchases of new capital.
The fact that corporations can deduct interest payments from taxable income,
but cannot deduct dividend payments, makes it cheaper for firms to borrow
(rather than issue stock) to finance additional spending. Excessive borrowing
increases the chances of insolvency because the higher a firm’s debt payments,
the greater the chance the firm’s income will be insufficient to cover these
payments. Insofar as insolvency triggers bankruptcy, this subjects equity
holders and employees to additional costs and uncertainty.
Changing the tax treatment of dividends also reduced the tax bias against
paying dividends compared to retaining earnings. Paying dividends returns
funds to stockholders, who can decide for themselves how to use them, rather
than having to leave the funds invested in a particular company. Also, paying
dividends is a way firms can provide tangible evidence of their profitability.
Clear signals about how profitable different firms are help investors identify
the most efficient allocation of their resources. When the tax code penalizes
dividends relative to capital gains and penalizes equity financing relative to
debt financing, corporate financing decisions will be inefficient.

158  |  Economic Report of the President

The Macroeconomic Benefits of Lower Tax Rates
Over the past 8 years, tax relief has reduced distortions to labor supply,
saving, investment, and corporate governance. Making the tax relief permanent can substantially improve economic efficiency and increase economic
activity. The Treasury Department estimates, for example, that if the tax
relief of 2001 and 2003 were made permanent and were paid for by reductions in future government spending, economic output would increase by
0.7 percent in the long run. The benefits would be smaller or even negative,
however, if the extension of the tax relief results in additional government
borrowing or future tax increases rather than spending reductions. The
Treasury Department estimates, for example, that if the tax relief were made
permanent but the lost revenues were made up with other tax increases,
economic output would decline by 0.9 percent over the long run. The
concern about long-term financing for the tax relief is particularly important
because of the likelihood of rising spending pressures in the future, as discussed
in Chapter 6.

A Record of Tax Reform
One of the Administration’s major tax policy objectives has been to
change tax laws so they better encourage activities that are beneficial to the
economy as a whole, such as work effort, saving and investing, education,
and the creation of new jobs. With regard to individual income taxes, the
Administration took steps each year to reduce the burden imposed on the
American taxpayer. Here are some of the highlights of the actions taken:
•	 The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 was
the most significant tax reduction since 1981. It created a new low
10 percent tax bracket and phased in reductions of the other existing
marginal tax rates. It reduced marriage penalties by increasing the
standard deduction and the lowest tax bracket threshold for married
taxpayers, increased the child tax credit, and made many other tax preferences more generous. It also began phasing out the estate tax.
•	 The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 accelerated
the phasing-in of many of the tax reductions enacted in 2001. It also
reduced capital gains tax rates and applied the capital gains tax rates to
dividends.
•	 The Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 and American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 further accelerated the tax reductions previously
enacted, including increasing the child tax credit to $1,000. These laws
further reduced marriage penalties by making the standard deduction
for joint returns twice the single standard deduction, and expanding the
Chapter 5  |  159

10 and 15 percent tax brackets for joint returns to twice the size of the
corresponding brackets for single returns.
•	The Pension Protection Act of 2006 made permanent a number of
pension-related provisions of previous tax bills, such as higher dollar
amounts for IRA contributions, higher dollar limits on defined contribution plans, and catch-up contributions for older workers.
•	 The Tax Increase Prevention Act (TIPA) of 2007 and the Emergency
Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 each extended AMT relief. TIPA
also increased the number of personal credits that could be used to
reduce AMT liability.
Each of the above measures was intended to promote long-term growth
and improve economic efficiency. Another significant measure was the
Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, which returned approximately $100 billion
to consumers via tax rebates—up to $600 per taxpayer ($1,200 for couples
filing jointly) and $300 for each dependent. Rebates were phased out for
taxpayers with over $75,000 in income (over $150,000 for couples filing
jointly). On the business tax side, the Economic Stimulus Act increased the
dollar value of new equipment that could be deducted in 2008 and provided
an expanded depreciation allowance of 50 percent on certain business property put into service in 2008. The primary purpose of these actions was to
provide short-term, counter-cyclical stimulus to the economy by encouraging short-run growth in consumer spending and business investment.
Tax rebates were chosen as the best way to provide this short-term stimulus
because of the speed with which they put money into the hands of people
most likely to spend it. Similarly, the business tax incentives were designed
to encourage firms to accelerate purchases of capital equipment, making such
purchases in 2008 rather than waiting until 2009 or later. Compared to
the paths consumption and investment would have otherwise followed, the
rebates appear to have boosted real personal consumption expenditures in
the second quarter of 2008 and the accelerated depreciation was expected to
boost business investment throughout 2008.
In total, the tax relief enjoyed by taxpayers from 2001 to 2008 saved
Americans nearly $1.7 trillion in taxes. Chart 5-2 illustrates how those benefits were distributed over these years. The value for 2008 includes over $100
billion from the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. Aside from stimulus, the
amount of tax relief granted to individuals declines after 2008 because of the
expiration of temporary changes to the AMT (discussed in detail later in this
chapter) and declines significantly in 2011 because most of the tax reductions
are scheduled to expire at the end of 2010.

Lower Tax Burdens
As a result of the tax relief of the past 8 years, the average Federal individual
income tax rate declined to 20.4 percent in 2008. Without tax relief, the
average Federal tax rate would have been 24.2 percent. The top half of Table
5-1 shows the rates taxpayers at different income levels face in 2008 as a result
of the tax relief of the past 8 years and the tax rates they would have faced if
it were not for this tax relief. Notice that taxpayers at all income levels experienced a reduction in their average Federal tax rate for 2008. For example,
among people in the lowest income quintile, the average Federal income tax
rate would have been 5.2 percent without tax relief, but with tax relief it was
only 1.1 percent; while for people in the highest income quintile, the average
Federal income tax rate would have been 29 percent without tax relief, and
with tax relief it was only 25.4 percent.
The distribution of the burden of Federal individual income taxes is shown
in the bottom half of Table 5-1. Without tax relief, the lowest quintile would
have borne 0.8 percent of the Federal tax burden in 2008. With tax relief,
the lowest quintile bore only 0.2 percent of all Federal taxes. The highest
income quintile was the only group to see its share of Federal taxes increase
in 2008, from 66.3 percent of Federal taxes before tax relief to 68.9 percent
after tax relief.

Pro-Growth Business Tax Reform
Throughout the past 8 years, the Administration has worked consistently
to lower the burden of taxes on businesses, with the objectives of encouraging greater investment, job creation, and long-term economic growth. To
accomplish these goals, the Administration has pursued two primary strategies: first, addressing enduring aspects of the tax system that diminish returns
on investment for both individuals and businesses; and second, providing
new tax incentives for businesses to stimulate greater investment.

Reducing the Double Taxation of Corporate Income
As indicated earlier, one aspect of the current tax system that diminishes
returns on investment is the practice of double taxation of corporate income,
which reduces the return to saving and investing. The Administration’s 2003
tax relief reduced the magnitude of double taxation by reducing the tax rate
on both dividends and capital gains. In addition, there have been amendments to the legal structure of corporations that have helped reduce corporate
tax burdens.
To understand these changes, it is first helpful to understand the basic
framework of corporate taxation. The tax treatment of business income
varies depending on the organizational structure of the firm. There are two
basic classifications of corporations for purposes of taxation and regulation:
(1) C corporations, the traditional large, stock-issuing corporations; and (2)
flow-through businesses, which include S corporations, partnerships, and sole
proprietorships. For tax purposes, the main difference between these two
groups is that flow-through businesses are exempt from the corporate profits
tax that is imposed on C corporations. In flow-through businesses, profits
are distributed to owners and shareholders (flowing “through” the company
162  |  Economic Report of the President

directly to their owners), who then pay income taxes on their gains. (There are
restrictions on both size and financial activities that prevent most firms from
qualifying to be S corporations.) This arrangement allows flow-through business owners to avoid the double taxation of corporate profits and to face lower
effective tax rates than do shareholders of C corporations. One goal of tax relief
has been to “level the playing field” by reducing the difference between the tax
rates applied to income generated by S corporations and C corporations.
Two types of changes helped to reduce the burden of corporate taxes.
First, regulatory changes in 2004 and 2007 relaxed some of the restrictions
that limit which firms can be S corporations. In addition to increasing the
maximum allowable number of shareholders, new rules were enacted to
make it easier for a firm to elect to become, and to remain, an S corporation. Second, each year from 2002 to 2005, and again in 2008, allowances
for depreciation deductions were extended or expanded. As described below,
these changes allow firms to take a greater deduction from income when new
capital equipment is purchased, which effectively decreases the tax burden on
income generated by that equipment.

Accelerating Depreciation Allowances
A consistent goal of the Administration has been to provide tax incentives
for businesses to invest in new facilities and equipment. One way this goal
was promoted was by accelerating business depreciation allowances. When
physical assets (such as machinery and equipment that can be used over
and over when producing goods and services) are used by businesses, their
value declines (depreciates) over time due to the wear and tear they experience. With this in mind, businesses are allowed to deduct from their taxable
income the dollar amount of the depreciation of their assets. The more
quickly a firm is able to deduct, through depreciation, the cost of new investment, the more attractive new investment becomes. Because different types
of assets have different useful lives and therefore depreciate at different rates,
the IRS established the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, which
specifies the rates at which different types of assets can be depreciated.
Accelerating depreciation rates improves investment incentives for firms.
As part of a temporary stimulus program, the Administration succeeded in
expanding businesses’ first-year depreciation allowance on qualified property
by an additional 30 percent of its adjusted basis in 2002, to encourage greater
business investment in new machinery and equipment in that year. In 2003,
to provide additional short-term stimulus, the first-year depreciation allowance was expanded further, to 50 percent of the adjusted basis for qualified
property. This expanded depreciation allowance expired in 2004, but was
reintroduced—at 50 percent of the adjusted basis—as part of the Economic
Stimulus Act of 2008.
Chapter 5  |  163

Increasing Small Business Expensing
In addition to accelerating business depreciation rates, the Administration
has supported pro-growth business tax policies by increasing the amount of
“expensing” small businesses can do for their use of depreciable property.
Distinct from the traditional concept of “business expensing,” which refers to
a business’s ability to deduct expenses incurred that are not associated with
acquiring or improving assets, Section 179 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code
allows individuals and small businesses to deduct the cost of property used
to generate income, rather than having to capitalize the benefits through the
depreciation schedule discussed above. The Administration expanded the
capability of businesses to expense the cost of property under Section 179;
in 2003, the maximum dollar amount that could be expensed under Section
179 was increased to $100,000. In 2007 the limit was again increased, to
$125,000, and indexed for inflation for 2008 through 2010. Then, as part
of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, the limit was increased to $250,000
for 2008.

Tax Credits for Research and Development
Finally, a number of tax credits have been extended to businesses to
encourage the types of research and development investment that have benefits for the public. Economists use the term “public goods” to describe things
that could easily be used by more and more people with little or no additional
production cost. From a social perspective, private companies generally make
insufficient investments in public goods, such as scientific research to develop
new technologies for health care or to expand utilization of renewable energy
resources. This “underinvestment” occurs because companies pursue investment projects based on the potential value to themselves and generally do not
consider the full benefit to society that could result from the investment.
For example, suppose a company was considering investing in research to
develop a vaccine against diabetes. Once developed, the company would
sell the drug at a price set high enough to recover its research costs and to
generate some profit. Ultimately, the company would evaluate the merits
of the investment based on the profit it expected to receive from selling the
vaccine relative to the profit it could earn on other possible investments.
Unfortunately, the price the firm would need to charge could exceed what
some people who would benefit from the drug can afford to pay. As a result,
some people who could benefit from the vaccine will not get it, and the
company will underestimate the full value of this research investment. That
is, the research will have a public value that is greater than its private value to
the company. Put another way, for goods with large social benefits, private
markets tend to offer smaller returns than are needed to result in efficient
levels of investment.
164  |  Economic Report of the President

Tax credits can be used to “fill the gap,” by providing the company with
an additional incentive that will encourage it to undertake this publicly
beneficial investment. In the area of alternative energy, the Administration
successfully extended existing research and development tax credits and
expanded upon them in 2005 and 2006, providing an additional 20 percent
credit for qualified energy research and increasing the percentage of research
and development expenses that qualify for the credit. In 2005 and 2006,
private industry research and development grew notably. Annual research
and development spending by private industry grew by only 2.9 percent
per year over the 20 years from 1985 through 2004. Subsequently, private
industry research and development grew at an average rate of 5.1 percent per
year in 2005 and 2006.

International Competitiveness
Today’s global economy enjoys more economic interconnectedness than
ever before. Efficiency improvements in information, communication, and
transportation technologies have increased the ability of international firms to
compete with U.S. firms in domestic and international markets. Associated
improvements in the international mobility of capital mean that modern
companies have a high degree of international flexibility regarding the location of new facilities. Thus, companies that want to open new facilities can
compare investment opportunities across the globe to find locations with
the highest after-tax return. As a result, a country’s corporate tax policy,
including its statutory tax rates, can have a significant impact on both job
creation and the competitiveness of businesses within that country. There is
ample evidence that companies include tax considerations when determining
where to locate new facilities, a fact that has led to a sense of competition
between countries as they try to attract companies by reducing their respective
corporate tax rates.
To illustrate the trend toward lower corporate tax rates, Chart 5-3 shows
the statutory corporate tax rate for the United States and the average
(weighted by gross domestic product (GDP)) statutory corporate tax rate
for non-U.S. members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) since 1981. (State and local rates are combined with
the Federal statutory rates where appropriate.) During the early 1980s, the
United States had a statutory corporate tax rate of nearly 50 percent, which
was higher than the OECD average. Significant tax reform in 1986 reduced
the United States’s combined (Federal and State) rate to about 39 percent,
a level it has roughly maintained since then. While this change reduced the
U.S. tax rate to well below that of most other OECD countries in the late

Chapter 5  |  165

1980s, other countries soon began reducing their corporate tax rates as well.
By 2008, the non-U.S. OECD average corporate tax rate had fallen to about
30 percent, and the non-U.S. median corporate tax rate stood at 27.5 percent.
Table 5-2 gives statutory tax rates for most OECD countries; the United
States currently has the second highest statutory corporate tax rate of any
industrialized country, less than 1 percentage point below Japan’s.
That said, the United States offers companies a more generous depreciation
allowance than do most other countries—only Italy and Greece offer greater
allowances (see Table 5-2). When considered together, the high statutory tax
rate in the United States is somewhat mitigated by its generous depreciation
allowance. However, as shown in the last column of Table 5-2, the United
States still has the fourth highest effective marginal tax rate on equity-financed
projects, which can dampen the competitiveness of U.S. businesses and can
dissuade firms from locating new facilities—and the associated jobs—here in
the United States.

Future Challenges
The tax policy changes of the past 8 years have considerably reduced the
burden on taxpayers and improved the efficiency of U.S. income tax laws.
However, there is more work to be done. In addition to making these
changes a permanent part of the tax code, the AMT needs to be reformed
or even eliminated, and the tax code should be greatly simplified because
complying with its incredible complexity consumes resources that could be
put to better use elsewhere.

Making Tax Relief Permanent
Failing to extend the tax relief enacted over the past 8 years would amount
to one of the largest tax increases in history. Individuals at all income levels,
from low-income Earned Income Tax Credit recipients to high-income
taxpayers, would be negatively affected. The total increase would average
nearly 1.9 percent of GDP per year over the next 10 years and would increase
the tax burden on the economy to well above the average over the past
40 years of 18.3 percent of GDP.
Taxing business income reduces the incentive people have to invest in
businesses. Tax relief has encouraged greater business investment over the last
several years. Going back to the high tax rates of the 1990s could reduce business investment, which could in turn reduce workers’ wages and economic
growth. In an international context, higher corporate tax rates would make
locating new businesses in the United States less attractive, and would further
depress jobs and growth.

These lower tax rates have had many positive consequences for the
economy. Lower taxes for individuals increased people’s disposable income,
allowing them to save more and spend more. Lower taxes for businesses
increased business incentives to invest in new capital assets, which will
improve worker productivity and wages and increase their international
competitiveness. Letting tax relief expire will remove many of the gains made
in each of these areas.

Fixing the Alternative Minimum Tax
The first minimum tax was enacted in 1969 in response to a Treasury
Department report that a number of high-income taxpayers had no Federal
income tax liability in 1966. The Alternative Minimum Tax, which is
a parallel tax system with its own set of exemptions, deductions, and tax
rates, was intended to ensure that high-income taxpayers pay their fair share
of taxes. A major difference between the regular income tax laws and the
AMT is that several significant deductions allowed under the regular income
tax—such as personal exemptions, State and local income taxes, and business
expenses—are not allowed under the AMT.
Technically, all taxpayers are required to compute their tax liability under
both the regular income tax laws and the AMT and then pay the larger tax
amount. Having to compute one’s tax liability twice increases both compliance costs and the complexity of the tax code. In practice, the large income
exemption available under the AMT means low-income taxpayers hardly
ever owe more under the AMT. For many years, middle-income taxpayers
were similarly unaffected by the AMT. However, the major problem with
the AMT is that, unlike the regular tax exemptions and bracket thresholds,
the AMT values are not indexed for inflation. This means that, as people’s
incomes naturally rise, even if only with inflation, an increasing number
of middle-income taxpayers find themselves having a greater tax liability
under the AMT than they do under the regular tax code. To counteract this
problem, the exemption has been permanently increased several times, most
recently in 1993, to $45,000 for joint returns and to $33,750 for singles.
Above the exemption amount, the AMT tax rate is 26 percent on the first
$175,000 of taxable income and 28 percent thereafter. (Adjusting for inflation, the $45,000 exemption in 1993 is worth more than $66,000 in 2008
dollars.)
In its first year of operation, the minimum tax affected only 19,000 taxpayers
and raised about $122 million, meaning this tax caused these taxpayers to owe
$122 million more in tax than they owed under the regular tax laws. In 2007,
the AMT affected over 4 million taxpayers and raised roughly $26 billion in
revenue (about 1 percent of all Federal revenue). Under current law, these

168  |  Economic Report of the President

numbers are projected to increase to over 29 million taxpayers and over $100
billion in revenue in 2009.
Chart 5-4 shows the number of taxpayers who are forecast to be affected by
the AMT under different future policies. Under current law—with the AMT
parameters returning to their 1993 levels after 2008 and tax relief expiring
at the end of 2010—the number of AMT-affected taxpayers will rise sharply
in 2009, ultimately reaching nearly 44 million taxpayers in 2018. In 2008,
Congress enacted an AMT “patch,” which adjusted the AMT parameters for
1 year to $69,950 for joint returns and $46,200 for singles (Congress has
enacted short-term changes to the AMT parameters several times since 2001).
If this patch is permanently extended and tax relief is allowed to expire at the
end of 2010, the number of AMT-affected taxpayers would rise to 8 million
in 2018. Alternately, if tax relief is extended (the “policy baseline” lines in
Chart 5-4) the number of AMT-affected taxpayers will grow to 56 million in
2018 if the AMT parameters are allowed to return to their 1993 levels or to
21 million taxpayers if the AMT patch is permanently extended.
Taxpayers with many dependents or significant business deductions and
those in high-tax States are more likely to be subject to the AMT. Three
reductions to taxable income allowed under regular tax laws but not under the
AMT are personal exemptions, miscellaneous business deductions, and State
and local taxes. Taxpayers claiming more dependents may be accustomed to

Chapter 5  |  169

seeing a large reduction in taxable income because of the personal exemption
allowed for each dependent, but no corresponding reduction is available under
the AMT. Similarly, miscellaneous business deductions, allowable under the
regular tax laws when they exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI),
are not deductible under the AMT. Taxpayers in a State with relatively high
income taxes or relatively high property taxes receive a relatively large deduction under the regular tax laws but receive no relief for this expense under the
AMT. The result of these items not being deductible under the AMT is that
people with these deductions are more likely to be subject to the AMT than are
people without these deductions. Among otherwise similar people, taxpayers
with these deductions generally still pay less in Federal income tax than do
people without these deductions, but the existence of the AMT reduces the
tax benefit these deductions provide and means these people will have the extra
work of filling out the additional form(s) required for the AMT.
Prior to 1998, most personal credits (such as the education tax credits and
the child and dependent care credit) could not be used to reduce tax liability
owed under the AMT. In fact, even if a taxpayer did not owe additional tax
under the AMT, he or she would be prohibited from using the full amount
of a credit if it would reduce his or her tax liability below the level determined
under the AMT. This reduction in credit usefulness was yet another way
people could be “hit” by the AMT.

AMT Reform Ideas
The most obvious way to deal with the AMT would be to abolish it entirely,
although this would require the Federal Government to forgo over $1.7 trillion in revenue over the next 10 years (assuming tax relief is extended through
at least 2018). Short of that, there are several incremental approaches that
could be used. One alternative would be for Congress to enact permanent
inflation indexing of the AMT income exemption and other parameters.
The recent experiences when 1-year increases in the AMT exemptions were
enacted make clear that a permanent solution is needed. Other ways to
reduce the impact of the AMT on the middle class include allowing deductions for personal exemptions and State and local taxes. Prohibiting taxpayers
from using their personal exemptions under the AMT means the AMT treats
large families differently than the regular tax code does, and effectively makes
it more expensive for people to raise a family.

Simplifying the Tax Code
Finally, it remains difficult to overstate the complexity of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code: at standard print sizes, it would fill thousands of pages, with
more added nearly every year. Deductions, exemptions, phase-outs, credits,
and the AMT add complexity to the tax code that makes it challenging for
170  |  Economic Report of the President

ordinary people to determine their tax liability. See Box 5-3 for a fuller
discussion of these issues.

Box 5-3: Tax Code Complexity
The U.S. individual income tax system is extremely difficult to
understand and, as a result, imposes a substantial burden on taxpayers
in the form of time and money spent complying with its various
rules. There are dozens of tax credits and deductions, many of which
target specific social goals. As the number of credits and deductions
has grown over the years, the number of overlapping provisions has
also increased, which often creates complicated interactions among
provisions. Further, eligibility can vary across similar tax preferences
due to idiosyncratic definitions and complicated phase-out provisions
intended to limit tax benefits to lower-income taxpayers. For example:
•	 The tax code currently contains a dozen special tax preferences relating
to educational expenses. Three commonly utilized preferences—the
Hope credit, the Lifetime Learning credit, and the tuition deduction—
help families meet the costs of post-secondary education, but each
provision varies in terms of eligibility and benefits. Also, the use of
one tax provision may affect a student’s ability to use one of the other
provisions and can even affect a student’s eligibility for subsidized
student loans or Pell Grants.
•	 Phase-out provisions reduce the benefit of certain tax preferences
(such as personal exemptions and the tuition deduction) for highincome taxpayers. Similarly, the maximum allowable amount of
itemized deductions can be reduced for taxpayers with an AGI above
$159,950 (in 2008). These provisions require additional calculations
for taxpayers and also effectively increase their marginal tax rate. In
2008, an estimated 13 percent of taxpayers who itemized deductions
will have their allowable itemized deductions reduced.
•	 When the parents of a qualifying child file separate tax returns, the tax
code contains a number of special rules to determine which parent
can claim the child as a dependent. These rules depend on the marital
status and adjusted gross income of the parents as well as on the
amount of time the child lives with each parent.
•	 To prevent parents from shifting investment income to their children,
the unearned income of dependent filers is taxed at the parents’
marginal tax rate. However, to limit this provision to higher-income
families, this applies only to a child’s unearned income in excess of a
certain limit ($1,800 in 2008).
•	 As discussed in the text, the AMT, which requires taxpayers to
calculate their tax liability a second time using a different set of tax
rules and rates, affects a growing number of taxpayers.

Chapter 5  |  171

Complying with these complex laws costs taxpayers time and money. It
takes time to read and understand the laws, to collect the relevant data and
keep records, and to fill in the forms themselves (or to have someone else do
it). In fact, the tax laws are so complex that an entire industry of lawyers and
accountants exists to help people comply with the laws and even to find ways
to avoid paying the taxes they owe. The resources used in this industry are
unavailable for use to produce other goods and services. In effect, other than
for tax-related purposes, there are no consumable goods or services produced
by these resources—one could argue that the economy is wasting these
resources. Several studies have examined the social cost of the complexity
of our tax code. A Government summary of these studies concludes that
the annual cost of complying with the tax laws averages at least 1 percent of
GDP (about $140 billion in 2008) and may be even higher. Tax reform that
substantially simplified the tax code would free up these resources for more
beneficial uses.

Conclusion
Taxes distort incentives to work, save, and invest. By lowering individual
income tax rates at all income levels over the past 8 years, the Administration
has substantially reduced these distortions and increased incentives to work,
save, and invest. Lower Federal tax rates on capital gains and dividend
income, along with the temporary increases in depreciation allowances,
increased business incentives to purchase new capital equipment and reduced
the double taxation of corporate income. Each of these changes improves the
efficiency of the tax structure, enhances economic growth, and improves our
standard of living over the long run. However, most of these tax reductions
are scheduled to expire at the end of 2010, which would eliminate many of
the gains made over the past 8 years. Allowing these tax reductions to expire
will increase taxes for all income groups, with the lower- and middle-income
groups experiencing the largest percentage increases.
Despite the improvements of the past 8 years, there remains much to
be done to make the tax code as efficient as possible. In the international
arena, the relatively low U.S. corporate tax rates of the late 1980s were left
unchanged while most other developed countries dramatically reduced rates.
As a result, U.S. corporate tax rates are now among the highest in the developed world. This handicap is partly offset by other tax provisions, such as
generous depreciation allowances. But the resulting tax burden still places
U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies in lowertax jurisdictions, and it reduces our ability to attract capital in an environment
where capital is highly mobile across international borders. In addition, two

172  |  Economic Report of the President

long-standing problems needing attention are the Alternative Minimum Tax
and the complexity of the U.S. income tax laws. Without its annual “patch,”
the AMT would affect more than 20 million more taxpayers each year.

The Long-Run Challenges of
Entitlement Spending

F

ederal spending on entitlement programs is expected to increase
dramatically in the coming decades, particularly for Social Security,
Medicare, and Medicaid. Taken together, these programs currently
constitute 45 percent of Federal non-interest spending; assuming there are no
major changes to these programs, this share is projected to rise dramatically
in coming decades. An aging population and rising health care spending per
person are major reasons for these projected increases. The primary objective
of this chapter is to highlight the budgetary challenges facing each of the three
major entitlement programs and to outline possible strategies for addressing
these challenges.
The key points of this chapter are:
•	 Federal entitlement spending is on an unsustainable path.   Spending
on the three major entitlement programs—Social Security, Medicare,
and Medicaid—is projected to increase much faster than tax revenues
or than the overall economy over the coming decades. Paying all scheduled benefits would eventually require substantial reductions in other
Government spending, or major tax increases, or both.
•	 The aging population is a major cause of the expected increase, especially
for Social Security, representing a permanent, as opposed to temporary,
shift in the entitlement landscape. Currently, one out of six adults is age
65 or older; by 2020, one out of five adults will be 65 or older; and, by
2030, one out of four adults will be age 65 or older.
•	 The pay-as-you-go financing structure of Social Security, coupled with
the aging population, creates a sizeable structural imbalance that will
cause current and future generations of workers to bear increasing costs,
or receive smaller benefits than now scheduled, or both.
•	 Over the past 30 years, real per capita health care spending has grown
considerably faster than real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.
Real growth in Medicare spending is being driven by increasing
enrollment, greater utilization of more expensive high-technology
medical treatments, and expansion of the goods and services covered by
the program.
•	 Long-term care expenditures for low-income elderly and disabled
persons represent a large and growing share of total Medicaid spending.
The demand for long-term care is expected to grow in the United States
as a result of the aging population. In turn, this will place even greater
financial strain on Federal and State budgets.
175

Background Facts About Entitlement Programs
Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are key components of the U.S.
social safety net. This section briefly reviews the evolution and current
structure of each program.

Social Security
The Social Security system protects people from income loss due to life
events such as retirement, a period of disability, or the death of a household
wage earner. This system was introduced in 1935, when it is estimated that
over half of the elderly lacked the income needed to care for themselves. In
2007, approximately 50 million beneficiaries received $585 billion in benefit
payments. Approximately $486 billion of these benefits was paid to over
40 million retirees and survivors, and $99 billion was paid to 8.9 million
disabled workers and their families. Nearly 90 percent of all individuals
aged 65 and over received some benefit from Social Security in 2006 (the
most recent year for which these data are available). Social Security benefits
provided about 58 percent of all income received by individuals age 65 and
older and for 32 percent of recipients, Social Security benefits provided over
90 percent of their entire income.
Social Security is largely a pay-as-you-go program, meaning that current
benefits are financed primarily with a payroll tax on wages earned by current
workers. Employers and employees each pay 6.2 percent of wages—although
economists generally believe the employer’s portion is passed on to workers in
the form of lower wages—up to a maximum amount of taxable wages. This
maximum, called the contribution and benefit base, increases each year as
average wages increase; it was $102,000 in 2008, increasing to $106,800 in
2009. Self-employed individuals pay the entire 12.4 percent.
As a result of legislation enacted in 1983, Social Security began collecting
more revenue than was needed to pay benefits each year, thereby requiring
current workers to partially prefund future retirement benefits. The annual
surpluses have been placed in the Social Security Trust Fund, which is
invested in special U.S. Treasury bonds, used only for this purpose. In 2007,
Social Security ran a surplus of $190 billion, which brought the balance in the
Trust Fund to over $2.2 trillion. Because the value of the assets accumulated
in the Trust Fund is exactly offset by the liability of the general fund to repay
the special Treasury bonds, the Social Security Trust Fund has zero net value
for the Government.
The Social Security benefit a worker receives in retirement is based on the
average wage he or she earns when working and paying the Social Security
payroll tax. Workers who earned higher wages get larger benefits, but the
portion of preretirement income replaced by Social Security declines as
176  |  Economic Report of the President

preretirement wage income rises. An individual must have worked and paid
Social Security taxes for 40 quarters (10 years of employment) to be eligible
for retirement benefits. Individuals become eligible for a reduced benefit at
age 62, while those who work past full retirement age can receive a larger
benefit for each year worked up to age 70. Once a retiree’s initial benefit has
been determined, it increases each year with annual cost-of-living adjustments
that are based on the inflation rate for the previous year.
More than one in six recipients of Social Security benefits receive their benefits through the Disability Insurance program. This program provides monthly
benefits to workers and their families for workers who are unable to work for
a year or more. The Social Security Administration has guidelines about the
conditions that must be met before an individual can receive this benefit.

Medicare
Beginning in the 1930s and for several subsequent decades, policymakers
considered legislation that would create a larger role for Government in the
provision of health insurance for Americans, particularly for those who faced
financial barriers to medical care. Before Medicare was created in 1965,
almost 50 percent of older adults lacked health insurance. Originally, only
people age 65 and older were eligible for Medicare. In 1972, eligibility was
expanded to include those receiving Social Security Disability Insurance
payments for 2 consecutive years and those with end-stage renal disease who
meet specific eligibility requirements. Today, nearly 45 million individuals
are enrolled in Medicare, including approximately 38 million elderly and
7 million disabled beneficiaries.
Medicare has four parts:
•	 Part A, also known as Hospital Insurance, provides coverage for inpatient
hospital services, some home health care, hospice, and up to 100 days
in a skilled nursing facility after a qualifying inpatient stay. Individuals
who have worked at least 40 quarters in qualified employment are automatically enrolled in Part A upon reaching age 65. Individuals who lack
40 quarters of employment can buy into Part A when they reach 65 years
of age by paying a monthly premium (plus a late penalty if enrolling
after the initial eligibility period); in 2009, the maximum monthly
premium is $443.
•	 Part B provides coverage for outpatient services, including outpatient provider visits, emergency room services, and certain preventive
screening measures. Enrollment in Part B is optional (there is a
penalty for enrolling after the initial eligibility period) and requires
a premium contribution, which is higher for individuals who make
more than $85,000 per year, based on their most recent Federal income
tax return.
Chapter 6  |  177

•	 Part C, also called Medicare Advantage, uses private health plans to
provide Part A and B and, in most cases, Part D benefits. Medicare
Advantage plans often include benefits not covered by traditional
Medicare. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
Modernization Act of 2003 changed how the Government reimburses
health plans for the coverage they provide to enrollees. This resulted in
an increase in the number of private plan choices available to beneficiaries in every county in America. Enrollment growth has been steady,
most likely due to improved access to Medicare Advantage plans and
more generous benefits. Current enrollment is nearly 10 million beneficiaries, representing over 20 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries.
•	 Part D, also created by the 2003 legislation, is an optional, outpatient
prescription drug benefit. This benefit is administered by private health
insurance plan sponsors that contract with the Federal Government. In
2008, 32 million Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in stand-alone
prescription drug plans, Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans, or
employer/union plans receiving the Retiree Drug Subsidy.
Medicare is financed primarily through a combination of payroll taxes,
general revenues, and premiums paid by beneficiaries. Part A is financed
primarily by a dedicated payroll tax of 2.9 percent, which is split evenly
between employees and employers. If total non-interest revenues exceed
Medicare Part A spending for a particular year, the difference is placed into
the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. If non-interest revenues are lower than
spending, money is withdrawn from the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.
At the end of 2007, the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund had a balance of
$326 billion; however, under the Medicare Trustees’ intermediate estimates,
this balance is expected to begin declining in 2008.
Medicare Part B is financed by general revenues and beneficiary premiums,
the latter of which are set to equal approximately 25 percent of total expected
spending. Part D is also financed through beneficiary premiums and general
revenues, as well as State payments for low-income beneficiaries who are
also enrolled in Medicaid. Medicare Advantage (Part C) is not separately
financed; rather, it is simply a vehicle for providing Part A, Part B, and typically Part D benefits. Projections by the Medicare Trustees indicate that
in 2010, approximately 45 percent of non-interest income will come from
payroll taxes, 39 percent from general revenues, 12 percent from beneficiary
premiums, and the remainder from miscellaneous sources.

Medicaid
Medicaid provides medical assistance to low-income individuals, including
children and parents in working families, children and adults with severe
disabilities, and low-income Medicare beneficiaries, who are known as
178  |  Economic Report of the President

“dual eligibles” because of their eligibility for both programs. The Federal
and State Governments share responsibility for administering and funding
Medicaid. For States to receive Federal funding, their Medicaid plans must
cover specific populations, including children under the age of 6 and pregnant women whose family income is below 133 percent of the poverty level;
school-age children (ages 6 to 18) with family income below 100 percent
of the poverty level; parents with income below States’ July 1996 welfare
eligibility levels; and certain other low-income and disabled persons. In addition, with approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
States have the flexibility to expand Medicaid eligibility to other groups of
individuals, including those whose incomes exceed the mandatory thresholds
indicated above.
Medicaid programs cover a broad set of health care services, including
inpatient and outpatient services, dental care, family planning, mental health,
substance abuse treatment, home health care, and long-term care services. In
2007, Medicaid monthly enrollment averaged approximately 48.1 million
people, including 23.5 million children.
Medicaid is jointly financed by the Federal Government and the States.
The Federal Government’s share of each State’s Medicaid spending is based on
the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), which is calculated using
a formula that incorporates data on average per capita income for each State
and for the United States as a whole for the most recent 3 years. The FMAP
formula is designed to provide a larger Federal share of spending for States with
lower per capita income relative to the national average, with Federal shares
ranging from a minimum of 50 percent to a maximum of 83 percent. Overall,
Federal Government expenditures on Medicaid account for approximately
57 percent of total annual Medicaid spending. Unlike Medicare, the Medicaid
program does not have any dedicated revenue sources; rather, Federal expenditures come from the general fund of the Federal Government.
As part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the State Children’s Health
Insurance Program (SCHIP) was created to provide health insurance to
uninsured children under age 19 who live in low-income families that are
not eligible for Medicaid. In 2007, more than 7 million children enrolled
in SCHIP. States have significant flexibility in terms of their program
design. In particular, they can implement SCHIP by expanding their existing
Medicaid programs, creating separate programs, or using a combination of
the two approaches. States that implement SCHIP as a Medicaid expansion
must provide all of the benefits offered through their Medicaid programs,
while States that choose to have separate SCHIP programs must provide
benefits that meet specific Federal standards. Like Medicaid, the SCHIP
program is financed jointly by the Federal Government and the States,
although the Federal matching rate for SCHIP is higher than the rate used
for Medicaid, and ranges from 65 percent to 83 percent of total spending.
Chapter 6  |  179

Unlike Medicaid, SCHIP is not actually an entitlement program, but is
instead a matching grant program that has a fixed limit on Federal spending,
both nationally and State by State.

Major Entitlement Spending Over Time
Federal Government expenditures for Social Security, Medicare, and
Medicaid have grown from 3.8 percent of GDP in 1970 to roughly
8.4 percent of GDP in 2008. (For comparison, Federal revenue generated
from all sources averaged 18.3 percent of GDP over the last several decades.)
Estimates of expected future growth in entitlement spending consistently
predict sharply rising expenditures in coming decades, although such projections depend on specific assumptions made for a variety of economic and
demographic variables. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
projects that in the absence of reforms, by 2020, spending on these three
programs will exceed 10 percent of GDP; by 2040, it will reach 14.9 percent
of GDP, and by 2080, it will reach 18.9 percent of GDP. It is important to
note, however, that there is considerable uncertainty among long-run forecasts. For example, under its Alternative Fiscal Scenario, the Congressional
Budget Office (CBO) projects that Federal spending will rise much faster,
reaching 11.2 percent of GDP by 2020, 16.8 percent of GDP by 2040, and
exceeding 25 percent of GDP by 2080. The primary difference between the
OMB and CBO projections (and other projections) is in their forecasts of
future health care expenditures; in contrast, their forecasts of Social Security
growth are very similar. Chart 6-1 uses the OMB projections to contrast the
projected growth in these programs with other Federal spending, which fell in
the 1990s with declines in defense spending, rose with increased Homeland
Security spending over the past few years, and is assumed to decline in the
coming decades, primarily due to declines in defense and other discretionary
spending. Two trends can be discerned from Chart 6-1. One trend is the
growth in Social Security spending expected over the next two decades. In
2008, Social Security spending constituted approximately 4.3 percent of
GDP. CBO estimates this share will grow to 6.1 percent of GDP by 2030,
with OMB estimating growth to 5.9 percent of GDP by 2030. After 2030,
the share of GDP spent on Social Security remains relatively constant under
both forecasts. Population aging is the main cause of this growth, a factor
that also affects Medicare costs.
The second trend shown in Chart 6-1 is that after the period of Social
Security’s rapid cost growth, health care expenditure growth will cause
Medicare and Medicaid spending to grow far more over the long term.
In 2008, Medicare and Medicaid respectively constituted 2.7 percent and
1.4 percent of GDP. CBO projects that, absent reforms, in 2030 these
180  |  Economic Report of the President

shares will rise to 5.9 percent of GDP for Medicare and 2.5 percent of GDP
for Medicaid. In comparison, OMB predicts that, absent reforms, in 2030
Medicare spending will be 5.0 percent of GDP and Medicaid spending will
be 2.4 percent of GDP. By 2060, CBO projects spending for these programs
will grow to 11.2 and 3.3 percent of GDP, respectively, while OMB projects
spending will grow to 7.7 and 3.2 percent of GDP, respectively. Note that
the major difference between the two forecasts lies in their estimates of the
growth in health care expenditures per beneficiary.
Even under the more optimistic OMB projections, expected growth in
entitlement spending will place a significant burden on the Federal budget and
will require policymakers to make hard choices about the financing and benefit
structures of these entitlement programs, as well as other Federal spending.

Social Security
During the program’s first four decades, spending for Social Security
benefits steadily increased relative to the size of the economy, reaching about
4 percent of GDP in the mid-1970s. This initial growth was driven largely
by repeated program expansions that broadened coverage to include benefits
for spouses and dependent children of retirees (1939), survivors of deceased
workers (1939), the self-employed (1950), and disabled individuals (1956).
Since then, annual spending for Social Security benefits has generally fluctuated between 4.1 percent and 4.5 percent of GDP.
Chapter 6  |  181

As shown in Table 6-1, the number of Social Security beneficiaries is
expected to more than double from 2000 to 2050, while the total population
will increase by roughly 50 percent. The relative growth of the number of
elderly individuals means that a larger share of the adult (age 18 and over)
population will be drawing Social Security benefits in the years ahead. The
demands imposed on the Social Security program by the baby boomers will
diminish by the middle of the 21st century, but the expectation of a relatively
constant fertility rate in combination with increasing lifespans means the
portion of the adult population drawing Social Security benefits will remain
high by historical standards. Box 6-1 describes some of the ways in which
the Social Security program influences the saving behavior and labor supply
decisions of individuals.

Box 6-1: Undesirable Consequences of Social Security
The specific taxation and benefit structure of Social Security produces
some undesirable consequences that may discourage participants from
working and saving. Reduced work and saving levels reduce national
output (GDP) and gradually reduce the U.S. standard of living over time
from what it could have been. Efforts to reform Social Security should
address each of these disincentives.
There are at least three ways Social Security discourages work and
saving. First, the system imposes high effective tax rates on secondary
earners. The benefit available to a married couple is either the sum of
the benefits they are each individually eligible for or up to 150 percent
of the higher earner’s benefit, whichever is larger. This structure means
the lower earner in a couple receives very little return on his or her Social
continued on the next page

182  |  Economic Report of the President

Box 6-1 — continued
Security tax contributions and, if the low earner’s wage is low enough,
may not realize any benefit from his or her tax contributions. This
reduces the reward for the second member of a married couple to work
outside the home and can contribute to a decision not to participate in
the labor force at all. As an extreme example, this can also cause the
Social Security taxes paid by a low-income two-earner couple to subsidize the benefits received by a high-income one-earner couple.
Second, the program encourages early retirement. The existence of
an Early Eligibility Age encourages workers to retire earlier than they
may have done in the absence of Social Security. In fact, while the
decision of when to retire probably depends on many factors, the mere
existence of a sure income source in retirement, via Social Security
benefits, could encourage people to retire earlier. The average age of
retirement has been declining steadily, from over 67 in the early 1950s to
under 63 in the early 2000s. When workers retire early, they pay less tax
into Social Security and draw benefits for a longer period of time. This
provision thus places additional stresses on Social Security finances and
reduces the total amount of labor supplied to the economy.
Few people work past normal retirement age, perhaps because, in
terms of one’s Social Security benefit, the return to working past normal
retirement age is modest at best. While a person who delays taking
Social Security benefits receives a larger monthly benefit, they receive
this benefit for a shorter period of time. The actuarial present value of
the deferred payments is almost identical to the value of the payments
that could be taken at normal retirement age. When one considers the
additional taxes a person pays on labor income earned after normal
retirement age, the return to working after this age may even be negative. This provides little incentive for people to work past their normal
retirement age.
Third, Social Security discourages private saving. Social Security is
a system that effectively forces people to save for their retirement—a
portion of their wage is taken away and, in return, they expect income
during retirement. From the perspective of an individual planning for
his or her retirement, it makes little difference whether this income
comes from a government program or from his or her own investments.
However, when individuals do their own saving, the money is used by
the financial markets to expand the economy. With a pay-as-you-go
Social Security system, the taxes collected today are used to pay benefits for current retirees, and no actual saving occurs in terms of money
going into financial markets. This means that a pay-as-you-go Social
Security system actually reduces economy-wide saving, which reduces
economic growth from what it could have been.

Medicare and Medicaid
Public spending on health care has increased as a share of total U.S.
personal health care expenditures over the past several decades, as shown in
Chart 6-2. In 1960, only 21 percent of personal health care spending was paid
for by Federal and State Governments. With the introduction of Medicare
and Medicaid in 1965, and SCHIP in 1997, public spending as a share of total
health care spending has more than doubled to 45 percent. In contrast, the
share of personal health care spending that is paid out of pocket by individuals
has fallen dramatically from 55 percent in 1960 to just 15 percent of total
spending in 2006.
Medicare expenditures, which include benefit payments and administrative
expenses, were $432 billion, or approximately $10,500 per enrollee, in 2007.
Between 1980 and 2006, real Medicare spending, that is, spending adjusted for
the effects of inflation, grew at an average annual rate of 6.4 percent. This rate
is higher than the 3.1 percent average annual growth rate for real GDP during
that period. From 2008 to 2017, the Medicare Trustees’ intermediate projections, which take into account currently legislated reductions in physician
payment rates, suggest real Medicare spending will grow at an average rate of
6.0 percent per year. This rate exceeds projected average real economic growth of
2.8 percent per year over the same period.

184  |  Economic Report of the President

Government spending on Medicaid and SCHIP includes benefit payments,
administrative expenses, and payments for the Vaccines for Children
program. Collectively, the Federal Government and States spent $352
billion on Medicaid and an additional $10 billion on SCHIP in 2008. Of
this total, Federal spending was approximately $190 billion for Medicaid and
$7 billion for SCHIP. The amount spent on different Medicaid enrollee groups
varies considerably. While the elderly and disabled represent the smallest
groups in terms of numbers of enrollees (28.1 percent), they account for over
67 percent of spending, as depicted in Chart 6-3. (See Box 6-2 for a discussion of Medicaid and long-term care expenditures.) In contrast, children are
much less expensive to cover. In 2007, almost half of total Medicaid enrollees
were children, and yet they generated less than 20 percent of total spending.
Between 1997 and 2007, real Federal Medicaid spending grew at an average
of 3.5 percent per year. This growth reflects a number of factors, including
increased enrollment from outreach efforts and eligibility expansions, increased
use of high-technology services (such as advanced diagnostic imaging and
prescription drugs), and greater reliance on Medicaid to cover long-term care
expenses. Medicaid spending is expected to continue growing faster in real
terms than the overall economy throughout the coming decade.

Chapter 6  |  185

Box 6-2: Long-Term Care and Medicaid
Today, about 10 million Americans receive long-term care services.
Long-term care refers to medical care and support required by someone
with a chronic illness or disability over an extended period of time.
Typical long-term care services range from providing assistance with
eating, bathing, and dressing, to managing medications and preparing
food. Most people who require long-term care are 65 years of age or
older. This demographic cohort is projected to grow dramatically over
the next several decades, greatly increasing demand for long-term care
services.
Current estimates suggest the average cost of nursing home care
is $68,000 per year, an amount high enough to strain most families’
finances. Private long-term care insurance represents one way individuals can obtain financial protection from these costs. Yet most people
do not purchase long-term care insurance.
In 2005, Medicaid expenditures for long-term care services were
$101 billion, representing 49 percent of the Nation’s spending on longterm care. Under Federal law, State Medicaid programs must cover
nursing home care and home health care, and may opt to cover some
personal care services as well for qualified individuals. In contrast,
Medicare covers only some home health care and limited recuperative
care in skilled nursing facilities following a qualified inpatient hospitalization. In 2005, Medicare’s share of total U.S. long-term care spending
was approximately 20 percent.
Medicaid expenditures have grown rapidly in recent years with the
increasing cost of covering long-term care and a growing population of
elderly and disabled people. Medicaid expenditures on long-term care,
including skilled nursing care as well as home- and community-based
services, are expected to grow at an average real rate of approximately
6 percent per year over the next decade. By 2017, Medicaid long-term
care expenditures for the Federal Government and States are projected
to reach $228 billion. In the absence of fundamental reforms, this
enormous entitlement burden will severely strain both Federal and
State budgets.

Factors That Drive Expenditure Growth
Over Time
Growth in expenditures for Social Security is expected to accelerate as
the baby-boom generation retires, after which it is expected to level off. In
contrast, expenditures for Medicare and Medicaid are expected to continue
rising faster than GDP. This section examines the main factors that drive
these expected increases in expenditures.

Demographic Shifts
The changing demographics of the United States population is an important factor in the growth of entitlement spending. With slowing birth rates
and increasing life expectancy, the U.S. population is aging. For example,
in 1950, less than 12 percent of the adult population was 65 or older; in
2008 this group constituted nearly 17 percent of the adult population.
Demographers estimate that this trend will continue and that by 2030,
twenty-five percent of the adult population—72 million people—will be at
least 65 years of age.
This demographic shift means there are fewer workers paying taxes into the
Social Security system for each retired person. To illustrate, in 1950, there
were 16 workers paying taxes into the Social Security system for each Social
Security beneficiary, meaning the effective tax burden on each worker was
only one-sixteenth of the average amount paid to each beneficiary. In 2007,
there were 3.3 workers per beneficiary. The number of workers per beneficiary is expected to fall further, to 2.6 workers per beneficiary in 2020 and to
2.1 workers per beneficiary in 2035. As the number of workers per beneficiary falls, the effective individual burden of taxes for both Social Security and
Medicare Part A increases. For example, for Social Security, the payroll tax
rate has been raised more than 20 times and the maximum annual amount
of taxable income has been increased statutorily 11 times since the program’s
inception. This maximum is now (since 1981) adjusted annually to reflect
average wage growth.
It is important to note that the demographic shift is not a temporary phenomenon brought on simply by the aging of the baby-boom generation. That is,
assuming stable fertility rates and immigration patterns, one should not expect
to return to a world with 16 workers—or even 5—contributing to each Social
Security recipient’s benefit after the baby-boom generation stops collecting
Social Security benefits. Chart 6-4 shows that in the very near future, as the
baby boomers retire en masse, the share of the adult population that is eligible
for Social Security and Medicare will begin shifting from a recent average of
about 16 percent to over 25 percent, where it will stay for the foreseeable future.

Chapter 6  |  187

A clear implication of this trend is that there will be fewer workers to pay taxes
to support each Social Security and Medicare recipient.

Increased Health Care Spending per Beneficiary
Advances in medicine over the past few decades have created new methods
for diagnosing illness and disease, as well as new therapies for preventing
and treating medical conditions. While these advances have contributed to
improvements in quality of life and longer life expectancy, they also have
contributed to greater utilization of complex, expensive treatments and higher
spending per person. This phenomenon is not restricted to Medicare and
Medicaid enrollees, but instead reflects broader health spending patterns
among individuals in the United States.
Although health insurance, including Medicare and Medicaid, provides
important financial protections, one consequence of comprehensive coverage
and a third-party payment system is that individuals have little incentive to
consider providers’ costs when making decisions about the medical care they
receive. This moral hazard effect can lead people to demand more medical
care than they would without insurance because their out-of-pocket cost at the
point of use constitutes only a small portion of the total cost of the service.
Among Medicare enrollees, moral hazard problems are exacerbated by the
widespread use of supplemental insurance, including retiree coverage, private
188  |  Economic Report of the President

Medigap plans, and Medicaid (for dual eligibles). In effect, the combination
of Medicare and supplemental insurance means enrollees pay only a very small
portion or none of the total cost of care, and as a result, price is removed as a
factor in determining how much medical care enrollees consume.

The Bottom Line
The permanent demographic shift and growth in per-person health care
spending suggest that there are two distinct aspects of these programs that
must be addressed. One aspect is program solvency: that is, how will the
Government finance the benefits scheduled to be paid over the near term to
current and future beneficiaries? Given the permanent nature of the demographic shift and the likelihood that future health care expenditures will
grow, it will be impossible for the Government to continue these entitlement
programs indefinitely as they currently exist. Thus, the second aspect that
must be addressed is the long-term sustainability of the programs.

The Financial Future of Social Security
The demographic transition to an older population that is already underway in
the United States will place increasing stress on the financing of Social Security
in the years ahead. This section examines the issues inherent in ensuring that
benefits can be paid in the near term (solvency) and the issues that must be
addressed to ensure long-term sustainability of this important program.

Addressing Future Solvency
Projections by the Social Security Administration (SSA) indicate that
payroll tax revenues will exceed expenses through 2016, then, beginning in
2017, it will be necessary to draw on Social Security Trust Fund assets to
pay all scheduled benefits. This would require making increasing amounts
of general revenue available from 2017–2041 to pay full scheduled benefits,
after which time the trust fund would be exhausted. Payroll tax revenues are
projected to be sufficient to pay 78 percent of scheduled benefits in 2041
and beyond.
As Social Security costs continue to rise faster than revenues, increasing
pressure will be placed on the general fund of the Federal Government. By
purchasing Treasury bonds with its annual surpluses, the Social Security Trust
Fund has been effectively lending money to the general fund of the Federal
Government. As Social Security’s annual surpluses decline, beginning after
2009, less money will be available to the Treasury Department from this
channel and the Government will increasingly be forced to find other revenue

Chapter 6  |  189

sources or reduce spending. The problems for the Federal budget intensify
in 2017, when Social Security will first need money from the general fund to
pay scheduled benefits. During the 2020s, Social Security will require larger
and larger transfers from the general fund as it redeems the Treasury bonds
that have accumulated in the trust fund, putting greater and greater pressure
on the Federal budget.
Most proposed solutions to the solvency issue involve some form of revenue
increases, or benefit reductions, or both. Social Security revenues could be
increased either by raising the payroll tax rate or increasing the maximum
amount of taxable earnings. However, as discussed in the preceding chapter,
imposing taxes distorts markets—higher taxes would decrease economic efficiency by worsening the adverse labor incentives discussed in Box 6-1.
There are a variety of ways Social Security benefits could be reduced, such
as further delaying the normal retirement age, or reducing scheduled benefits, particularly for higher-income workers. To help address the solvency
issue, the President embraced the concept of progressive price indexing for
new retirees. Progressive price indexing would reduce the growth in initial
benefits for new retirees, particularly for high-income workers, and thus
would reduce projected program costs in the decades ahead, while retaining
currently scheduled benefits for very low income workers.
Workers with higher preretirement earnings are eligible for a larger initial
benefit, but the marginal increase in the initial benefit decreases as a worker’s
preretirement income gets higher and higher. Progressive price indexing
would further reduce the rate at which benefits grow with preretirement
income, which would slow the year-by-year growth of initial benefits for
high- and middle-income retirees. This proposal would ensure that retirees of
the future will receive real benefits that are at least as high as those of today’s
retirees who are at comparable positions on the wage spectrum. Benefits
for all recipients would still increase annually via cost-of-living adjustments
to maintain the purchasing power of the benefits. Note that the current
benefit formula would be preserved for individuals with low preretirement
income. Estimates suggest that progressive price indexing would cover about
70 percent of the gap between income and outlays over the long term.
Benefits paid under the Disability Insurance program would not be affected
by this proposal.

Funding Future Benefits
The current Social Security system was designed in an era in which average
life expectancy was less than 65 years and few women participated in the labor
force. Today, average life expectancy is 78 years and about 60 percent of all
women participate in the labor force. The demographic and labor market

190  |  Economic Report of the President

changes that have occurred in the last 70 years or so render the pay-as-you-go
system of the 1930s inappropriate for the 21st century.
A central feature of the Administration’s 2005 proposals for Social Security
reform, the Personal Retirement Account (PRA), was designed to pre-fund a
portion of future benefit obligations. Participation in PRAs would be entirely
voluntary. Workers could choose to have up to 4 percentage points of their
current Social Security taxes go into their own, individual account. The Federal
Government would administer these accounts, making contributions and withdrawals as appropriate for each worker’s wages and individual choices.
Each worker could choose to have the funds in their account invested in any
of a set of prescreened, broadly diversified investment funds, similar to those
currently available to Government employees in their retirement savings plan.
Recent stock market declines raise concerns about the desirability of investing
even a portion of Social Security assets in the stock market. However, market
declines, like market increases, are a normal part of stock market behavior and
do not negate the desirability of owning stocks as part of a long-term investment strategy. From 1926 to 2000, even with several periods of significant
market decline, stocks generated an average annual return of 10.7 percent.
Nevertheless, there is currently much concern about the risks of investing
Social Security assets in the stock market. One way to mitigate these risks
could occur automatically; as workers near retirement age, their PRA investments could be moved to lower-risk, life-cycle funds, which ensure the safety
of the worker’s retirement benefits by progressively shifting more of the
worker’s investment from growth funds to secure bonds as the worker nears
retirement age.
A PRA-based system offers a partially self-funded retirement benefit while
retaining the social safety net aspects of the current system. A primary advantage of this system would be significantly reduced intergenerational transfers
from future workers entering the system. This system would give workers a
partial alternative to the current, pay-as-you-go, Social Security system that,
as discussed above, will require reducing benefits when the Social Security
Trust Fund is exhausted or force workers to bear ever-increasing tax burdens
as the population continues to age.
PRAs could be phased in to ensure that current retirees and workers nearing
retirement would receive the full Social Security benefits they are expecting.
PRAs would offer those who want it individual ownership and management
of retirement assets and could be transferable to family members if the worker
were to die prematurely. Finally, PRAs would reduce the disincentives the
current system generates regarding labor supply and saving decisions. (Box
6-1 describes the disincentives present in the current system.) For example,
PRAs reduce possible adverse labor supply effects for secondary earners by
giving them explicit rights to a portion of their Social Security assets.

The Financial Future of Medicare and Medicaid
Medicare and Medicaid are currently responsible for purchasing health
care services for over 80 million individuals in the United States annually—a
number that is expected to exceed 100 million by 2017. This section takes
a closer look at the future budgetary impact of these programs and identifies possible strategies for promoting long-term sustainability of Medicare
and Medicaid.
Recall that Medicare is financed predominately by payroll taxes, general
revenues, and beneficiary premiums. Under current projections in the 2008
Medicare Trustees Report, the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for
Part A is projected to be exhausted in 2019. The projected 75-year deficit
for the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is 3.54 percent of taxable
payroll. That is, the Medicare Hospital Insurance payroll tax would have to
immediately increase from a total of 2.90 percent to 6.44 percent to cover all
projected spending for Part A over the next 75 years. Thus, one option for
keeping Part A solvent would be to more than double the Medicare payroll
tax rate. For Medicare Parts B and D, as well as Medicaid, general revenues
are the largest source of financing. This suggests that, in the absence of
significant reforms to slow spending growth, spending on other government
programs will have to be dramatically reduced, budget deficits will grow
larger, or income taxes will have to increase.
Real spending growth for Medicare and Medicaid is on a much steeper
trajectory than projected growth for the economy as a whole. The long-term
sustainability of these programs is in question unless policymakers implement
a comprehensive set of reforms to slow both the overall growth in health
care spending as well as the Federal Government’s liabilities. Although
key stakeholders have not yet discovered a silver bullet for slowing overall
spending growth, insurers and providers are pursuing a variety of approaches
in an attempt to improve the efficiency of resource allocation and to slow the
growth of costs.
Some of these efforts focus on greater use of high-value health care services
by individuals, including preventive care (certain types of screening for
diseases), wellness initiatives (flu shots or smoking cessation advice), and
disease management for those with chronic conditions. Other efforts target
provider behavior, including adopting health information technology that may
reduce medical errors and duplication of services, and participating in qualitymeasurement activities and public reporting. In value-based purchasing,
insurers design payment systems that are tied more directly to the quality and
efficiency of care that is delivered by providers. One example includes payfor-performance programs, whereby providers may receive financial rewards if
the quality of care they provide achieves certain outcomes (such as a physician

192  |  Economic Report of the President

making sure that all of his diabetic patients receive HbA1c tests during the
year) or if a provider shows improvement over time in the quality of care he
or she provides. Of course, many of these initiatives are fairly recent and as
a result, the empirical evidence is not yet available to establish what impact
these particular initiatives might have for slowing overall cost growth.
A second strategy directly targets Federal spending growth vis-à-vis structural changes to the designs of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several
types of reform proposals are specifically aimed to reduce Federal spending
by altering the current structure of Medicare benefits. Increasing the age of
eligibility for Medicare, raising premiums, and modifying the benefit design
are three examples. Similar to the changes that were made to Social Security
in 1983, the age at which individuals become eligible for Medicare could
gradually increase. However, unlike Social Security, the savings generated
from delaying eligibility may not be substantial, since younger Medicare
beneficiaries have much lower average costs relative to older beneficiaries.
Beneficiary premiums are an important source of income for Medicare
Parts B and D. Raising beneficiary premiums is one option for reducing
Federal spending, although raising premiums for all beneficiaries may impose
a significant financial burden on lower-income beneficiaries who are not also
eligible for Medicaid. One suggested proposal calls for the broader use of
income-related premiums, whereby higher-income beneficiaries would pay
more for their coverage. Income-related premiums are already being used for
Part B; however, as of 2007 the threshold was set so high that it affected less
than 3 percent of the Medicare population. Using more stringent thresholds
and adopting income-related premiums for Medicare Part D are two possible
strategies for reducing the implicit subsidy that Medicare provides to higherincome beneficiaries.
Modifying the benefit design offers another approach to limiting Federal
spending. Benefit design features, such as deductibles and coinsurance, are
typically used to address moral hazard concerns. While increasing deductibles and coinsurance can reduce beneficiaries’ incentives to overuse care and
reduce spending, it may lead some beneficiaries to delay or forgo needed care
due to cost. A related issue is the widespread use of supplemental Medicare
insurance, which typically reimburses beneficiaries for deductibles and coinsurance amounts when they seek care. With this additional coverage, the
price of medical care is effectively removed as a factor from decision making.
Some economists have suggested that private supplemental Medicare insurance should be limited or eliminated altogether. Since greater utilization of
high-technology treatments is a major driver of health care spending growth,
an additional strategy is to base coverage decisions about new medical
treatments on their comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness relative
to existing therapies. Certainly, this may raise concerns by patients and

Chapter 6  |  193

providers regarding the role of government in determining which medical
treatments are prescribed.
In addition to strategies that alter the existing program structure, others
have suggested more fundamental changes to promote long-run sustainability.
For example, some have suggested moving completely to a market-based
approach in which Medicare beneficiaries receive risk-adjusted and incomeadjusted vouchers that could be applied toward the cost of private health
plans. Such a reform could build upon the strengths of the current Medicare
Advantage program and potentially strengthen competition in the market
for health insurance. Moreover, a voucher system would provide greater
certainty in terms of the Federal Government’s future liabilities.
Medicare provider payment systems are complex and generally create poor
incentives for limiting spending growth. Fee-for-service payment systems
reward providers for how much they do rather than for the value that they
provide to Medicare patients. Furthermore, administrative pricing may or
may not necessarily reflect what would be observed in a competitive market,
due to inflation and technological advances in medicine. Competitive bidding
has been proposed as one alternative method for setting prices. Specifically,
competitive bidding requires providers to submit bids that reflect costs plus a
normal rate of profit. Providers with the lowest cost can be identified. Over
time, this type of system can enable providers to more easily adjust prices to
reflect changes in production costs resulting from changes in input prices
(such as the wages of nurses) or technology (such as MRI or CT scanners).
For Medicaid, one of the most pressing issues is the anticipated growth
in long-term care. While some people require the level of care provided by
nursing homes, many eligible Medicaid beneficiaries would actually prefer
less expensive community-based care. Transitioning away from primarily
institutional care and toward a more community-based long-term care system
is one potential cost-saving measure; however, it is not clear to what extent
overall demand for services will rise when access to this option improves.
Encouraging the purchase of private long-term care insurance through tax
credits or Qualified State Long-Term Care Partnerships, which protect some
assets of those with long-term care insurance while still allowing them to
qualify for Medicaid, may both reduce the spending burden on Medicaid and
protect many seniors from poverty. Additionally, better coordination of care
between Medicare, which is often responsible for financing initial nursing
home stays through its post-acute care coverage, and Medicaid, which often
assumes responsibility for nursing home patients after their Medicare benefits
end, could also help reduce costs.

194  |  Economic Report of the President

Conclusion
There are no painless solutions to the budgetary challenges arising from
long-term projected growth in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
While there is no specific year when one can be sure a crisis is imminent,
it is clear that these problems will only grow larger the longer policymakers
delay in developing and implementing reform strategies. The environments
in which Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid were created no longer
exist, and the Legislative and Executive branches of the Federal and State
Governments need to take up the budgetary challenges entitlement programs
present and ensure that these programs are adapted to their new realities.

Balancing Private and Public Roles in
Health Care

H

ealth care is one of the largest and fastest growing sectors of the U.S.
economy, employing millions of individuals in hospitals, physician
offices, home health agencies, long-term care facilities, insurance, and pharmaceutical and medical device companies. Today, Americans are living
longer as a result of public health improvements and advances in medical
treatment. While modern health care provides substantial benefits, there
are growing concerns about its rising cost. In 2008, the United States is
projected to spend approximately $2.4 trillion, or almost $8,000 per person,
on health care, and forecasts indicate that spending will continue to grow at
a rate faster than the gross domestic product (GDP). Recognizing that rising
costs pose a threat to Americans’ access to health insurance and medical care,
the Administration has pursued several initiatives to encourage the efficient
provision of health care through private markets and to improve access to
affordable health care for individuals in the United States.
This chapter begins with a brief overview of U.S. performance with
respect to the population’s health status and spending on health care. This is
followed by a discussion of key efforts by the Administration to address issues
of health care quality, cost, and access. The key points of this chapter are:
•	 Health care spending is expected to grow rapidly over the next several
decades, a trend that is driven by the increased use of high-technology
medical procedures, comprehensive health insurance that decreases
consumer incentives to shop for cost-effective care, rising rates of chronic
disease, and the aging of the population in the United States.
•	 Markets for health care services can function more efficiently when
payers, providers, and consumers have more complete information as
well as incentives to use medical care that is clinically effective and of
high value.
•	 Health insurance improves individuals’ well-being by providing financial protection against uncertain medical costs and by improving access
to care. Market-based approaches and innovative benefit designs can
enable people to select coverage that best fits their preferences and to
more actively participate in their own health care decision making.
•	 The Federal Government has an important role in investing in public
health infrastructure, particularly with respect to improving the availability of community-based health care for the underserved, preparing
for possible public health crises, supporting health-related research and
development, and promoting global health improvement.
197

The Health of the U.S. Population
Health can be defined as a state of complete physical, mental, and social
well-being. Individuals who are healthy are more productive and happier.
Genetic factors; the environment; lifestyle behaviors such as smoking, eating
healthy foods, and exercise; and medical care consumption are all factors that
have been shown to affect an individual’s health.
There are several different ways to measure health outcomes for a population. One consistent and reliable measure is life expectancy, defined as the
average number of years of life remaining to a person at a particular age.
Chart 7-1 shows how U.S. life expectancy at birth has changed over the
past century. In the early part of the 20th century, life expectancy averaged
51 years until an influenza pandemic in 1918 resulted in a significant drop,
to 39 years. Following that crisis, there have been steady increases in life
expectancy over time. This positive trend can be explained by several factors,
most notably, public health improvements such as cleaner water, improved
sanitation, and vaccinations, as well as medical innovation.
A second way to measure population health is by examining disease
prevalence. Rising rates of age-adjusted chronic diseases, which are conditions

198  |  Economic Report of the President

expected to last at least 1 year, are particularly concerning to the medical,
public health, and health policy communities. Heart disease and diabetes are
two examples of chronic diseases that afflict millions of Americans each year.
Heart disease, which affects 7.3 percent of adults 20 years of age and older,
has been the leading cause of death for the past 90 years, as well as a major
cause of disability. Diabetes affects 7.8 percent of the population, or roughly
23.6 million children and adults, and has numerous costly complications,
including kidney damage, eye problems, nerve damage, foot problems, and
depression.
In 2005, approximately 60 percent of people 18 years of age and older in
the United States had at least one chronic condition, and older adults were
considerably more likely to have multiple chronic conditions (Chart 7-2).
Managing many chronic diseases can be quite costly. More than 50 percent
of total medical care expenditures generated by the adult U.S. population
(excluding expenditures for dental care and medical equipment and services)
is for the treatment of chronic conditions. However, with medical management and lifestyle changes, people can remain productive and lower their risk
of disability from these conditions.

Chapter 7  |  199

The good news is that many chronic diseases are preventable. Healthy
lifestyle decisions, such as being a nonsmoker, eating nutritious foods, and
getting regular physical activity, can significantly lower the likelihood of
developing a wide variety of serious medical conditions. In the United
States, the rate of smoking has fallen during the past several decades, a trend
partially explained by better information about the associated health risks, as
well as public policies that deter smoking behavior. However, a major health
concern remains in that about 20 percent of adults still report being current
smokers. Another major public health concern is the rapid rise in obesity
rates among adults and children. Currently, more than 72 million people
ages 20 and older are obese, which is defined as having a body mass index (a
measure using information on a person’s weight and height to indicate body
fat) greater than or equal to 30. Obesity is a known risk factor for several
costly medical conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and some
forms of cancer. Continued efforts to promote healthy eating and regular
physical activity are critical for reversing this rising trend.

U.S. Health Care Spending
Health-related goods and services include hospital care, physician and
clinical services, nursing home care, prescription drugs, and more. Over time,
there have been large spending increases across all of these major categories.
Chart 7-3 shows the distribution of national health expenditures by type of
service in 2006, the most recent year of data available. Hospital care represents the largest segment, at 31 percent of total expenditures, followed by
physician and clinical services (21 percent), other types of health spending
(which include administration, the net cost of health insurance, public health
activity, and research (16 percent)), other personal health care costs such
as dental care and medical equipment (13 percent), and prescription drugs
(10 percent).
U.S. health care expenditures have grown rapidly during the past several
decades. In 2008, the United States is projected to spend approximately $2.4
trillion, or 16.6 percent of GDP, on health care. Based on actuarial estimates
from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, forecasts indicate that
by 2017, the United States will spend approximately $10,592 per person (in
2008 dollars), which corresponds to 19.5 percent of GDP. Spending a larger
share of GDP on health care costs is not necessarily bad; it is to be expected as
a nation’s wealth rises. In addition to income effects, there are several other
factors that drive up the cost of health care in the United States, including
population aging, increases in input prices that are greater than inflation,
technological advances, and third-party payment.

200  |  Economic Report of the President

Researchers who have investigated the catalysts of health care spending
growth suggest that third-party payment and advances in medical technology
can account for a significant proportion of the long-term, historical spending
trends. Although health insurance provides valuable financial protection,
benefit designs that have low out-of-pocket costs at the point of use (such as
doctor or hospital visits) greatly inhibit consumers’ incentives to search for
the lowest-priced providers or to engage providers in discussion about alternative treatment options and their respective costs. Health insurance that has
low out-of-pocket cost-sharing can also create distorted incentives regarding
the development and diffusion of new medical technologies. Of course,
many advances in medicine have been instrumental in helping Americans live
longer and healthier lives. For example, providers now have more advanced
technologies to diagnose specific problems (such as MRI or CT scanners),
treat existing ailments (such as using minimally invasive surgical procedures),
and prevent the onset and spread of new diseases or illnesses (such as use
of vaccinations or screening procedures). However, when providers and
consumers lack strong incentives to control spending, one potential result is
that new, more expensive technologies may be prescribed and received, even
if they are only slightly more effective than existing therapies. As the amount
of financial resources allocated to health care rises, it is important to consider

Chapter 7  |  201

the role that incentives play in determining the quantity and types of medical
care that consumers receive. Additionally, it will be important to continue
evaluating the extent to which greater utilization of medical services, including
high-technology treatments, translates into better health outcomes.

Improving the Effectiveness and
Efficiency of Health Care
The terms “effectiveness” and “efficiency” are frequently used in the context
of discussions about improving health system performance. But what do
these terms actually mean? Effective care includes services that are of proven
clinical value. It is medical care for which the benefits to patients far outweigh
the risks, such that all patients with specific medical needs should receive
it. Efficient care includes medical services that maximize quality and health
outcomes, given the resources committed, while ensuring that additional
investments yield net value over time.
In the United States, there is clear empirical evidence that many patients do
not receive the highest quality of care possible. That is, patients do not receive
care that fully complies with current clinical guidelines. In one well-respected
study, researchers found that only 54 percent of acute care and 56 percent of
chronic care provided by physicians conformed to clinical recommendations
in the medical literature. Receiving better quality care, particularly for those
with chronic conditions, has the potential to reduce the adverse impacts of
existing illnesses and prolong life.
There are large differences in the levels of effective care provided in the
United States, a result that reflects differences both in provider practice styles
and in patient preferences. Researchers associated with the Dartmouth Atlas
of Health Care have reported extensive geographic variation in medical care
spending and in the use of medical care across a wide range of services such as
preventive screenings, diabetes management, joint replacement surgeries, and
end-of-life care. Differences across regions of the United States cannot be fully
explained by differences in illness rates or well-informed patient preferences.
In fact, this research finds that higher rates of utilization reported across the
United States do not appear to be correlated with better health outcomes,
and that nearly 30 percent of Medicare’s costs could be saved without
adverse health consequences if spending in high- and medium-cost areas of
the country was reduced to levels in low-cost areas. The Administration has
strongly advocated, in its policies, using information and better incentives to
improve the effectiveness and the efficiency of health care delivery, including
hospital care, physician services, and long-term care.

202  |  Economic Report of the President

Health Information Technology
There is optimism among policymakers about the ability of health
information technology (IT) to generate significant production efficiencies in
the delivery of health care. This is because health IT permits the management
of medical information and the secure exchange of information among
consumers, providers, and payers. Using IT in health care may help reduce
medical errors, provide physicians with information on best practices for
diagnosis and treatment, improve care coordination, and reduce duplication
of services. The most comprehensive form of health IT is an electronic health
record, which is a longitudinal record of patient information that typically
includes the patient’s demographic characteristics, past medical history,
medication use, vital signs, laboratory data, and radiology reports.
One goal of the Administration is for most Americans to have an electronic
health record by 2014. While providers have expressed interest in the
potential benefits of IT for workflow improvement, adoption has been
somewhat slower than anticipated. Results from a survey conducted by the
Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT indicate that 14 percent
of outpatient doctors currently use an electronic health record, and a study
sponsored by the American Hospital Association finds that 68 percent of
hospitals have or are in the process of implementing an electronic health
record. Key barriers to adoption of health IT include lack of a business case
to support adoption; privacy and security concerns; technical issues that make
exchanging information difficult; and organizational culture issues, including
providers’ resistance to changing business processes.
In response to these concerns, the Administration formed the American
Health Information Community, a Federal advisory body that includes
experts from the public and private sectors, to make recommendations to the
Secretary of Health and Human Services about how to accelerate the development and adoption of health IT. Over the past few years, this advisory
body has also provided recommendations on how to make records digital and
available for providers to share easily, as well as how to assure the privacy and
security of those records.

Comparative Effectiveness
For many types of medical conditions, a patient may have a choice between
at least two diagnostic methods and/or treatments that have different benefits
and risks. Selecting the most appropriate course of care relies on having
current information about the effectiveness of each option, given a patient’s
characteristics. Comparative effectiveness research studies are rigorous
evaluations that compare the performance of various diagnostic and treatment options for specific medical conditions and sets of patients. By using

Chapter 7  |  203

comparative effectiveness research findings, providers can help patients select
the most clinically appropriate course of treatment. Advocates of comparative effectiveness research also suggest that widespread use of research findings
may help to reduce some of the geographic variation in utilization and
spending that exists in the United States.
The number of comparative effectiveness studies has increased in recent
decades, and provides the potential to improve the quality of care delivered
to patients. A recent Federally-sponsored comparative effectiveness initiative
is the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Effective Health Care
Program. Created as part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement,
and Modernization Act of 2003, this program funds the creation of new
research, synthesizes current research on the benefits and risks of alternative
medical interventions, and translates these findings into useful formats that
can be easily accessed by health care providers and patients.

Price and Quality Information Transparency
When individuals shop for many goods or services, often they can access
information on prices and quality using readily available sources. With this
information, they can compare alternatives and then select the one of highest
value. Unfortunately, the same information is not readily available for
health-related goods and services. Having information on prices and provider
quality may be important as people consider which physicians or hospitals to
select for care and what impact this might have on their out-of-pocket costs
(such as copayments or coinsurance) and their potential health outcomes.
To illustrate, suppose a couple learns that they are expecting their first child
and that their physician has admitting privileges at the two hospitals in their
community. Wanting to make an informed decision about which hospital
they should use for the birth, this couple would benefit from being able to
look on their insurer’s web site to find information about the price that each
hospital charges for different types of deliveries. With this information, they
could assess how much it will likely cost them out of pocket for a normal
delivery, given their insurance coverage. Additionally, the couple would be
able to find information on each hospital’s web site about the quality of its
maternity services, including the volume of deliveries during the past year,
the proportion of deliveries that were performed by Cesarean section, and
whether there is a neonatal intensive care unit at the facility.
One challenge in health care is that there are actually two types of prices:
list prices and transaction prices. List prices, which are also called charges, are
well-documented and are found in all standardized information that hospitals and physicians submit when seeking payment for services. However, list
prices are often not relevant because most payers, whether private insurers,
Medicare, or Medicaid, pay much less than the list price. The payment
204  |  Economic Report of the President

that is actually made by the insurer to the provider is called a transaction
price. Unfortunately, this information is more difficult to access because it is
insurer-specific and providers may be sensitive about having negotiated rates
available in the public domain.
In the past 20 years there have been tremendous advances in the development of objective measures of clinical quality for chronic diseases, acute care,
preventive care, and long-term care. Improvements in health care quality
measurement as well as better information systems are making it easier to
evaluate provider performance and generate information that is relevant and
timely for providers and individuals. Increasing the transparency of information about health care quality can motivate providers to improve the care
that they deliver, and it can help consumers to make more informed decisions regarding their provider choices. A key priority for the Administration
has been public reporting of price and quality information. In addition to
advocating for greater transparency across the entire health care system, the
Federal Government and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
in particular, have developed Hospital Compare, Nursing Home Compare,
and the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder, which are comprehensive,
web-based resources providing quality and pricing information.

Pay-for-Performance
Pay-for-performance refers to purchasing practices aimed at improving the
value of health care services that are provided to patients, where value depends
on both quality and cost. Private insurers, as well as Medicare and Medicaid,
are using pay-for-performance programs that provide doctors and hospitals
with financial incentives to meet certain performance measures for quality
and efficiency or to show quality improvement. Researchers in the private
and public sectors are conducting numerous evaluations of pay-for-performance programs to assess whether these programs affect provider behavior
and improve the quality of care that patients receive.
One such evaluation includes the Premier Hospital Quality Incentive
Demonstration Project, which started in 2003. In this Medicare demonstration, hospitals receive bonus payments based on their performance
on five medical conditions, including acute myocardial infarction (heart
attack), coronary artery bypass graft, pneumonia, heart failure, and hip/knee
replacement. Improvements in quality of care during the first 3 years of the
demonstration have saved the lives of an estimated 2,500 acute myocardial
infarction patients, based on an analysis of mortality rates at participating
hospitals. Additionally, more than 1.1 million patients treated in the
five clinical areas at participating hospitals have received approximately
300,000 additional services or recommendations that align with evidencebased clinical quality measures, such as smoking cessation advice, discharge
instructions, and pneumococcal vaccination.

Using Market-Based Approaches to Improve
Access to Health Insurance
The financial burden of health care costs can be extensive, particularly for
those who have a serious health episode, such as cancer or a trauma-related
injury. In the United States, about 80 percent of medical care expenditures
each year are generated by about 20 percent of the population. Health insurance provides individuals with financial protection against costs associated
with medical treatment, giving them access to needed and valuable care that
otherwise might not be affordable. This section provides an overview of
current health insurance coverage patterns and discusses key Administration
initiatives to promote market-based approaches and new types of insurance
benefit designs to provide individuals with greater flexibility as they choose
coverage that best meets their needs.

Private Health Insurance
The private market for health insurance is really two markets—one
for employer groups and another for individuals. Currently, 165 million
Americans under 65 years of age obtain their coverage through an employer
source, either as a worker or a dependent of a worker, and approximately
17 million non-elderly individuals purchase coverage in the individual market.
In the United States, employer provision of health insurance is voluntary,
and while 99 percent of large firms (those with 200 or more workers) offer
coverage to their workers as a benefit, a smaller percentage of small firms
do. In 2008, 62 percent of small firms (those with 3–199 workers) offered
their workers health insurance, down from 68 percent in 2000. Two main
factors cause small firms to be less likely to offer health insurance as a fringe
benefit relative to large firms. First, small firms may have difficulty pooling
risk effectively. Very small groups, in particular, may be less able to absorb
the financial shock of a high-cost, low-probability medical problem by one or
more of their employees, which may result in higher premiums for a specific
amount of coverage, as well as larger rate increases over time. Second, there
are human resources costs for firms when they shop for insurance, coordinate
enrollment with employees, and integrate employee contributions toward the
premium with payroll. If the per-worker administrative costs of insurance are
higher for small firms, they may be less likely to offer coverage.
For individuals who are not offered health insurance through an employer,
the individual market is an alternative way to acquire coverage. Many who
purchase insurance in this market use it as a bridge between jobs that provide
employer-sponsored insurance or between employer-sponsored coverage and

206  |  Economic Report of the President

Medicare. For others, including the self-employed, coverage purchased in the
individual market may need to serve their needs over the long term.
There are several different types of health insurance plans available in
the private market, including health maintenance organizations, preferred
provider organizations, and point-of-service plans. In addition to traditional
managed care plans, a new generation of insurance benefit designs, called
consumer-directed health plans, is emerging. Consumer-directed health plans
typically have three basic features: a high deductible, which is the dollar
amount that has to be paid before an insurer covers any medical expenses; an
associated account that can be funded with pre-tax dollars and can be used
to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses; and tools to help enrollees make
decisions about their medical care treatment options. The two most prevalent forms of consumer-directed health plans are Health Reimbursement
Arrangements, which are offered by employers, and Health Savings Accounts,
which are offered in both the employer group and individual markets. See
Box 7-1 for information about Health Savings Accounts.

Box 7-1: Health Savings Accounts: Innovation in Benefit Design
Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) were signed into law by the President
in 2003 as part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
Modernization Act. HSAs are tax-advantaged savings accounts to which
individuals can contribute funds that they can then use to pay for qualified
medical expenses. HSAs are used in conjunction with High-Deductible
Health Plans that meet specific criteria. In particular, these plans must
have a minimum deductible of $1,150 for single coverage and $2,300 for
family coverage in 2009, an annual out-of-pocket limit of no more than
$5,800 for individuals and $11,600 for families in 2009, and catastrophic
coverage in case an individual or family exceeds the out-of-pocket limit
as a result of a serious medical episode. Health plans that meet these
criteria are referred to as HSA-compatible or HSA-eligible plans.
HSAs are available in both the employer group and individual
markets. When offered in an employer setting, both an employer and
employee can contribute money to the account, up to specific limits
($3,000 for individuals and $5,950 for families in 2009). Also, employees
whose health plans meet the deductible and out-of-pocket limit criteria
described above can open an HSA on their own if their employer does
not open an account for them. Unused balances may be rolled over
from year to year and accumulate interest, thus allowing individuals
to build up savings that can be used to cover future medical expenses.
Additionally, HSAs are portable, which means that individuals are able to
continued on the next page

Chapter 7  |  207

Box 7-1 — continued
keep any unspent funds in the account when they change employment
or exit the labor force.
Enrollment in HSA-compatible health plans has been growing steadily
each year. In 2006, over 6.8 million employees and dependents were
enrolled in High-Deductible Health Plans, and over 30 percent of these
enrollees were in small firms. As of January 2008, approximately
1.5 million consumers had purchased HSA-compatible plans in the
individual market. HSAs in combination with a High-Deductible Health
Plan are playing an increasingly important role in the individual market,
providing an option that is more affordable, on average, than other
traditional types of health plans.
HSAs and High-Deductible Health Plans are designed to encourage
more consumer control over health care decision making, but concerns
have arisen about the impact that these plans may have on policyholders’ care-seeking behavior. In particular, some believe that the
deductible may lead individuals to forgo or delay getting care such as
preventive screenings (for example, mammograms). To mitigate this
concern, most insurers now provide some coverage before the insured
person meets his or her deductible. Research that analyzes the impact
of HSAs and High-Deductible Health Plans on medical care utilization
and expenditures is mixed. In coming years, as these plans gain market
share, research may help to clarify the full effect of this type of benefit
design on care-seeking behavior and costs.

The employer group and individual markets for health insurance have
unique advantages and disadvantages. Employer groups are generally able
to pool risk, as individuals within an employer group initially come together
for a purpose other than buying health insurance and because larger numbers
of covered people makes it easier to predict the average expenditure of the
group. Effective risk pooling is often more challenging in the individual
market, given the potential for adverse selection, whereby individuals who
expect high health care costs are more likely to buy coverage, while those who
expect to have low costs may be less likely to do so. If insurers are not able
to fully identify the risk of individuals seeking coverage and premiums are set
according to the average risk in the population, then there will be insufficient
funds to cover the claims that are generated. In most States, health insurers
use medical underwriting to assess individuals’ risk for generating medical
expenditures based on their demographics, health status, and past utilization.
Another important distinction between the employer group and individual
markets is the tax treatment of premiums. For employer-sponsored insurance,
premiums that are paid by employers are exempt from the Federal income
208  |  Economic Report of the President

tax, State income taxes in 43 States, and Social Security and Medicare taxes.
In addition, many employees can pay their share of the insurance premium
with pre-tax dollars if their firm offers a “Section 125” plan. The amount of
forgone revenue associated with excluding tax on premiums is often referred
to as the “tax subsidy” for employer-sponsored health insurance. The tax
exclusion encourages employers to provide a larger share of workers’ total
compensation in the form of health insurance benefits, leading employers to
offer generous coverage with low levels of coinsurance and deductibles. In
turn, these low levels of cost-sharing can encourage moral hazard, whereby
individuals use more medical care than they would if they were responsible
for the full price of that care.
For self-employed workers and their families, there is a partial tax subsidy
of health insurance, which allows them to deduct health insurance for themselves and their families from the Federal income tax (up to the net profit
of their business) but not from the self-employment tax (equivalent to the
combined tax that they would pay for Social Security and Medicare). For
those who neither are self-employed nor have an offer of employer group
insurance, medical care expenses, including the premiums for coverage
purchased in the individual market, are tax deductible only when these
expenses exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income.
As discussed before, not all workers have access to employer-sponsored
insurance; those who do may have limited choices, particularly if they are
employed at a small firm. While the individual market provides an alternative
way to acquire health insurance, for many it is not perceived to be as attractive as employer-sponsored insurance. One way to move toward balancing
the attractiveness of the employer group and individual markets is to alter the
current tax treatment of premiums. Removing the tax exclusion for employer
premiums has the potential to eliminate many of the inefficiencies and equity
issues associated with the current system; it would also increase Federal
Government income tax revenues by up to $168 billion in FY 2009.
The President has proposed replacing the current tax exclusion with a flat
$15,000 standard deduction for health insurance for families or $7,500 for
individuals. The amount of the standard deduction would be independent
of the actual amount spent on a health insurance policy, which would need
to meet a set of minimum requirements for catastrophic coverage. Thus,
individuals and families would still be able to take the full amount of the
deduction from income and payroll taxes, even if their health insurance
premium cost less than that amount. Although individuals with small tax
liabilities would not stand to gain as much from a tax deduction as individuals with higher tax liabilities, this approach would make health insurance
more affordable, particularly for those who do not have access to employersponsored coverage.

Public Insurance
Several programs funded by the Federal Government exist to provide health
care to specific populations. These programs include the Federal Employees
Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), TRICARE, the Veterans Health
Administration (VHA), the Indian Health Service (IHS), Medicaid, the State
Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and Medicare. The FEHBP
and TRICARE are health insurance programs for Federal employees and
active duty personnel, respectively. The Federal Government also provides
medical care to veterans through the Veterans Health Administration.
Run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the VHA provided services to
5.5 million patients in 2007, up from 3.8 million in 2000. The Indian
Health Service provides health care to members of Federally-recognized
tribes and their descendants. This too is a public health care system in the
sense that the Federal Government operates the IHS hospitals and employs
the program’s health care providers. In 2007, the IHS provided services to
1.5 million American Indians and Alaska Natives.
Established in 1965, Medicaid provides medical assistance for certain
children, families, and elderly and disabled individuals with low incomes and
low resources. Medicaid is administered by the States and is jointly funded
by the Federal Government and States. In 2007, there were approximately
48 million Medicaid enrollees. Another public insurance program is the State
Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which was created in 1997.
SCHIP enables States to provide health insurance coverage for low-income
children who do not qualify for Medicaid. SCHIP is also administered by the
States and jointly funded by the Federal Government and the States. States
receive an enhanced Federal matching rate for SCHIP that is higher than
their Medicaid matching rate but capped at a fixed level. During fiscal year
2007, more than seven million children were enrolled in SCHIP.
Medicare, also begun in 1965, provides health insurance to nearly all
individuals aged 65 and older, as well as some younger individuals with
permanent disabilities or those who have been diagnosed with end-stage renal
disease. Today, there are approximately 44.6 million Medicare beneficiaries.
As discussed in Chapter 6, Medicare consists of four parts: Part A provides
coverage for inpatient hospital services, some home health care, and up to
100 days in a skilled nursing facility. Part B provides coverage for outpatient
services, including outpatient provider visits and certain preventive screening
measures. Part C, also known as Medicare Advantage, provides beneficiaries
with the option of enrolling in one of several types of private health plans
rather than traditional, fee-for-service Medicare. Finally, Part D provides
coverage for outpatient prescription drugs.

210  |  Economic Report of the President

Revitalizing and strengthening Medicare Advantage has been a key priority
for the Administration. As an alternative to traditional Medicare, beneficiaries may enroll in one of several types of private health plans, including
health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and private fee-for-service (PFFS) plans. For the past 3 years,
100 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have had at least one Medicare
Advantage plan available in their local geographic market, up from 75 percent
in 2004. Currently, nearly 10 million people, or over 20 percent of all
Medicare beneficiaries, are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.
Many beneficiaries are attracted to Medicare Advantage plans because these
plans typically cover services that are not covered under traditional Medicare,
such as dental care, certain preventive services, and care management for those
with chronic conditions. Additionally, Medicare Advantage enrollees may
have lower out-of-pocket costs. For 2008, Medicare Advantage plans offered
an average of approximately $1,100 in additional annual value to enrollees
in terms of cost savings and added benefits. Of course, it is important to
acknowledge that beneficiaries who enroll in Medicare Advantage plans must
comply with the particular policies of those plans when using services. In
some cases, this may include using only providers in the plan’s network.
One of the most significant changes in Medicare during this Administration
was the creation of Part D, a voluntary program in which beneficiaries are
able to purchase prescription drug coverage from private health plans that
contract with Medicare. On average, beneficiaries pay 25.5 percent of the
cost for standard drug coverage, while the Federal Government subsidizes the
remaining 74.5 percent. Each year, beneficiaries can choose a drug benefit
plan from a large number of diverse plan offerings. This variety ensures
that beneficiaries are able to select the insurance policy that best meets
their preferences.
Before Part D was created, beneficiaries could obtain drug coverage by
using an employer retiree plan, if they had one; purchasing a private Medigap
plan; enrolling in a Medicare managed care plan; or using Medicaid coverage
if they were dually eligible. Chart 7-4 illustrates the change in prescription
drug coverage among beneficiaries between 2004 and 2006, the year that
Part D was fully implemented. In 2004, 24 percent of Medicare beneficiaries
lacked prescription drug coverage. By 2006, many of these Medicare beneficiaries obtained prescription drug coverage by choosing a stand-alone drug
plan or a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan.
Part D has had important effects on beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket spending
and their adherence to the medication protocols they have been prescribed.
Recent analyses from the Health and Retirement Study data found that
the introduction of Part D has been associated with a median decrease of

Chapter 7  |  211

$30 per month in out-of-pocket spending among the newly insured
population, compared to median baseline spending of $100 per month. When
prescription drugs are not affordable, individuals may not adhere to their
prescribed regimes. They may skip doses, reduce doses, or let prescriptions
go unfilled. Recent work finds a small but significant overall decrease in
cost-related medication non-adherence following the implementation of
Part D. Both the revitalization of Medicare Advantage and the creation of
Medicare Part D represent important steps for ensuring that beneficiaries
have affordable choices for their health insurance.

The Uninsured
An important issue facing policymakers today is that a large number of individuals lack health insurance in the United States. In addition to providing
important financial protection, health insurance can help people obtain
timely access to medical care. Research has shown that having health insurance is positively related to having a usual source of medical care, receiving
preventive services, and getting recommended tests or prescriptions. Based

212  |  Economic Report of the President

on U.S. Census data, the current number of individuals who lacked insurance
during the calendar year is estimated to be 45.7 million people, or roughly
15.3 percent of the population. It is important to note that some people
in Federal survey-based counts of the uninsured actually may have access to
public insurance, but do not wish to report their program enrollment due to
the possible stigma, or have not yet enrolled despite their eligibility. Also,
others in Federal survey-based counts of the uninsured may have access to
private insurance but have chosen not to purchase it.
The uninsured are diverse in terms of their employment and demographic
characteristics. Individuals in households that have a full-time, full-year
worker make up about 62 percent of the non-elderly uninsured population.
Even with strong ties to the labor force, many people may not be offered
employer-sponsored coverage. Even if such coverage is available to them,
many people may choose not to buy insurance because it is not affordable
or they do not place much value on having insurance. Individuals who lack
insurance also tend to be younger.
In 2007, roughly 58 percent of the uninsured were under the age of 35.
Finally, the uninsured are more likely to be from lower-income households,
although a significant proportion of the uninsured population is made up
of people in higher-income households. As shown in Table 7-1, among
households earning less than $50,000 per year, more than 20 percent of those
households are uninsured. This contrasts with the highest household income
category, where only 7.8 percent of individuals lack insurance.
Going forward, it is important that as the Federal Government continues
to work on increasing the number of Americans who have health insurance,
it uses approaches that effectively target those who are the greatest risk for
being uninsured.

Investing in Public Health
The Federal Government plays an important role in identifying and
addressing public health issues. This Administration has pursued several
public health investment areas, including building a stronger safety net for
the medically underserved, preparing for disease outbreaks and bioterrorism
threats, supporting health-related research, and taking a leadership role in
global health-improvement activities focused on HIV/AIDS and malaria.

Strengthening Community-Based Health Care
The Health Center Program is a Federal grant program that offers funding
to local communities for providing family-oriented primary and preventive
health care services. Health centers serve as an important safety net for people
who need medical care but are underserved, including those without health
insurance. Health centers provided care to more than 16 million individuals
in 2006, and they are located in all 50 States and the District of Columbia.
In 2002, the President made a commitment to create 1,200 new or expanded
sites—a goal that was attained in 2007. Additionally, Federal funding for
health centers has increased to $2 billion annually.

Preparing for Public Health Emergencies
The Federal Government plays an important role in ensuring a timely and
appropriate response in the event of a public health emergency, such as an
influenza pandemic or a bioterrorism threat. These types of situations could
potentially lead to high levels of illness, social disruption, and economic loss,
and therefore it is important for the Federal Government to invest resources
in developing strategies to prepare for them. Working in collaboration with
the States, the Federal Government has provided funding, advice, and other
assistance to State and local planning efforts.

Supporting Research
Health-related research is multidisciplinary. It includes biomedical and
epidemiological work that can reduce a population’s mortality and morbidity
risks from disease; economic analyses that investigate consumer and provider
decision making; and health services research that examines issues such as
medical care utilization, quality, and access to services. Americans rate health
research as a high national priority. For fiscal year 2009, Federal funding for
the National Institutes of Health is $29.5 billion. These resources will be
used predominantly for supporting more than 38,000 research grant awards.
It is beneficial to have a balance between investments that support biomedical

214  |  Economic Report of the President

research and those that address critical issues pertaining to the delivery
and financing of health care, particularly given the substantial amount of
resources that are going to be required to meet the medical care needs of the
population in future decades.

Promoting Global Health Improvement
Many nations across the world are developing strategies to deal with consequences from the broad transmission of serious diseases, including HIV/
AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, among others. In less developed parts of
the world, people who contract these diseases face a much higher risk of
mortality than do people in more developed parts of the world. There is also
a significant economic impact from disease. In addition to the direct costs
of medical treatment, high rates of serious disease within a population can
hinder economic development. For example, HIV/AIDS may lead to largescale losses in work productivity as the disease progresses and leaves those who
are infected and their caregivers unable to work. Studies suggest that the high
rate of HIV/AIDS has reduced the average national growth rates in African
countries by 2 to 4 percent per year. Over the long term, high levels of disease
also may inhibit educational investment, as shorter life expectancy diminishes
incentives for human capital investment.
In 2003, the United States took a leadership role in supporting HIV/AIDS
treatment, care, and prevention programs around the world, including in
15 countries that together have half of the world’s HIV infections: Botswana,
Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana, Haiti, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia,
Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, and Zambia.
Known as the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), this
program has supported more than 57 million HIV counseling and testing
sessions and has supported care for more than 10.1 million people infected or
affected by HIV/AIDS, including more than 4 million orphans and vulnerable
children worldwide. Additionally, through September 30, 2008, PEPFAR
supported antiretroviral treatment for approximately 2.1 million people and
prevention of mother-to-child transmission interventions during more than
16 million pregnancies. In 2008, Congress extended this program for an
additional 5 years and significantly increased its authorized funding level.
A second global health initiative pursued by the Administration has been
prevention and treatment of malaria. Each year, more than 1 million people
die of malaria, most of them young children in Sub-Saharan Africa. It also
causes serious morbidity, as those who are infected tend to lose, on average,
6 weeks from school or work due to the illness. Spending related to the
disease can account for as much as 40 percent of public health expenditures,
as well as high levels of household out-of-pocket expenditures. Beyond
imposing high medical costs and lower incomes due to absenteeism, malaria
Chapter 7  |  215

is likely to impose indirect costs through broader macroeconomic channels,
including underdeveloped tourism industries and lower levels of foreign
direct investment.
In June 2005, the President’s Malaria Initiative was announced.
This initiative represents a public–private partnership among the U.S.
Government, nongovernmental organizations, corporations, foundations,
and faith-based service organizations, with the goal of reducing the mortality
rate from malaria in 15 African countries by 50 percent. In 2007, the initiative’s second year, 25 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa are estimated
to have benefited from the program. More than 6 million long-lasting,
insecticide-treated mosquito nets have been purchased, with two-thirds of
those nets distributed.

Conclusion
The U.S. health care system is at a critical juncture. While advances in
medical technology help millions of Americans lead longer and healthier lives,
the rising cost of health care is both threatening the ability of Americans to
access care that is affordable and is increasing the strain on Federal and State
budgets. There are several opportunities to increase the value of health care
and improve health insurance coverage. This Administration has pursued
policies to improve the efficiency of health care markets through increased
consumer involvement, improved choices, information transparency, and
incentives to providers for delivering high-quality, efficient care.
This Administration has also pursued policies to improve the health
insurance options of Americans. With the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, Medicare was expanded
to provide beneficiaries with improved access to affordable prescription
drugs. Additionally, this legislation created Health Savings Accounts, which,
in combination with High Deductible Health Plans, give individuals the
incentive to become more active decision makers regarding their health
care and health investments. Finally, this Administration has held to its
commitment to make important investments in public health, including the
expansion of Health Centers, collaboration with States and local governments
to prepare for potential crises or threats, support of health-related research
and development, and promotion of global health-improvement initiatives.

Education and Labor

L

ong-term economic growth requires a productive workforce with the skills
necessary to compete in a global labor market. The Administration’s
commitment to boosting the high productivity of American workers is
evident in successful education and training policies. These include initiatives
to increase primary and secondary school accountability, to ensure broader
access to higher education, and to train workers so that they may take advantage of new high-paying job opportunities.
Real disposable income grew steadily during the Administration, and earnings per hour outpaced inflation despite large increases in energy prices and a
growing portion of employee compensation being paid in non-wage benefits.
Real median household income did fall slightly during the Administration,
but this decline began prior to the Administration taking office. The
Administration included several years of strong growth in real median household income from 2004 to 2007. The strongest pension reform measures in
over three decades were also enacted. These offered important protections
to workers who depend on their firm’s pension plans for their retirement
incomes.
Challenges lie ahead, however, and the most successful initiatives of the
Administration must be bolstered. A continued commitment to better
quality in kindergarten through twelfth-grade (K–12) education and broader
access to higher education will help produce the additional workers the
United States needs to meet the increasing worldwide demand for highly
skilled labor.
In addition to these challenges, some related issues will need to be addressed,
and education and labor policy will be important elements. First, the high
level of income inequality in the United States calls for educating and training
a greater number of workers, as better and more widely dispersed skills will be
a force in reducing income inequality in the United States. Furthermore, the
United States also needs comprehensive reform of its immigration policies.
The principles of this Administration’s immigration plan, which include a
number of education and labor initiatives, will likely be the starting point for
future discussions.
The key points of this chapter are:
•	 Education benefits individuals through higher earnings, and benefits
society as a whole. Administration initiatives to improve K–12 education,

217

most notably the No Child Left Behind Act, are demonstrating clear,
measurable results.
•	 Access to higher education was maintained through an expanded Pell
Grant program and proactive efforts that helped protect Federally
subsidized student loans from recent credit issues faced elsewhere in the
economy.
•	 Despite a small decline in real median household income, which had
begun prior to the Administration taking office, hourly earnings of
workers outpaced inflation, and real per capita disposable income
rose substantially during the past 8 years. Median household income
increased steadily after the recovery began in earnest in 2004. Also,
pension reforms were enacted to help protect retirement income.
•	 Income inequality and immigration reform must still be addressed.  
Strong support for education and a focus on workers’ skills can help
close income gaps. Reform of immigration policies must provide border
security while allowing the economic benefits that immigrant labor
provides to the economy.

Economic Benefits of Education
Education is an investment. As with other investments, people compare
benefits and costs when deciding whether to invest. The benefits of a quality
education are widespread, with greater earnings being enjoyed by people and
families who invest in education. Also, there are additional, non-pecuniary
benefits of education that are enjoyed by both individuals and society at large.
Education is also a key component of worker productivity and long-term
economic growth.
For most people, a strong motivation to obtain additional years of
schooling is the labor market return they expect to receive. Indeed, according
to Chart 8-1, adults with a bachelor’s or an advanced degree earn considerably more than adults with a high school degree. Likewise, those with a high
school degree earn more than those who failed to complete high school. The
gap between the earnings of those with a college education and those with a
high school education, however, has grown since the 1970s. Currently, the
average recipient of a college degree earns well over twice the amount earned
by the average adult without a degree. Although any one individual’s benefit
from a college degree will differ due to ability, choice of major, and other
factors, the expected return for investments in education undoubtedly motivate people to attend college.
Chart 8-1 does not take into account other individual benefits of education,
most notably improved health. A substantial number of recent studies have

218  |  Economic Report of the President

shown that a direct link exists between educational attainment and health,
even after holding income constant. One reason for this link may be the
fact that people with greater educational attainment make better choices that
impact their health positively, such as getting more exercise or not smoking.
Education might also improve one’s ability to navigate a complex health care
system. Although the health returns to education are difficult to price in
monetary terms, people surely value their health.
In addition to an individual’s benefit from more education (greater earnings and better health), society benefits from a better-educated population.
Education has been shown to foster civic-mindedness. For example, education makes it more likely someone will vote or support free speech. It also
improves social skills and reduces crime. These effects of education positively
affect fellow citizens as well as the individuals obtaining the education.
Finally, education is a key component of economic growth. Chart 8-2
illustrates the sustained productivity growth the United States has enjoyed
throughout the past half century. It sets an index of output per hour of
work for all non-farm workers to 100 in 1952 and displays the index over
5-year increments through 2007. The chart indicates that productivity has
grown more than 200 percent over the past half century. Chart 8-2 also
plots indexes of educational attainment (measured as the share of adults
with a bachelor’s degree) and capital services (for example, machinery and
Chapter 8  |  219

equipment) per hour. Both educational attainment and capital intensity,
which measures the extent to which capital is used with labor, show strong
upward trends. This means that in recent decades, businesses have not
only employed an increasingly educated workforce, but have also put more
capital (especially computers and high-tech equipment) at the disposal of
this workforce. Through better production processes and management,
businesses have also become more efficient in using labor. Education, capital
intensity, technological advances, and efficiency gains are all interrelated in
complex ways, but research has credited education with as much as one-third
of the growth of U.S. productivity from the 1950s to the 1990s.
As more of the population achieves higher levels of education and the
education they receive is of better quality, additional productivity benefits
start to take hold through spillover effects. Educated workers share their
knowledge and skills with each other, thereby increasing their combined
productivity. Moreover, an increasingly skilled workforce fosters technological advancements that increase the demand for even more skilled workers.
This technologically driven increase in demand has been great enough in the
United States to drive up the wages for skilled workers even as the supply of
such workers is increasing.

220  |  Economic Report of the President

There are also benefits to moving the entire population up to a basic level
of competence because the labor market continues to demand increasing
skills of its participants in virtually all tasks. Thus, the focus of the current
Administration on improving K–12 instruction of every student in the
United States is well placed.

Primary and Secondary Education
A strong commitment to education begins with ensuring that every child
has access to quality primary and secondary schools. The No Child Left
Behind Act (NCLB), which is intended to accomplish this goal, has been the
centerpiece of the Administration’s education policy. The NCLB Act was
signed into law in January 2002 and has since reshaped the Federal role in the
provision of K–12 education in the United States. It holds schools accountable for the performance of students, provides parents with more information
and more choices, gives States and localities more flexibility in using Federal
funds to meet the needs of children they serve, and promotes proven education methods. Among its many provisions, two innovative approaches to
improve the quality of education stand out: holding schools accountable for
making adequate yearly progress toward NCLB goals, and facilitating school
choice options and supplemental education services for students in schools
that are failing to meet standards.
Under the adequate yearly progress provisions of NCLB, each State is
charged with developing its own guidelines for determining whether schools
make sufficient progress each year toward the NCLB goal that all students
be proficient in math and reading by 2014. If a school receives NCLB
funds due to its low-income status and fails to meet its State’s standards for
adequate yearly progress for consecutive years, that school is identified as
needing improvement and faces an escalating set of interventions. Students
can transfer to another school in the same district. In addition, low-income
students in the schools are offered supplemental education services (such as
tutoring services or other academic help), which are paid for out of Federal
funds. School districts have the obligation to notify parents of these options
and to provide a list of approved supplemental education service providers in
their area. A school that continually fails to make adequate yearly progress is
subject to takeover or restructuring by the State.

Early Signs of NCLB Success
The success of NCLB will take years to determine, as current cohorts of
students complete high school and move on to college or the workforce, but
early indications are encouraging. The top panel of Table 8-1 summarizes
Chapter 8  |  221

recent trends in standardized math test scores for fourth graders as reported
by the National Assessment of Educational Progress, which periodically tests
fourth and eighth graders across the country. Researchers suggest that math
test scores are a good way to judge achievement because they predict future
labor market success well. The scores of students who were in fourth grade
in 2005 and 2007 (no test was given in 2006) provide the most information
because most if not all of their schooling to that point was during the time of
the NCLB. These scores are from national standardized tests, and each State
sets it own definition of proficiency, so the table is more indicative of general
changes in student performance over time rather than actual progress toward
a specific State’s proficiency standard.
Table 8-1 shows that early in this decade, less than 10 percent of lowincome students and less than 25 percent of all students were proficient in
math (with low-income defined as being eligible for government-sponsored
free lunch programs). Over 50 percent of low-income students were below
even basic levels at that time. By 2007, however, 82 percent of students had
reached the basic level, and the number of students achieving proficiency had
increased from 24 percent in 2000 to 39 percent in 2007. For low-income
students, the percent proficient has nearly tripled, from 8 percent in 2000 to
22 percent in 2007. This is encouraging evidence, but we must use caution
in attributing these increased test scores to NCLB directly. For example,
there were increases in math and reading scores from 2000 though 2003, and
this may reflect some upward trending of scores before NCLB took effect in
2002. This pre-NCLB trend could be reflective of an accountability movement that was taking shape across the country, which culminated in Federal

law through NCLB. The continuing upward trend after NCLB was enacted
is noteworthy, however, and under NCLB, test scores clearly are higher than
they were before NCLB.
Although not shown, math test scores for eighth graders have improved
as well, but the gains are slightly more modest. This is perhaps because
the eighth graders have not had the benefit of NCLB for their entire school
careers. More time will need to pass to appropriately evaluate results for
eighth graders.

NCLB Challenges
Although the success in math that is illustrated in Table 8-1 is encouraging,
the reading scores in the bottom panel of Table 8-1 have not increased
as much as math scores. Math scores are better predictors of future labor
market success, but the slower pace of improvement in reading scores should
not be dismissed. The Administration’s Reading First Program was enacted
as part of the NCLB Act in 2002. This Department of Education program
supports State educational agencies and local school districts that submit
a plan to implement a scientifically based instructional reading program.
Each submitted plan must demonstrate that students will be able to read by
the end of third grade. The amount of support is based on the proportion
of children in low-income households in each State. The program has
demonstrated success in improving reading comprehension. For example,
44 State educational agencies reported improvements, and 31 of them
reported an increase of at least 5 percentage points. Unfortunately, funding
for this program was substantially reduced in fiscal year (FY) 2008.
Low test scores in poorer households are improving, according to Table
8-1, and achievement gaps are narrowing. Continuing to narrow the achievement gaps by raising test scores of low-income students remains an ongoing
challenge that will require that attention be paid to some unique problems
facing schools in high-poverty areas. For example, there is a high rate of
teacher turnover in schools that serve low-income students. The most recent
data available show a turnover rate in public schools in high-poverty areas
that is 50 percent higher than in low-poverty areas.
Two components of the NCLB program that may help address the needs
of low-income students are NCLB’s supplemental education service and
school choice options for students in failing schools. These programs are
currently underutilized, alarmingly so in some districts. Parental outreach
could be improved by providing more timely and better information about
students’ eligibility for these programs, and new Department of Education
regulations specifying early notification requirements may help. In addition,
ways to make school choice options more convenient for parents should be
explored, because many parents are currently reluctant to enroll their children
Chapter 8  |  223

in alternative schools largely because of the perceived inconvenience of doing
so. School choice options are limited, however, for many districts where there
are no schools to which a student can reasonably transfer.
Finally, high school graduation is valuable for future labor market success
(Chart 8-1) and is the most likely path to college enrollment. An accurate
method of calculating graduation rates that is uniform across States is necessary to improve high school accountability. Requiring school officials to have
written confirmation that a student transferred out, immigrated to another
country, or is deceased before removing the student from their graduation
cohort will improve the accuracy of graduation rate calculations. Written
confirmation will ensure that students who have dropped out of school are
not counted as transfers; consequently, schools will be held accountable for
dropouts and others who do not graduate from high school with a regular
diploma. The final NCLB regulations require States to use the methodology
adopted by the National Governors Association. This “4-year adjusted cohort
graduation rate” uses the number of students who graduate in 4 years with a
regular high school diploma divided by the number of students who entered
high school 4 years earlier (adjusting for transfers in and out). The use of
the 4-year adjusted cohort graduation rate is an improvement over previous
systems not only because it is a uniform method of calculating graduation
rates, which will allow for more meaningful cross-State comparisons, but
also because this particular method will give parents and educators a more
accurate picture of high school completion in their communities. This will
improve the understanding of the scope and characteristics of the population
of students who do not earn regular high school diplomas or take longer to
graduate.  Educators will be able to use this information to help local education agencies meet their State graduation rate goals and thus make adequate
yearly progress.
Currently, high school dropout rates hover around 10 percent and have
fallen since the inception of NCLB, from 10.5 percent in 2002 to 9.3 percent
in 2006. High school dropout rates among certain population groups,
however, remain remarkably high. For example, Hispanic students dropped
out of school at a rate of 22.1 percent in 2006. Although this has decreased
from 25.7 percent in 2002, it is still over twice the national average. Dropout
rates in the southern United States (11.7 percent) far exceed those in the
Midwest (6.1 percent) and Northeast (6.5 percent).
Because teachers are on the front line of the NCLB mission, future
Administrations will need to do more to keep our best teachers in the classroom, particularly those who have been successful in reaching low-income
students. The Administration supported tax deductions for the out-of-pocket
expenses teachers incur while providing instruction, as well as loan forgiveness
programs for teachers in low-income schools. While both of these programs
are likely to provide some financial incentives, the need to find new ways to
224  |  Economic Report of the President

help keep good teachers in classrooms still remains a challenge for improving
K–12 education. The President’s Teacher Incentive Fund has supported
several pay-for-performance models around the country to help reward and
retain outstanding teachers.

Higher Education
The U.S. higher education system is the best in the world. World rankings
are dominated by American institutions, and the United States has long been
the destination of many of the world’s best students, teachers, and researchers.
The American Competitiveness Initiative embodies the Administration’s
strong commitment to maintain the United States’s standing as a leading
producer of scientific knowledge, and it would increase the funding capabilities of grant organizations and expand the math and science curricula
at primary and secondary schools. While keeping American universities
competitive should remain a priority, maintaining student access to these
institutions is perhaps even more important.
After several decades of growth, the share of high school graduates immediately transitioning to either a 2- or 4-year college has hovered around
two-thirds since 1996. Although college enrollment is more likely among
high school graduates from high-income families, about half of the students
who graduated from high school in the poorest fifth of families have immediately enrolled in college since 2000.
Enrollment does not necessarily mean that a student receives a college
degree. According to Chart 8-1, completing a 4-year degree is associated
with the highest earnings. Thus, Chart 8-3 shows an unfortunate trend.
Since 1996, there has been a large and steady gap between the number of
students completing a bachelor’s degree and the number of students enrolling
in college 4 years before. Because it is true that many students take longer
than 4 years to graduate from college, the gap depicted in Chart 8-3 does
not capture everyone who will drop out. Nevertheless, the relative steady
space between the two trends does show that college completion rates are
low. This finding is backed up by more exact information on the number
of enrollees who ultimately complete college (regardless of the number of
years it takes), which indicates that the completion rate is only slightly above
50 percent. Furthermore, among 25- to 29-year-olds, the proportion of all
college attendees with no bachelor’s degree has remained at about 50 percent
over the past decade. There are two things that can be done to help increase
completion rates: continue with the Administration’s efforts to improve
K–12 education so that students are better prepared for college, and maintain
access to grant aid to defray the increasing costs of education.

Chapter 8  |  225

College Preparedness
One reason for low college completion rates may be that many students are
ill-prepared for the rigors of college education. One recent study suggests that
nearly half of public high school graduates attending college in 2005 felt that
there were notable gaps in their high school preparation. Moreover, college
professors reported that about 42 percent of public high school graduates are
not prepared for college-level classes.
There are reasons to be optimistic, however, because of the improved scores
for fourth and, to some extent, eighth graders. In addition, the American
Competitiveness Initiative contains a sound plan to devote significant
resources to improving college preparedness through investments in math
and science education. Congress also recently enacted the Adjunct Teacher
Corps, a program proposed by the President that encourages well-qualified
math and science professionals to serve as adjunct middle or high school
teachers. There is more work to do at the high school level, however, and
encouraging good teachers to remain in classrooms would likely improve
college preparedness.

226  |  Economic Report of the President

Funding Higher Education
The real cost of education (tuition and fees less aid and tax benefits) has
increased substantially during this decade. In response to the rising costs,
the Administration substantially expanded the Pell Grant program. Under
this Administration, the total value of Pell Grants more than doubled from
$8 billion in the 2000–2001 school year to $16.3 billion in the 2008–2009
school year. During 2008–2009, the maximum award available was $4,731,
which exceeds the annual tuition and fees of attending a public 2-year institution and covers over 70 percent of the average tuition and fees of a public
4-year college. Pell Grant aid, however, is targeted to families with the greatest
financial need, so the reality is that even large expansions in grant programs
cannot keep up with increasing college costs for many families whose incomes
are too high to qualify for Pell Grants. For millions of students, Federal
Stafford loans provide essential assistance to help cover costs.
Stafford loans come in two forms. Subsidized loans defer payments until
after students complete college, and the Government pays the interest while
the students are in school. Unsubsidized loans allow deferred payments,
but interest accrues while students are in school. Schools can sign up for
Stafford loans to be handled by the Department of Education through the
Federal Direct Loan Program or through private lenders that offer students
loans through the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Because
students represent a greater credit risk (they tend to be younger and have
lower incomes), private lenders rely on the Government’s guarantee against
borrowers defaulting on loan payments. The Administration took action
this year, as discussed in Box 8-1, to ensure continued access to the Federal
student loan program in the face of credit markets disruptions.

Box 8-1: The Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act
of 2008
Largely unnoticed in the turmoil of the financial markets in 2008 was
the fact that the Administration was proactive in avoiding a crisis in
the student loan market. Many student lenders finance their lending
by repackaging student loans and reselling them to investors in the
secondary market. However, in early 2008, the disruption in credit
markets made it increasingly difficult for lenders to resell loans. As
a result, many of these lenders warned that they might not take part
in the Federal student loan program for the 2008–2009 school year.
continued on the next page

Chapter 8  |  227

Box 8-1 — continued
The Administration stepped in with an innovative program that was
embraced by both parties in Congress.
On May 7, 2008, the President signed into law HR 5715, the Ensuring
Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008. One of the critical provisions of this law granted the Secretary of Education the authority to
purchase Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans. Under
this authority, the Department of Education created two programs: one
in which it offers lenders the option to sell fully disbursed FFEL loans
and another in which it purchases a participation interest in 2008–2009
FFEL loans. The programs were designed to retain lenders who might
otherwise not have participated in the FFEL program; the ability to sell
loans to the Department assured lenders that even if they had difficulty
reselling the loans in the secondary market, they would not be stuck
with the loans. The programs have also ensured that lenders originated
new loans to students because lenders who sold their loans to the
Department then had the funds necessary to originate new loans.
The intervention has helped the Federal student loan program
function effectively so far this academic year despite the condition
of financial markets. A projected 8.5 million students are attending
college partly because they were able to finance their studies through
the FFEL program. Recognizing that the financial crisis may impact
the student loan program for the 2009–2010 year, Congress recently
extended the authority for the Department of Education to purchase
loans for another year. The Department has announced that it will
replicate the current programs for the 2009–2010 school year. This
will help ensure that students who are investing in their future through
education will have access to Federal student loans despite current
conditions in credit markets.

Labor Issues: Income Trends,
Worker Flexibility, and Pension Reform
Real hourly earnings grew during the Administration, and real per capita
disposable income (which includes income from labor and non-labor sources)
rose substantially. The Administration also worked to promote retraining so
that workers could fill jobs in demand. Finally, pension reform enacted in
2006 will help protect retirement incomes.

228  |  Economic Report of the President

Recent Trends in Real Incomes
A common belief is that the incomes of working American families have
not kept pace with inflation in recent years. Adjusting for inflation, it is
indeed true that the annual median household income (measured in 2007
dollars) was $408 less in 2007 than it was at its peak in 1999, two years before
this Administration took office. Although this is a decline in real terms, it
tells an incomplete story of what happened during the Administration. Real
median household income fell through 2004, but this represented a trend
that began before the Presidency. Real median income strongly rebounded
beginning in 2004 and reached near-peak levels by 2007.
Annual median household income, as reported by the Census Bureau, also
includes both labor income and non-labor income. Thus, changes in median
household income can be driven not only by changes in labor income but also
by changes in income from investments and government transfer payments,
such as Social Security or unemployment benefits. Turning to more specific
measures of labor income, workers fared well during the Administration.
Chart 8-4 plots an index of real hourly earnings for private non-farm production or non-supervisory workers from 1988–2007 (with real earnings in 1988
set to 100). The chart shows that real hourly earnings fell slightly through the
early 1990s. After that, however, there was a long period of strong growth
starting in the mid 1990s and continuing into the early part of this decade.
Although it is true that real earnings are still less than their historic highs in
the 1970s, 2007 marked their highest point since 1979.
Chart 8-4 reveals one other important point about recent trends in labor
income. Workers are increasingly getting less of their pay in terms of cash
wages and more in terms of benefits. Real total compensation per hour for
private non-farm workers is plotted using the Employer Cost Index, which
includes wages, salaries, and employer costs for employee benefits. Again,
the index is set to 100 in 1988. Real total employee compensation grew
considerably faster throughout the last 20 years than real hourly earnings. In
2007, total employee compensation in real terms reached its highest point
on record. The growth appears most pronounced during the first half of
this decade. This rise in total compensation likely stems from the growth
in the costs of employer-provided health and retirement benefits, which far
outpaced the growth in cash wages (and inflation) during the Administration.
The increase in the dollar value of compensation received in the form of nonwage benefits has reduced the real wage increases that workers would have
otherwise received.
Finally, the real household income decline noted at the start of this section,
as well as the changes in worker wages, masks one other important factor.
These are pretax measures and therefore are imperfect gauges of what people

Chapter 8  |  229

and households are able to spend, save, and invest. One measure that looks
at after-tax income tells a much different story. Specifically, real per capita
disposable income, another important measure of income derived from the
Bureau of Economic Analysis’s National Income and Product Accounts,
reflects after-tax income and is more reflective of purchasing power. From
2000 to 2007, there was a steady increase in per capita real disposable income
that averaged 1.68 percent per year, compared with 2.12 percent annual
growth in real disposable income over the 8 years from 1992 to 2000. Given
the rise in energy prices during the current Administration, however, as well
as the fact that there was an economic downturn over its first several years, the
growth in real disposable income is noteworthy. Like real median household
income, however, real per capita disposable income reflects both labor and
non-labor income.
Although 2008 and 2009 will undeniably be difficult for many workers
and their families as unemployment rises, data from 2000–2007 show that
most measures of real income (that is, labor income, total compensation, and
per capita disposable income) grew during the Administration.

Worker Flexibility and Training
The U.S. labor market is part of a dynamic worldwide market with
constantly changing demands brought about by technological change and
international trade. The U.S. labor market, however, is well structured to
meet these challenges. The United States has a long history of limiting
the amount of government intervention between workers and firms, thus
allowing for flexibility in the American workforce. Specifically, businesses in
the United States are less limited than businesses in other developed countries in their ability to discharge a worker, thereby making them more willing
to hire workers, knowing that they can more easily fire an unproductive
employee. In times of growth, job openings are plentiful and workers are
willing to search for the job that best matches them. The flexible employment relationship in the United States is evidenced by the relatively high rate
of job mobility. Although it must be recognized that workers do build up
specific skills from remaining at a firm and that not all job separations are
advantageous, a growing economy still requires that workers be flexible and
change jobs to find the correct match for their skills.
Among countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), the United States has by far the most mobile workforce. Since January 2001, about 1 in 30 workers separated from their job
in an average month (or about 4.39 million jobs were vacated). During
these months, an average of 4.54 million workers were hired each month,
suggesting that the economy was both creating new jobs and that workers
were quickly filling positions that opened. The majority of job separations during these years were also created by workers voluntarily quitting,
suggesting that many workers left jobs for new opportunities. Although these
numbers have become more volatile in the latter half of 2008, with layoffs
making up a higher percentage of job separations, during times of growth the
rate of job openings in the United States is a testament to the relative flexibility of the U.S. labor market.
Workers in the United States have also shown more willingness to move to
where jobs are located. According to the OECD, in each year from 2000 to
2005, over 3 percent of the U.S. working-age population moved across State
lines. In comparison, only 1 percent of the working-age population in the
EU-15 (the 15 European Union members before the 2004 expansion) moved
between the 72 recognized European regional subdivisions. Moreover, less
than 0.25 percent moved between EU-15 countries annually over this period.
Obviously language barriers preclude some EU-15 mobility, but the greater
geographic mobility in the United States also compares favorably to Australia
and Canada. In short, the willingness of workers in the United States to
move is an important part of the structure of the labor force and a reason for
its flexibility.
Chapter 8  |  231

Another key to meeting the growing demand for new and changing skills in
the labor force will be the continued willingness of American workers to get
the education and training needed to fill the new jobs that are created in the
economy. A commitment to education, particularly in more technical fields,
will prove to be important in the coming decades. The Administration’s job
training initiatives, including the Community-Based Job Training Grants
and the High Growth Job Training Initiative, have helped prepare workers
for jobs in high-demand industries. The Administration also proposed
Career Advancement Accounts that put funds directly in the hands of people
to pay for expenses related to education and training and put strict limits
on administrative overhead in order to increase resources available for job
training. Finally, international trade has also created many new opportunities
for American workers, and Box 8-2 describes programs aimed to help workers
take advantage of these opportunities.

Retiree Income
As life expectancies increase, American workers will likely spend an
increasing amount of time in retirement. The Federal Government provides
substantial retirement assistance through the Medicare and Social Security
programs, but the challenges faced by these entitlement programs are substantial and are discussed in Chapter 6. Private savings and individual pensions
provided by employers continue to be essential.

Box 8-2: Trade Adjustment Assistance
International trade brings substantial benefits to the U.S. economy.
Not only are American consumers able to take advantage of a greater
number of goods at lower prices, but workers in industries whose products and services are in high demand internationally benefit as well. In
2006, for example, an estimated 13 million U.S. jobs were supported by
exports. The wages of manufacturing workers in plants that export are
9 percent higher than the wages of workers in non-exporting plants, and
the wage premium in service-oriented firms that export is 13 percent
over non-exporting firms. Furthermore, exports accounted for approximately 30 percent of economic growth in 2006.
Although the benefits of trade are enormous, workers in industries
that must compete with imports can be adversely affected. Because
of this, Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) exists to provide benefits
to workers who are potentially adversely affected by trade. Though
continued on the next page

232  |  Economic Report of the President

Box 8-2 — continued
the TAA has been in operation since 1974, it was changed substantially
when it was reauthorized in the Trade Act of 2002. The Act consolidated
the TAA and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) TAA
programs, expanded the eligibility to cover workers affected by shifts
in production to certain other countries and to workers secondarily
affected upstream or downstream from TAA-certified firms, expanded
the training opportunities available, provided a health coverage tax
credit, and promoted earlier intervention to allow more rapid enrollment, training, and reemployment of eligible workers. In FY 2007, firms
covered by TAA certifications employed nearly 147,000 workers. Of
these, over 49,000 eligible workers entered TAA training.
Of the eligible workers who took up benefits in the program in
fiscal year 2007, 68 percent received some form of training, 59 percent
received specific occupational training, and 13 percent received remedial training. The TAA program has also become successful over time
in finding new employment for workers. While in 2001 only 63 percent
of workers who exited the program were successfully reemployed, with
a wage replacement rate of 87 percent, by 2006, 72 percent of workers
exiting the program were reemployed, with a wage replacement rate of
89 percent.
In discussions of TAA reauthorization during 2007, debate developed
in Congress over potential ways to expand the TAA program. The
Administration supported reforms to the TAA to improve the delivery of
services, to offer greater flexibility, and to enhance training for eligible
workers. Several legislators and policymakers, however, suggested
a number of expansions to TAA benefits, most notably: (a) allowing
service workers, in addition to manufacturing workers, to receive benefits; (b) allowing workers who produce service-related goods to receive
benefits; (c) allowing entire sectors to be eligible for coverage under
TAA benefits; and (d) increasing the amount of funding for benefits
and training. The fiscal and economic costs of such an expansion were
uncertain, and some estimates indicated they would be substantial (the
Congressional Budget Office estimated an additional $8.6 billion over
the 2008–2017 period). Beyond the fiscal cost, however, there were
additional concerns regarding economic efficiency. Extending TAA
benefits to substantially more workers could lead to economic losses by
creating longer-term, higher unemployment in the covered industries.
Furthermore, service workers experience minimal wage loss during
displacement when compared with manufacturing workers, indicating
that expanding benefits to them may not be justified. Finally, there were
worries that expansion would open the door for further, unwarranted
expansions of TAA benefits.

Chapter 8  |  233

Employer-provided pensions come in one of two types: defined benefit
plans or defined contribution plans. Defined benefit pension plans specify
an amount to be paid upon retirement, normally calculated using a formula
based on an employee’s years of service with the company and his or her
earnings history. Defined contribution pension plans consist of an individual
employee account into which the employer and/or employee contribute,
usually at a fixed percentage of the employee’s salary. Upon retirement,
individuals have access to the balance in the account. Historically, defined
benefit plans have been dominant, but over the past several decades, defined
contribution plans have become more popular.
The first Federal protections of worker pensions were set by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, which, among other
things, established the fiduciary responsibilities of plan managers. It also
established the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which protects the
defined benefit plans (up to a statutory limit) of private sector workers
against the possibility that an employer will fail to pay the promised benefits.
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is funded primarily through
premiums established by law paid by the sponsors of defined benefit plans.
There have been many changes in pension provision since ERISA was
passed in 1974, including the increased prevalence of defined contribution plans and heightened concerns regarding underfunded private plans.
The Pension Protection Act of 2006 accomplished several important goals.
First, with regard to defined benefit plans, greater premiums were imposed
on companies with underfunded plans. Moreover, caps on the amount
employers could put into plans were raised to allow employers to build a
cushion during good economic times.
The Pension Protection Act also addressed the growing use of defined
contribution plans by including provisions that give workers more information and control over the investment of their account balances. It also
provided incentives for employers to automatically enroll new employees
in defined contribution plans, which likely will increase plan participation.
Furthermore, after observing the potential for notable shortfalls in pension
plan funding, the act also improved the process employed to value plan assets
and liabilities. By utilizing fair-market valuations, the pension reform was
able to limit the use of valuation-smoothing practices that often made it
difficult to detect gaps in pension funding, thus helping to prevent funding
shortfalls. The various reforms in the Pension Protection Act followed an
initiative led by the President in his 2005 pension reform proposal. These
reforms will make retirement incomes of millions of Americans more secure.

234  |  Economic Report of the President

Looking Ahead
As we look toward the future, there are a number of education and labor
issues that will likely receive attention. First, the distribution of income in
the United States is more skewed toward the wealthy than in other developed countries. The lower level of intergenerational economic mobility in
the United States, compared with other countries, suggests this is a concern
that will persist. Second, a need for comprehensive immigration reform
exists and will necessarily require education and labor policies to be balanced
with border security. The Administration has been a strong supporter of
such reform, and the ideas generated by the Administration will likely shape
discussions in the years ahead.

Income Inequality
In addition to arguments centered in theories of social justice, high income
inequality may create more tangible problems. Some argue that inequality
leads to a breakdown in social cohesion, which lowers a population’s aggregate health (even holding income constant). Violent crime also increases as
gaps between the poor and wealthy widen. Apart from that, high inequality
threatens to squander the abilities and talents of a larger number of children
in poorer families if upward economic mobility is also low. This is the case
in the United States, where intergenerational mobility is relatively low and
income inequality is high.
The most common method for measuring income inequality is the Gini
coefficient, which is a value that ranges from zero (perfect equality, or everyone
has an equal amounts of income) to one (perfect inequality, or all income is
held by one family). The U.S. Gini coefficient is currently 0.45, according
to the most recent cross-country comparison measures from the Central
Intelligence Agency (or 0.46, according to the most recent Census Bureau
estimates, which measures U.S. inequality). This level of inequality exceeds
that of most other developed countries, with many European nations having
Gini coefficients below 0.30. In fact, the U.S. level of inequality exceeds that
in some lesser developed countries such as Indonesia (0.36) and is comparable
to Kenya (0.45). Only a few countries noticeably exceed the United States in
terms of inequality (for example, Brazil (0.57) and South Africa (0.65)). In
short, the level of inequality in the United States is unusually high given our
level of development and wealth.
In addition to the Gini coefficient of the United States being high by international standards, it has steadily risen over the past several decades. Many
researchers have tried to explain the reasons for the high and growing level of
income inequality in the United States. Although some have attributed the

Chapter 8  |  235

greater inequality to institutional factors such as the declining real value of the
minimum wage and lower rates of unionization, institutional explanations fail
to match some of the more recent trends in inequality that look beyond the
Gini coefficient. Specifically, an analysis of the wage distribution of workers
suggests that the gap between mid-level earners and low-wage workers has
remained relatively steady over the past decade despite a declining real value
of the minimum wage. Instead, the gap between the highest earners and midlevel earners has increased over the past decade.
This most recent analysis of trends argues that technological change since
the 1990s, particularly in the area of information technology, has benefited
workers who possess skills for which these advances are complementary.
These include highly skilled workers who are in jobs where technology is used
in combination with interpersonal skills, such as in management or professional positions. These jobs are not as easily automated or outsourced as
the tasks performed by middle-educated white collar or production workers.
Those with less education but wages in the middle of the distribution have
seen the difference between their wages and the wages of the highest earners
widen.
One way to bring more of the workforce into the group of highly skilled
workers whose jobs are not easily automated or outsourced is to provide a
greater emphasis on education, particularly in math and science. Recent
successes in raising math test scores and expanding the Pell Grant program
are important steps. A continuing focus on increasing educational attainment
for children across the income distribution is critical. Increased access to
quality education will create more productive workers and greater wages for
an increasing share of the population, thereby closing income gaps.

Immigration Reform
The United States is a nation of immigrants and has long depended on
the contributions of the foreign-born to its economy. A sound immigration policy must continue to foster the economic benefits of immigrants by
recognizing that foreign-born labor complements the existing strengths of the
U.S. workforce. Such an immigration policy should also promote fluency in
English, which not only enhances the earnings potential of immigrants but
also can help improve productivity. Furthermore, the flow of immigration
must also be regulated and restricted to legal channels.
Residents of foreign countries will immigrate when the benefits of migration outweigh the costs. The benefits typically are the earnings differentials
between the United States and their home country. Because of this, the
United States usually attracts immigrants of all skill levels. The highly skilled

236  |  Economic Report of the President

are attracted to the greater earnings they receive in the United States given
their skill level. Immigrants with fewer skills are attracted to the better wages
and potential opportunities for their families.
The United States benefits from both types of immigration. The scientific establishment and high-technology industries have long benefited from
workers with superior skills who immigrate to the United States and boost
productivity. Immigrants with fewer skills perform jobs that complement
existing labor in this country.
Education and labor policies have their roles in a comprehensive approach
to immigration policy in the United States. While many immigrants are
highly skilled, the average educational attainment of immigrants lags behind
the native-born. Promoting English fluency is important because it increases
labor market opportunities for immigrants, boosts their productivity, facilitates higher earnings, and promotes greater assimilation. To enhance the
potential contribution of immigrants and to improve their well-being, it is
also important to continue this Administration’s sound education policies.
NCLB, Reading First, and policies that increase access to higher education
are all targeted toward students that need the most assistance, and the U.S.
immigrant population stands to gain much from these programs. The U.S.
economy will benefit in turn.
The issues the United States confronts with regard to its immigration
policy are complex, and the Administration introduced comprehensive immigration reform as part of its domestic policy agenda in 2004. This proposal
addressed many issues, including devoting more manpower to border security
and increasing worksite enforcement of immigration laws. To ensure that
the United States has an immigrant workforce that complements the existing
U.S. workforce and meets economic needs, the Administration called for a
flexible temporary guest worker program. To improve the productivity of
immigrants, enhance their contributions to U.S. labor markets, and improve
their welfare, assimilation proposals that promoted English and cultural
literacy were advanced. The sweeping reforms of this proposal, however,
failed to gain the necessary Congressional support. The need for these immigration reforms endures, and the Administration’s plan remains one that is
sound in terms of both securing borders and promoting economic progress.

Conclusion
The Administration has been committed to ensuring that the U.S. labor
force remains productive for decades to come. Significant progress has been
made in the U.S. educational system to help current and future students
meet the ever-increasing and changing demand for skills in the more global,

Chapter 8  |  237

competitive labor market. K–12 education has improved, test scores are
rising, and students in underperforming schools now have more education
options. Also, access to the U.S. higher education system has improved
through expansions of the Pell Grant program and reforms enacted in the
student loan program. Despite these successes, there are challenges that
remain. Income inequality in the United States is high and suggests that a
continued emphasis on education is necessary to raise the incomes of those in
the lower half of the income distribution. Also, education and labor policy
will need to be part of comprehensive immigration reform in the United
States. This reform must reduce illegal immigration while continuing to
allow the U.S. economy to benefit from legal immigrants.

Economic Regulation

T

he United States relies on the private sector to organize most economic
activity. Through price signals and competition, markets allocate scarce
resources to their highest-value uses, encourage businesses to avoid waste, and
create incentives to invest in new technologies. Government plays a vital role
in a market system by guaranteeing property rights and enforcing contracts,
meaning that businesses and individuals can invest and trade with confidence
that their agreements will be honored and free from fraud. A private enterprise system supported by consistent enforcement of laws protecting property
and contracts has been at the heart of the American economy’s tremendous
prosperity and growth.
Although free markets produce the most efficient outcome in most cases,
there are markets in which government intervention can increase economic
efficiency. A market failure is an instance in which unregulated markets yield
an outcome that is inefficient from society’s point of view. As discussed in
Chapter 2, regulation is important in financial markets because of imperfect
information; for example, investors often have far less information about the
firms they invest in than the managers who control those firms. Chapter 3
discusses the role of regulation when production of a good creates a negative
externality, such as environmental harm, that does not represent a cost from
the producer’s perspective but imposes a cost on society. Regulation can
mitigate the costs of negative externalities by ensuring that consumers and
producers bear the full cost of their activities. Regulation can also reduce
harm from natural monopoly, which occurs when a single seller can produce a
good or service more cheaply than a competitive industry. In the presence of
natural monopoly, an unregulated market will yield output levels that are too
low and prices that are too high from society’s perspective. In cases like these,
where there is a specific market failure that can be effectively addressed by the
government, regulation may be able to improve economic outcomes.
When unregulated markets produce inefficiencies, however, government is
not always effective in eliminating or reducing the inefficiencies. There are
several reasons that government is often inefficient in carrying out regulation.
First, competitive market prices, which efficiently coordinate decisions in
competitive markets, are unavailable where market failures have caused
inefficiencies. The lack of reliable price information makes it difficult for
government to design effective regulation. Second, government does not
face market incentives to keep costs low and to use resources in the most
efficient way possible. Third, government decision making reflects the results
239

of a political process in which decision makers may be motivated by narrow
interests rather than the broader goals of society. Market participants may
spend resources on attempts to influence the political process, when other
uses of resources would produce greater public benefit. These factors mean
that government intervention can have significant costs, which must be
weighed against the potential benefits of addressing market failures.
One way government can mitigate these problems is by designing
regulations that take advantage of markets or market mechanisms whenever
possible. “Command and control” regulation, which replaces decentralized
market choices with centralized decision making by government officials,
exacerbates the three problems identified above. Regulation that relies on
market mechanisms, however, can take advantage of individuals’ information
about costs and benefits, give individuals the incentive to make socially
efficient decisions, and reduce the ways that narrow interests can influence
policy choices.
This chapter reviews several areas in which markets have been affected
by government policy in the past 8 years. The Administration has pursued
market-oriented policies that favor individual choice over government decision making and has supported new rules when needed to address identified
market failures. The Administration has also considered the effectiveness of
the overall regulatory structure for financial markets in particular, a summary
of which is provided in Chapter 2. The key points of this chapter are:
•	 Regulation is appropriate when, and only when, there is an important
market failure that can be effectively addressed by the government.
For example, the Administration has taken steps to reduce restrictive
regulation of broadband markets, preserving an environment conducive
to innovation and new investment. Conversely, the Administration
supported new rules for financial reporting when it became clear that
existing laws did not adequately reduce information asymmetries
between investors and management.
•	 When the government intervenes to address market failures, it should
attempt to take advantage of market-based incentives whenever possible.
The Administration has helped ensure that scarce spectrum licenses
are allocated more efficiently by increasing the amount of bandwidth
allocated through auctions rather than through arbitrary allotments.
In transportation, the Administration has supported market-based
approaches to financing infrastructure such as roads and the air traffic
control system.
•	 The Administration has endeavored to ensure that, when the government
does intervene in markets, it does so in a way that supports the operation
of competitive markets. When the market for terrorism insurance was
disrupted following the attacks of 9/11, the Administration supported
a temporary program of Federal support for terrorism insurance, and
240  |  Economic Report of the President

the Administration has insisted that subsidies be phased out as private
insurers adapt and return to the market. By supporting tort reform, the
Administration has helped reduce the scope for class action lawsuits that
create costs that outweigh their social benefits.

Telecommunications and Broadband
Digital technologies and the Internet are rapidly changing the market
for telecommunications. Much of our system for regulating telecommunications, however, is designed to address local monopolies in telephone
service. Regulation that was well suited to markets based on prior technologies should be revisited as markets change. Particularly when innovation is
transforming an industry, outdated regulations can hamper investment and
prevent new products and services from developing in the way that best serves
consumers.
Governments regulate local telephone service because it has long been
considered a natural monopoly. It is expensive to build and maintain a
network of lines to homes and businesses, but once the lines are in place, the
extra cost of providing each call is small. This means new entrants would
find it very hard to challenge an incumbent phone company. A potential
competitor would need to invest large amounts to duplicate an incumbent
phone company’s network of lines, and resulting competition would make it
hard for either firm to charge rates high enough to pay for the investment.
To prevent incumbent phone companies from charging monopoly prices,
government regulates rates for local phone service. In addition, the Federal
Government attempts to encourage competition in local service by requiring
incumbent phone companies to make their lines available to competitors and
by regulating the price for access to their lines.

New Technologies Permit Greater Competition in
Telecommunications
New technologies are changing the telecommunications market. A new
market has developed in broadband Internet connections that can transmit
data at high speeds. Broadband data can be delivered along the same physical
lines that carry telephone signals, but can also be delivered via cable, via fiber
optic connections, wirelessly via “third-generation” networks or satellites, or
via newer technologies such as broadband over power lines. Because digital
signals can be delivered in a variety of ways, the broadband market is more
open to competition than the traditional phone system, which required
copper wires connected to every home.

Chapter 9  |  241

Unlike local phone service, for which Americans traditionally had only one
provider available, the large majority of Americans can now choose among
competing broadband providers. As of June 2007, 99 percent of U.S. ZIP
codes had access to two or more high-speed Internet service providers, and
more than three-quarters of ZIP codes were served by five or more providers.
The price of broadband service has fallen in real terms even as the average
broadband connection has become more advanced. Chart 9-1 shows that the
total number of subscribers has grown dramatically, with an increasing variety
of technologies used.
These same digital technologies, combined with large investments in wireless telephone networks, mean that consumers have new choices for local
telephone service, a market situation that undermines the traditional arguments for regulation in local telephone markets. Between 2002 and 2006, the
number of households that use a wireline for their primary phone connection
fell from 102 million to under 90 million, and the number of “wireless-only”
households increased from 2 million to 19 million. That new competitors are
challenging the longstanding monopoly position of local telephone providers
raises questions about the best approach to regulating local telephone service
going forward.

242  |  Economic Report of the President

Telecommunications Regulation in an Evolving Market
The Administration’s approach to broadband regulation has recognized
that a dynamic and competitive broadband market should not be governed
by rules designed for monopoly telephone services. That does not mean that
no rules are appropriate. Broadband companies should disclose the policies
they use in managing their networks; if consumers know what they are
getting, competitive pressures will offer the most effective means of providing
consumers with low prices and high-quality service. However, prescriptive
regulation of a growing, dynamic market carries two risks. First, because the
market continues to evolve, a regulation aimed at temporary or hypothetical
problems may cause permanent harm by preventing new and innovative ways
of delivering service. Second, regulations that make it harder for broadband
providers to price or manage their networks effectively may lower the
incentives to invest in new capacity, ultimately harming consumers.
Following the principles outlined in the previous paragraph, the
Administration has supported policies that avoid unwarranted regulation
of the broadband market and encourage private sector investments in the
market. In a series of decisions, the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) determined that broadband service providers would not be regulated
as a local phone service; in particular, they are not required to make their
high-speed lines available to competitors at a regulated price. While government-mandated access can facilitate competition between a large incumbent
provider and potential competitors, applying it to an emerging industry that
features competing technologies would have risked undermining incentives to
invest in new capacity. In fact, the private sector has invested more each year
in building broadband networks, in real terms, than the Federal Government
invested annually in the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s. These
investments in turn have meant more options for consumers, and ultimately
more competition in the broadband market.
There is certainly a role for telecommunications regulations that target
specific failures in the telecommunications market. For example, 911 services
provide external benefits by making it more likely that emergencies are
promptly reported to emergency services. The Administration supported the
FCC’s efforts to ensure that 911 services are available for subscribers of Voice
over Internet Protocol telephone providers. When there is a role for regulation, the rules should facilitate competition and consumer choice whenever
possible. In implementing the “Do Not Call” list, for example, the Federal
Trade Commission did not dictate a market outcome but created a way for
people to decide whether they wanted to receive certain telemarketing calls
(see Box 9-1).

Chapter 9  |  243

Box 9-1: The Do Not Call List
Telemarketing can be an effective way to inform people about products and services, but it generates a negative externality by wasting the
time of those who are not interested in the product being sold. Although
the harm from each call may be small, many consumers have found the
aggregate externality to be quite large. The policy behind the Do Not Call
list is to permit consumers to decide for themselves whether the benefits
of telemarketing calls outweigh the costs. Individuals who do not want
to receive calls simply add their phone numbers to a central registry,
and telemarketers must delete any numbers listed in the registry from
those they plan to call. The program has proved quite popular: as of
2007, according to one survey, 72 percent of Americans had registered
on the list, and 77 percent of those say that it made a large difference in
the number of telemarketing calls that they receive (another 14 percent
report a small reduction in calls). Another survey, conducted less than a
year after the Do Not Call list was implemented, found that people who
registered for the list saw a reduction in telemarketing calls from an
average of 30 calls per month to an average of 6 per month.

Spectrum Policy
Since the 1920s, the U.S. Government has required a license of anyone
who transmits radio signals on most frequencies. Radio communication
works by transmitting a signal on a specific frequency of the electromagnetic
spectrum. Mandatory licensing prevents interference: when multiple signals
are broadcast on the same frequency, it is difficult to receive any of those
signals clearly. Interference is an example of an externality, because when one
person decides to broadcast a signal, he or she does not take into account the
harm this causes to people who are attempting to send or receive other signals
on the same frequency.
While licensing addresses the externality problem, it puts the government
in the position of allocating a scarce and valuable resource. Given spectrum’s
value, it is important to allocate it efficiently. Radio waves can be used in
many different ways: for two-way communication, to broadcast radio or
television programs, and for radar, among other uses. The more spectrum
is set aside for broadcast television stations, for example, the less spectrum is
available for wireless phones. The challenge of spectrum licensing is to ensure
that spectrum is divided among competing uses in the way that creates the
greatest benefits to society.

244  |  Economic Report of the President

Ordinarily, markets allocate scarce resources using prices, ensuring that
resources are dedicated to their highest-value uses. For many decades,
however, the U.S. Government awarded spectrum licenses through an
administrative process, deciding both how spectrum would be used and who
would be allowed to use it. Prospective users submitted applications to the
FCC, and the FCC attempted to identify the applicant who would offer the
greatest public benefit.
The optimal allocation of spectrum, however, depends on information not
easily available to government, from technical information about how much
spectrum is needed to effectively carry out different activities and how that is
likely to change in the future, to questions about the value to consumers of the
various services that require spectrum. Administrative assignment of licenses
also gives firms no incentive to find ways to use spectrum more efficiently,
because they cannot change their method of transmission and cannot sell or
lease unused capacity to others who would use spectrum in a different way.
The United States began using a more market-oriented approach to
allocating spectrum rights in 1994 with the first auctions of radio spectrum
for use in wireless phones. In the auctions, the FCC announces the portion
of the spectrum for which licenses will be made available, and all interested
parties are invited to submit bids. By 2008, the FCC had held more than 70
auctions that raised tens of billions of dollars for the Federal Government.
More important than the revenue, however, is that auctions ensure that
spectrum will go to those who are able to use it in the most efficient way.
When one company outbids others, it generally means that the winner believes
it can produce more value using that spectrum, by using it more effectively
or in a more innovative way than its competitors. Instead of a government
evaluation of which applicant is best able to use spectrum to serve the public,
the bidding process allocates licenses based on what companies reveal about
the benefits they can actually produce.
The Administration has worked to increase the role of auctions in
allocating spectrum. Most spectrum remains under licenses granted long ago;
as of 2001, less than 7 percent of the most valuable spectrum was available
for allocation through market mechanisms. One obstacle to reallocating
spectrum is that incumbent license holders have a strong incentive to retain
spectrum they use, even if others might be able to use it more efficiently. One
way the Administration has tried to overcome this obstacle is by making it
easier for incumbents to transfer their spectrum to others. In October 2003,
the FCC established new procedures for holders of existing licenses to more
easily sublicense their spectrum to third parties, helping to foster secondary
spectrum markets. More broadly, the Administration has supported policies
under which incumbents are compensated as part of a process that reduces
the total amount of spectrum they use. Two major spectrum auctions using

Chapter 9  |  245

this general approach since 2001 have freed up significant bands of spectrum,
nearly doubling the amount of spectrum allocated through auctions for
wireless use.
In early 2008, the FCC held an auction to allocate spectrum that will
be vacated when the United States makes the transition to digital television broadcasting, pursuant to the Digital Television Transition and Public
Safety Act of 2005. Digital signals allow broadcasters to transmit television
programming more efficiently, so that the spectrum that was used to broadcast a single analog television channel is now able to carry multiple digital
channels. One result of the transition is that spectrum that was previously
used for channels 52 to 69 (between 698 and 806 megahertz (MHz)) will
become vacant. Television stations using other frequencies will be able to
transmit using digital signals. Much of the newly vacated spectrum was
auctioned for wireless communications use.
In December 2004, the President signed the Commercial Spectrum
Enhancement Act, which created a mechanism for transferring spectrum
from government use into the private sector. Government users of these
frequencies were given the opportunity to switch to other parts of the spectrum, with the transition costs (including new equipment) paid for using a
portion of the auction proceeds. Under the Act, the reallocation of spectrum
was not to take place unless the auction raised sufficient funds to compensate
the affected agencies. In fact, auction revenues were several times what the
agencies had reported was necessary to compensate them for the switch. The
large difference between the market value of spectrum and the costs of the
transition demonstrate the large efficiency gains available from reallocation of
spectrum. Together with the transition to digital television, the Commercial
Spectrum Enhancement Act has freed up 152 MHz of spectrum to be
auctioned for wireless communications use, and all but 10 MHz had been
auctioned by 2008. This represents an increase of 80 percent over spectrum
available for mobile telephones at the beginning of this Administration.
The President’s Spectrum Policy Initiative for the 21st Century, which was
announced in 2003, requires a studied look at the current spectrum management policies and practices in the United States. As part of this program, the
Commerce Department’s National Telecommunications and Information
Administration has worked to establish or expand incentives for promoting
efficient spectrum use by the private sector as well as Federal agencies, using
market-based approaches wherever appropriate. Areas of particular interest
have included revising the traditional “command and control” management
of Federal spectrum, developing user fees that reflect market worth, and
creating property rights that would permit spectrum trading.

Tort Reform
Even when businesses are not regulated directly by the government, they
face the possibility of being sued under the tort system. “Tort” refers to the
body of law that permits individuals to sue others, seeking compensation
when they have been accidentally or deliberately injured. Many tort suits
arise from harms involving strangers, such as automobile accidents, but an
important class of torts arises when buyers of a good or service sue the seller
in response to harm related to the purchase of the good or service.
Tort law can be a response to the market failure of imperfect information.
Buyers often cannot tell ahead of time whether a product is safe or a service
provider is qualified. By providing buyers with redress when a product or
service they buy causes harm, tort law can encourage sellers to exercise appropriate care and to make sure buyers are getting what they expect when they
enter into a transaction.
Like more direct forms of government regulation, tort law establishes
rules that firms must follow to avoid being penalized. Tort law can increase
sellers’ incentives to provide safe, high-quality products and services. It also
compensates victims of some accidents, providing a form of insurance when
an accident is caused by another’s negligence. However, the tort system is an
expensive form of regulation, and tort law can be abused in ways that make
its costs to society greater than its benefits. One study found that out of each
dollar of costs in the tort system, only 46 cents goes to compensating plaintiffs
for their losses. This makes the tort system much more expensive to administer than other systems that compensate victims for unexpected losses, such
as worker’s compensation.
Total tort costs represent a significant part of U.S. economic activity. Tort
costs in 2007 totaled $252 billion, or 1.83 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP), including damages paid to compensate plaintiffs, costs of defense,
and administrative costs. As shown in Chart 9-2, more than half of tort costs
come from lawsuits against businesses (including doctors) as compared with
personal lawsuits such as automobile accidents.
The Administration has worked to reduce the scope of lawsuits in areas
where costs often outweigh benefits. A type of lawsuit that may be especially
susceptible to abuse is the class action suit, in which a single suit is filed on
behalf of a large number of plaintiffs with the claim that everyone in the class
has been harmed by the defendant. Class actions can be efficient in some
cases in which a large number of people have suffered a similar type of harm,
because they eliminate the redundancy of multiple courts exploring similar
sets of facts, and because absent a class action, each individual may have little
incentive to bear the costs of a lawsuit. A potential problem with class action
lawsuits, however, is that plaintiffs’ lawyers may have incentives that are not

Chapter 9  |  247

aligned with those of their clients. Because individual plaintiffs may not have
a large stake in the outcome, they may not effectively monitor their attorneys,
and plaintiffs’ attorneys may negotiate a settlement with the defendant that
works well for the attorneys but does not represent meaningful redress for the
people actually harmed.
In 2005, the President signed the Class Action Fairness Act, which
contained provisions aimed at reducing the number of abusive class action
lawsuits. An important set of reforms addressed “coupon settlements,” one
arrangement that may often serve the interests of defendants and plaintiffs’
lawyers at the expense of plaintiffs themselves. In a coupon settlement,
members of the affected class receive coupons that can be redeemed for
discounts on the defendant’s product, but attorneys receive what may be a
very large cash payment based on the nominal value of the coupons. For
example, in one case, plaintiffs alleged that a video rental company had
failed to disclose its late-fee policy. Members of the class received coupons
worth $1 off a future rental, while the plaintiffs’ attorneys received a fee of
$9.25 million. Experts estimated that at most 20 percent of the coupons
would be redeemed. Moreover, it is plausible that the coupons were more
effective as a marketing effort by the defendant than as a deterrent to poor
disclosure policies. The Act reduced possible abuse of settlements through

248  |  Economic Report of the President

a number of reforms, including instructing courts to scrutinize settlement
agreements more carefully and a requirement that attorney fees be based on
the value of coupons actually redeemed, rather than coupons issued.
The Act also took steps to curtail “forum shopping”—that is, efforts by
plaintiffs to choose a jurisdiction that they expect will be friendly to their case.
Lawsuits are generally tried in a jurisdiction that has some connection to the
parties, but because class actions often include a large number of plaintiffs
nationwide, attorneys had the opportunity to initiate a lawsuit in a location
where they felt either the court or the local jury pool would be most favorable
to their case. The Class Action Fairness Act addresses this issue by making
it easier for defendants to have their case heard in Federal court, reducing
opportunities for plaintiffs to shop around for a jurisdiction in which they are
likely to have an advantage.

Corporate Governance Reform
For small businesses, a firm’s owner is likely to be its manager. But large
corporations may be owned by thousands of shareholders at once, and such
a large, dispersed group must delegate management to a smaller group of
people. This separation of ownership and control makes it possible to maintain central control over a firm’s operations while raising the large amounts
of capital needed for many corporate investments. But it also introduces the
problem of ensuring that managers make decisions that are in the best interests of the shareholders. Corporate governance refers to the systems through
which shareholders are able to control the choices of those who manage the
firm on their behalf.
Regulation of corporate governance arises from the fact that managers
know more about the corporation’s situation than the shareholders on whose
behalf they are making decisions. Most shareholders would like the corporation’s managers to make decisions that maximize profits. To encourage this,
corporate boards attempt to design incentives that reward managers when
their actions increase profits. For these incentive systems to work, however,
they must be based on accurate financial reports that are generated in a transparent way.
A corporation will be better off if it can ensure accurate financial reporting,
because if investors doubt the information they receive, they will be less willing
to invest. But it is difficult for shareholders to observe the mechanisms that
a corporation uses to improve accuracy and to prevent management from
making misleading reports. Furthermore, shareholders are a large, dispersed
group, so that an individual shareholder will not receive the full benefit of
costly efforts to monitor management. In the face of these challenges to

Chapter 9  |  249

private monitoring of financial reporting, the U.S. Government attempts to
ensure the accuracy of financial reporting through the securities laws enforced
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Beginning in the late 1990s, an increase in earnings restatements and
some large accounting scandals at major companies led to concerns that
corporations had been misleading investors about the extent of their profits.
In March of 2002, the President proposed a plan to improve corporate
governance, centered on three principles: accuracy and accessibility of information, management accountability, and auditor independence. Congress
later passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which incorporated these three
principles by introducing a number of changes to U.S. securities laws. Some
of the key reforms are described in the following paragraphs.
To promote greater accuracy and accessibility of information, SarbanesOxley requires corporations to disclose more information about internal
control structures and the members of their audit committees. It also significantly increases the penalties for criminal fraud, increasing the maximum
term for securities fraud to 25 years in prison and permitting terms of up to
20 years for destroying documents.
To promote greater management accountability, Sarbanes-Oxley requires
chief executive officers and chief financial officers to certify the accuracy and
completeness of financial reports that they file with the SEC and makes it a
criminal offense to knowingly certify a false report. In addition, executives
must forfeit any bonuses or other incentive compensation to which they
would have been entitled during the year after a false report is issued.
To increase auditor independence, the Act creates the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, which oversees the firms that audit corporations’ financial reports. The Board conducts regular reviews of accounting
firms’ activities, and if it discovers problems it can impose sanctions and
can bar a firm from providing audit services to corporations listed on U.S.
securities exchanges. In addition, the Act creates new requirements to ensure
that accounting firms are more independent of a corporation’s management.
Accounting firms are no longer permitted to sell certain non-audit services to
their corporate audit clients, and a company’s accountants must be chosen by
a committee of directors who have no ties to management.
Since passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, many have expressed concern
about the cost of compliance with its requirements. There is evidence that
some firms, especially smaller firms and foreign firms, have chosen to cease or
to avoid trading on U.S. public markets because of the expense of complying
with Sarbanes-Oxley, although there is no definitive evidence on how large
this effect has been. While some increase in costs is the inevitable result of
stricter reporting standards, it is important to ensure that the increased costs
are justified by greater accuracy and transparency. Many of the specifics of
Sarbanes-Oxley depend on rules and standards under the control of the SEC
250  |  Economic Report of the President

and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. As regulators and
corporations become more familiar with the implementation of the Act, and
as reporting companies adapt their practices and regulators adjust rules to
eliminate inefficient requirements, the costs should fall.

Insurance Against Terrorism and
Natural Disasters
When disasters occur, such as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,
or hurricanes such as Katrina in 2005 or Ike in 2008, the government plays
an important role in providing emergency relief and helping communities to
recover. At the same time, insurance coverage is vital in helping individuals
and businesses recover from catastrophic events. Most insurance is provided
by the private sector, regulated to make sure that insurers are able to repay
claims if they come due. But disaster relief acts as a form of public sector
insurance, and this means that the market for insurance against catastrophic
events is inevitably affected by government policy. To preserve private
insurers’ important role in mitigating disasters, government disaster relief
should help the Nation recover from major losses without discouraging the
operation of private insurance markets.
Insurance markets give individuals and businesses a way to reduce risk.
For example, anyone who owns a building faces a small risk of losing property in a fire. Rather than accepting a small probability of suffering a large
financial loss, insurance allows one to substantially reduce this risk by paying
a regular fee, called a premium, in exchange for compensation for some or all
of the losses sustained in the case of a fire. Because only a small fraction of
the population will suffer a fire in any given period, the premiums from the
overall pool of insured people provide funds to pay for the damage suffered
by those few who do suffer fires.
Insurance markets work most effectively if premiums are tailored to risks
that are observable or can be controlled by the insured customer. If individuals with different risk profiles are grouped together and charged the same
premium, then those who in fact have low risks are being charged premiums
that are greater than the expected value of their losses and may choose to
go without insurance. Differences in premiums can also lead individuals to
make more efficient choices about what risks to take and how best to mitigate risks—for example, if driving a safer car means paying lower insurance
premiums, people will have an incentive to choose safer vehicles. Similarly,
it may be more expensive to live in some coastal areas because a high risk of
storm damage leads to higher insurance premiums. This means that when

Chapter 9  |  251

home buyers decide whether to live in those areas, they will take into account
the extra cost associated with potential storm losses.
For risks such as house fires or automobile accidents, the fraction of the
population that will suffer losses each year is relatively stable. This means
that insurers can feel reasonably confident about what level of premiums will
be sufficient to cover the year’s losses. Losses from major catastrophes are
much more difficult to predict—for example, flood losses in 2005 related to
Hurricane Katrina were many times larger than the annual flood losses from
preceding years. This creates the risk that total losses in a year will be greater
than the funds available to the insurer to pay claims. Insurance companies
address this risk by purchasing reinsurance for large losses: in exchange for
premiums, reinsurers agree to bear a fraction of insurer’s losses if those losses
exceed a certain amount. Because reinsurers typically diversify their risks
internationally, they are in a position to pay claims arising from catastrophic
losses in a single country.
The 9/11 attacks seriously disrupted the market for terrorism insurance.
Prior to the 9/11 attacks, the risk of terrorist attacks was covered by most
commercial insurance policies. In the months following the attacks, however,
insurers were forced to reassess the likelihood of potential terrorist attacks and
the capital reserves they would require, and many insurers began excluding
terrorism risk from commercial insurance policies. Congress passed the
Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) to address this disruption in the market
and to help reassure businesses that they could obtain insurance against the
commercial risks associated with the threat of terrorism. Under TRIA, the
U.S. Government provides reinsurance for terrorism losses: in the event of
a claim for terrorism-related losses, an insurer would pay the claim to the
insured party and then be compensated by the Government for a large share
of the losses above certain limits. Insurers do not pay premiums up front
for this reinsurance. Instead, TRIA specifies that assessments from insurers
would be made after the fact.
TRIA was intended to address a sharp temporary disruption in insurance
markets, not to be a long-term subsidy to insurers that provide terrorism
coverage. Providing insurance at subsidized rates reduces the efficiency of
the insurance market. First, it undermines the incentive effects of premiums
that reflect expected losses as discussed above. This can encourage people
to undertake risks that they would otherwise not be willing to bear and
discourages people from taking actions that would mitigate risk. Second,
government-provided reinsurance undermines the private market for reinsurance, discouraging innovation and efficient pricing of risk.

252  |  Economic Report of the President

Because of these problems with government-subsidized insurance, the
Administration has insisted that TRIA should be a temporary program and
that subsidies should be reduced as markets adjust to the post-9/11 environment. The subsidies provided by TRIA have gradually been reduced.
The insurer’s deductible was initially 7 percent of the insurance company’s
previous year’s premiums, and this fraction had been increased to 20 percent
by 2007. In addition, the Federal share of insured losses has been reduced
from 90 percent to 85 percent, and as of 2007, Federal payments will not be
made unless insured losses from a terrorist event exceed $100 million. The
program is scheduled to expire in December of 2014.
The market in terrorism insurance has grown since 2002, even as subsidies for terrorism insurance have been reduced. As shown in Chart 9-3, the
fraction of policyholders purchasing terrorism insurance increased from 27
percent in 2003 to 59 percent in 2007, even as deductibles for the Federal
reinsurance program were increasing. As the private market develops to
accommodate the post-9/11 environment, government assistance should be
eliminated to allow the market to operate efficiently.

Chapter 9  |  253

Roads
The Nation’s roads are built and maintained primarily by State and local
governments; the Federal Government’s role has been to help fund these
activities. Like some other infrastructure projects, roads are often natural
monopolies: once a road is constructed, it is usually less expensive to accommodate extra traffic on that road than to construct a competing road. But
rather than organizing roads under a regulated, private sector monopolist,
the government generally owns and operates the roads itself—at least in part
because of the expense that would be involved in limiting access to roads to
paying drivers and collecting revenue from road users.
When government provides a service itself to an identifiable subset of
society, it is often most efficient to pay for the service through user fees
that reflect the marginal cost of providing it—that is, the extra cost created
by each user. This approach, when practical, both ensures that the service
will be used when its value is greater than its costs and provides information
about whether and when capacity should be expanded. User fees that reflect
marginal costs will lead drivers to make efficient decisions, choosing to drive
when the benefits they receive are greater than the costs their trip generates.
On an uncongested road, the marginal congestion imposed by each driver
is very small, and fees that reflect marginal cost may often be insufficient
to pay the fixed costs of building and operating the road. In this case, the
goal is to finance roads in a way that does as little as possible to discourage
efficient road use. When a road is congested, however, each trip adds to the
delays experienced by other drivers, meaning that the marginal cost of each
trip can be quite large. As discussed below, efficient user fees will reflect these
congestion costs.
Broadly speaking, roads in the United States are financed in one of three
ways: through general revenues such as property or sales taxes, through fuel
taxes and other vehicle fees, and through tolls. Chart 9-4 shows that about
a third of expenditure on roads is raised through taxes unrelated to road use,
largely at the State and local level. About half is raised through fuel and
vehicle taxes, and only about 5 percent through tolling (11 percent is funded
through bond issues that will be repaid from one of these three revenue
sources). Almost all Federal expenditure is funded by fuel and vehicle taxes,
reflecting an early decision that the Nation’s Interstate Highway System
should be funded by the drivers who benefit from it.
One advantage of funding roads with fuel taxes rather than general
revenues is that they approximate a user fee: roads are paid for by those who
use them, and on average people who drive more contribute more of the
cost of providing the roads. However, fuel taxes do not do a good job of
capturing the marginal cost of using the road. One of the most important

254  |  Economic Report of the President

costs associated with road use is congestion: when a driver uses a congested
road, she or he increases the delays experienced by everyone else. The
increased delay is a negative externality, because each driver does not take
into account these costs when deciding when, where, and whether to drive.
The fuel tax fails to account for this negative externality, because drivers
pay the same amount whether driving on an urban highway at rush hour
or on an empty rural road. Many economists point out that fuel taxes can
be effective in addressing some negative externalities directly related to fuel
use, such as environmental degradation and petroleum dependence. But this
does not imply that fuel taxes are the best way to finance roads. In fact, as
vehicles become more fuel efficient, they will produce less revenue for each
mile driven, so that the same amount of driving will contribute less and less
highway revenue.
The Administration has supported exploring ways to begin moving away
from fuel taxes toward forms of direct pricing, such as tolls, that would be
more effective at matching what drivers pay to the costs they impose. Not
only are tolls independent of a vehicle’s fuel efficiency, but they also have the
flexibility to address congestion externalities because they can be adjusted
according to time and place, so that drivers pay more to travel on busy routes
Chapter 9  |  255

or during busy times. Such tolls encourage drivers to drive at times and places
where they will contribute less to the delay experienced by others on the road.
Furthermore, tolls that reflect how busy a road is can provide information
about how much drivers are willing to pay to use each road. This information
can help improve decisions about new investments, by providing objective
measures of how valuable roads are to drivers.
By linking revenue to particular road projects, tolling can facilitate private
investment in building and maintaining roads. This increases the likelihood
that investments will be based on a careful analysis of a project’s benefits and
costs. When funding is controlled by the government, decisions about road
investments are likely to be influenced by a political process that takes place
among people with competing interests, and the process frequently does not
reflect an objective cost–benefit analysis. Tolling permits revenues to be
collected at the point of road consumption and directed to those responsible
for building and operating the road. Toll revenues can give investors strong
incentives to pursue only investments with revenues that exceed their costs,
so that they will not ignore projects with a large revenue-to-cost ratio and will
not spend money on projects that do not have a positive return (see Box 9-2).
However, private infrastructure investments may not give weight to public
benefits of an investment that are not reflected in the project’s revenues, such
as increased safety or reduced pollution. For projects for which such benefits
are substantial, it is important to have a public partner that can contribute
funding that reflects the public benefits of the project.
To encourage development of more efficient forms of highway finance,
the Department of Transportation has entered into Urban Partnership
Agreements with several metropolitan areas that will undertake programs
that include congestion pricing or variable toll demonstration projects. Calling for broader reform to highway finance, the Secretary of
Transportation proposed a plan in 2008 to reform Federal highway policy
by initiating a movement away from the fuel-tax-based approach to funding
highway investment to methods that link fees more closely to use of the road
system, such as congestion pricing. The Secretary also proposed expanding
support for private sector participation in road projects, including removing
current Federal statutory and regulatory barriers to tolling on Federally
supported highways.

256  |  Economic Report of the President

Box 9-2: The Role of Incentives in Road Investments
When private sector road operators rely on user fees for their revenue,
the potential for profit gives them incentives to invest in projects that
improve service to the public. Examples of such investment can be seen
on the Indiana Toll Road, which provides a key route between Chicago
and Ohio. In 2006, the State agreed to turn over operations on the road
to the Indiana Toll Road Concession Company under a 75-year lease.
Within the first year, the company installed electronic tolling facilities,
easing congestion and saving commuters valuable time. The company
also spent $250 million to add lanes to highly trafficked areas of the road.
Because the company’s profits depend on the toll revenues it generates,
the operators have an incentive to improve road conditions when the
cost of doing so is less than the extra revenue it gains from improving
service to drivers.
While some State and local governments use cost–benefit analyses
to guide their infrastructure investment decisions, many others fail
to make the investments that offer the greatest net benefits. Traffic
signal optimization is one area in which municipal governments have
frequently failed to invest resources despite very high expected returns.
Over time, pedestrian and vehicle traffic patterns change substantially
as cities grow and residential and commercial areas develop. Retiming
traffic signals to optimize traffic flow can reduce vehicle stops, which
in turn reduces delays, fuel use, and vehicle emissions. Transportation
engineers recommend retiming signals every 3 to 5 years, but a recent
survey showed that only 60 percent of State and local traffic agencies
retime their signals at least every 5 years.
Signal optimization is relatively inexpensive, and recent projects have
seen benefits in time and fuel savings exceed their cost by more than
40 to 1. Cities like Nashville, Austin, and Portland, Oregon, have invested
in signal optimization plans and seen improvements in traffic delay and
air quality, but State and local agencies often fail to allocate resources
to signal optimization programs. Many retime their signals infrequently
or conduct traffic assessments only in response to citizen complaints.
Local governments will better serve drivers if they follow the private
sector’s lead and base their investment decisions more heavily on cost–
benefit analysis.

Chapter 9  |  257

Aviation
Like roads, airports and air traffic control services are often provided by
the public sector. As with fees to finance roads, it would be economically
efficient to set aviation fees where a competitive market would set them, at
marginal cost. In fact, aviation fees bear little relationship to marginal costs.
Airport landing fees are generally based on aircraft weight, and air traffic
control operations are funded largely by a ticket tax of 7.5 percent on each
airline ticket. Air traffic control operations are also funded by fuel taxes and
additional fees.
This approach to financing means that fees do not reflect marginal costs in
at least two important respects. The cost of air traffic control services depends
on the number of planes, not on the size of those planes or the number of
passengers each carries. Similarly, each flight at a congested airport contributes approximately the same amount to congestion, regardless of the plane’s
size. Because fees are roughly proportional to the size of each plane and the
value of tickets sold, an airline that flies a single plane with 200 passengers
might pay roughly the same fees as an airline that flies 10 planes with 20
passengers each. The second airline, however, generates approximately 10
times as much congestion and requires about 10 times as much air traffic
controller time.
The result is that airlines do not take into account the external cost they
impose when they schedule a flight using a crowded airport. Airlines schedule
frequent flights with small aircraft rather than fewer flights with larger
aircraft. Overcrowded airports mean delayed flights, and delays have been
increasing in recent years, with congestion at the Nation’s busiest airports a
significant contributing factor. Delays were especially severe in New York
City airports in the summer of 2007; for example, at John F. Kennedy
International Airport (JFK), only 56 percent of flights arrived on time during
the summer months.
One method the government can use to address overcrowding is to place
caps on the number of flights permitted to land at an airport, in order to
limit those flights to the capacity the airport can accept. When the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) establishes a cap at an airport, each airline is
assigned “slots” permitting its aircraft to land or take off at particular times.
Delays are thereby reduced by excluding other airlines from the airport. In
the past, slots have been assigned through a negotiated process, and this
approach was used in 2008 at JFK and Newark Liberty International airports
after severe delays in the summer of 2007.
A problem with this approach is that the government must decide whose
planes can and cannot land at the airport. The need to obtain slots from the
government acts as a barrier to new entry at the airport, so that passengers are

258  |  Economic Report of the President

denied the benefits of competition. Even if the FAA makes wise decisions
about which airlines should initially receive slots when a cap is imposed at an
airport, this allocation will become inefficient over time. But the FAA will
find it difficult to further reallocate the slots regardless of how inefficient a
given distribution of slots becomes: given their scarcity, slots are very valuable, so an incumbent authorized to use the slot will go to great lengths to
maintain its allocation.
Recognizing the inefficiency that results when the government decides
which airlines have access to an airport, the Administration has sought
to use market-based mechanisms to allocate scarce airport capacity. One
approach is to allow airports to charge landing fees in a way that reflects the
greater demand to operate at certain times of the day. The Department of
Transportation published guidance in 2008 clarifying that airports have the
authority to charge congestion-based prices that would help encourage planes
to use the airport when it is less busy, as long as the total charges imposed
do not exceed the eligible costs of operating the airport. Under such an
approach, airlines—and ultimately passengers—would decide whether it was
worth paying a premium to schedule a flight at the most popular time.
Another approach with a similar result is to auction slots so that each
slot is used by the airline that values it most highly. As with congestionbased landing fees, an auction would drive up the price of slots at the
busiest times, but it would be less expensive to schedule a flight when the
airport is less crowded. Auctions would permit new entry by airlines if they
believed they could serve consumers more efficiently. In New York City,
the Administration issued rules that would implement this approach for a
limited number of slots. Apart from efficiently allocating the slots within the
cap, an auction would reveal the market value of the other slots held by the
airlines. This could help encourage airlines to trade slots among themselves
if they discover that particular slots would be worth more in the hands of a
different airline.

Conclusion
Government can play an important role in addressing the market failures
associated with natural monopoly, externalities, and imperfect information.
However, it would be naive to assume that government can eliminate all inefficiency in a market. Government lacks the information and incentives that
make competitive markets work efficiently. Before intervening in a market,
policymakers should first examine whether the inefficiencies of government
involvement are outweighed by the inefficiencies of an unregulated market.

Chapter 9  |  259

Regulation will be most efficient if it takes advantage of market mechanisms
where possible. The Administration has taken an approach to regulation that
supports competitive markets and attempts to take advantage of private sector
incentives rather than working against them. There are many opportunities
to further improve the efficiency of regulations, and this chapter has laid out
a number of areas where such improvements are possible.

Report to the President on the
Activities of the Council of Economic
Advisers During 2008
The Council of Economic Advisers was established by the Employment
Act of 1946 to provide the President with objective economic analysis and
advice on the development and implementation of a wide range of domestic
and international economic policy issues.

The Chairman of the Council
Edward P. Lazear continued to chair the Council during 2008. Dr. Lazear
is on a leave of absence from the Stanford Graduate School of Business where
he is the Jack Steele Parker Professor of Human Resources Management and
Economics. He also served as the Morris Arnold Cox Senior Fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
Dr. Lazear is responsible for communicating the Council’s views on
economic matters directly to the President through personal discussions and
written reports. He represents the Council at daily White House senior staff
meetings, a variety of inter-agency meetings, Cabinet meetings, and other
formal and informal meetings with the President. He also travels within
the United States and overseas to present the Administration’s views on the
economy. Dr. Lazear is the Council’s chief public spokesperson. He directs
the work of the Council and exercises ultimate responsibility for the work of
the professional staff.

The Members of the Council
Donald B. Marron was confirmed by the Senate as a Member of the
Council of Economic Advisers on June 27, 2008, was appointed by the
President on June 30, and was sworn in on July 17. While awaiting confirmation, Dr. Marron had served as Senior Economic Adviser to the Council.
Dr. Marron previously served as Deputy Director of the Congressional
Budget Office, including more than a year as its Acting Director. His earlier
government service included serving as Chief Economist at the Council
and as Executive Director and Chief Economist of the Congressional Joint
Economic Committee. At the Council Dr. Marron’s responsibilities include
work on financial markets, housing, and a variety of macroeconomic and
microeconomic policy issues.
Appendix A  |  267

Macroeconomic Policies
As is its tradition, the Council devoted much time during 2008 to assisting
the President in formulating economic policy objectives and designing
programs to implement them. In this regard the Chairman kept the President
informed, on a continuing basis, of important macroeconomic developments
and other major policy issues through regular macroeconomic briefings. The
Council prepares for the President, the Vice President, and the White House
senior staff regular memoranda that report key economic data and analyze
current economic events and financial market developments. Council staff
also regularly provides assistance with economic data and analysis to other
offices within the Executive Office of the President.
The Council, the Department of the Treasury, and the Office of Management
and Budget ­­
— the Administration’s economic “troika” ­­
— are responsible for
producing the economic forecasts that underlie the Administration’s budget
proposals. The Council, under the leadership of the Chairman and the Chief
Economist, initiates the forecasting process twice each year. In preparing
these forecasts, the Council consults with a variety of outside sources,
including leading private sector forecasters.
In 2008, the Council took part in discussions on a range of macroeconomic issues. The Council contributed significantly to discussions on the
macroeconomic impact of this year’s housing and credit market disruptions,
and provided analysis and support for the Administration’s economic growth
package and various policies to promote financial stability.
The Council works closely with the Department of the Treasury, the
Federal Reserve, and other government agencies in providing analyses to the
Administration on these topics of concern. It also works closely with the
National Economic Council, the Domestic Policy Council, the Office of
Management and Budget, and other offices within the Executive Office of the
President in assessing the economy and economic policy proposals.

International Economic Policies
The Council was involved in a range of international trade and finance
issues, with a particular focus on the determinants of the international financial crisis and related global economic slowdown. The Council was an active
participant in discussions at the global, regional, and bilateral levels. Council
members regularly met with economists and policy officials of foreign countries, finance ministers, other government officials, and members of the
private sector to discuss prevailing issues relating to the global economy.
In response to high commodity prices in 2007 and the first half of 2008, the
Council provided analysis on the causes and impact of rising crop prices on
the United States and on developing economies. The Council also examined
the effects of global biofuels policies including the U.S. ethanol mandate.
268  |  Economic Report of the President

On the international trade front, the Council provided empirical analysis
of pending free trade agreements including the Colombia, Panama, and
South Korea free trade agreements. The Council was also a participant in the
U.S. Trade Policy Review, conducted by the World Trade Organization.
The Council also prepared in-depth analyses for the President’s international itinerary, including travel to Africa, as well as the annual Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Peru.
In the area of investment and security, the Council took part in discussions
on the implementation of the Foreign Investment and National Security
Act of 2007 (FINSA), which clarified and improved the operations of the
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), including
participating in the drafting and publication of new regulations governing
CFIUS under FINSA. The Council also participated in discussions of individual cases before CFIUS.
The Council is a leading participant in the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), the principal forum for economic
cooperation among the high-income industrial economies. Senior Council
members participated in the OECD’s Economic Policy Committee (EPC)
meetings, the Economic Development Review Committee, as well as the
Working Party meetings on macroeconomic policy and coordination.

Microeconomic Policies
A wide variety of microeconomic issues received Council attention during
2008. The Council actively participated in the Cabinet-level National
Economic Council and Domestic Policy Council meetings, dealing with
issues including health care, labor, energy policy, legal reform, the environment, homeland security, education, pensions, transportation, and technology
among others.
The Council was active in the examination of health care policy related
to Medicare spending growth and reform, Health Savings Accounts, health
information technology adoption, tobacco regulation, and the promotion of
price and quality information transparency. The Council was also heavily
involved in the policy process for the two 2008 State of the Union healthcare
proposals: the Standard Deduction for Health Insurance and the Affordable

General Notes
Detail in these tables may not add to totals because of rounding.
Because of the formula used for calculating real gross domestic
product (GDP), the chained (2000) dollar estimates for the
detailed components do not add to the chained-dollar value
of GDP or to any intermediate aggregate. The Department of
Commerce (Bureau of Economic Analysis) no longer publishes
chained-dollar estimates prior to 1990, except for selected series.
Unless otherwise noted, all dollar figures are in current dollars.
Symbols used:

... Not available (also, not applicable).
Data in these tables reflect revisions made by the source agencies through December 5, 2008. In particular, tables containing
national income and product accounts (NIPA) estimates reflect
revisions released by the Department of Commerce in July 2008.

1 Consists of agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; mining; construction; and manufacturing.
2 Consists of utilities; wholesale trade; retail trade; transportation and warehousing; information; finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing;

professional and business services; educational services, health care, and social assistance; arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services;
and other services, except government.
Note.—Industry detail data for 2005 and 2006, released in January 2008, and data for 2007, released in April 2008, do not incorporate revised statistics of
the national income and product accounts that were released in July 2008. The sum of value added for all industries differs slightly from GDP in these earlier
data because value added for manufacturing included source data that were not included in GDP as reported in the national income and product accounts
(NIPAs).

Note (cont’d).—Value added is the contribution of each private industry and of government to GDP. Value added is equal to an industry’s gross output minus
its intermediate inputs. Current-dollar value added is calculated as the sum of distributions by an industry to its labor and capital, which are derived from the
components of gross domestic income.
Value added industry data shown in Tables B–12 and B–13 are based on the 1997 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). GDP by industry
data based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) are available from the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis.

1 Inventories at end of quarter. Quarter-to-quarter change calculated from this table is not the current-dollar change in private inventories component of
gross domestic product (GDP). The former is the difference between two inventory stocks, each valued at its respective end-of-quarter prices. The latter is
the change in the physical volume of inventories valued at average prices of the quarter. In addition, changes calculated from this table are at quarterly rates,
whereas change in private inventories is stated at annual rates.
2 Inventories of construction, mining, and utilities establishments are included in other industries through 1995.
3 Quarterly totals at monthly rates. Final sales of domestic business equals final sales of domestic product less gross output of general government, gross
value added of nonprofit institutions, compensation paid to domestic workers, and space rent for owner-occupied housing. Includes a small amount of final sales
by farm and by government enterprises.
Note.—The industry classification of inventories is on an establishment basis. Estimates through 1995 are based on the Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC). Beginning with 1996, estimates are based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

1 Inventories at end of quarter. Quarter-to-quarter changes calculated from this table are at quarterly rates, whereas the change in private inventories
component of gross domestic product (GDP) is stated at annual rates.
2 Inventories of construction, mining, and utilities establishments are included in other industries through 1995.
3 Quarterly totals at monthly rates. Final sales of domestic business equals final sales of domestic product less gross output of general government, gross
value added of nonprofit institutions, compensation paid to domestic workers, and space rent for owner-occupied housing. Includes a small amount of final sales
by farm and by government enterprises.
Note.—The industry classification of inventories is on an establishment basis. Estimates through 1995 are based on the Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC). Beginning with 1996, estimates are based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).
See Survey of Current Business, Tables 5.7.6A and 5.7.6B, for detailed information on calculation of the chained (2000) dollar inventory series.

1 The term “family” refers to a group of two or more persons related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. Every family must include a
reference person.
2 Current dollar median money income adjusted by consumer price index research series (CPI-U-RS).
3 Reflects implementation of Census 2000–based population controls comparable with succeeding years.
4 Reflects household sample expansion.
5 For 2004, figures are revised to reflect a correction to the weights in the 2005 Annual Social and Economic Supplement.
6 Data are for “white alone,” for “white alone or in combination,” for “black alone,” and for “black alone or in combination.” (“Black” is also “black or African
American.”) Beginning with data for 2002 the Current Population Survey allowed respondents to choose more than one race; for earlier years respondents could
report only one race group.
Note.—Poverty thresholds are updated each year to reflect changes in the consumer price index (CPI-U).

to the Current Population Survey (CPS) at http://www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#concepts for details on breaks in series.
6 Beginning in 2000, data for agricultural employment are for agricultural and related industries; data for this series and for nonagricultural employment are
not strictly comparable with data for earlier years. Because of independent seasonal adjustment for these two series, monthly data will not add to total civilian
employment.
Note.—Labor force data in Tables B–35 through B–44 are based on household interviews and relate to the calendar week including the 12th of the
month. For definitions of terms, area samples used, historical comparability of the data, comparability with other series, etc., see Employment and Earnings or
population control adjustments to the CPS at http://www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#concepts.

identified as the main race. Data for “black or African American” were for “black” prior to 2003. Data discontinued for “black and other” series. See Employment
and Earnings or concepts and methodology of the Current Population Survey (CPS) at http://www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#concepts for details.
Note.—Beginning with data for 2000, detail will not sum to total because data for all race groups are not shown here.

1 Annual data are averages of monthly not seasonally adjusted figures.
2 Unfilled orders are seasonally adjusted, end of period. Ratios are unfilled orders at end of period to shipments for period (excludes industries with no

unfilled orders). Annual ratios relate to seasonally adjusted data for December.
3 Effective in 2001, data classified based on North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Data on NAICS basis available beginning with
1992. Earlier data based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). Data on SIC basis include semiconductors. Data on NAICS basis do not include
semiconductors.
Note.—For NAICS basis data beginning with 1992, because there are no unfilled orders for manufacturers’ nondurable goods, manufacturers’ nondurable
new orders and nondurable shipments are the same (see Table B–58).

1 Consumer price index, all urban consumers.
2 CPI-U-X1 reflects a rental equivalence approach to homeowners’ costs for the CPI-U for years prior to 1983, the first year for which the official index
incorporates such a measure. CPI-U-X1 is rebased to the December 1982 value of the CPI-U (1982–84=100) and is identical with CPI-U data from December 1982
forward. Data prior to 1967 estimated by moving the series at the same rate as the CPI-U for each year.
3 Consumer price index research series (CPI-U-RS) using current methods introduced in June 1999. Data for 2008 are preliminary. All data are subject to
revision annually.
4 Chained consumer price index (C-CPI-U) introduced in August 2002. Data for 2007 and 2008 are subject to revision.

1 High bill rate at auction, issue date within period, bank-discount basis. On or after October 28, 1998, data are stop yields from uniform-price auctions.
Before that date, they are weighted average yields from multiple-price auctions.
2 Yields on the more actively traded issues adjusted to constant maturities by the Department of the Treasury. The 30-year Treasury constant maturity series
was discontinued on February 18, 2002, and reintroduced on February 9, 2006.

3 Beginning with December 7, 2001, data for corporate Aaa series are industrial bonds only.
4 Effective rate (in the primary market) on conventional mortgages, reflecting fees and charges as well as contract rate and assuming, on the average,

repayment at end of 10 years. Rates beginning with January 1973 not strictly comparable with prior rates.
5 For monthly data, high and low for the period. Prime rate for 1929–1933 and 1947–1948 are ranges of the rate in effect during the period.
6 Primary credit replaced adjustment credit as the Federal Reserve's principal discount window lending program effective January 9, 2003.
7 Since July 19, 1975, the daily effective rate is an average of the rates on a given day weighted by the volume of transactions at these rates. Prior to that
date, the daily effective rate was the rate considered most representative of the day's transactions, usually the one at which most transactions occurred.
8 From October 30, 1942 to April 24, 1946, a preferential rate of 0.50 percent was in effect for advances secured by Government securities maturing in one
year or less.

2 Data on Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) basis include transportation and public utilities. Those on North American Industry Classification System
(NAICS) basis include transporation and warehousing. Utilities classified separately in NAICS (as shown beginning 1998).
3 SIC-based industry data use the 1987 SIC for data beginning in 1987 and the 1972 SIC for prior data. NAICS-based data use 1997 NAICS.
Note.—Industry data on SIC basis and NAICS basis are not necessarily the same and are not strictly comparable.

1 In the old series, “income taxes” refers to Federal income taxes only, as State and local income taxes had already been deducted. In the new series, no
income taxes have been deducted.
2 Annual data are average equity for the year (using four end-of-quarter figures).
3 Beginning with 1988, profits before and after income taxes reflect inclusion of minority stockholders’ interest in net income before and after income taxes.
4 Data for 1992 (most significantly 1992:I) reflect the early adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 106 (Employer’s Accounting for
Post-Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions) by a large number of companies during the fourth quarter of 1992. Data for 1993 (1993:I) also reflect adoption of
Statement 106. Corporations must show the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of the year in which the change is adopted.
5 Data based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Other data shown are based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC).
Note.—Data are not necessarily comparable from one period to another due to changes in accounting principles, industry classifications, sampling
procedures, etc. For explanatory notes concerning compilation of the series, see Quarterly Financial Report for Manufacturing, Mining, and Trade Corporations,
Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census.

Note.—Farm output includes primary agricultural activities and certain secondary activities that are closely linked to agricultural production for which
information on production and input use cannot be separately observed. Secondary output (alternatively, farm-related output) includes recreation activities, the
imputed value of employer-provided housing, land rentals under the Conservation Reserve, and services such as custom machine work and custom livestock
feeding.
See Table B–100 for farm inputs.

1 End-use commodity classifications beginning 1978 and 1989 are not strictly comparable with data for earlier periods. See Survey of Current Business,
June 1988 and July 2001.
Note.—Data are on a balance of payments basis and exclude military. In June 1990, end-use categories for goods exports were redefined to include
reexports (exports of foreign goods); beginning with data for 1978, reexports are assigned to detailed end-use categories in the same manner as exports of
domestic goods.

1 Department of Defense shipments of grant-aid military supplies and equipment under the Military Assistance Program are excluded from total exports
through 1985 and included beginning 1986.
2 F.a.s. (free alongside ship) value basis at U.S. port of exportation for exports.
3 Beginning with 1989 data, exports have been adjusted for undocumented exports to Canada and are included in the appropriate end-use categories. For
prior years, only total exports include this adjustment.
4 Total includes “other” exports or imports, not shown separately.
5 Total arrivals of imported goods other than in-transit shipments.
6 Total includes revisions not reflected in detail.
7 Total exports are on a revised statistical month basis; end-use categories are on a statistical month basis.
Note.—Goods on a Census basis are adjusted to a BOP basis by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, in line with concepts and definitions used to prepare
international and national accounts. The adjustments are necessary to supplement coverage of Census data, to eliminate duplication of transactions recorded
elsewhere in international accounts, and to value transactions according to a standard definition.
Data include international trade of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Foreign Trade Zones.

1 Prior to 1991 data are for West Germany only.
2 Civilian unemployment rates, approximating U.S. concepts. Quarterly data for France, Germany, and Italy should be viewed as less precise indicators of

unemployment under U.S. concepts than the annual data.
3 There are breaks in the series for Canada (1994), France (1982 and 1990), Germany (1983, 1991, 1999, and 2005), Italy (1986, 1991, and 1993), and United
States (1990 and 1994). For details on break in series in 1990 and 1994 for United States, see footnote 5, Table B–35. For details on break in series for other
countries, see U.S. Department of Labor International Comparisons of Annual Labor Force Statistics, 10 Countries, 1960–2007, October 21, 2008.
4 Hourly compensation in manufacturing, U.S. dollar basis; data relate to all employed persons (employees and self-employed workers). For details on
