ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT

To the Congress of the United States:
Since the summer of 2000, economic growth has been unacceptably slow.
This past year the inherited trend of deteriorating growth was fed by events, the
most momentous of which was the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
The painful upshot has been the first recession in a decade. This is cause for
compassion—and for action.
Our first priority was to help those Americans who were hurt most by the
recession and the attacks on September 11. In the immediate aftermath of
the attacks, my Administration sought to stabilize our air transportation
system to keep Americans flying. Working with the Congress, we provided
assistance and aid to the affected areas in New York and Virginia. We sought
to provide a stronger safety net for displaced workers, and we will continue
these efforts. Our economic recovery plan must be based on creating jobs in
the private sector. My Administration has urged the Congress to accelerate
tax relief for working Americans to speed economic growth and create jobs.
We are engaged in a war against terrorism that places new demands on our
economy, and we must seek out every opportunity to build an economic
foundation that will support this challenge. I am confident that Americans
have proved they will rise to meet this challenge.
We must have an agenda not only for physical security, but also for
economic security. Our strategy builds upon the character of Americans:
removing economic barriers to their success, combining our workers and
their skills with new technologies, and creating an environment where
entrepreneurs and businesses large and small can grow and create jobs. Our
vision must extend beyond America, engaging other countries in the virtuous

cycle of free trade, raising the potential for global growth, and securing the gains
from worldwide markets in goods and capital. We must ensure that this effort
builds economic bonds that encompass every American.
America faces a unique moment in history: our Nation is at war, our homeland
was attacked, and our economy is in recession. In meeting these great challenges,
we must draw strength from the enduring power of free markets and a free
people. We must also look forward and work toward a stronger economy that
will buttress the United States against an uncertain world and lift the fortunes
of others worldwide.

Overview

T

he events of 2001 brought new challenges for the U.S. economy and for
economic policy. The war against terrorism has increased the demands
on our economy, and we must do everything in our power to build our
economic strength to meet these demands. At the same time, we must take
pains to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared as widely as
possible, both within and beyond our borders.
Economic growth is not an end in itself. As it raises standards of living—
consumption, in the language of economists—growth also provides resources
that may be devoted to a variety of activities beyond the traditional marketplace. Growth can fund environmental protection, the work of charitable
organizations, and many other activities of interest and value to the United
States, other industrialized economies, and developing economies alike.
These uses of our economic growth contribute to achieving the President’s
vision of “prosperity with a purpose.”

Restoring Prosperity
The economy entered 2001 growing slowly, and growth continued to
decelerate through most of the year. After expanding at an annual rate of
5.7 percent in the second quarter of 2000, gross domestic product (GDP)—
a standard measure of economy-wide production—began to falter later that
year, and the weakness persisted into 2001. Some sectors stumbled into
outright decline; for example, industrial production peaked in June 2000 and
then entered a prolonged slump. After several quarters of increasingly weak
growth, the terrorist attacks of September 11 tipped the economy into
recession, the first in 10 years.
The economic difficulties that began in 2000 and continued through
2001 should not blind us to the fact that the outlook for the economy
remains strongly positive. What matters most for long-term growth is
improvements in productivity. Productivity growth in the United States
accelerated during the second half of the 1990s, and economists generally
believe that much of that faster productivity growth is permanent. New technology deserves much of the credit—but by no means all of it. Better, more
efficient ways of doing business also contributed, and only a fraction of the
many possible improvements have yet been made. Our economic challenge
is, in large measure, to discover how to reap the benefits of the remainder.

15

The United States is unique among industrial economies in having
experienced this recent boom in productivity growth. In principle, nothing
prevents businesses in all of the world’s industrial and industrializing
economies from adopting the same technologies available here. Yet only the
United States has enjoyed an increase in sustained productivity growth since
1995. This stronger productivity performance therefore likely derives from
uniquely American advantages: notably, the strength of our institutions and
the flexibility of our business culture. Accordingly, this Report focuses on
those institutions and on that culture, and proposes strategies for improving
them and putting them to use, to sustain our growth and broaden our prosperity.
The Report begins, in Chapter 1, by reviewing the important economic
events of 2001. The chapter goes on to present the economic outlook for the
United States and to sketch an agenda for the institutions needed to speed
the Nation’s growth and enhance its economic security.

Strengthening Retirement Security
No area of American life could benefit more from enhancements to its
institutional underpinnings than retirement security, and the President has
made the reform of the Social Security system a central part of his economic
agenda. As he has stressed, “Ownership in our society should not be an
exclusive club. Independence should not be a gated community. Everyone
should be part owner in the American Dream.”
Chapter 2 of this Report examines the changing nature of retirement
security and the institutional changes needed to meet this challenge. There is
little dispute about the need for reform, and there is growing agreement that
personal accounts within the Social Security system are an indispensable part
of any reform plan. Personal accounts would enhance individual choice—the
very foundation of the success of our market economy. The current Social
Security system collects 12.4 percent of all covered wages and essentially
constrains all working Americans to place that sizable share of our wealth in
a single entity—one that demographic change is rendering increasingly
inadequate to support the system’s obligations.
Personal accounts would permit individuals to diversify their retirement
portfolios, thus increasing their retirement security. They would for the first
time acquire rights of ownership, wealth accumulation, and inheritance
within Social Security. These advantages are widely recognized. Less well
appreciated, however, is that ownership and inheritability will enhance Social
Security’s role in making our economic system more equitable. Some groups
in our society with lower average incomes also have lower life expectancies,
and as a consequence, they benefit less today from Social Security than do
other, wealthier groups. Under a system of personal accounts, the early death
of a worker would no longer mean the loss to that worker’s heirs of much of
16 | Economic Report of the President

what he or she has paid into Social Security. Instead, those assets could be
passed on to the next generation. For all these reasons, personal accounts are
an important part of reforming Social Security, and thereby of strengthening
retirement security for all Americans.

Realizing Gains from Competition
One source of the United States’ superior economic performance over the
past decade has been the success of its institutions for promoting open,
competitive markets. Strong incentives to compete are what drive firms to
exploit new opportunities, and so achieve faster growth throughout the
economy. Deregulation of several key industries during the 1970s and 1980s
brought substantial benefits to consumers and to the economy as a whole—
however, it took time for all of those benefits to be realized, and this counsels
patience in evaluating more recent deregulation initiatives in, for example,
electricity markets.
The task of competition policy—as detailed in Chapter 3 of this Report—
is to promote competition in a way that ensures the efficient allocation of
resources and serves the interests of consumers. In doing so, however, competition policy must walk a fine line: efforts to prevent anticompetitive changes
in the behavior and organization of firms may inadvertently keep firms from
taking steps that could lower their costs or improve their products. Such
ill-advised interventions would ultimately harm consumers rather than
benefit them.
The recent past has witnessed a remarkable shift in the competitive
landscape. Mergers and acquisitions have reshaped and continue to reshape
the organization of firms and the nature of competition itself. Our competition policy must be flexible enough to acknowledge and support the quest
for efficiency that drives these changes, while remaining vigilant against
efforts to restrain competition. To fail in this task would be to hinder the
growth of innovative firms, the adoption of new technology, and the
enhancement of productivity.
The markets in which American firms compete today are increasingly
global markets, and globalization motivates further changes in firms’ organization. Our competition policy should acknowledge and reflect these
motivations. But other countries have their own competition policies, and
inefficient policies in any one of them may impose costs on firms and
consumers in the United States and around the world. The United States
should therefore pursue the harmonization of national competition policies—but should do so in a way that spreads best-practice, efficient
competition policy worldwide.

Overview

| 17

Finally, competition policy must also deal with the increased importance
of “dynamic competition,” in which firms compete not just for increments of
market share but for absolute (if temporary) market dominance, through
rapid innovation. Policies should recognize that, at any given moment, high
profits and substantial market share—indicators that might warrant concern
about competition in some industries—need not preclude vigorous dynamic
competition among firms in industries undergoing rapid technical change.

Promoting Health Care Quality and Access
Health care is one of the largest and most vibrant sectors of the economy.
Biomedical research, both public and private, has generated stunning
advances in our understanding of biology and disease and achieved major
therapeutic discoveries. As a result, Americans today are living longer lives
with less disability. However, the health care delivery system today is troubled, as medical expenditures are again rising rapidly. The costs of private
health insurance to working Americans and the costs to taxpayers of government health programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, are increasing at
rates far surpassing the growth of the economy. Managed care is under fire
from patients and physicians alike. With the economic slowdown and rising
costs, concerns about the growing number of uninsured are again coming
to the fore.
Much of the discussion about Federal policies to address these concerns
has been framed through a narrow lens that focuses on “guarantees” for
access and treatment, to be achieved largely through expanding government
programs that rely on regulation and price setting. Yet this approach does not
ensure access to innovative care that meets the diverse needs of patients in
an efficient way.
Chapter 4 of this Report explores an alternative framework, one that
focuses on achieving better health care through solutions that emphasize
both shared American values and sensible economics. These solutions build
on existing support; they encourage flexible, innovative, and broadly available health care coverage; they emphasize the central role of the patient in
making health care decisions; and they improve those decisions by creating
an environment for medical practice that encourages steps to improve quality
and reduce costs. This approach emphasizes patient-centered health care,
with individual control and individual responsibility.
If we move toward a system of informed choice and well-crafted economic
incentives, and away from rigid regulation, the health care system will benefit
from the resulting flexibility and competition. In this vision, government
support would be used to broaden access and to encourage competition in
both the private and the public sectors. Support should be targeted to
improving the health care of those most in need: the uninsured and those
18 | Economic Report of the President

with significant health expenses. New incentives should strengthen the
market by improving information about quality and cost, broadening choice,
rewarding quality, and addressing costs by encouraging value purchasing by
both employers and patients.
The Administration’s emphasis on patient-centered health care reform
centers on three objectives. First, we must develop flexible, market-based
approaches to providing health care coverage for all Americans. Second, we
must support health care providers in their efforts to meet the demand for
higher quality and value, in part by making better information available
about providers, options, outcomes, and costs. And finally, we must provide
the foundation for further innovation through strong support for biomedical
research. Providing competitive choices for all Americans, and meaningful
individual participation in those choices, will encourage innovation in health
care delivery and coverage. Improving incentives and information, and
taking steps to help patients and providers use information effectively, will
help ensure continued improvements in the health of Americans in the future.

Redesigning Federalism for the 21st Century
Throughout its history the United States has relied heavily on State and
local governments to provide certain goods and services. Our federal system
has been a source of greater efficiency and of innovation in government practice. History reveals several tensions as well, most vividly evidenced by
Washington’s all-too-frequent practice of providing funds to State and local
governments without allowing flexibility in their use. As discussed in
Chapter 5 of this Report, this tension between flexibility and control can be
resolved efficiently by specifying standards for outcomes but leaving it to
State and local providers to determine how best to achieve those outcomes.
Focusing on outcome standards and flexibility to improve efficiency can
also imply a role for the private sector in providing public services. The
choice of where to draw the line between the public and the private sector
depends on the characteristics of the services to be provided. The nature of
some services makes it difficult for markets to meet the needs of the population effectively. Even then, it may be efficient to rely on the private sector to
produce the service, but to let State and local governments decide what and
how much shall be provided.
Chapter 5 of this Report discusses the principles underlying the roles of
differing levels of government, and of for-profit firms and not-for-profit
organizations, in identifying and meeting needs for public goods and
services. Specifically, the chapter shows how allowing public and private
organizations to compete in meeting preset standards can improve the
efficiency of programs in education, welfare, and health insurance for
needy populations.

In education, evidence supports the benefits of competition in improving
quality, with public, private, and charter schools vying with each other to
provide the best education most efficiently. When the right institutions are in
place, school systems can be held accountable for results. Similarly, the
providers of safety net benefits—such as welfare and Medicaid—must be
accountable to taxpayers for the quality of services they provide and the
resources they use to provide them. By tying payments to these providers to
results, and by allowing private nonprofit providers to compete with them on
an equal footing, the market discipline that yields innovation and efficiency
in the private sector can be brought to bear in the public sector as well.

Building Institutions for a Better Environment
Not so long ago, environmental protection and market-based economic
growth were widely regarded as fundamentally in conflict. The past 30 years,
however, have seen dramatic improvements in environmental quality go
hand in hand with robust growth in GDP. Releases of many toxic substances
have been reduced, and many of our natural resources are better protected.
Rivers are cleaner and the air is clearer.
In many of these early environmental interventions, the anticipated
benefits were clear, large, and achievable at relatively low cost. The next
generation of environmental issues, however, is certain to be more challenging. Ongoing efforts to protect endangered species, maintain
biodiversity, and preserve ecosystems will require tradeoffs between the
welfare interests of current and future generations. But those early initiatives
also taught us that the costs of environmental protection can be minimized
through careful policy design. Part of the challenge for environmental protection today is to identify the best institutions to address each of an array of
stubborn environmental problems. Another part is to design those institutions so that they can evolve to address new problems in the future.
Chapter 6 of this Report describes how flexible, market-based approaches
to environmental protection—using tradable permits, tradable performance
standards, and similar mechanisms for a fixed overall standard—allow
businesses to pursue established performance goals or emission limits in the
manner they find most efficient. The chapter documents, through several
case studies, that such an approach can often achieve equal or greater environmental benefits at lower cost than one based on inflexible government
mandates. The chapter concludes by illustrating how—and how not—to
apply this experience with flexible mechanisms to the long-term challenge of
global climate change.

Supporting Global Economic Integration
The final chapter of this Report examines our institutions for international
trade and finance. International flows of goods, services, capital, and people
have played an increasingly important role in the world economy, raising the
standard of living in the United States and around the world. These gains
from international interaction stem from an improved allocation of
resources. A more efficient global allocation of productive inputs such as
capital and labor translates into higher global output and consumption.
Today, however, signs of a slowing global economy, and threats to the
freedom that is part and parcel of a well-functioning economic system, make
it more important than ever to rededicate ourselves to the free exchange of
goods, services, and capital across borders.
It is therefore critical that the United States continue to lead the world in
the liberalization of trade. The restoration of the President’s Trade Promotion
Authority (TPA) will provide the Administration the flexibility and the
bargaining power to promote this liberalization most effectively. By streamlining the system for approving trade agreements, TPA will allow the United
States to keep pace with our trading partners in the timely adoption of
trade liberalization.
The United States must also continue to encourage efforts to strengthen
the international financial architecture. A stronger global financial system is
needed to support the cross-border flows of capital that are vital to increasing
world output. The Administration is taking the lead in the debate over principles for reform of international lending by the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank. In addition, the Administration is seeking to shift
the multilateral development banks’ emphasis toward grants for low-income
countries: this is consistent with continued efforts to make these institutions
more efficient and more focused on growth in living standards in developing
countries. U.S. leadership in this area is essential to safeguarding and enhancing
both our own economic prospects and those of the rest of the world.

Conclusion
The past year has shown that we cannot be complacent about America’s
rate of economic growth, gains in productivity, and successes in global
markets. Nor can we afford to be parochial. We seek growth and prosperity
for the whole world, and we will achieve it by wise economic policy and
farsighted institutional reform.

Restoring Prosperity

O

ver the past two decades, the Nation has witnessed an impressive increase
in prosperity. Over 35 million jobs were created, and real income nearly
doubled, producing an unprecedented standard of living. This economic
success also serves as an example of what an open, free market economy—one
that relies on the private sector as the engine of growth—can achieve.
A hallmark of the economy has been its ability to weather adverse
economic developments in a flexible and resilient manner. This is not an
accident but rather a characteristic of an economic system that relies on
market forces to determine adjustments in economic activity. But such an
economy, even in the presence of sound fiscal and monetary policies, is not
immune to business cycles. Economic activity in 2001 is an example of how
a series of adverse developments can cause setbacks on the road to greater
prosperity. The last year also highlighted the value of continued efforts to
strengthen the policy environment in a way that allows the private sector
both to recover more quickly and flourish more strongly in the future.

Macroeconomic Performance in 2001:
Softer Economy, Harder Choices
U.S. economic growth continued to decelerate during 2001. It was
apparent early in the year that policymakers would face considerable challenges as the rate of growth slowed from the rapid rates of past years. The
momentum placing downward pressure on economic activity appeared to
subside by midsummer, however, by which time growth of real gross
domestic product (GDP) had come to a virtual standstill. Economic conditions showed some tentative signs of firming, and growth prospects were
brightening. All that changed on September 11. The President, Congress,
and other policymakers responded decisively to the damage and disruptions
caused by the terrorist attacks, while continuing to work to strengthen the
long-run economic fundamentals.

Aggregate Demand During the First Three Quarters
The deceleration of real GDP in 2001 continued a slowdown in economic
activity that had begun the previous year (Chart 1-1). Real GDP growth over
the first three quarters remained barely positive, at 0.1 percent on an annualized basis; however, the economy steadily weakened through this period,
23

ending with a 1.3 percent annualized contraction in real GDP in the third
quarter. Although several key components of aggregate demand rose
moderately, overall growth was dragged down by unusually weak investment
spending. Preliminary evidence indicates a further decline in the fourth
quarter due to weaker economic conditions—especially during the early
months of the quarter—in the aftermath of the September terrorist attacks.
This assessment, however, may be subject to large revision because of the
limitations of existing statistical sources (Box 1-1).

Box 1-1. Better Tools: Improving the Accuracy and Timeliness of
Economic Statistics
Economic statistics are valuable tools that economists, policymakers, business leaders, and individual investors use to increase our
understanding of the economy. The Bureau of Economic Analysis, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Bureau of the Census, the Federal
Reserve, and other departments and agencies combine thousands of
bits of information from market transactions, consumer and business
surveys, and numerous other sources to produce scores of economic
estimates every month.

24 | Economic Report of the President

Box 1-1.—continued
The ability of government, consumers, workers, and businesses to
make appropriate decisions about work, investments, taxes, and a host
of other important issues depends critically on the relevance, accuracy,
and timeliness of economic statistics. At turning points in the economy,
such as those marking the beginning or the end of an economic slowdown, the accuracy and timeliness of data are especially critical,
because at these times fiscal and monetary policy can be most useful
in steering the economy.
Recent economic events have emphasized the importance of timely
economic information. Thus one area deserving considerable attention
is the need for readily accessible real-time data. Investment in sources
of these data could yield handsome dividends, especially at key junctures
in the business cycle.
Moreover, the quality of existing statistics is far from perfect and
could be enhanced with further investment. Even real GDP generally
,
thought of as a reliable measure of overall activity in the U.S. economy,
is susceptible to considerable revisions. For example, in the third
quarter of 2000, real GDP was first estimated to have grown 2.7 percent
at an annual rate—a subpar but respectable growth rate. That rate was
then revised downward to 2.4 percent and then again to 2.2 percent.
Seven months later it was further revised downward to 1.3 percent,
providing evidence that the economy had begun to slow dramatically
at that time. A key component of the revision came from revised data
on gross private domestic investment, initially estimated to have risen
3.2 percent but later revised to show a contraction of 2.8 percent. Such
revisions lead to uncertainty for both government and private decisionmakers, which can cause costly delays. Although most revisions
are not that large, the average quarterly revision of real GDP growth
over 1978-98 was about 1.4 percentage points in either direction, while
real GDP growth averaged 2.9 percent.
In addition to these problems with large revisions, the national
accounts statistics are beset by some growing inconsistencies. Gross
domestic product, the sum of final expenditures for goods and services
produced by the U.S. economy, and gross domestic income, the sum
of the costs incurred and income received in the production of those
goods and services, are theoretically equal. Because of statistical
discrepancies, there has always been some divergence between these
two reported numbers. However, this discrepancy has been growing
lately, raising concerns among policy experts and business leaders as
well as among the producers of the data themselves. These differing
estimates can lead to different readings of such critical indicators as
output and productivity growth.
continued on next page...

Chapter 1

| 25

Box 1-1.—continued
A number of steps can be taken to improve the accuracy and
timeliness of economic statistics. In particular, targeted improvements
to the source data for the national accounts would go a long way
toward illuminating the causes of the growing statistical discrepancy.
Another cost-effective measure would be to ease the current restrictions on the sharing of confidential statistical data among Federal
statistical agencies. Such data sharing, which would be done solely for
statistical purposes, is currently hindered by lack of a uniform confidentiality policy. Confidentiality is of key importance to all agencies
and to the individuals and businesses who participate in Federal
surveys, but a uniform confidentiality policy would allow agencies
such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, and the Bureau of the Census to cost-effectively compare
and improve the quality of their published statistics while preserving
confidentiality. In the past, attempts have been made to pass legislation, together with a conforming bill to modify the Internal Revenue
Code, allowing such data sharing under carefully crafted agreements
between or among statistical agencies. In 1999 such legislation passed
the House but stalled in the Senate. The Administration will continue to
seek passage of data sharing legislation to improve the quality and
effectiveness of Federal statistical programs.
In addition to data sharing legislation, the Administration is
proposing new and continued funding for the development of better
and more timely measures to reflect recent changes in the economy.
For example, these resources would allow for tracking the effects of the
growth in e-commerce, software, and other key services, and for developing better estimates of employee compensation. The latter are
increasingly important given the expansion in the use of stock options
as a form of executive compensation, as well as for tracking the
creation and dissolution of businesses, given the importance of business turnover in a constantly evolving economy. Improved
quality-adjusted price indexes for high-technology products are also an
important area for future research. The direct contribution of these
products accounted for nearly a third of the 3.8 percent average annual
growth rate in real GDP during 1995-2000, but current estimating techniques fail to capture productivity growth in high technology-using
service industries. This shortcoming may lead to underestimates of
annual productivity growth of 0.2 to 0.4 percentage point or more. As
the economy continues to change and grow, the need persists to create
and develop such new measures, to provide decisionmakers with
better tools with which to track the economy as accurately as possible.

26 | Economic Report of the President

Consumption
Personal consumption expenditures grew 2.8 percent at an annual rate in
the first half of 2001, followed by a 1.0 percent increase in the third quarter
(Chart 1-2). Consumption growth in the first three quarters was 2.2
percent—notably slower than the 4.8 percent rate of the previous 3 years.
Spending for all types of consumption slowed in 2001. Growth in
spending on nondurable goods declined to a 1.1 percent annual rate through
the third quarter, from a 4.5 percent rate in 1998-2000. The sharp decline in
nondurable consumption is somewhat surprising, because swings in this
category of consumption tend to be more muted than those in overall
consumption. Consumption of food and of clothing and shoes decelerated
sharply, in a significant deviation from recent trends. The Bureau of
Economic Analysis estimates that food consumption edged down 0.4 percent
in the first three quarters of 2001, after averaging 3.8 percent growth in the
previous 3 years; clothing and shoes consumption rose 1.9 percent after
averaging nearly 7 percent growth in 1998-2000. Energy consumption
continued to be weak, reflecting higher energy prices early in the year.
Growth in durable goods spending also subsided, but remained relatively
strong, in the first three quarters of 2001: purchases rose 6.1 percent at an
annual rate compared with 9.7 percent on average in 1998-2000. This recent
strength has been atypical because, during most economic downturns,

Chapter 1

| 27

durable goods spending tends to slow more sharply than nondurable goods
spending. Part of the explanation is that two key durable goods industries
have proved more resilient to the slowdown than in the past. Furniture and
household equipment grew robustly, as the housing sector stayed healthy in
2001. And although growth in sales of motor vehicles and parts was anemic
early in the year, these sales remained remarkably high for a period of such
marked slowing in overall activity.
Finally, consumption of services—the least cyclical component of
consumption—grew at a 1.9 percent annual rate in the first three quarters of
2001, down from a 4.0 percent rate over 1998-2000. Medical care spending,
however, continued its strong upward trend.
These patterns in consumption spending—which constitutes two-thirds of
GDP—reflected several key economic crosscurrents. On the downside, the
decline in equity markets and the deterioration in labor markets (discussed
below) reduced wealth and consumer confidence. On the upside, housing
prices continued to climb, rising at roughly an 8 percent annual rate. In addition, lower mortgage interest rates sparked the strongest wave of home
refinancing ever, transforming housing equity into more liquid forms of
wealth. Refinancing is estimated to have increased household liquidity (from
increased cash flow and cashouts) by about $80 billion during the year. In
addition, real disposable personal income, aided somewhat by provisions of
the President’s tax cut—reduced withholding and the payment of rebates for
the new 10 percent personal income tax bracket—rose at a solid 4.5 percent
annual rate during the first three quarters.

Investment Spending
Real gross private domestic investment fell at a double-digit annual rate
(roughly 12 percent) in each of the first two quarters of 2001—the steepest
decline in investment spending in a decade (Chart 1-3). The year began with
a sizable inventory liquidation, which accounted for most of the decline
in gross private domestic investment in the first quarter and subtracted
2.6 percentage points from the growth rate of real GDP. Inventory reduction
remained a drag on GDP growth in subsequent quarters, with manufacturing industries shedding inventories at a faster pace than wholesalers and
retailers. By the end of the third quarter, the inventory-to-sales ratio had
returned to a level close to the average over the previous 3 years, indicating
that the downward phase of the inventory cycle may soon be ending.
Nonresidential business fixed investment contracted sharply in 2001, in
stark contrast to the investment boom from 1995 to early 2000. In the first
quarter this category of investment fell at only a 0.2 percent annual rate—the
first decline in 9 years. In the second quarter, however, it fell at a 14.6 percent
annual rate, with declines in investment in structures and in equipment
28 | Economic Report of the President

and software of 12.3 percent and 15.4 percent, respectively. Investment in
information processing equipment and software alone fell at a 19.5 percent
rate in the second quarter. The widespread decline in business fixed investment continued in the third quarter with an 8.5 percent contraction,
combining a 7.6 percent drop in structures investment with an 8.8 percent
decline in equipment and software spending. Capital spending on computers
and peripherals during the second and third quarters was hit particularly
hard, plunging at a 28.6 percent rate.
The housing sector was a bright spot in 2001. Lower mortgage rates and
rising real income helped to support rising residential investment in each of
the first three quarters; growth for the period averaged 5.6 percent at an
annual rate. Investment in single-family structures rose 6.0 percent, after
declining during most of 2000. Investment spending on multifamily structures rose briskly at a 15.3 percent rate. Investment in residential building
improvements increased at a 3.2 percent rate.

Government Spending
Government spending—Federal, State, and local levels combined—added
to economic activity over the first three quarters of the year. Federal
Government spending increased at a 2.9 percent annual rate during this

Chapter 1

| 29

period. In contrast, Federal spending in 2000 fell by 1.4 percent, and over
1995-2000 it grew at only a 0.1 percent average rate. Last year’s increase was
driven by national defense expenditure, which rose 4.4 percent through the
first three quarters. Defense spending on research and development as well
as personnel support accounted for most of the increase. Nondefense
expenditure grew only 0.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2001.
State and local government spending increased 3.8 percent at an annual
rate in the first three quarters. State and local spending has increased steadily
over the past decade, averaging 2.8 percent annual growth from 1990 to
2000 and 3.2 percent from 1995 to 2000. Investment by State and local
governments rose much faster (4.6 percent a year on average) than their
consumption (2.8 percent) during 1995-2000. However, consumption
expenditure accounts for 80 percent of State and local spending.

Net Exports
Net exports exerted a smaller drag on economic activity in 2001 than in
2000. Both imports and exports fell significantly during the year, but the
drop in imports was larger. Real exports of goods and services, measured at
an annual rate, declined $95.3 billion through the third quarter, mostly
because of a decline in exports of capital goods—especially high-technology
goods—as a result of the global economic slowdown (discussed further
below). Over the same period, real imports declined $105.3 billion. Real
imports of services suffered one of the largest declines on record in the third
quarter, largely because international travel was disrupted in September.
Overall, net exports contributed 0.1 percentage point to real GDP growth
in the first three quarters of the year. By comparison, in 2000 net exports
depressed real GDP growth by 0.8 percentage point.

Preliminary Evidence on Aggregate Demand in the
Fourth Quarter
The terrorist attacks of September 11 changed the direction of the macroeconomy. Before the attacks, the economy had been showing tentative signs
of stabilizing after its long deceleration, and many forecasters expected real
GDP growth to accelerate in the third and fourth quarters of 2001.
Immediately after the attacks, however, the economy turned down because of
the direct effect of the assault on the Nation’s economic and financial
infrastructure and because of the indirect, but more significant, effect on
consumer and business confidence. The drop was sufficient to turn the
sluggish period of economic activity into a recession.
The disruptions to lower Manhattan’s telecommunications and trading
facilities temporarily interfered with the normal operations of key components
30 | Economic Report of the President

of the Nation’s financial center and caused dislocations in the Nation’s
payment system, which processes trillions of dollars in transactions on a
typical business day. Equity markets shut down temporarily, and when they
reopened a week later, the value of shares fell by $500 billion. Money
markets and foreign exchange markets continued to function during this
period but faced considerable difficulties.
In the New York City area, the closure of much of lower Manhattan
weakened economic activity, especially employment, and had serious consequences for local businesses that depend on sales from that part of the city.
The local tourism and business travel industries also sagged. The attack on
the Pentagon had less of a direct effect on the private sector because of the
limited destruction of private infrastructure. Nonetheless, economic activity
in the Washington, D.C., area slumped, primarily because of the need to
temporarily close Reagan National Airport for national security reasons.
Local businesses, such as hotels and restaurants, that provide ancillary
services for travelers were hit particularly hard. As in the New York City area,
small businesses were especially affected, because many operate from only
one business location, whereas large businesses with operations throughout
the country are often better able to weather local dislocations.
The terrorist attacks also had a significant macroeconomic effect. The
Nation’s airspace was shut down for several days after the attacks, halting
passenger travel and deliveries of airfreight. In addition, cross-border ground
shipping was delayed because of increased security measures. Businesses that
rely on highly synchronized deliveries of inputs were forced to slow down
their assembly lines, and in some cases close plants, creating disruptions up
and down the stream of production.
Beyond the initial impacts, the attacks continued to have a significant
negative effect on the economy as uncertainty about the future led to a steep
decline in consumer and business spending. Consumers retrenched as they
mourned the loss of life and reevaluated the risks inherent in even the most
mundane activities, such as shopping at malls and traveling by air.
Meanwhile businesses adopted a more pessimistic outlook about the
prospects for a speedy recovery. The underlying psychology was affected
again in October, by the discovery of anthrax spores delivered through the
mail distribution system, although the direct macroeconomic effects of this
attack have been fairly limited.
Preliminary evidence indicates that economic activity at the beginning of
the fourth quarter of 2001 suffered a pronounced decline. The industrial
sector contracted at a faster pace in October than earlier in the year, and job
losses mounted. By November, however, some tentative signs had emerged
that business conditions were deteriorating at a slower pace. For example, the
decline in industrial production was milder, and nondefense capital goods
Chapter 1

| 31

spending appeared to have bottomed out, with new orders recovering from
the trough in September. Construction spending also performed well, as
weather in the fall was unseasonably warm. By December the manufacturing
sector, which had been particularly hard hit in 2001, witnessed increases in
the length of the average workweek and in factory overtime. Meanwhile the
Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) of the Institute for Supply Management
(formerly the National Association of Purchasing Management) rebounded
sharply, with a jump to 48.2 in December from 39.8 in October. The
production component of the PMI rose to 50.6 from 40.9 in October; the
new orders index surged to end the year at 54.9. Moreover, industrial
production in December was nearly unchanged after several months of
sizable declines.
Despite the initial dropoff in consumer confidence after the terrorist
attacks, consumer spending bounced back within the quarter from its
September plunge. Real personal consumption expenditures on durable
goods, nondurable goods, and services rose considerably in October and
November. Purchases of automobiles and light trucks contributed substantially to the rebound, as consumers responded favorably to the incentive
programs offered by manufacturers and dealers, such as zero-percent
financing and rebates. Automobile and light truck sales surged to a record
21 million units at an annual rate in October, then moderated to something
closer to the average 17-million-unit selling pace of the first three quarters.
Even though nominal retail sales of goods excluding motor vehicles edged
down in November and December, falling prices for energy and consumer
goods suggest that real consumption spending continued to rise.
The performance of financial markets confirmed the view that economic
conditions were firming in the fourth quarter. Stock market prices
rebounded from a sharp decline after September 11 (Chart 1-4). The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Index had returned to its preSeptember 11 level by mid-October, and it ended the year near 1150, up 19
percent from its post-September 11 low. Other market indexes such as the
Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Wilshire 5000 rose in a similar
pattern. In addition, credit markets were active in providing funds to businesses. Low interest rates made bond financing attractive, especially for
investment grade issuers. Lending by commercial banks for real estate and
consumer purchases was rising and generally higher in the fourth quarter
than earlier in the year. Commercial and industrial lending, in contrast, was
lower in the quarter than earlier. According to the Federal Reserve, banks
tightened credit standards and terms on commercial and industrial loans by
late summer and early autumn. The tightening of non-price-related loan
terms was especially apparent for small firms.

32 | Economic Report of the President

Labor Markets
Private nonfarm payrolls dropped by roughly 1.5 million in 2001,
reflecting the weak economy. The bulk of the decline occurred in manufacturing, especially in durable goods-producing industries, where over 1
million jobs were shed after December 2000. In addition, employment in
help supply services, which provide labor to other industries, fell by about
550,000 jobs. Job losses in manufacturing and help supply services were
offset in part by increases in some other service industries during the year.
The health services industry logged strong increases in 2001. In recent
months, service employment has been hurt by cutbacks in business travel
and tourism, which have adversely affected employment in air transportation
and travel-related services such as travel agencies, hotels, and amusements
and entertainment.
Labor markets became substantially less tight in 2001. The total
unemployment rate rose from 4.0 percent in December 2000 to 5.8 percent
a year later, still below the average rate for the past 20 years of 6.2 percent.
The average duration of unemployment rose by 2 weeks during 2001,
ending the year at 14.5 weeks. More than half of this increase occurred in the
last 3 months of 2001.
Chapter 1

| 33

Every region saw its unemployment rate rise, as the slowdown in economic
activity was national in scope. The Mountain States experienced the largest
increase, 1.8 percentage points. The smallest increase occurred in the West
North Central States; this region had one of the lowest unemployment rates
in the country at the end of 2000.
The labor force participation rate (the share of the working-age population
either working or seeking work) fell 0.4 percentage point over the year. Labor
force participation has hovered near 67 percent since 1997, after rising from
near 60 percent in 1970. The average number of discouraged and displaced
workers has risen nearly 30 percent since the beginning of 2001 but remains
below the average for the past 5 years.

Inflation
Inflation remained low and stable in 2001. The consumer price index
(CPI) rose only 1.6 percent during the 12 months ending in December.
Consumer energy prices for fuel oil, electricity, natural gas, and gasoline
tumbled 13.0 percent, reflecting a collapse in crude oil and in wellhead
natural gas prices. In contrast, energy price inflation a year ago was 14.2
percent. Food prices rose 2.8 percent, the same rate as a year ago. The CPI
excluding the volatile food and energy components—often referred to as the
core CPI—posted another year of stable inflation. Core inflation was 2.7
percent, up somewhat from its 2.3 percent average rate over the past 4 years.
The absence of price pressures in the production pipeline helped hold
consumer price increases in check. The producer price index (PPI) for
finished goods fell 1.8 percent in the 12 months ending in December. At the
start of the year, producer prices had been rising rapidly, largely reflecting
rising energy prices; but PPI inflation fell all year long as energy prices
slumped and economic activity weakened. Excluding the volatile energy and
food components, the PPI for finished goods rose 0.7 percent during 2001.
PPI inflation for intermediate and crude materials declined throughout the
year, sometimes experiencing periods of steep price declines.

Productivity and Employment Costs
Despite the economic slowdown, nonfarm business labor productivity
grew at a 1.2 percent annual rate during the first three quarters of the
year. Although below the 2.4 percent average rate recorded during 19952000, productivity growth has been remarkably strong for this stage of the
business cycle. During previous postwar recessions, productivity growth averaged 0.8 percent.
Manufacturing productivity, in contrast, edged down at a 0.2 percent
annual rate for the first three quarters of the year, compared with a 0.6 percent
34 | Economic Report of the President

decline in the 1990-91 recession. The 2001 figure represents the first
decrease in manufacturing productivity in the past 8 years, and it reflects the
pronounced slump in the industrial sector that began in mid-2000. A sharp
deceleration in durable manufacturing productivity from a nearly 7 percent
rate of growth in 2000 to a 0.8 percent rate of decline during the first three
quarters of 2001 accounted for much of the change. Nondurable manufacturing productivity grew at only a 0.1 percent rate over the first three
quarters of 2001.
Employment costs rose at a slower rate in 2001 than in 2000. Total wages
and salaries for private workers as measured by the employment cost index
(ECI) rose 3.7 percent at an annual rate through the first three quarters
of 2001—slightly less than the 3.9 percent increase in 2000. The total cost
of benefits for private industry workers increased at a 5.1 percent rate
through September 2001, down from a 5.7 percent increase in 2000. The
ECI for manufacturing rose 3.3 percent, combining a 3.8 percent rise in
wages and salary with a 2.7 percent increase in benefit costs. This slowdown
in the rate of employment cost increases should help to moderate future
inflationary pressure.

Saving and Investment
National saving, which comprises private saving and government saving,
fell in 2001. As a share of gross national product, national saving edged down
to 17.2 percent during the first three quarters of 2001 from 17.9 percent in
2000. Shrinking Federal Government saving accounted for most of the
decline, as the economic slowdown reduced revenue and caused some types
of automatic expenditure to rise. The personal saving rate (personal saving as
a share of disposable income) averaged 2 percent in the first three quarters of
2001, up from 1 percent in 2000. Part of the increase was due to the downpayment on the President’s tax cut, which was sent out in the form of
“rebate” checks in July through September. Although the personal saving rate
rose in the third quarter, Federal Government saving declined, the natural
consequence of returning surpluses to taxpayers.
As the current account deficit shrank with the slowing economy, net
foreign investment flows slowed in 2001. As a result, despite the decline in
the national saving rate, domestic sources of saving funded a larger share of
domestic investment. Over the previous 3 years, net foreign investment had
been growing by roughly $100 billion a year. After reaching a peak of just
over $450 billion in 2000, net foreign investment fell steadily in 2001, its first
decline since 1997. By the third quarter, net foreign investment had dropped
to $355 billion, although this was exaggerated somewhat by the one-time
insurance payment of roughly $40 billion (at an annual rate) from foreign
sources on claims (recorded on an accrual basis) related to the terrorist attacks.

National saving and investment are key to our long-run prosperity, and the
President’s 2001 fiscal initiatives improved incentives for private saving and
investment. Because budget resources ultimately depend on the health of the
economy as a whole, this approach serves as the best way to enhance budget
surpluses over the long run.
In June the President signed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA, described in more detail later in this chapter),
which removes impediments to private saving by expanding contribution
limits for Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), 401(k) plans, and education savings accounts. Education savings accounts raise incentives not only to
save for education, but also to improve the quality and productivity of the
Nation’s work force in the future. Other provisions of the act, such as lower
marginal tax rates, a reduced marriage penalty, and elimination of the estate
tax, provide strong incentives to work, save, and invest. Another important
initiative is the President’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security, which
in December issued its final report on meaningful reform options to
strengthen the Social Security system and improve the ability of individuals
to accumulate and pass along wealth.

The Cyclical Slowdown
Several factors contributed to the deceleration in economic activity during
2000 and 2001 from its very high levels in the preceding years: the decline in
stock market wealth, the spike in energy prices, an increase in interest rates,
the collapse of the high-technology sector, and the lingering effects of preparations against the year-2000 (Y2K) computer bug. With this backdrop
setting the stage for sluggish growth, the economic aftermath of the terrorist
attacks in September and the subsequent precipitous decline in consumer
and business confidence late in 2001 were sufficient to tip the Nation into its
seventh recession since 1960.

Moderation After Very Rapid Growth
The strong growth recorded from 1995 through 1999 was a welcome and
beneficial development, as the private sector reaped the rewards from its
investments in high technology. In particular, the productivity gains offered
by the more intensive use of computers, fiber optic technologies, and the
Internet drove an investment boom in which the Nation’s businesses retooled
and upgraded their workplaces for the 21st century. Not surprisingly, the
rapid pace of investment then slowed as the need to adopt the new technologies began to be satisfied and a more mature investment phase began.
Although the transition to a more moderate growth rate could in principle
36 | Economic Report of the President

have been smooth, in practice additional economic developments created
swings in investment spending that contributed to the significant slowing of
economic activity.

Decline in Equity Values
The decline in equity values starting in early 2000 also helped slow
economic activity by dampening both consumption and business fixed
investment spending. Equity in businesses (both in corporations and in
noncorporate businesses) fell from its peak of $17.5 trillion in the first
quarter of 2000 to just under $13 trillion in the third quarter of 2001,
according to the latest quarterly estimate from the Federal Reserve’s flow of
funds accounts. Various studies suggest that every one-dollar decline in
stock market wealth ultimately reduces annual consumption spending by
3 to 4 cents. Thus the observed $4.5 trillion decline in wealth could be
expected to reduce consumption by $135 billion to $180 billion, or roughly
1 to 2 percentage points of GDP. Downward pressure from the equity
decline may continue to affect consumption spending into 2002, because a
drop in wealth typically has lagged effects for 1 to 2 years. Offsetting some of
the decline in equity wealth, however, has been a continued increase in
housing wealth. From the start of 2000 to the middle of 2001, housing
prices rose at a steady 9 percent annual pace, increasing housing wealth by
$1.7 trillion.
The effect of the decline in equity prices on investment demand was both
direct and indirect. Lower equity prices reduced investment spending directly
by raising the cost of capital for corporations, and indirectly by causing
growth in aggregate demand for final goods and services to wane.

Surge in Energy Prices
Energy prices surged in 1999 and 2000, reaching extremely high levels at
the start of 2001. Oil prices rose dramatically from $12.00 a barrel to peak in
November 2000 at $34.40 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate crude, its
highest monthly average price since October 1990. Even more dramatic was
the spike in natural gas prices, to the highest price on record, $8.95 per
million Btu in December 2000. This was more than 3½ times the average
price over the preceding 6 years. These developments in energy prices had
important ramifications for 2001. Personal disposable income available for
goods and services other than energy fell as gasoline, heating, and electricity
prices soared. Producers of nonenergy goods and services also suffered as
their costs of production rose—especially in the energy-intensive manufacturing sector. The decline in demand and the rise in input costs squeezed
profit margins, slowing corporate cash flow and reinforcing the downdraft on
stock market values and capital spending plans.
Chapter 1

| 37

Higher Interest Rates
Higher interest rates in 2000 and early 2001 also contributed to the deceleration in activity. The 10-year Treasury yield peaked at 6.7 percent in
January 2000, and the 10-year corporate Baa yield hit 8.9 percent in May.
Short-term interest rates rose consistently for a full year before reaching
6.2 percent in November 2000. The higher interest rate environment slowed
economic activity as consumers were given the incentive to consume less, and
investment in plant and equipment became less attractive.

Collapse of the High-Technology Sector
The collapse of stock prices in the high-technology sector—especially the
dot-coms, or Internet-related firms—contributed an additional drag on
economic activity. Prices for high-technology stocks as measured by the
NASDAQ composite index fell 67 percent from their monthly peak in March
2000 to their monthly trough in October 2001, returning the NASDAQ to
levels last seen in early 1998. By contrast, during the same period the Wilshire
5000 index fell by a much smaller 32 percent. The drop in the hightechnology stocks represented an important reduction in equity wealth, but
it also signaled a sea change in the fortunes of these businesses—especially
those in the information and communications technology industries—which
had been an important source of economic gains in the 1995-99 period.
Investors both ratcheted down the earnings prospects of these firms and
perceived a greater risk of investing in both established and more speculative
high-technology businesses. This fundamental reevaluation of information
and communications technology firms led to a swift downturn in the sector’s
activity and a reversal of the capital investment boom.

Lingering Effects of Y2K
The runup in capital spending by firms nationwide in anticipation of and
in response to the Y2K event created conditions that exacerbated swings in
high-technology capital spending. Instead of primarily upgrading existing
capital and software, which might have remained vulnerable to the Y2K bug,
most businesses replaced them with the latest technologies. The resulting
bulge in investment spending around January 2000 generated a tendency
toward a subsequent investment lull. Given that the typical replacement cycle
for high-technology goods is about 3 to 5 years, it is not surprising that the
investment decline that began in 2000 lingered in 2001.

38 | Economic Report of the President

Effects on Inventories and the Capital Stock
The factors just discussed—the transition to more moderate growth rates,
the decline in equity values, the surge in energy prices, higher interest rates,
the collapse of high-technology industries, and the lingering effects of
Y2K—constituted a potent set of adverse economic circumstances for
investment in 2000, with consequences for 2001. The declining stock
market and higher interest rates increased the cost of external financing of
new investment. At the same time, higher energy prices ate into corporate
cash flow, which was already slowing as the economy decelerated. As a result,
the financing gap (capital expenditure less internally generated funds) hit an
all-time high in 2000. Also, by mid-2000 businesses found themselves with
unplanned inventories as demand began to soften, and the result was a traditional inventory cycle. The accumulation of unwanted inventories led
businesses to slow production further, with consequences for employment
growth. This in turn fed the reduction in demand that had left businesses
with rising inventories in the first place.
As the economy slowed, firms found themselves with the desire to defer
future capital spending plans. By some estimates, a “capital overhang” developed in which the actual capital stock exceeded that desired by firms to meet
the lower expected demand in 2000. By late 2001, however, the decline in
investment spending had likely eliminated the capital overhang (Box 1-2).

Box 1-2. Capital Overhang and Investment in 2001
A capital overhang develops when the amount of capital in the
economy exceeds the amount that businesses desire for the production of goods and services. The emergence of such an overhang
complicates both business planning and policymaking. Businesses
often have to alter their capital spending plans and curtail their investment spending—sometimes quite abruptly. A large overhang may also
reduce the stimulative effects of tax policies designed to boost investment, possibly lengthening the recovery time during a period of
sluggish economic activity, especially for the manufacturing sector.
An overhang can arise in various ways. If, for example, rapid growth
is expected in the future, businesses will begin increasing their investment in advance. If the faster growth is not realized, these businesses
will find themselves with too much capital. A capital overhang can
also arise during a short period of unexpectedly sluggish growth. If
the decline in demand is thought to be sufficiently deep and
persistent, businesses may want to reduce their capital spending plans,
continued on next page...

Chapter 1

| 39

Box 1-2.—continued
and possibly sell off part of their capital stock, especially those capital
goods that are readily marketable. However, if the slowdown is
sufficiently short, businesses may prefer to reduce their use of the
capital stock rather than sell it, especially because the market price of
capital goods is likely to fall during such periods. Selling capital and
buying it back at a later date can then be more costly than simply
holding onto it and not using it to its full capacity. Reducing the utilization rate thus helps to prevent the desired capital stock from falling.
Policymakers have lately been concerned that the changing business
climate may have given rise to a capital overhang over the past 2
years. Some businesses, especially in the information and communications technology sector, may have overestimated the potential of the
“New Economy” and therefore overinvested in productive capacity. In
addition, businesses throughout the economy were surprised by the
extent of the slowdown in aggregate demand in 2000 and 2001, and
they therefore had to revise downward the path of their desired
capital stock.
Empirical evidence suggests that a capital overhang did develop in
2000. The overhang was modest for the economy on average, but
various types of capital equipment such as servers, routers, switches,
optical cabling, and large trucks were disproportionately affected.
Estimates of the total overhang must be interpreted with caution. There
is considerable uncertainty about its size, because it is difficult to estimate precisely both the capital stock that businesses desire and the
capital stock they actually possess. Better data collection (see Box 1-1)
could help solve this problem in the future. In any case, over the past
year and a half, the decline in investment spending and depreciation of
the existing capital stock combined to slow capital accumulation sufficiently to eliminate the overhang. Chart 1-5 shows that the capital stock,
which had been growing at an annual rate above 4 percent over the past
several years, is estimated to have grown just over 2 1/2 percent in 2001.
The remarkable slowdown in capital accumulation during 2001
underscores the importance of the President’s tax relief recommendations for economic stimulus. The partial expensing provisions and the
elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax will encourage
business investment, stimulating economic activity in the short run
and laying the foundation for stronger growth in the long run. The
reductions in marginal income tax rates will help spur investment by
providing incentives for flow-through entities, mainly small businesses, to grow and create jobs. The President’s tax relief will also
help foster a smooth and more predictable transition to a period of
sustainable growth.

40 | Economic Report of the President

From Slowdown to Recession
Even though economic activity had begun to soften in the first half of
2000, the onset of recession did not arrive until March 2001, according to
the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic
Research (NBER), the arbiter of U.S. business cycle dates. The committee
based this date on its reading of the economic data through November 2001,
especially the four measures of economic activity it considers most important: industrial production, the real volume of sales in manufacturing and
trade, employment, and real personal income less transfer payments.
Industrial production peaked in June 2000, real sales in manufacturing and
trade peaked in August 2000, employment peaked in March 2001, and real
personal income less transfers may not have peaked yet.
As the variation in these dates suggests, picking “the” month for the start
of a recession involves considerable judgment and is not without controversy.
The employment series appears to play a dominant role in the NBER
committee’s decisions. Without a doubt, employment is a key resource for
economic activity, representing about two-thirds of all inputs into production. In recessions since 1960, however, the peak in employment has tended
to follow the peak in economy-wide activity. In addition, total industrial
capacity utilization, a standard measure of the employment of capital—the
other key input in production—peaked in mid-2000, suggesting an earlier
Chapter 1

| 41

economy-wide turning point. These statistical arguments notwithstanding,
the evidence is clear that the industrial sector was already well into a contraction, and real sales volumes were sagging, before March 2001. Finally, the
economic consequences of the terrorist attacks were critical to the business
cycle dating. As the committee noted in its decision, “before the attacks, it is
possible that the decline in the economy would have been too mild to
qualify as a recession. The attacks clearly deepened the contraction and may
have been an important factor in turning the episode into a recession.”
The decline in consumer and business confidence following the terrorist
attacks in September had a larger and more durable macroeconomic effect
than the physical destruction and was sufficient to scuttle any possibility of
avoiding a recession. Chart 1-6 shows, however, that the decline in the
University of Michigan consumer sentiment index following September 11
was less than the sharp drop following Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
Since September, consumer confidence has rebounded noticeably, to close to
the preattack level. By comparison, during the Gulf War period, consumer
confidence remained subdued for a longer period but then surged when
the successful completion of Operation Desert Storm largely resolved
uncertainty about the future.
Overall, the deceleration of economic activity since mid-2000 has been
dramatic. Unemployment has risen, business earnings have suffered, and
government budgets have been strained. As in past recessions, no single key

42 | Economic Report of the President

factor caused the slowdown and subsequent recession; rather it took the
confluence of a series of unforeseen adverse events. Despite some similarities
shared with previous episodes of sluggish growth, the 2000-01 slowdown has
been unique in many respects and has required policies to address the
particular challenges of these developments.

Policy Developments in 2001
Both fiscal and monetary policy became expansionary in 2001. The
Federal budget surplus, although still substantial by historical standards, fell
because of deteriorating economic conditions and changing fiscal priorities
after the terrorist attacks. Falling short-term interest rates and rapid expansion of the money supply indicated that monetary policy was eased
significantly during the year.

Fiscal Policy Before the Terrorist Attacks
In February 2001 the President’s budget for fiscal 2002 outlined major
policy initiatives for the Nation. These included continuing the retirement of
the Federal debt, providing tax relief for American families, strengthening
and reforming education, modernizing and reforming Social Security,
modernizing and reforming Medicare, revitalizing national defense, and
championing faith-based initiatives. Although tangible progress has already
been made, fiscal vigilance will be essential to continuing toward these goals.
The Federal budget process needs to be more disciplined, and spending
limits previously agreed upon should be respected. Too often in the past,
budget deadlines were missed and legislation was consolidated into omnibus
spending bills that exceeded the agreed spending limits. Appropriations in
fiscal 2001, even before the emergency funds made available after September
11, were over $50 billion higher than in 2000—the largest 1-year appropriations increase in history. The events in September and October precluded
an expeditious completion of the appropriations process in the fall, but the
President and Congress agreed to limit discretionary spending to $686
billion excluding emergency spending. This new level provides reasonable
spending growth, ensures funding for Medicare and Social Security, and sets
an example for future budget negotiations.
In fiscal 2001 the Federal Government ran the second-largest budget
surplus in history and paid down the second-largest amount of debt in
history, despite the weak economic conditions. Looking forward, the Federal
budget will be in deficit during fiscal 2002 but, with spending restraint and
pro-growth policies, is projected to return to surplus beginning in 2005.
About two-thirds of the decline in the projected baseline fiscal position since
Chapter 1

| 43

last year may be traced to the weaker economy and technical revisions.
Spending accounts for nearly 20 percent of the decline, and the EGTRRA
provisions account for under 15 percent.
A sound long-run fiscal position holds down unnecessary spending and
removes tax-based impediments to economic growth. As noted earlier, the
tax cut in 2001 was key to mitigating the severity of the slowdown and
simultaneously improving growth incentives. The deterioration in the
surplus from a weak economy is the mirror image of the experience of the
late 1990s, when budget surpluses were fueled largely by a strong economy.
In general, faster economic growth causes budget surpluses, not the other
way around. Moreover, policies that promote job creation and entrepreneurial activity ultimately increase the size of the economy and hence provide
the resources for future spending obligations.

Tax Relief in 2001
The President laid a strong foundation for growth in 2001 with the Economic
Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act. This package provides a powerful
stimulus for future growth, with reductions in marginal tax rates that improve
incentives and leave in the hands of Americans a greater share of their own
money to spend on consumption, education, and retirement investment.
The first reduction in marginal tax rates was effective for 2001 and was
reflected in lower withholding during the second half of the year. In addition,
the new 10 percent tax rate bracket, carved out of the beginning of the
15 percent rate bracket, was reflected in rebate checks totaling $36 billion,
which were mailed to 85 million taxpayers during the second half. The
timing of these reductions in withholding and rebates proved propitious:
they added significant economic stimulus by boosting purchasing power in
the hands of consumers during a period of sluggish economic activity. The
2001 tax rate reductions were just the first step in a series of income tax rate
reductions to be phased in by 2006; by that year the 39.6 percent tax
rate will have dropped to 35 percent, the 36 percent rate to 33 percent, the
31 percent rate to 28 percent, and the 28 percent rate to 25 percent.
The tax cut package also provided incentives for saving, investment, and
capital accumulation. Higher IRA and 401(k) retirement contribution limits
are to be phased in over time, with those for persons over 50 phased in more
quickly. Beginning in 2002 and continuing through 2009, the highest estate
tax rates are reduced and the effective exemption amount is increased,
reducing an important impediment to the growth of entrepreneurial enterprises and the overall accumulation of wealth. In 2010 the estate tax is
eliminated. Small businesses will benefit from the lowering of individual
income tax rates for owners of flow-through business entities such as sole

44 | Economic Report of the President

proprietorships and partnerships. In 1998 there were close to 24 million
flow-through businesses in the United States, including 17.1 million sole
proprietorships, 2.1 million farm proprietorships, 1.9 million partnerships,
and 2.6 million S corporations. By 2006, when the personal income tax cut
is fully phased in, the Treasury Department estimates that over 20 million tax
filers with income from flow-through businesses will receive a tax reduction.
Finally, the President’s tax cut strengthens families and reduces the burden
of financing education. The marriage penalty is reduced, and the annual
child tax credit is increased from $500 to $600 per child in 2001 and gradually increased to $1,000 by 2010. Adoption credits are doubled in 2002 from
$5,000 per child; in addition, the credit will apply to more taxpayers, because
the income threshold at which the credit begins to phase out will rise to
$150,000 from $75,000. Contribution limits for education savings accounts
(formerly called educational IRAs) are raised to $2,000 a year, and distributions
are made tax-exempt. The law also increased the income phaseout range for
student loan interest deductions and made certain higher education costs taxexempt for households with less than $130,000 in income.
The initial macroeconomic effects of tax relief have been positive,
strengthening aggregate demand in the face of other downward pressures.
The rebate checks and the lower marginal tax rates alone reduced taxpayer
liabilities by $44 billion in 2001 and by $52 billion in 2002. Adding in the
effects of the other provisions of EGTRRA (such as the education incentives,
child credits, the individual alternative minimum tax, and marriage penalty
relief ) brings the liability reduction in 2001 and 2002 to $57 billion and
$69 billion, respectively.
In short, the President delivered important tax relief in 2001, providing a
solid foundation for renewed growth in consumer spending once confidence
rebounds, and for an improved investment climate for businesses. The boost
in aggregate demand should help provide a foundation for economy-wide
recovery in 2002.

Monetary Policy Before the Terrorist Attacks
The Federal Reserve aggressively pursued an easier monetary policy during
2001. With clear evidence that economic activity was sharply decelerating at
the end of 2000 and that inflation pressures were minimal, the Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC) began cutting the target Federal funds rate by
50 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point) at an unscheduled
meeting on January 3, 2001. By mid-August the FOMC had lowered its
target Federal funds rate on seven occasions, from 6½ percent at the start of
the year to 3½ percent (the lowest rate since early 1994). The target rate
reductions were also notable for their rapid succession. The Federal Reserve

Chapter 1

| 45

lowered the target rate at every scheduled meeting and at two unscheduled
meetings—a sequence of events rare in its history, and one that underscored
the seriousness of the deterioration in economic conditions. At each meeting
the committee also reaffirmed its view that the risks of weaker economic
activity outweighed the risks of higher inflation. Over the first 8 months of
2001, easier monetary policy pushed growth in M2 (a broad definition of the
money supply) to an annualized 10 percent rate.
Market interest rates responded to the lower targets for the Federal funds
rate. Short-term interest rates followed in lockstep, with the 3-month
Treasury bill rate declining roughly 240 basis points from December 2000 to
early September 2001. Three-month commercial paper rates, credit card
rates, personal loan rates, and 1-year adjustable mortgage rates also moved
down. Long-term rates decreased as well, but by a smaller amount. Ten-year
Treasury yields slid almost 20 basis points, and rates on 30-year fixed rate
mortgages fell about 25 basis points. Corporate bond yields also receded:
yields on corporate Baa-rated bonds fell roughly 15 basis points. The Merrill
Lynch high-yield bond index was off about 20 basis points.
The pattern of short-term and long-term interest rates during 2001 is
consistent with similar periods in the past. History shows that when the
economy has slowed sharply or is in a recession, and monetary policy has
eased significantly, short-term interest rates have tended to fall more than
long-term rates, but the large decline in short-term rates often proves temporary. In addition, the widening interest rate spread during 2001 reflected the
fact that long-term rates had edged down in 2000 in anticipation of lower
short-term rates in 2001. On the whole, the pattern of the yield spread is
more a reflection of the circumstances of the recession, not a factor
contributing to it.

The Macroeconomic Policy Response After September 11
In the days and weeks following the September terrorist attacks, fiscal and
monetary actions were taken to address the new challenges. The President
expeditiously requested emergency funds to assist in meeting humanitarian,
recovery, and national security needs. The Federal Reserve added substantial
liquidity through various channels to help markets function in an orderly
fashion in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, and it continued to ease
monetary policy.

Fiscal Policy
In the wake of the attacks, the President took action to ensure the security
of Americans. The President signed the 2001 Emergency Supplemental
Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on
the United States. The $40 billion in funding assisted victims and addressed
46 | Economic Report of the President

other consequences of the attacks. Funding was provided for debris removal,
search and rescue efforts, and victim assistance efforts of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency; emergency grants to health providers in
the disaster-affected metropolitan areas; investigative expenses of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation; increased airport security and sky marshals; initial
repair of the Pentagon; evacuation of high-threat embassies abroad; additional expenditures of the Small Business Administration disaster loan
program; and initial crisis and recovery operations of the Department of
Defense and other national security operations. These measures took needed
initial steps toward restoring security and confidence in the economy. The
President also proposed additional funding to help displaced workers and to
extend unemployment insurance in impacted areas.
In September the President signed the Air Transportation Safety and
System Stabilization Act, which provided the tools necessary to aid the transition of the air transport system to the new security and economic
environment. The law provides $5 billion to compensate for losses to the
industry directly resulting from the attacks; it also allows the President to
issue up to $10 billion in Federal loan guarantees.
The terrorist attacks introduced new risks into the economic environment.
One of the challenges has been to provide an umbrella of support for
economic security that draws on the strengths of the private sector. The
Administration has proposed measures designed to provide economic growth
insurance, or economic stimulus. The central focus of this effort is to address
the immediate needs of those displaced workers directly affected by the recession and the terrorist attacks, while also mitigating the effects of these events
on the broader economy. In response to the President’s leadership, the House
of Representatives passed such stimulus legislation on two separate occasions,
but the Senate failed to pass such legislation.
In choosing among alternative economic stimulus policies, the
government should favor those that are pro-growth—enhancing long-term
incentives to work, invest, take risks, and expand productive capacity—as
well as remain cognizant of short-term needs. The Administration’s approach
includes tax relief for low-income families and extended unemployment
insurance benefits. These types of policies address short-term needs while
also providing purchasing power that helps to ensure steady demand for
businesses.
However, the real solution to the economic woes of displaced workers is
employment. Fully addressing these workers’ needs and buttressing confidence on the part of all households and businesses requires a focus on job
growth. One key to this effort is small businesses and entrepreneurs, traditionally an important source of new jobs in the economy. The best policy to
help businesses and entrepreneurs is to reduce their marginal tax rates. The
Chapter 1

| 47

Administration proposes moving forward the implementation of the
marginal tax rate cuts passed by Congress in the spring of 2001. Lower
marginal tax rates both improve incentives and augment the cash flow of
small businesses. Research shows that entrepreneurs will respond to these
stronger incentives and increased cash flow by expanding their payrolls and
increasing their investments.
A second policy to provide incentives for private sector job creation is to
help businesses overcome uncertainty and restart investment spending. At
the aggregate level, the return to rapid growth requires a resumption in the
growth of capital expenditure. Employment losses have been concentrated in
the manufacturing sector—a sector heavily dependent on the health of business investment. For this reason the Administration has focused on growth
incentives, such as partial expensing and reform of the corporate alternative
minimum tax, that target the source of the problem, namely, an investment
slump that has diminished private sector job creation.
Property and casualty insurance is one mechanism by which economies
respond efficiently to risks in the business environment. Insurance spreads
these risks, converting, for each business that takes out insurance, a potential
cost of unknowable size and timing into a set of smaller premium payments
of known magnitude. The events of September 11 induced a dramatic revision in businesses’ perceptions of the risks facing them. In normal
circumstances, such increased risks are translated into higher premiums.
This serves the useful economic function of pricing risk, leading the private
sector toward those activities that present a risk worth taking, and away from
foolhardy gambles.
In the aftermath of September 11, however, one concern was that the
economy faced disproportionate increases in terrorism risk insurance
premiums or, in the extreme, a complete withdrawal of this type of coverage.
With this concern in mind, the Administration proposed legislation to
provide a short-term backstop for terrorism risk insurance that would
encourage rather than discourage private market incentives to expand the
economy’s capacity to absorb and diversify risk, and which would expire as
soon as the private market is capable of insuring these losses on its own.
Taken as a whole, the President’s policies have improved the Nation’s security, compensated the direct victims of the September attacks, and aided
displaced workers. If the President’s terrorism risk insurance and economic
stimulus proposals are passed, they will further enhance economic security.

Monetary Policy
In the hours, days, and weeks following the terrorist attacks, the Federal
Reserve used its financial resources to provide liquidity and ensure the functioning of financial markets. The Nation’s central bank injected substantial
liquidity into financial markets by promoting the use of the discount
48 | Economic Report of the President

window by depository institutions, increasing the volume of open market
operations, and arranging temporary reciprocal currency swaps (swap lines)
with several foreign central banks.
On September 11, the Federal Reserve made it clear through a press
release that the discount window was available to meet liquidity needs, and
depository institutions responded by employing the discount window at an
unprecedented level. Before September 11 average weekly discount
borrowing during 2001 had been $143 million. During the week of the
attack, however, borrowing ballooned to an all-time high of $11.8 billion
(Chart 1-7). In the next 2 weeks, as liquidity pressures waned, borrowing
quickly dropped to the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range and then returned to
levels seen earlier in the year. On the days that followed the attack, the
Federal Reserve also allowed reserves in the Federal funds market to rise as
Federal Reserve float surged because of the closure of the Nation’s air transportation system. In addition, the Federal Reserve made liquidity available by
arranging temporary swap lines with the European Central Bank (ECB) and
the Bank of England, and by augmenting existing swap lines with the Bank
of Canada.
In the week following the attacks, the Federal Reserve eased monetary
policy further at an unscheduled meeting of the FOMC, lowering its target
Federal funds rate ½ percentage point, to 3 percent. The FOMC reiterated,
in a press release accompanying its decision, that it would continue to
supply large amounts of liquidity to counter the extraordinary strains in the

Chapter 1

| 49

financial markets as well as to help ensure the effective functioning of the
banking system. The committee recognized that providing ample liquidity in
the short run could lead to the Federal funds rate trading well below its
target. In fact, in the week following September 11, the effective Federal
funds rate fell to an average of 1.2 percent for the 2 days of the week when
liquidity issues were of primary concern (Chart 1-8).
Despite the devastation to New York’s financial center, financial markets
and the banking system resumed business quickly and were operating at
near-normal conditions within just weeks of the terrorist attacks. The
remarkable resiliency of the financial markets and the longstanding policy of
the Federal Reserve to provide ample liquidity to stabilize markets in the wake
of unusual developments combined to mute the effects of the initial shock.
Since mid-September the FOMC has continued its easing of monetary
policy to help counter the deterioration of economic activity. By the end of the
year the Federal Reserve had lowered its Federal funds target to 1¾ percent,
its lowest level in 40 years, leaving the real Federal funds rate near zero.
Meanwhile there was no evidence of increasing inflation pressures. The
lowering of the Federal funds rate target led to further declines in short-term
and long-term market interest rates. At the end of the year, short-term
market interest rates were below 2 percent. The 10-year Treasury yield was
5.2 percent, and 30-year conventional mortgage rates averaged 7.2 percent.

Economic Developments
Outside the United States
Growth in the rest of the world slowed markedly in 2001. The global
slowdown is attributable to many of the same factors that affected the United
States: weakened investment demand (especially for high-technology goods),
relatively high oil prices in 2000 and early 2001, and the increased costs and
loss of confidence associated with the September terrorist attacks.
Canada and Mexico, our largest trading partners, saw their economies
soften in 2001. Canadian economic growth began to fall in 2000 as the deterioration in U.S. economic conditions particularly affected Canadian
exports. Late in 2001 Canada’s exports and domestic demand were weakened
further by disruptions and increased uncertainty following the terrorist
attacks. Real GDP growth was 1.4 percent for 2001 as a whole, down from
4.4 percent in 2000, and the unemployment rate stood at 8 percent at year’s
end. Mexico experienced zero growth in 2001, following a long period of
expansion; real GDP growth had been 6.9 percent in 2000. The unemployment rate edged up to 2.5 percent for 2001.
Growth also faltered in Europe. In the euro area (the 12 European
countries that have adopted the euro as their common currency), output
growth slowed significantly in 2001, after weak growth in the second half of
2000. The unemployment rate remained above 8 percent last year. Because
of constraints imposed by member countries’ commitments to the monetary
union, fiscal policy in the euro area remained only slightly stimulative. With
regard to monetary policy, the European Central Bank cut interest rates
by a total of 150 basis points in 2001. Growth in the United Kingdom
declined in 2001, but by less than in continental Europe, bolstered in part by
a 200-basis-point reduction in short-term interest rates. Over the year,
growth fell to 2.3 percent from 2.9 percent in 2000. The unemployment rate
declined to 5.1 percent in 2001, its lowest in 26 years.
Japan fell into its third recession in 8 years during 2001, with its unemployment rate reaching an all-time high of 5.5 percent as of November.
Although Japan, too, suffered from the effects of the slowing global economy,
it also continued to struggle with its moribund banking and corporate
sectors. Fiscal stimulus and monetary easing have done little thus far to
improve the country’s economic prospects.
The newly industrialized economies in East Asia were particularly hard hit
by economic stagnation in Japan and the slump in global technology investment. High-technology goods account for roughly 40 percent of these
economies’ exports. After increasing 8.2 percent in 2000, output in these
economies registered only a 0.4 percent increase in 2001.

Chapter 1

| 51

In the developing economies as a group, economic growth moderated
from almost 6 percent in 2000 to 4 percent in 2001. Meanwhile growth for
the developing economies in Asia declined from almost 7 percent to just over
5½ percent. In China, fiscal measures aimed at infrastructure investment
helped maintain rapid growth: Chinese GDP growth for 2001 was roughly
7 percent. The Middle East and developing countries in the Western
Hemisphere saw GDP growth fall dramatically, to just 1 to 2 percent in
2001. In contrast, Africa saw growth edge up from just under 3 percent to
3½ percent.
Two of the world’s larger developing economies—Turkey and Argentina—
faced significant financial turmoil in 2001. In Turkey, a banking crisis and
political uncertainty led to high real interest rates and a sharp drop in output.
The Turkish lira was floated in February 2001 and depreciated sharply
against the dollar before stabilizing. Late in the year Argentina also experienced severe financial distress, with unsustainable fiscal policy leading to loss
of confidence and a run on bank deposits, culminating in a default on the
country’s sovereign debt and dramatic political unrest.

The Economic Outlook
The Administration expects that the economy will recover in 2002. The
economy continues to display characteristics favorable to long-term growth:
productivity growth remains strong, and inflation remains low and stable.

Near-Term Outlook: Poised for Recovery
Real GDP growth is expected to pick up early in 2002 (Table 1-1). The
pace is expected to be slow initially, followed by an acceleration thereafter;
over the four quarters of 2002 real GDP is expected to grow 2.7 percent. The
unemployment rate is projected to continue rising through the middle of
2002, when it is expected to peak around 6 percent.
As discussed earlier, the decline in aggregate demand during the past year
was concentrated in inventory investment, business fixed investment, and
exports. Of these downward pressures, that from inventory disinvestment is
projected to reverse its course soonest and most rapidly, as the pace of liquidation is forecast to recede dramatically in the first quarter of 2002. By the
end of 2001 inventories had become quite lean, making it likely that, once
sales resume their growth, stockbuilding will boost real GDP growth.
Growth in business investment and exports may take longer to reassert
itself. Nonresidential investment fell sharply in 2001, and some downward
momentum probably remained at the start of 2002. Still, the financial foundations for investment remain positive: real short-term interest rates are low,

prices of computers are again falling rapidly, and equity prices moved up
during the fourth quarter. Indications late in the year suggested that these
factors were contributing to an upturn in new orders for nondefense capital
goods in October and November. The Administration projects that business
fixed investment will return to positive growth around the middle of 2002
and resume rapid growth thereafter.
The past year’s decline in exports reflects stagnating growth among the
United States’ trading partners. Consensus estimates of foreign growth in
2002 are anemic as well. In these circumstances any rebound in exports is
likely to lag behind the expected recovery of U.S. GDP as a whole. Imports
meanwhile are projected to grow faster than GDP. As a result, net exports
and the current account deficit are likely to become increasingly negative
during 2002.
Consumption growth slowed during the past year but has remained in
positive territory. This slowing may be attributable to the decline in the stock
market from its peak in March 2000. But in the absence of further stock
market declines, such restraint is expected to wane. Consumption will also be
supported by fiscal stimulus and interest rate cuts. The major provisions of
EGTRRA will lower tax liabilities by about $69 billion in 2002 (up from its
contribution of $57 billion in 2001).
Chapter 1

| 53

Inflation Forecast
As measured by the GDP price index, inflation was stable at about
2.3 percent during the four quarters ending in the third quarter of 2001. The
Administration expects this measure of inflation to fall to 1.9 percent over
the four quarters of 2002. The unemployment rate is now above the level
that the Administration considers to be the center of the range consistent
with stable inflation, and capacity utilization in the industrial sector is
substantially below its historical average. Despite faster-than-trend growth of
output in 2003 and 2004, some downward pressure will be maintained on
the inflation rate, because the unemployment rate is projected to remain
high over that period. As a result, inflation in terms of the GDP price
index is expected to inch down to 1.7 percent in 2003 before edging up to
1.9 percent over the forecast period.
In contrast, consumer price inflation is likely to edge up temporarily over
the four quarters of 2002, to 2.4 percent, reflecting energy price fluctuations.
(Petroleum-related goods make up a larger share of consumer budgets, on
which the CPI is based, than of the production of final goods in the
economy, on which the GDP price index is based.) In 2001 CPI inflation
was held down by a 13 percent decline in energy prices. In 2002 petroleum
prices are expected to stabilize, and energy price inflation is projected to be
positive, but still moderate. Following a temporary increase in 2002, overall
CPI inflation is projected to edge down and eventually flatten out at about
2.3 percent from 2003 forward.

Long-Term Outlook:
Strengthening the Foundation for the Future
The Administration forecasts real GDP growth to average 3.1 percent a
year during the 11 years through 2012. The growth rate of the economy over
the long run is determined primarily by the growth rates of its supply-side
components, which include population, labor force participation, productivity, and the workweek. The forecast is shown in Table 1-2.
The Administration expects nonfarm labor productivity to grow at a
2.1 percent average pace over the forecast period, the same as over the entire
period since the previous business cycle peak in the third quarter of 1990.
This forecast is noticeably more conservative than the 2.6 percent average
annual growth rate of actual productivity from 1995 to 2001. The pace is
projected to be slower as a caution against several downside risks:
• Nonresidential fixed investment has fallen about 6 percent from its
peak in the fourth quarter of 2000, while the level of the capital stock—
and therefore depreciation—remain elevated. This combination implies

54 | Economic Report of the President

that the near-term growth of capital services is likely to be reduced from
its average pace from 1995 to 2001, leading to slower growth in labor
productivity from the use of these capital services.
• The diversion of capital and labor toward increased security (which is
largely an intermediate product) may reduce the growth of productivity
modestly over the next few years (Box 1-3). Once the transition phase
has been completed, the enduring restraint on productivity growth is
likely to be small.
• As discussed in Box 1-4, about one-half of the post-1995 structural
productivity acceleration is attributable to growth in total factor
productivity (TFP) outside of the computer sector, perhaps due to
technological progress and better business organization. (The latter
aspect is discussed in Chapter 3.) Although there is no reason to expect
this process not to continue, the Administration forecast adopts a cautious
view in which the pace of TFP growth is near its longer term average.

Box 1-3. Increased Security Spending and Productivity Growth
The Nation will spend more on security in the wake of the terrorist
attacks. Economic growth will likely slow because more labor and
capital will be diverted toward the production of an intermediate
product—security—and away from the production of final demand. In
addition, lower output from these direct effects will lower national
saving and investment, and this reduces output a bit further. The eventual increase in the private security budget is unknown, but for
calibration purposes it is assumed that it doubles. Smaller or larger
changes would produce proportionally smaller or larger effects. Under
these assumptions, increased security costs reduce the level of output
and productivity by about 0.6 percent after 5 years below what they
would have been otherwise.
The United States spends roughly $110 billion a year on security. This
includes the services of Federal, State, and local police (but not the
armed forces). Of this, private business spends about $55 billion, or
0.53 percent of GDP It is assumed that one-third of the incremental
.
spending goes to security capital and two-thirds to security labor.
The diversion of two-thirds of $55 billion for additional security labor
diverts about 760,000 workers from productive employment, lowering
labor input to the economy by 0.69 percent. This diversion lowers
production by about two-thirds of 0.69, or about 0.46 percent. The
diversion of one-third of $55 billion from productive investment in the
first year lowers the “productive” capital stock by 0.10 percent and
lowers production by one-third of that, or about 0.03 percent.
In addition, by reducing output, the diversion also reduces saving
and investment, in turn reducing output further. The diversion in each
subsequent year lowers capital services even more. Assuming a 25
percent depreciation rate, capital services will have fallen by 0.39
percent after 5 years, lowering output by 0.13 percent.
The effect of the labor diversion is relatively large and immediate.
The effect of the capital diversion, in contrast, takes a few years to
accumulate. By the fifth year, output will be about 0.6 percent lower,
with 85 percent of that effect arising in the first year or two. Thus
productivity growth will be lower by 1/4 percentage point during the
first 2 years but will be affected only marginally thereafter.

56 | Economic Report of the President

The other components of potential GDP growth shown in Table 1-2 are
more easily projected. In line with the latest projection from the Bureau of
the Census, the working-age population is projected to grow at an average
1.0 percent annual rate through 2012. The labor force participation rate and
the work week are projected to remain approximately flat. In sum, potential
real GDP growth is projected to grow at about a 3.1 percent annual pace,
slightly above the average pace since 1973.
The rate on 91-day Treasury bills fell about 4 percentage points during the
12 months of 2001, reflecting the series of cuts in the Federal Reserve’s
interest rate target in response to the slowing economy. By the end of
December, the Treasury bill rate had fallen to about 1.7 percent. At this
nominal rate, real short-term rates (that is, nominal rates less expected inflation) are close to zero. Real rates this low are not expected to persist once
recovery becomes firmly established, and nominal rates are projected to
increase gradually to 4.3 percent by 2005. At that level the real rate on
Treasury bills will be close to its historical average.
The Administration projects that the yield on 10-year Treasury notes will
remain flat at 5.1 percent. The Administration’s expectation for the 10-year
rate reflects the assumption that the market yield embodies all pertinent
information about the path of future interest rates. In 2003 and thereafter,
the real 10-year rate is projected to remain slightly below its historical
average. The projected term premium (the premium of the 10-year rate over
the 91-day rate) of about 1 percentage point is projected to remain slightly
(about 30 basis points) below its historical average.
One important purpose of the Administration forecast is to estimate
future government revenue. To this end, the forecast of the components of
taxable income is crucial. The Administration’s income-side projection is
based on the historical stability of the long-run labor and capital shares of
gross domestic income (GDI). During the first three quarters of 2001, the
labor share of GDI was on the high side of its historical average of 57.7
percent. It is projected to decline to this long-run average and then remain at
this level over the forecast period. Nevertheless, the Administration forecasts
that wages and salaries as a share of GDI will decline and that other labor
income, especially employer-provided medical insurance, will grow faster
than wages. The capital share of GDI is expected to rebound in the short
run, reflecting an expected cyclical rebound in productivity, and to remain
flat at roughly its historical average thereafter. Within the capital share, a
near-term decline in the depreciation share (a consequence of the recent
decline in equipment investment) implies an increase in the profit share from
its current level. (Profits before taxes had fallen to 6.7 percent of GDP by the
third quarter of 2001, well below the post-1969 average of 8.1 percent.) The
Administration projects an increase in the profit share over the next several
years, so that it averages 8.1 percent over the forecast period.

Box 1-4. Is There Still a New Economy?
The late 1990s witnessed what many regard as the birth of a “New
Economy”—one characterized by the dominance of high-technology
industries, immunity from cyclical downturns, and, most of all, rapid
productivity growth. In the past year, however, high-technology stocks,
especially Internet and communications stocks, led the stock market’s
retreat; the 1990s expansion ended; and July’s annual revision to the
national income and product accounts caused productivity to be
revised downward. It is useful, therefore, to examine the evidence for a
resumption of the post-1995 acceleration in productivity.
Productivity growth is cyclical: it typically slows relative to its trend
immediately before and after a business cycle peak. Yet over the four
quarters ending in the third quarter of 2001, productivity growth grew
faster than in any comparable period during the last four decades
(Chart 1-9).
Table 1-3 presents the results of an analysis of the factors that
influence productivity growth and compares their influences in two
periods: 1973 to 1995, and 1995 to 2001. According to a model designed
to capture its cyclical behavior, the productivity acceleration after 1995
would have been stronger by 0.48 percentage point a year but for the
hiring that took place during this period to accommodate the increase
in demand that occurred before and during 1995. (See the second line
in Table 1-3.) This model estimates that business cycle effects raised
productivity growth noticeably in 1992-94 as the economy emerged
from recession, and reduced it noticeably in 1999, 2000, and 2001 (by
0.8, 0.4, and 1.4 percentage points, respectively). Adjusted for this
cyclical effect, structural productivity has accelerated by 1.70
percentage points. In short, the latest evidence shows structural
productivity growth continuing to exceed its pace during the period
from 1973 to 1995. Because it was reduced by the effects of the business cycle slowdown, actual productivity growth accelerated
somewhat less than structural productivity: by 1.21 percentage points,
to a 2.60 percent annual rate of growth.
In general, an acceleration in structural productivity can come from
increases in any of the following four sources of growth:
• growth in the amount of capital services per worker-hour
throughout the economy (capital deepening),
• improvements in the measurable skills of the work force (labor
quality),
• total factor productivity (TFP) growth in computer-producing
industries, and
• TFP in other industries.
continued on next page...

58 | Economic Report of the President

Box 1-4.—continued
TFP growth is the increase in aggregate output over and above that
due to increases in capital or labor inputs. For example, TFP growth
may result from a firm redesigning its production process in a way
that increases output while keeping the same number of machines,
materials, and workers as before.
Business investment was relatively strong during the past 6 years,
so that even after declining during the past year, nonresidential fixed
investment remained (at 12.0 percent of GDP in the third quarter of
2001) well above its postwar average (10.7 percent of GDP). Investment
in information equipment and software was especially strong after
1995, and likewise remains above its historical average share of GDP
,
although it, too, has fallen from levels of a year ago. As Table 1-3
shows, investment in information technologies added 0.60 percentage
point to the increase in structural productivity growth after 1995. The
buildup of capital outside of information technology maintained about
the same pace after 1995 as before, and so did not contribute to the
acceleration of productivity.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics measures labor quality in terms of the
education, gender, and experience of the work force. The agency uses
differences in earnings paid to workers with different characteristics to
infer relative differences in productivity. Measured in this way, labor
quality has risen as the education and skills of the work force have
increased. Because that increase occurred at about the same rate
before and after 1995, however, the contribution of labor quality to the
recent acceleration in productivity has been negligible.
The rate of growth of TFP in computer-producing industries has
been rising, as evidenced by the rapid decline in computer prices.
Computer prices did not fall as rapidly in 2000 as they did from 1997 to
1999; however, their rapid descent resumed in 2001. Using computer
prices as an indirect measure of productivity growth in the computerproducing industries, calculations indicate that computer manufacturing
accounts for 0.16 percentage point of the economy-wide acceleration in
productivity.
The final contribution comes from accelerating TFP in the economy
outside the computer-producing industries. The contribution of this
source is calculated as a residual; it captures the extent to which
technological change and other business and workplace improvements
outside the computer-producing industries have boosted productivity
growth since 1995. This factor accounts for about 0.90 percentage point
of the acceleration, or about half of the total. Taken at face value, it
implies that improvements in the ways capital and labor are used
continued on next page...

Chapter 1

Box 1-4.—continued
throughout the economy are central to the recent acceleration in
productivity, but it is equally an illustration of the limits on our ability to
account for the acceleration.
In summary, structural labor productivity growth and TFP growth
remained strong through 2001. This growth argues that the New
Economy remains alive and well.

The Administration believes that the economy may be able to grow faster
than assumed in the budget, once the new tax policy is in place. The
reductions in marginal tax rates are expected to lead to increases in labor
force participation and increased entrepreneurial activity. The budget,
however, uses economic assumptions that are close to the consensus of forecasters. As such, the assumptions provide a prudent, cautious basis for the
budget projections.

The events of 2001 have brought home to us a simple lesson: We cannot
be complacent about the security of American lives. Nor can we be complacent about our rate of economic growth, our gains in productivity, or our
successes in the international marketplace. The war against terrorism steps
up the demands on our economy. We must seek every opportunity to
remove obstacles to greater efficiency and seek new ways to combine our
workers’ skills, our new technologies, the drive of our entrepreneurs, the efficiency of our financial markets, and the strength of our small businesses to
yield faster growth. As we integrate ever more closely our own resources, so
must we also extend this integration abroad, addressing the economic roots
of terrorism and securing the gains from worldwide markets in goods and
capital. This is our economic challenge.
Chapter 1

The United States boasts a more rapid long-term rate of productivity
growth than do other major industrialized economies. Nonetheless, the
Administration is committed to seeking opportunities to enable the economy
to grow even more rapidly in the future. Growth, of course, is not an end in
itself. As the President has said, we seek “prosperity with a purpose.”
Economic growth raises standards of living and generates resources that may
be devoted to a variety of activities in the market and beyond. Growth can
fund environmental protection, the good works of charitable organizations,
and a wide variety of nonmarket goods and services that benefit the United
States, other industrialized economies, and developing economies alike.
To build upon our past success and rise to our new challenges, we must
remove impediments to growth and build the institutions necessary to foster
improved economic performance. For example, as noted in Chapter 7, one
of the President’s top priorities is the U.S.-led effort toward more open global
trade. Trade raises the productivity of Americans, and the United States has
an opportunity to reap significant gains from future trade agreements.
Another area of interest is science and technology, long an important
source of economic growth. For example, although information technologyproducing industries account for roughly one-twelfth of total output, they
contributed nearly a third to economic growth between 1995 and 1999.
They generate some of the best and highest paying new jobs and contribute
strongly to productivity growth. Technology also improves our quality of life.
New agricultural technologies are increasing crop yields while reducing the
need to spray herbicides and insecticides on our foods or into the atmosphere. More generally, however, it is important to establish incentives that
will ensure continued growth in innovation and the new technologies
that will define the 21st century. We must not only invest in basic research,
but also ensure that the intellectual property of innovators is secure at home
and abroad.
Getting the most out of the economy’s resources also means avoiding
unnecessary costs. Prominent among these are the costs—in terms of slower
economic growth and waste—associated with the Federal tax code. The
entire tax system would benefit from changes to address its complexity and
inefficiency. With the President’s leadership, progress has been made with the
individual income tax by reducing marginal tax rates and improving tax
fairness. Much more needs to be done, however, to ease the burden of taxation
on the economy, to help it generate resources and increase productivity.
The current tax code imposes multiple layers of taxation, whose inefficiency costs may be as high as ½ percent of GDP a year, according to the
Treasury Department. In addition, tax complexity is much more than an irritant around April 15: it, too, imposes real costs on taxpayers and the
economy. Taxpayers bear the cost in terms of the billions of dollars they
62 | Economic Report of the President

spend—on recordkeeping, tax help, and their own valuable time—trying to
comply. Tax compliance costs range from $70 billion to $125 billion a year.
The economy also suffers because tax complexity raises the uncertainty
surrounding business decisions, wastes resources, reduces our international
competitiveness, and lowers productivity. These are costs that produce few
benefits. They are largely avoidable. To get the most out of our economy, we
must investigate options for tax reform.
The deregulation of the economy over the past 25 years has been a
tremendous source of economic flexibility and productivity growth. We
must build on that success. Deregulation of several key sectors during the
1970s and 1980s has brought substantial benefits to consumers and to
the economy at large. In the 20 years following the beginning of airline
deregulation, the average fare declined 33 percent in real terms. Rates for
long-distance telecommunications dropped 40 to 47 percent in the 10 years
following deregulation of that market.
Partly because of increased competition arising from reductions in banking
regulations, banks have greatly expanded the financial services they offer
customers, including important new tools for diversifying risk. Together
these price declines and quality improvements across a range of deregulated
industries have yielded substantial economic benefits. One study estimates
the combined economic benefit of deregulating just three industries—
airlines, motor carriers, and railroads—at about ½ percent of GDP each year.
This important strength of our economy must be protected against unintended interference and extended to new spheres. Competition and
incentives to compete are at the core of exploiting opportunities to achieve
faster growth. (Chapter 3 discusses competition policy.) The rule of law is
central to efficient markets. Today, however, frivolous lawsuits and the lure of
windfall recoveries are transforming America from a lawful society to a litigious one. The litigation explosion imposes a variety of costs on all of us—as
much as 2 percent of GDP by one estimate—and damages the prospects for
growth. The inefficiencies in our tort system are a pure waste, an unnecessary
tax on our attempts to grow faster. To reduce this wasteful distortion we
must address the incentives that lead to unnecessary torts and unreasonably
large settlements.
We must reexamine the provision of economic security for every
individual American. For example, Chapter 2 of this Report examines the
changing nature of retirement security and documents the widely accepted
need for reform. Personal accounts within the national retirement system
would enhance the ability to diversify retirement portfolios, including diversifying part of retirement security away from the unsustainable current
system. In doing so, they could for the first time provide rights of ownership,
wealth accumulation, and inheritance within the Social Security framework.
Chapter 1

| 63

We must design an efficient set of institutions that meet the short-run
needs of displaced workers and move them quickly toward productive activities. The past year has displayed an extreme form of the shocks to which our
economy may be subjected. The President’s vision of economic security
recognizes that many events impact the economy all the time. We should
think comprehensively about these policies and focus our efforts on incentives for getting workers back to work, and quickly. Resources should be
devoted flexibly to basic needs and retraining, without creating an incentive
for unnecessarily long spells between jobs, because benefits extended under
the wrong conditions create a “tax” when a new job is taken and those
benefits are lost.
Finally, getting the most out of the economy will require an emphasis on
efficiency in government as well. If government spending grows without
discipline, billions of dollars will be siphoned away from private sector innovation, taxes will rise, and growth will suffer. The President’s Management
Agenda seeks to shift the emphasis of government toward results, not
process. It aims to replace the present Federal Government hierarchy with a
flatter, more responsive management structure and to establish a performance-based system. Chapter 5 of this Report examines fiscal federalism and
shows how this approach to the structure of Federal programs may usefully
be extended to the conduct of intergovernmental relations, particularly in
education, welfare, and health insurance for low-income Americans.

Strengthening Retirement Security

O

ver the course of the 20th century, longer life expectancies and
increased personal prosperity fostered a virtual revolution in the way
Americans approach work and retirement. At the turn of the last century,
male and female life expectancies at birth were 51.5 years and 58.3 years,
respectively. Today, in contrast, life expectancy at birth is 79.6 years for males
and 84.3 years for females. Because of these patterns, retirement security was
not nearly the important policy issue in 1900 that it is just over a century
later. And this issue is likely to grow in importance. Thanks to lifestyle
improvements, less dangerous jobs, and advances in medical technology,
among other reasons, the average life expectancy of a 65-year-old is projected
to increase by more than 2 years over the next half century and to continue
increasing even after that.
Changes in life expectancy and in fertility—American women are having
fewer children—are among the forces working at the individual level that
have demographic implications at the national level. These trends, together
with the aging of the baby-boom generation, ensure that the population of
the United States will grow older on average and remain older. Whereas in 1950
only 8 percent of the population were aged 65 or over, today those in that
age group account for more than 12 percent of the population. Thirty-five
years hence, they will represent more than a fifth of all Americans.
Not only are Americans living longer, but work and living arrangements
have changed as well. In 1900, when fewer than 4 in 10 people reached the
age of 65, approximately two-thirds of these survivors continued to work, the
vast majority as farmers or laborers. In contrast, more than half of all workers
today retire before their 62nd birthday, and only about 12 percent of the
population work past 65. The few elderly Americans at the turn of the last
century who were lucky enough to retire by 65 typically counted on
extended family to support them in their old age: over 72 percent of retired
men in 1900 were living with adult children. Today, fewer than one in five
retirees live with extended family.
In addition to longer lives and earlier retirements, increased personal and
national prosperity means that most Americans, including those in retirement, can now pursue leisure and recreational activities that were the
exclusive privilege of the most affluent a century ago. To take full advantage
of these changes, however, we must confront issues that previous generations
of Americans, who often labored until life’s end, did not have to. Planning
65

ahead for a comfortable, independent lifestyle during several decades without
earnings from labor has become an important issue for most of the population. Amassing the resources necessary to live unsupported by others for an
indefinite length of time is a task that demands forethought and preparation
from the time a worker first enters the labor force. The growing importance
of retirement security demands that, as we enter the 21st century, we reevaluate the strength of the Nation’s many institutions for supporting workers’
retirement planning efforts.

Rationale for a National Retirement System
As a starting point for thinking about retirement security, it is useful to
consider a simplified scenario in which each individual passes through two
distinct phases of adult life, with the length of each known with certainty.
During the “working” phase, the individual uses earnings from work both to
purchase goods and services for current consumption and to accumulate
assets for future use. In the “retirement” phase, the individual ceases to work
and instead lives on savings accumulated during the first phase. If these individuals are forward looking, then because they know how many years they
will spend in retirement, they will save enough while working to ensure that
they can maintain through retirement their previous level of consumption,
and perhaps make a bequest to their heirs as well. Put differently, they will
use their savings to “smooth” their consumption over their entire lifetime,
instead of living well only while working.
In this highly simplified world, retirement security is not an issue of
national concern. Prudent individuals have the incentives and the means to
successfully plan for their retirement so that they will always have enough
resources in their nonworking years. There is no need for government
involvement in workers’ planning and saving decisions.
Why, then, is retirement security a public policy concern? Traditionally,
the rationale for a public system for retirement planning derives from three
broad sources: insurance against uncertainty, foresight and planning failures
on the part of individuals, and redistributive goals.

Insurance Against Uncertainty
So far we have deliberately ignored the many sources of uncertainty an
individual faces when planning for the future. But in fact none of us who are
working today knows how long we will be able to work, how much we will
earn along the way, how long we will live, or what our costs of living in retirement will be. A person may plan to work for 45 years and may save
accordingly, only to discover after just 40 years that, for health reasons, he or
66 | Economic Report of the President

she simply cannot work any longer. Exactly how long we will live in retirement
is likewise subject to a great deal of uncertainty. Although the average
remaining life expectancy of a 65-year-old today is about 18 years, nearly a
quarter of those alive at 65 will live into their 90s. To guard against the
pleasant “surprise” of a longer-than-expected life, an individual needs a larger
nest egg than if he or she were certain of living to the average life expectancy.
Uncertain and unexpected health care costs pose another potential obstacle
to an individual’s retirement planning. Out-of-pocket medical expenses are
fairly low for most retirees, but for some they will be catastrophically high.
Can private insurance markets effectively safeguard individuals against
these contingencies? Although insurance is available against disability and
against large medical costs, not all the potential shocks to an individual’s
retirement security can be insured against. For example, an insured worker
may find it difficult to continue to work, and therefore apply for benefits,
but for various reasons the insurance company may be unable to verify that
the person can indeed no longer work and is therefore entitled to benefits.
This creates what economists call moral hazard: once a person is insured
against running out of money in retirement, he or she has an incentive to
retire earlier than in the absence of insurance, and this raises the insurer’s costs.
It has been argued that the inadequacy of existing insurance contracts
against a long life without work constitutes a market failure that only a
national social insurance system can address. Some have pointed to the small
size of the private U.S. market for life annuities as evidence of market failure
due to adverse selection: those who expect to live longer than the average will
be more inclined to buy annuities; this self-selection of higher risk (from the
insurers’ perspective) individuals raises the cost to insurers of providing
annuities, and thus, ultimately, their price. The higher price in turn discourages still more potential annuity purchasers, further shrinking the market.
But although there is evidence of some adverse selection in the U.S. annuity
market, studies have shown that this is not a sufficient explanation of its
small size. Among the leading alternative explanations is the existence of
Social Security, which itself provides a substantial annuity to most disabled
workers and retirees. Thus the seeming failure of markets for insurance
against a long life may not actually be a sufficient motive for government
involvement in retirement security.

Foresight and Planning
Some have suggested that even if workers could insure against all uncertainty
in planning for retirement, a portion of the population may nonetheless fail
to save adequately for retirement. Why might this be the case? Some people
may simply be shortsighted, failing to consider fully the long-run implications of their consumption and saving decisions. Also, some “free-riders”
Chapter 2

| 67

might intentionally neglect to accumulate retirement assets, in the expectation
that they can throw themselves at the mercy of a family or government safety
net that will guarantee them a minimally acceptable living standard
in retirement.
Even a worker who intends to save adequately for retirement may not fully
appreciate the necessity of saving enough, early enough, in his or her working
life. Or that worker may miscalculate the level of savings necessary to finance
a retirement that may span several decades. Saving for retirement is a continuous, lifelong process, but inadequate preparation early in life, perhaps due
to lack of experience in saving for large expenditures, may have lifelong
implications. Although some empirical research suggests that most people do
plan and save adequately for retirement, it is ultimately unclear, given widespread expectations of government support in old age, how much people
would save in the absence of existing government programs.

Redistributive Goals
For some, a third rationale for a public pension system is as a way of
redistributing resources from higher income to lower income individuals.
There are two reasons why government institutions for retirement security
may be especially well suited for achieving redistributive goals. The first is
that, because retirement benefits are provided after a person’s working years
are over, it is possible to redistribute based on lifetime rather than annual
income. Because income in a given year is not perfectly correlated with
income over a lifetime, redistribution on a lifetime basis should allow for
more accurate targeting of the lifetime needy. However, as discussed below,
evidence suggests that the current Social Security system accomplishes very
little lifetime income redistribution. Another task for which a social security
system might be uniquely suited is redistribution between generations. This
sort of redistribution might be desirable if each generation is substantially
wealthier than its predecessors. Indeed, in a continually growing economy
this is normally the case, but it was especially the case for the generation
following the Great Depression. The institution of Social Security transferred
a large amount of resources from those who were younger during the
Depression to those who were older, many of whom had lost much of their
wealth, or were unable to accumulate it, during those years.
Unlike most events against which individuals insure, retirement and old
age are not unforeseen. Accordingly, individual workers can and should take
primary responsibility for their own retirement preparation. For a variety of
reasons, however, retirement planning in the real world may not reflect the
ideal, simplified world in which each worker can and does optimally provide
for his or her own retirement. To the extent that obstacles to an individual’s

68 | Economic Report of the President

ability to save adequately for retirement do exist and cannot be removed by
private markets, or if certain social goals can only be achieved through
government involvement in retirement planning, retirement security can be
a national concern as well as a personal one. The appropriate public policy in
this area depends on the nature of the impediments to successful retirement
planning at the individual level, and the potential benefits from government
intervention. Given the wide variety of circumstances facing individuals,
however, retirement security must ultimately be the fruit of government
policy that supports and enhances individuals’ efforts to plan for themselves.

Sources of Retirement Security
A traditional metaphor for retirement security is that of the “three-legged
stool,” where the legs—the principal sources of income in old age—are
Social Security, employer-sponsored pensions, and individual savings. For
elderly households as a group, the largest share of income today comes from
Social Security, providing 38 percent of the total (Chart 2-1). Personal
savings, which include both individual savings and employer pensions, also
remain important, but a fourth income source has taken on increased
salience in recent years, namely, earnings from labor. In fact, earnings from
work are second only to Social Security in their contribution to the total
income of the elderly. Other sources of income, including Supplemental
Security Income (SSI) and other forms of public assistance, account for only
a small fraction of all income for this group. In the future, the relative importance of each of these income sources will likely change; for example, many
of today’s younger workers will receive a larger share of income from private
pensions upon retirement than did previous generations.
There are other sources of retirement security as well. Many people have
the advantage of owning a home that they can occupy. Private, employerprovided health insurance benefits for retirees, as well as Medicare and
Medicaid, also help mitigate the need for income flows in retirement.

Social Security
Social Security plays a central role in the household budgets of older
Americans as a group. On average, Social Security benefits account for
58 percent of total income for elderly households (defined in this chapter as
households with at least one member aged 65 or over). For the poorest
elderly, Social Security is even more important. Those in the lowest income
quintile obtain an average of 77 percent of their money income from Social
Security benefits; for half of that group, Social Security is the sole source
of income.
Chapter 2

| 69

The importance of Social Security benefits in the retirement portfolios of
most American households does not necessarily mean, however, that most
U.S. households would be poorly prepared for retirement without it. It is
sometimes suggested that, were it not for Social Security, elderly poverty rates
would be much higher than they are today. But this claim is generally based
on the premise that benefit payments to current Social Security beneficiaries
would suddenly be ended without warning, and that workers who had
contributed to the system their entire lives would be given nothing in return.
That is not the same as saying that, if Social Security had never existed, the
elderly poverty rate today would necessarily be higher than it is. In the
absence of a national retirement security program, people would have higher
after-tax income and would not expect future retirement benefits. Therefore
it is reasonable to suppose that today’s retirees would have saved more on
their own for retirement than they actually did. Private pension coverage
might also have been dramatically different in the absence of a public
pension system. Consequently, it is important not to conclude, based solely
on the current distribution of retirement income sources, that people would
be poorly prepared for retirement under a different set of savings institutions.

70 | Economic Report of the President

Employer-Sponsored Pensions
Outside of Social Security, saving for retirement occurs in two main ways:
individuals may save independently, or they may save through an employersponsored pension plan. Savings accumulated in employer plans have
increased dramatically over the past few decades, growing from $852 billion
(in 1997 dollars) in 1978 to almost $3.6 trillion in 1997. At the same time,
there has been a pronounced trend away from defined-benefit plans, in
which employees are promised specified benefit levels upon retirement, and
toward defined-contribution plans, including 401(k) plans, in which
employers and, often, employees make specific periodic contributions
toward the employees’ pension savings. The number of participants in
defined-contribution plans has skyrocketed, from 16.3 million in 1978 to
54.6 million in 1997, while the number of participants in defined-benefit
plans increased only slightly, from 36.1 million to 40.4 million (Chart 2-2).
The growth in defined-contribution plans primarily reflects the popularity of
401(k)-type plans; participation in these had increased to 33.9 million by
1997, compared with only 7.5 million in 1984. Age-specific trends in plan
participation, as well as a trend toward more companies offering plans,
indicate that the rapid growth of 401(k)-type plans is likely to continue.

Chapter 2

| 71

Individual Savings
Income from assets accumulated outside of private pension accounts is
another important component of retirement income, accounting for about a
fifth of all income for elderly households. With more than half of elderly
households reporting income from nonpension assets in 1998, individual
retirement savings are a widespread, but not yet ubiquitous, phenomenon. At
the same time, the distinction between pension savings and other personal
savings has become increasingly blurred. For example, balances from 401(k)
and other pension plans may be rolled over into Individual Retirement
Accounts (IRAs), which are regarded as nonpension savings. Also, small
firms may establish IRAs on behalf of their workers rather than provide traditional pensions or 401(k)-type plans; such accounts would be counted as
individual savings even though the employer contributes the funds.

Labor Earnings
Older workers are a vital part of the work force today and will become
even more important in the future, as growth in the work force slows in
response to population trends. Earnings from labor are an important
component of income for a significant minority of older households. In
1998, 21 percent of elderly households reported income from labor earnings.
Apparently, working is a feasible and perhaps even a desirable option for
those elderly who wish to supplement income from Social Security and
savings. And for those who determine that they have undersaved, or whose
assets decline in value close to or during retirement, working in the traditional retirement years can be an important adjustment mechanism. Finally,
today’s elderly tend to be in better health than the elderly of 50 years ago,
and it is likely that many more than in the past have valuable skills whose use
does not require physical exertion. These considerations make the choice of
continued work even easier.

Public Assistance
Compared with the four primary sources—Social Security, savings in
pension plans, individual savings, and labor earnings—public assistance
programs such as SSI account for an insignificant share of total income for
the elderly. Nevertheless, SSI, as the retirement security program of last
resort, is an important part of the safety net for a civilized society, guaranteeing a minimum income for those elderly who have little or no income
from other sources. Five percent of all aged households receive some form of
public assistance, and for a quarter of these it is their sole income source.
Medicare and Medicaid, which provide in-kind assistance rather than cash
benefits and which may have a substantial insurance value, also are an important
form of public support for the elderly.
72 | Economic Report of the President

Challenges Ahead
At the beginning of the 21st century, America is taking stock of its
institutions for retirement security. A monumental demographic shift is
taking place, in the United States and around the world, with the result that
the elderly, and programs for the elderly, will consume a growing proportion
of the Nation’s output. The aging of the baby-boom generation, whose
oldest members will reach the age of 65 in just 9 years, together with continuing low fertility rates and increasing life expectancies, will mean that
relatively fewer workers will be available to support a growing elderly population. Over the next 35 years, the number of workers for every retiree will
fall from 3.3 to just 2.1—a 36 percent drop.
One clear imperative arises from this trend: Americans must take even
greater responsibility for their own retirement security by increasing their
personal saving. Higher personal saving has a twofold benefit. Not only will
it improve personal retirement security by expanding personal wealth, but it
will also have a salutary effect on the economy as a whole. When individuals
save more, they add to national saving (Box 2-1). Higher national saving, in
turn, means a larger capital stock and, consequently, an expanded national
productive capacity for the future. This larger economic pie improves the
ability of the Nation to ensure a minimum level of consumption for those
members of the growing elderly population who did not earn enough while
working to accumulate a large base of assets.
Public policy has an important role to play in encouraging personal saving
as the foundation of retirement security. As outlined earlier, personal saving
can take several different forms. Individuals may save for retirement on their
own initiative. This form of saving can be encouraged through incentives in
the tax system, such as the exemption of capital income from taxation.
These incentives reduce the tax burden that might otherwise inhibit personal
saving; however, they also have a cost in terms of forgone tax revenue, which
can mean that national saving does not increase by the full amount of the
increase in personal saving (see Box 2-4 below). Personal saving may also take
place through employer-sponsored pension plans, which likewise receive
favorable treatment under the tax code. Finally, personal saving may even
take place through a public pension system, if the program allows individuals
to save in accounts that they personally own. The rest of this chapter
examines each of these important retirement security institutions, beginning
with the institution that dominates the current retirement saving landscape:
Social Security.

Chapter 2

| 73

Box 2-1. National Saving, Personal Saving, and Growth
National saving is the sum of saving by individuals, businesses, and
all levels of government, Federal, State, and local. Augmented by
saving from abroad, national saving represents the total resources
available for investment: the purchase of factories, equipment, houses,
and inventories. When a country saves more than is necessary to
replace worn-out capital goods with new capital, so that net national
saving is positive, extra resources are available to expand the country’s
capital stock. A larger capital stock corresponds directly to a higher
capacity to produce goods and services. Therefore increasing net
national saving today can be an important step toward expanding the
productive capacity of the economy for tomorrow.
During the 1990s, net national saving averaged about 5 percent of
GDP down from its 1960s average of nearly 11 percent. Although net
,
national saving was fairly stable during the 1990s, its components
varied widely across the decade. Net business saving grew slightly as
a fraction of GDP but there were substantial changes in the contribu,
tions of government and personal saving. Personal saving dropped
sharply, from a peak of 6.5 percent of GDP in 1992 to just 0.7 percent in
2000. Over the same period, government accounts flipped from a
deficit of 4.8 percent of GDP to a surplus of 2.5 percent—a total rise in
saving of 7.3 percentage points. Thus, increased government saving
roughly offset the decrease in personal saving. Traditionally, personal
saving has been an important source of net national saving that
finances investment. And because the Federal Government may not be
expected to run large, persistent surpluses as an aging population
strains its finances, it is imperative that the Nation increase personal
saving now in order to expand the economy for the future.

Social Security: Past and Present
Origins of the Current System
The basic institution for retirement security in the United States today was
established in the midst of the Great Depression, through the Social
Security Act of 1935. Championed by President Franklin Roosevelt as a
means of offering “some measure of protection to the average citizen and to
his family...against poverty-ridden old age,” Social Security was Roosevelt’s
proposal for a national system of retirement security. Ultimately, this proposal
became a key part of the Nation’s response to the upheaval of traditional social
and economic structures in the early decades of the 20th century.
74 | Economic Report of the President

The secular decline in agricultural employment, on which many
Americans had depended for their living, worsened the ill effects of the Great
Depression for many of the elderly. The loss of agricultural jobs over several
previous decades had forced a shift of employment to the cities. But nonfarm
workers had always fared worse than agricultural workers during economic
declines, and the pattern persisted during the 1930s. Unemployment in the
work force as a whole reached a high of 25 percent in 1932, but unemployment among nonfarm workers peaked at nearly 38 percent. The elderly were
hit particularly hard. In 1930, 54 percent of men aged 65 and over were
unemployed and looking for work, and another quarter were temporarily laid off
without pay.
Aggravating the situation, the stock market crash and subsequent failure of
many financial institutions wiped out the limited resources that some older
workers had managed to accumulate. Without assets, employment, or traditional support systems, many of the elderly of the 1930s were in dire need of
assistance. President Roosevelt sought to provide aid for the aged through his
plan for social insurance. Social Security, as envisioned by Roosevelt,
addressed the problem through a system in which workers contributed a
portion of their earnings while working and, in turn, earned the right to
collect benefits upon retirement.
Importantly, Social Security was not implemented as a program for
national saving. Although the authors of the Social Security Act of 1935
intended to create a funded system, one that sets aside revenue to meet
scheduled future benefits, amendments to the act in 1939 made important
changes to provide more immediate relief from the widespread poverty then
afflicting the elderly. As a result, Social Security is not today a fully funded
system. Rather it is primarily a system for the transfer of income from one
generation to the previous one: each generation pays taxes during its working
years to support the current generation of retirees. Such a system is called an
unfunded, or pay-as-you-go, system.
Although the Social Security system as amended in 1939 addressed the
needs of the elderly during the Great Depression, today the United States
faces a different challenge. The role of our retirement security institutions in
enhancing the ability of relatively fewer workers to support relatively more
retirees will be a critical issue as the 21st century progresses. To that end we
must consider the effect of Social Security on national saving, the essential
ingredient for expanding the economy’s productive capacity so that it can
support a vastly larger number of retirees.

Chapter 2

| 75

Social Security and National Saving
To consider how the presence of Social Security affects national saving,
one must examine the effects of the current program on two individual
components of national saving: government saving and personal saving.

Government Saving
To the extent that Social Security operates as a pure income transfer
program, in which taxes collected from current workers are precisely equal to
the benefits paid to current retirees, the system itself has no effect on government saving. Thus the effect of Social Security on government saving hinges
on how any deviation from annual budget balance in the Social Security
program affects overall government budgetary policy.
When Social Security runs a surplus, so that income from payroll taxes
and taxes on benefits in a given year exceeds total benefit payments in that
year, as is currently the case, the government essentially has two options for
the use of those excess funds. The surpluses may be spent, or they may be
saved. If the surpluses are used to finance current expenditure beyond the
level that would have prevailed in their absence, they do not contribute to
government saving. If instead those funds are used to pay down publicly held
debt (which represents the accumulation of past government dissaving),
government saving increases dollar for dollar with the reduction in the debt.
However, the government’s ability to save by paying down its publicly held
debt is limited by the amount of such debt. If all publicly held debt were to
be retired, the only way that the government could continue to save through
existing systems would be through investments in non-Federal securities,
such as corporate or municipal bonds, or equities. This, however, would
raise difficult issues about government interference in equity markets and
corporate governance.
Ultimately, the contribution of Social Security to government saving
depends on whether non-Social Security surpluses or deficits are affected by
the annual balances in the Social Security program. If the presence of Social
Security surpluses leads policymakers to increase spending or reduce taxes
in the non-Social Security budget, the potential contribution of surpluses to
government saving is reduced.
Many discussions of the effect of Social Security surpluses on national
saving are confused by misunderstandings about the relationship between the
Social Security trust fund and national saving. (Technically, there are separate
trust funds for the two major Social Security programs, that for old-age and
survivors insurance and that for disability insurance, but for purposes of this
discussion we will combine them.) The trust fund is essentially an accounting
device for keeping track of annual surpluses in the Social Security portion of
the Federal budget. The balance of the trust fund represents the accumulated
76 | Economic Report of the President

value of excess revenue, net of expenses, to the Social Security system in all
years that the system has run a surplus, net of accumulated deficits, as well as
the interest earned on those surpluses. All Social Security surpluses are
credited to the trust fund, regardless of whether they are used to finance nonSocial Security spending or reduce debt, and regardless of how the existence
of those surpluses affects other government spending. Consequently, the
balance in the trust fund is not a measure of the Social Security program’s
accumulated net contribution to government saving. Rather, it merely represents the upper bound on the saving that could have happened if all Social
Security surpluses had been devoted to government saving. Although Social
Security has run large surpluses since 1984, these surpluses have in most
years been offset by large non-Social Security deficits, suggesting that actual
saving through Social Security has been far smaller than the value of the
balance of the trust fund.

Personal Saving
To gauge the effect of the current Social Security system on national
saving, one must consider the system’s effect not only on government saving
but also on personal saving. It is difficult to say definitively what personal
saving would be, or would have been in the past, in the absence of Social
Security, but reasoning and empirical evidence can be useful guides. As
discussed previously, careful consideration suggests that Social Security may
act as a substitute for retirement saving. Instead of saving, a worker pays
taxes on his or her wages and, upon retirement, instead of using past
savings to finance consumption, the worker receives a check from the
government. In this way Social Security can negatively affect personal—and,
consequently, national—saving.
For a number of reasons, however, a rational worker might decide to
reduce personal saving less than dollar for dollar with increases in expected
Social Security wealth. A worker may underestimate the expected value of
Social Security benefits or simply not believe that the scheduled benefits will
be forthcoming upon retirement. This is particularly possible in the current
climate, when revenue has been projected to fall short of projected benefits.
Another possibility is that Social Security affects saving behavior through an
effect on retirement behavior (Box 2-2). If Social Security makes retirement
an attainable goal and thus prompts workers to plan for an earlier retirement,
they may actually save more than they would have in the absence of
the program.
Clearly, economic reasoning alone does not lead to an unambiguous
conclusion regarding the effect of Social Security on personal saving
behavior. Therefore we must rely on empirical analysis to learn about the
actual effect of the program on personal saving and, ultimately, on national
Chapter 2

| 77

Box 2-2. Does Social Security Alter Retirement Behavior?
Careful economic analysis indicates that the current Social Security
system does indeed have the potential to alter workers’ retirement
behavior. Incentives that affect retirement could come through a
number of different channels. For some, Social Security provides more
retirement wealth than they would have chosen to provide for themselves through their own saving; the resulting benefit windfall in old
age could induce their earlier retirement. Also, Social Security adjusts
benefits for those who retire and begin receiving benefits before or
after Social Security’s normal retirement age, currently 65 years and 6
months; if these adjustments deviate from what is actuarially fair, they
may create incentives favoring retirement at a particular age. If those
who work past 65 do not get an actuarially fair increase in benefits, for
example, people might be inclined to retire earlier than otherwise.
People with above- and below-average life expectancies will also have
varying retirement incentives related to the benefit formula. Social
Security may also have affected retirement behavior simply by establishing the social convention that 65 is the “normal” retirement age.
Since rational analysis does not lead to a definite conclusion about
how Social Security affects retirement behavior, we must examine
empirical retirement patterns in order to understand the ultimate effect
of this complex system of incentives. Early retirement has become
more common in the United States, as well as in other countries, in
recent decades. And a considerable amount of evidence indicates that
the relaxation of early retirement rules and the increased availability of
benefits at earlier ages in the 1950s and 1960s resulted in these
pronounced trends toward earlier retirement. Cross-sectional evidence
using only U.S. data has been less clear in establishing a link between
Social Security expansions and declines in the average retirement age.
Some research suggests that changes in pension wealth have had a
much stronger effect on retirement trends than have Social Security
changes; this research finds that any Social Security effect accounts for
only about 1 percentage point of the 20-percentage-point decrease in
the labor force participation rate for males aged 55 to 64 between 1950
and 1989.

78 | Economic Report of the President

saving. Even then the results are less than clear, but in a recent Congressional
Budget Office survey, 24 of 28 cross-sectional studies found a negative
impact of increases in Social Security wealth on private saving. If Social
Security does negatively impact private saving, as much evidence suggests, it
may be inhibiting national saving and, consequently, economic growth.

The Future of Social Security
In assessing the role of Social Security as a retirement security institution
for the 21st century, two related, yet conceptually distinct, issues must be
addressed. The first is the fundamental question about the degree to which
government transfers should supplement personal saving for retirement. In
the extreme, the essential choice is between a savings-based program in
which individuals accumulate assets, and a program that simply transfers
income from younger to older generations.
The second issue is that the current Social Security system, which
resembles more the latter system than the former, is on a fiscally unsustainable course as a result of the demographic changes discussed earlier: the aging
of the population and the consequent projected decline in the ratio of
workers to retirees. These changes make it impossible to afford the currently
projected rate of benefit growth without large tax increases or other fundamental changes to the system. The following sections deal with each of
these issues in turn.

Advantages of Personal Accounts
One of the President’s principles for strengthening Social Security is that
modernization must include individually controlled, voluntary personal
retirement accounts to augment the Social Security safety net. Under such a
system, a worker could direct a portion of his or her payroll taxes, or possibly
an additional voluntary contribution, into a personal account that he or she
would legally own. The worker would then choose, from a variety of options,
how the assets in the account are to be invested. Upon retirement, the
worker would have access to the accumulated assets, which could be used to
purchase an annuity, provide a bequest to heirs, or make withdrawals from as
needed. Workers who choose to direct a portion of their existing payroll taxes
into private accounts could expect a higher combined level of benefits,
because an annuity funded by the personal accounts would have a higher
expected value than the benefits from the traditional system that are being
partially replaced by the account contributions. Personal accounts would
thus represent a voluntary means by which a worker could supplement benefits from the pay-as-you-go portion of Social Security. As such, they could
Chapter 2

| 79

provide the foundation for a return to individual-based retirement security
that takes advantage of the safety net aspects of Social Security and the
strengths of individual choice and wealth accumulation.
Although the introduction of personal accounts within Social Security
would represent the most significant change in the program since its inception, the idea itself is not new. In President Roosevelt’s message to Congress
on Social Security on January 17, 1935, he stated that one of his three principles for the program was “voluntary contributory annuities by which
individual initiative can increase the annual amounts received in old age.” In
this light, a system of personal accounts would appear to be the next step in
the natural evolution of the program. In addition, many other nations, from
the United Kingdom to Australia to former socialist countries like
Kazakhstan, have included personal accounts as an important part of their
national retirement program.
A Social Security system that includes an element of personal accounts
would offer many advantages over the current regime. These include
personal ownership of accounts, bequeathability of account assets, better
diversification of risk, reduced distortion of work incentives, and the potential
for higher national saving. We discuss each in turn.

Ownership
From the perspective of an individual worker, perhaps the most striking
difference between personal accounts and the current system is ownership.
Under Social Security, a worker’s retirement security depends not on the
assets that worker possesses, but on the hope that future Congresses will raise
taxes on the next generation of workers by a sufficient amount to pay scheduled benefits. In fact, the Supreme Court ruled in Flemming v. Nestor (1960)
that workers and beneficiaries have no legal ownership claim to their benefits, even after a lifetime of contributing to the system. A personal account,
on the other hand, would be the legal property of the worker who
contributed to it and whose name it bears. Regardless of the financial
situation of the government, a worker would be legally entitled to the assets
in his or her account upon retirement.
The security that comes from this ownership, however, is not the only
benefit that ownership offers. Asset ownership and wealth accumulation
could be a positive new experience for many Americans. In 1998 the median
U.S. household owned only $17,400 worth of financial assets, including
sums in retirement accounts. Four out of every nine households saved
nothing at all during the year. For many families, contributions to individual
Social Security accounts may represent their only chance to build privately
held financial assets and wealth. The experience of selecting investments
and observing the miracle of compound interest at work might help many
workers overcome existing social and informational barriers to asset
80 | Economic Report of the President

ownership. Research has shown, in fact, that the experience of managing a
pension account may actually encourage workers to save more outside of
their pension than they otherwise would. Accordingly, personal accounts
could have an important effect on the personal saving rate.
Studies have suggested a broad range of other benefits from asset
ownership as well. Owning assets makes people more oriented toward the
future, more likely to take calculated risks, and more likely to participate in
the political process. Financial assets have also been found to be associated
with positive physical and mental health effects, particularly for those
between the ages of 65 and 84. Married couples with property and financial
assets are less likely to divorce than couples without assets. Finally, a survey of
participants in an experimental program designed to help the poor save and
accumulate assets has yielded important information on the benefits of asset
ownership. Program participants report feeling more economically secure, are
more likely to make education plans for themselves and their children, and
are more likely to plan for retirement because of their asset accounts. They
also reported that they are more likely to increase their work hours or
increase their income in other ways. They are more confident about the
future and feel more in control of their lives because they are saving.

Bequeathability and Redistribution
Recent research has shown that Social Security is only mildly progressive
and may even be regressive on a lifetime basis, despite an explicitly progressive benefit formula (Box 2-3). One reason for this seeming paradox is that
people with higher incomes tend to live longer than those with lower
incomes. Because Social Security retirement benefits cease at the death of the
insured individual (or the individual’s surviving spouse), those with shorter
lifespans will earn lower returns on their contributions, all else equal.
Additionally, research has indicated that current Social Security arrangements may substantially increase the inequality of the wealth distribution by
depressing bequests by low- and moderate-income households who might
have accumulated bequeathable assets in the absence of the program.
Depending on the degree of annuitization of assets that is required, and on
other program design elements, a system that includes personal accounts has
the potential to reduce some of the regressive tendencies of the current
system. Accountholders who die earlier than the average might be able to
pass on to their heirs a portion of the wealth in their personal accounts;
this would partly correct for the disadvantage many higher mortality,
lower income groups face under Social Security today. The introduction
of personal accounts might also provide an opportunity for the creation
of a more progressive benefit structure for the pay-as-you-go portion of
Social Security.
Chapter 2

| 81

Box 2-3.The Effect of Social Security on Income Distribution
One of the traditional justifications for a government role in retirement
security institutions is the potential to use these institutions as tools for
redistribution, especially redistribution based on lifetime income. It is
often argued that Social Security is redistributive along a number of
different dimensions. However, in large part because of heterogeneity
among individuals in marital status and life expectancy, much less
redistribution on a lifetime basis occurs under the current system than
is widely believed.
Progressivity. The design of the Social Security benefit formula is
explicitly progressive at the individual level. When redistribution is
considered at the family level, however, the system looks less progressive than the benefit formula seems to imply. There are two reasons for
the potential disparity. First, many low-income individuals are
members of high-income households; if such a low-income person
receives a high return on Social Security, the system will appear redistributive on an individual, but not on a household, basis. Second, the
ability to collect benefits on the basis of a spouse’s earnings also
fosters redistribution to low- or zero-income individuals with highincome spouses. Research has shown that the system hardly
redistributes to poor families at all.
Redistribution by marital status. Rates of return are considerably
higher for single-earner couples than for dual earners. For medium
earners (as defined by the Social Security actuaries) retiring in 2000,
for example, the 4.75 percent rate of return for a one-earner couple was
very nearly twice that for a two-earner couple. There is also substantial
redistribution from single individuals to married couples. A man
retiring in 2000 with medium earnings and with a wife who never
worked would receive a rate of return on Social Security that exceeded
twice the return obtained by an identical man who had never married.
Redistribution by race. Largely because of differences in mortality
rates, African Americans receive on average nearly $21,000 less, on a
lifetime basis, from Social Security’s retirement program than whites
with similar income and marital status, according to recent research.
Other research finds that rates of return for African Americans from
Social Security are approximately half a percentage point lower than
for whites of the same marital status. Survivor benefits that pay benefits to the spouse or the children of deceased workers partly, but not
completely, compensate for the negative effect of mortality on returns.
The provision of disability insurance through Social Security also
improves returns for African Americans, who are more likely than other
groups to collect disability benefits.

82 | Economic Report of the President

Diversification of Risk
Another important advantage of adding personal accounts to a pay-as-yougo system is the potential to diversify the risks inherent in such systems.
Under the present Social Security system, the ultimate rate of return earned
by a participant is subject to political risk. Without structural reform of
Social Security, workers and retirees will face significant uncertainty about
how future policymakers will alter system revenues and outlays to avoid
system insolvency. These actions would directly impact the rate of return
earned by participants in the system.
Although funds invested in equities through a personal account can be
expected to earn a higher rate of return than funds in a pay-as-you-go
system, investment in equities does expose participants to some degree of
financial market volatility. However, as long as the market risk associated
with equity investment is not perfectly correlated with the demographic and
political risks of a pay-as-you-go system, a mixed system of personal accounts
and pay-as-you-go benefits offers an opportunity for better diversification
than either a pure pay-as-you-go or a pure investment-based system. This
diversification could be especially important to low-income workers whose
sole source of retirement income is Social Security, and who are
consequently less well diversified than wealthier individuals who are able to
hold private financial assets in addition to expecting scheduled Social
Security benefits.

Labor Supply
A reform of Social Security that includes personal accounts would reduce
the economic inefficiency arising from elements of the current Social
Security system that distort labor supply. For many workers, including
younger workers and secondary earners in a household, the present structure
of the benefit formula means that the marginal dollar of Social Security
payroll taxes that they pay does nothing to raise their benefits at retirement.
When this is the case, that worker’s effective marginal tax rate is increased by
the full amount of the payroll tax (provided the worker is earning less than
the Social Security cap on taxable earnings, which is $84,900 in 2002). Since
a higher marginal tax rate corresponds to a lower return to work, the Social
Security payroll tax may discourage work by many low- and middle-income
workers. In a system that includes personal accounts, however, the link
between current contributions and future income is stronger, and there is
more incentive to work than under the current system.
The current Social Security system may also distort labor supply behavior
through its effect on retirement age. Growth of assets in personal accounts,
however, is governed by the rate of return on those assets rather than by the
potentially distortionary rules of a defined-benefit program. Thus workers
Chapter 2

| 83

with income from personal accounts may be less influenced in their choice of
retirement age than if their income from Social Security depended entirely
on the particular structure of the Social Security benefit formula.

Higher National Saving
Establishing personal accounts has the potential to raise national saving,
thus expanding the capital stock and increasing productive capacity, so that a
relatively smaller labor force can support a relatively larger population of
beneficiaries. If Social Security payroll taxes were saved in personal accounts
rather than used to finance an increase in non-Social Security government
spending, national saving would likely be higher. Although it is theoretically
possible, within the current system, for the government to save those excess
payroll tax revenues, the experience of the last 20 years has shown that, even
for laudable reasons, it is difficult to do so. The only truly effective way to
preserve a Social Security surplus is to put it safely beyond the grasp of those
who would spend it for other purposes, by depositing it into personal
accounts. Doing so would also make the rest of the budget more transparent,
because any non-Social Security spending in excess of non-Social Security
revenue would clearly have to be financed by issuing public debt or
increasing non-Social Security revenue.
The degree to which saving in personal accounts would increase national
saving would depend in part on whether households changed their other
personal saving in response to the accounts. Although ownership of a
personal account might dampen other personal saving to some extent, it is
unlikely that the effect would be large enough to completely offset the
expected increase in national saving. As long as other personal saving were
not reduced (and personal borrowing were not increased) one for one with
contributions to personal accounts, the net effect of the accounts would
likely be to increase national saving (provided that any forgone income tax
revenue is less than the increase in personal saving). Since many low-income
workers today have very little saving to reduce, overall personal saving should
certainly not fall one for one with increases in personal account saving.

International Experience with Personal Accounts
The United States would by no means be the first country to incorporate
an element of personal accounts into its social security system. The finances
of pay-as-you-go pension systems around the world have come under pressure, due to unachievable benefit commitments and an over-60 population
that will rise from 9 to 16 percent of the global population over the next
three decades. Finding their pay-as-you-go systems overextended, a growing
number of countries have instituted major structural reforms, including

84 | Economic Report of the President

downsizing traditional defined-benefit public pension systems and relying
increasingly on a personal account-based system that is fully funded and
based on defined contributions. In 1981 Chile became the first country to
implement a mandatory, funded system based on personal accounts.
Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom also instituted major
structural reforms in this direction during the 1980s. After a flurry of reform
activity in the 1990s, at least 22 countries have now added funded systems or
partially privatized part of the old system. Three more European countries
have also advanced proposals. The reformers are a geographically and
economically diverse set of nations, including 6 high-income industrial
countries, 10 Latin American countries, and 5 former socialist countries.
China’s autonomous province of Hong Kong has also pursued reform along
these lines.
International experience shows that pension reform seems to be one of the
most politically difficult reforms to undertake, but also that when a pension
reform is actually implemented and people are given a choice, they overwhelmingly choose personal accounts. The case of Uruguay illustrates the
popularity of personal accounts in countries that have undertaken reforms,
despite the political rhetoric that preceded those changes. In that country,
there are 600,000 contributors in the national social security system. Before
reform, a number of surveys showed that only 80,000 people would opt for
personal accounts. When the system was implemented and people were
given a choice, however, more than 400,000 chose personal accounts.
In evaluating America’s reform options in light of the experiences of other
countries, one should keep in mind the important advantages that this
Nation possesses. Indeed, few of the many countries that have converted to
personal account-based public pension systems were in as favorable a position to do so as the United States. First and foremost, the United States has
the best-developed financial markets in the world, with a wide variety of
investment vehicles and about 40 percent of world equity market capitalization. This long and broad experience with financial markets at the
institutional level offers a solid foundation for a system of personal accounts.
Another institutional advantage is the advanced degree of development of
our private pension system. In 2000, 51 percent of all wage and salary
workers had some type of private pension coverage at their current job, and
almost 80 percent of those eligible participated in defined-contribution
plans. This experience with defined-contribution plans means that a sizable
portion of the population is already well grounded in the principles necessary
for understanding and managing personal accounts. Additionally, the prevalence of these private plans means that much of the basic financial
infrastructure needed for personal accounts is already in place.

Chapter 2

| 85

The Financial Sustainability of Social Security
A system of personal accounts based on individual wealth accumulation
has many advantages over alternative methods of financing retirement.
Whether or not personal accounts become part of the solution, however,
Social Security reform is a necessity. The Social Security system faces a severe,
long-term financing shortfall. Put simply, the system does not have a dedicated income stream sufficient to pay the benefits scheduled under current
law. According to intermediate projections of the Social Security
Administration, by 2016 the system will begin running persistent cash flow
deficits; by 2050 the current benefit structure would cost nearly 18 percent
of the Nation’s payroll, whereas program revenue would be just over 13 percent.

Adverse Demographic Trends
The need for reform arises because the structure of the current system is on
a collision course with the changing demographics of our country. In a
funded pension system, the resources available to pay retirement benefits
depend on the assets put into the system for that purpose and the rate of
return those assets earn, not on demographics. Because Social Security is
unfunded, however, demographic trends can play an important role in
system finances and in determining the rate of return that workers earn on
their Social Security contributions. The ability of an unfunded Social
Security system to pay benefits to retirees in a given year depends on the size
of the taxable wage base in that year. Consequently, demographic trends that
decrease the number of workers available to support each beneficiary, referred
to as the worker-to-beneficiary ratio, reduce the ability of an unfunded
system to pay retirees without raising taxes or reducing benefits. In the
United States, lagging birthrates and increasing life expectancies, together
with the aging of the baby-boom generation, will put tremendous pressure
on the Social Security system.
The baby-boom generation, defined as those Americans born between
1946 and 1964, was a major demographic boon for the United States. In
particular, the birth of many new workers-to-be during those years was a
major blessing for a pay-as-you-go Social Security system that operates best
with a large number of workers for each benefit recipient. The total U.S.
fertility rate (roughly speaking, the number of children the average woman
would have in her lifetime, based on current births) climbed steadily through
the 1940s and 1950s, from 2.2 children per woman in 1940 to a peak of 3.7
in 1957. Unfortunately for Social Security, which depends on the younger
generations to finance the retirement of workers in the older generation,
fertility rates subsequently fell to pre-baby boom rates. By the mid-1970s, the
total fertility rate had fallen by half from its peak, to just 1.8. It presently
stands at around 2 children per woman and is not projected to change
substantially in the foreseeable future.
86 | Economic Report of the President

These lower birthrates are especially problematic given the aging of the
baby-boom generation. Beginning in 2008, the first of the baby boomers will
be eligible for early retirement under Social Security rules. By 2026 the
youngest boomers will have reached age 62, and most of that generation
will have retired and begun to collect Social Security benefits, putting a
substantial burden on the system.
Another significant factor in the aging of the population is the fact that, as
noted previously, Americans are living longer than ever before. Of the cohort
born in 1875—the first to receive Social Security benefits—only 40 percent
survived to age 65, and those who did lived an average of 12.7 additional
years. In contrast, 69 percent of males born in 1935 lived to age 65, and
those who did could expect to survive an additional 16.2 years on average.
And among males born in 1985, 84 percent are expected to survive to age
65, and those who do will be able to look forward to an average of 19.1 years
of life in old age.
This trend toward increasing longevity, combined with the low birthrate,
implies an aging of the overall population. The share of the population over
age 65 will increase from 12.4 percent today to 20.9 percent by the 2050s.
Moreover, the “oldest old,” those aged 85 and older, will more than double
their share of the population, from 1.5 percent today to 3.7 percent in 2050.
The combined effect of these fertility and longevity patterns is to reduce
the number of people of working age relative to the number collecting Social
Security benefits. Chart 2-3 displays the declining ratio of 20- to 64-year-olds
to individuals aged 65 and over. The change in this ratio over time reflects
fertility and longevity trends and, together with changes in labor supply and
Social Security rules, accounts for the change in the worker-to-beneficiary
ratio discussed previously. Today there are approximately 4.8 people of
working age for each person 65 or over; by 2030 that ratio will have dropped
to 2.8, and by 2075 it will be 2.4. The bottom line is that there will be relatively fewer people of working age to support a growing elderly population.
Because Social Security is primarily unfunded in its current form, the declining
ratio of young to old foretells serious solvency problems for Social Security.

Insolvency on the Horizon
Beginning in 2016, as noted previously, payments to Social Security
beneficiaries are projected to exceed revenue to Social Security from payroll
taxes and taxes on benefits. The result will be annual cash flow deficits for the
system, which are projected to continue indefinitely. Although the trust fund
will have a positive balance at that time, allowing Social Security to continue
paying full benefits, the Federal Government will be forced to find a way to
finance those benefit payments that exceed the revenue generated by payroll
and benefit taxation. In that first year of cash deficits, the projected shortfall
amounts to $17.4 billion in 2001 dollars. Just 4 years later, however, the
Chapter 2

| 87

annual deficit will have jumped to $99.3 billion. By 2030 Social Security will
face a $270.8 billion annual cash shortfall, representing over 4 percent of
taxable payroll, and deficits will continue to worsen for the foreseeable
future. Until the trust fund becomes insolvent in 2038, Social Security will
finance these cash deficits by redeeming bonds from the trust fund, but this
will put a large strain on the rest of the Federal Government’s budget.
Financing these cash shortfalls, therefore, requires that the government
increase revenue to the system or slow the growth rate of outlays.
Meanwhile, because of the aging of the population, the non-Social
Security portion of the Federal budget will face increasing pressure from
other sources as well, further complicating the overall fiscal situation.
Medicare will demand an increasing share of the Nation’s resources, reducing
the government’s flexibility in addressing Social Security financing issues
within the budget. An amount equivalent to 2.3 percent of GDP goes to
Medicare today, and the program’s claim on GDP is projected to rise to
8.5 percent by 2075. Absent structural reforms, Medicare and Social Security
together will consume more than 15 percent of GDP by that year. By
comparison, all personal income taxes paid to the Federal Government today
amount to only about 9 percent of GDP.

88 | Economic Report of the President

Restoring Fiscal Balance
To solve the serious long-term financing shortfall facing Social Security,
some combination of the following two measures is required:
• Future Social Security resources must be increased beyond currently
legislated levels, or
• Future Social Security spending growth must be reduced from
currently legislated levels.
Every policy proposal to solve the Social Security financing problem,
including those that utilize personal accounts, must follow one or both of
these two approaches. Thus restoration of fiscal balance to the system will
require some combination of a resource increase to support the benefit structure and a reduction in the rate of traditional benefit growth to a level that
can be paid by currently legislated tax rates.
Regardless of the path selected, personal accounts would provide participants
with the opportunity to increase their expected benefits by investing in a
diversified portfolio of assets. Historically, private sector investments have
consistently delivered higher returns than government securities over long
time horizons. If the future is like the past, personal accounts could provide
individuals with higher benefits than in the absence of personal accounts. As
such, personal accounts provide an opportunity to increase the expected
benefits of participants relative to any comparably funded system that lacks
personal accounts, and are therefore an important component of plans to
restore fiscal soundness to the Social Security system.
Increases in the system’s resources could take a number of forms. One
possibility is an increase in the payroll tax, either by an increase in tax rates or
by an expansion of the taxable earnings base. For perspective, if taxes were
increased each year just enough to cover the contemporaneous benefit shortfall, combined employer and employee Social Security payroll tax rates would
need to rise from their current level of 12.4 percent to 14.1 percent by 2020,
16.6 percent by 2030, and 17 percent by 2040. Increasing payroll taxes on
this basis would be detrimental to economic growth and ultimately unsustainable, and the President, in enunciating his principles of Social Security
reform, has ruled out such an approach. Alternatively, current law benefits
could be paid by raising general revenue to support the system, but this
would require a comparable income tax increase or a comparable reduction
in non-Social Security spending. Yet another possibility is for the government
to borrow the necessary funds. Any borrowing, however, would have to be
repaid by some future generation through higher taxes or decreased
spending. Debt financing alone cannot be a permanent solution in any case,
because in the absence of structural reform, the debt could never be repaid, as
Social Security’s cash shortfalls are projected to continue indefinitely.

Chapter 2

| 89

An alternative to increasing revenue to pay for currently legislated benefit
payments is to place the benefit formula on a more sustainable course. The
President has made it clear that benefits for current retirees, and for persons
nearing retirement, should not be changed. However, under the existing
benefit formula, benefits for future retirees are scheduled to rise substantially
above current levels in real terms. One way to achieve fiscal sustainability is
to restrain the rate of future benefit growth.
Many specific policy changes could be used to slow the rate of benefit
growth. For example, future growth in initial benefits could be indexed by
price growth rather than by wage growth in the economy, as now. According
to intermediate projections of the Social Security trustees, wage growth is
expected to exceed price growth by approximately 1 percentage point a year.
Indexing benefits to price inflation would keep benefits fixed at their current
real level, significantly reducing future system costs. In fact, according to the
Social Security actuaries, price indexing alone would suffice to close the
entire 75-year actuarial deficit. This approach would entail no real benefit
reductions or tax increases relative to current tax and benefit levels. Another
possible change to reduce benefit growth would be to adjust benefit levels in
accordance with increases in life expectancy.

Personal Accounts and Fiscal Sustainability
In assessing any reform proposal, it is important to remember that the
need for action to restore fiscal sustainability is independent of whether
personal accounts are implemented. It would be possible to restore fiscal
sustainability without personal accounts, simply by raising taxes or reducing
benefit growth, and it would be possible to introduce personal accounts in a
way that does not contribute to fiscal sustainability. A well-designed reform
package, however, would provide workers with the opportunity to benefit
from personal accounts and would, simultaneously, help restore fiscal
soundness to the Social Security system.
Many specific design elements in Social Security reform will determine
how personal accounts and fiscal sustainability will interact. It is possible to
design personal accounts that are wholly separate from the traditional Social
Security system; for example, they could be funded entirely by new contributions or from general revenue. In that case the accounts would neither
improve nor worsen the underlying fiscal status of the traditional system. On
the other hand, many proposals would integrate the two systems by allowing
for a redirection of current payroll tax revenue to fund the personal accounts.
In this type of proposal, it is appropriate to construct a “benefit offset,” that
is, an amount by which a person can choose to have his or her traditional
benefit reduced in order to have the opportunity to invest in the personal
account. Depending on how this offset is constructed, the decision to choose
90 | Economic Report of the President

a personal account can have implications for system finances. If, on the one
hand, the individual is required to forgo a portion of benefits that is actuarially equivalent to the portion that would have been paid with those
redirected payroll taxes, the long-run effect of this choice on system finances
will be neutral. On the other hand, if the benefit offset deviates from
actuarial equivalence, it can have a long-run effect on system finances.
This discussion has focused on the long-run fiscal effects of specific
alternative reforms. During a temporary transition period, movement to a
system of personal accounts would require additional funds in order to
make scheduled payments to current and near-retirees while simultaneously
funding the new personal accounts. This is sometimes referred to as a transition cost, but it is more appropriate to think of it as a national economic
investment. These funds would not be spent on consumption, but rather
saved to finance future retirement benefits through the personal accounts.
This prefunding of benefits is the mechanism by which national saving
will be increased. Indeed, ultimately, it is only by such a reduction in
consumption that saving can be increased.

Baselines for Comparison
As the Nation debates plans to reform Social Security and considers
personal accounts as a component of that reform, it is important to keep in
mind the appropriateness of the standards by which any proposed reform is
assessed. It has become clear that the Social Security system is unsustainable
in its present form. As noted above, options for resolving the system’s longrange financing issues include increasing system revenue and reducing the
rate of growth of system outlays. Because the full benefits scheduled under
current law cannot be paid without taking one or the other of these steps, or
some combination, it is not appropriate to compare a reformed system with
the present, unsustainable system without specifying how “current law” will
be brought into fiscal balance. In other words, one set of options for
achieving sustainability should be compared with other sets of options for
doing so; comparing any set of options for achieving sustainability with the
current unsustainable program is neither meaningful economically nor
informative to the public.
There are many alternative baselines that one could use in this comparison.
One approach is to measure reform proposals against the benefit levels that
could feasibly be paid given current Social Security payroll tax rates. In 2040,
for example, without tax increases, benefits would have to be 27 percent
lower than under current law. Alternatively, if one wishes to use currently
scheduled benefits as a basis for comparison, it is necessary to specify the
source of the funding required to finance those benefits.

Chapter 2

The effectiveness of a particular proposal for reform cannot be judged
solely on the basis of tax rates and benefit levels under that proposal,
however. The change in the total projected future burden on taxpayers
resulting from the reform must also be considered. This total projected
burden is the sum of explicit national debt and the present value of the benefits scheduled to be paid under today’s primarily pay-as-you-go system.
Although the present value of currently scheduled benefit payments to future
Social Security recipients can be changed through reform of the system, the
value of this implicit burden can be thought of as a form of implicit “debt”
on the part of the government. If the current schedule of future benefit
payments were binding and were feasible, which it is not, the government
would find itself in the situation of paying people alive today about $10 trillion more in future benefits than it would have collected from them in the
form of future payroll taxes. A complete accounting of a Social Security
reform’s effect on national saving and the country’s fiscal situation should
recognize the change in this potential burden on the Federal Government.
It is important to understand how any proposed reform would change the
combined level of the explicit debt and the implicit burden imposed by
scheduled benefits. For example, a change to the current system could make
the country as a whole better off by decreasing the total national obligation
even while increasing explicit, publicly held debt. This scenario could arise if
a transition to a new system with a lower total projected burden were
financed by converting a portion of future benefit payments into explicit
debt. Under current accounting rules, which document only explicit debt,
the Nation would appear to be worse off after such a transition. In reality,
however, the overall fiscal health of the Nation might actually have improved.
Because of this discrepancy, it is essential that reform proposals clearly specify
not only what benefits and taxes would be after reform, but also how the
total future burden of the program on future generations would change.

Other Sources of Retirement Security
As the earlier discussion of current sources of retirement income emphasized,
Social Security is not the sole source of support for the elderly. Nor is it
meant to be. The current average Social Security benefit, for instance, is
equal to only about 36 percent of the average worker’s wage. Already today,
workers need to supplement their Social Security benefits with income from
other sources in order to maintain a lifestyle in retirement similar to what
they enjoyed while working. With rising out-of-pocket medical expenditures,
an increasing number of years spent in retirement, and an unsustainable
Social Security system, the need to diversify retirement wealth is imperative
92 | Economic Report of the President

as we move into the future. Personal saving, undertaken both independently
and through employer-sponsored pension plans, is an increasingly important
element of retirement security.
The role of public policy in ensuring retirement security by no means ends
with Social Security. The government can continue to adopt tax policies that
reward and encourage the efforts of workers to plan for their own future.
Creating a friendly environment for retirement saving requires an awareness
of the ways in which the tax structure might encourage or discourage people’s
efforts to save. The income tax, one of the most basic components of the tax
system, may discourage saving by reducing after-tax returns. This is particularly true for capital income, which is often taxed twice: once at the level of
the corporation, and once at the individual level. Recognizing this fact,
certain mechanisms that reduce the burden of the income tax have been built
into the tax system in order to encourage saving for a variety of purposes, but
especially for retirement. IRAs and 401(k) plans are the most prominent
examples of such tax-preferred vehicles, but there are many less well known
arrangements as well.

Employer-Sponsored Pension Plans
One important means by which the government encourages saving for
retirement is through provisions in the tax code that grant special tax status
to profit-sharing and employer-sponsored pension plans. Generally, contributions made by an employer to a defined-benefit or a defined-contribution
plan, including a 401(k) plan, on behalf of an employee are not included in
the employee’s taxable income. This tax advantage gives employers an incentive to sponsor pension plans for their employees, thus increasing retirement
saving. These plans also have the advantage that earnings on invested contributions are not taxed until they are withdrawn, offering participants the
possibility of being subject to a lower tax rate in retirement. Moreover, even
if the owner’s tax rate has not declined, there is an advantage from the
deferral of taxes on returns accumulated within the account, effectively
lowering the tax rate on such saving.
Employer-sponsored pensions will continue to increase in importance as a
source of retirement income, as evidenced by the fact that a substantially
larger share of current workers than of current retirees have pension coverage.
As noted earlier, the 401(k) plan in particular has become increasingly
popular in recent years. In contrast to most other defined-benefit and
defined-contribution plans, in which only the employer contributes to the
plan, the employer, the employee, or both may make contributions to a
401(k) plan. These plans are expected to account for a growing share of
retirement income. By some estimates, assets in such plans could rival or

Chapter 2

| 93

even exceed total Social Security wealth by the time workers currently in
their early 30s retire. Provisions of the Economic Growth and Tax Reform
Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA), enacted in 2001, will further encourage
this form of saving by increasing the limit on individual contributions to
401(k)-type plans, as well as the limit on an employer’s deduction for contributions to certain types of defined-contribution plans. Additionally, workers
aged 50 and over will now be eligible to make “catch-up” contributions to
their 401(k)-type plans; this will help workers who might not have saved
in past years.
Although pension assets represent a large and growing share of retirement
wealth, pension coverage remains far from universal. In recent years almost
half of retirees lacked pension income or annuities, and 49 percent of those
employed lacked a pension plan. With this fact in mind, changes in tax
policy and pension law that further encourage all employers to provide plans
for their employees should continue to be explored.
The government must also work to expand its outreach to employers,
especially small businesses, to encourage retirement plan sponsorship. It
should eliminate artificial barriers to employers wishing to provide sensible
retirement advice to those who participate in pension plans. Also needed is
increased assistance to employers, plan sponsors, service providers, participants, and beneficiaries, to better inform these parties of their responsibilities
under the law. This compliance assistance will ultimately lower the cost of
investigations, judicial dispute resolution, and plan administration. Reducing
such burdens should remain an ongoing Federal goal, because efforts to that
end can yield higher retirement income for working Americans.

Individual Saving
Personal saving independent of profit-sharing plans and employer-sponsored
pensions is the third important component of retirement security. Public
policy has aimed to encourage such saving as well, most notably through
IRAs, which allow individuals to save for retirement on a tax-preferred basis.
Contributions to traditional IRAs, like those to most employer-sponsored
pensions, are tax-deductible under certain conditions, and earnings on
investments in these accounts are tax-deferred. Contributions to Roth IRAs
are not tax-deductible, but the earnings on these contributions are generally
tax-free. IRAs provide an important incentive for individuals, some of whom
may not be covered by an employer-sponsored pension plan, to invest for
retirement. And research has shown that IRAs are effective in increasing
personal saving (Box 2-4). EGTRRA greatly expanded the potential for
saving through IRAs by allowing catch-up contributions for those over age
50, raising the annual limit on contributions from $2,000 in 2001 to $5,000
by 2008, and indexing that limit to inflation thereafter.
94 | Economic Report of the President

Congress has appropriated increased resources to several Federal agencies
to promote retirement saving as well as general financial education. These
educational programs should be better coordinated to leverage best practices
and resources aimed at communicating the importance of savings, both
individually and through employer-sponsored retirement plans. Furthermore,
the Federal Government must remain a committed partner with the private
sector, both for-profit and nonprofit, to educate Americans about the need
and opportunities to save.
Other features of the tax code might also encourage saving for retirement
by relieving some of the burden of the income tax system. As one example,
medical savings accounts may be a useful mechanism for some people
wishing to save in anticipation of possibly large out-of-pocket medical
expenses related to old age.

Box 2-4. The Effectiveness of Saving Incentives
How effective are targeted saving incentives such as IRAs and
401(k)s at increasing saving? The answer depends, first, on how much
“new” saving these incentives generate, and second, on the cost of
achieving that saving, in terms of tax revenue forgone.
The first question can be addressed by considering two possible
extremes. One is that all saving in IRAs, for example, is new saving—
saving that would not have happened were it not for the tax incentives
associated with saving in an IRA. At the other extreme, it could be that
all saving in IRAs is saving that would have happened even without the
incentive. The question then becomes where, between these two
extremes, the actual fraction of new saving lies. This question is widely
debated, but estimates suggest that 26 cents of every dollar in IRA
contributions represents new saving.
Whatever the amount of new saving is determined to be, is it worth
the cost in terms of forgone tax revenue? A useful measure for
answering that question is the amount of new saving per dollar of
revenue cost. Estimates of this measure have indicated that IRAs need
not generate considerable new saving per dollar of lost revenue to
generate increases in the capital stock that are “inexpensive” relative
to the initial revenue loss. This cost-effectiveness of IRAs results
because contributions to IRAs lead to a larger capital stock and faster
growth. This faster growth translates into higher corporate revenue
and, thus, higher tax revenue that more than makes up for the forgone
tax revenue associated with IRA contributions.

Fostering Self-Reliance
The key principle underlying all of America’s retirement security institutions
should be individual self-reliance in planning for retirement. Personal Social
Security accounts, private pension plans, and vehicles for individual saving all
aim to encourage and support individuals’ efforts to prepare for their own
financial future. Pension plans and saving vehicles allow individuals to save
for retirement on a tax-preferred basis by reducing obstacles to saving
inherent in the income tax system.
In a Social Security system with personal accounts, participants will take a
more active role in exercising direct control over their retirement wealth, as
participants in defined-contribution pension plans and IRAs already do.
Lower income individuals will find in personal accounts a mechanism by
which they can play a larger role in their own financial destiny. Meanwhile
the defined-benefit element of Social Security will continue to provide a
foundation of retirement income for those for whom lower resources represent
an obstacle to complete self-reliance in retirement planning.

Meeting the Challenge of Retirement Security
The major challenge facing America’s retirement security institutions in
the 21st century is how to enable a relatively smaller work force to support a
growing elderly population. To meet that challenge, we must fortify all three
legs of the retirement stool: individual saving, employer-provided pensions,
and Social Security. Today the task at hand is to strengthen each of these
institutions to serve our needs tomorrow by encouraging public policy that
focuses on individual self-reliance in retirement planning.
Social Security is the retirement institution most urgently in need of
rebuilding. Simply put, the system will not take in enough in payroll taxes
over the coming years to pay the scheduled level of benefits to retirees.
Correcting this problem will require some combination of increasing
resources to Social Security and slowing the growth rate of outlays. However,
this difficult situation also offers an opportunity to build for the future.
Restructuring the current system to include personal accounts could improve
Social Security’s fiscal situation while giving workers a sense of ownership, an
element of choice, and the opportunity to leave something to their heirs.
Personal accounts could also increase national saving, helping to grow the
economy and support a relatively larger elderly population.
A Social Security system made sustainable is just one component of a
complete foundation for retirement security. Personal saving, undertaken
both independently and through employer-sponsored pension plans, is also
essential for ensuring the financial well-being of future retirees. Employer
96 | Economic Report of the President

pensions have seen considerable growth over the past two decades and should
continue to grow. Individual saving outside of these plans, on the other
hand, has lagged recently. Tax policy should follow the lead of EGTRRA and
continue to develop in ways that encourage, rather than punish, these forms
of saving.
Meeting the needs of a growing retired population with a relatively smaller
work force is a new challenge for the United States, but it is not by any
means an insurmountable one. What lies ahead is clear. What we must do to
prepare is also clear. We must reinforce our existing retirement security institutions and use them to begin raising national saving right away. These steps
will pave the way for a secure retirement for Americans and a prosperous
future for the whole country.

Realizing Gains from Competition

T

he organization of the firms that contribute to our Nation’s economic
output is constantly in flux. Some changes in organization are limited to
a firm’s internal operations, as when firms develop innovative ways to
produce an existing good or service, or introduce incentives that encourage
workers to be more efficient. Other organizational changes involve changing
a firm’s size or scope. This might include expanding production or offering
new goods or services, to gain a greater share of a market or to broaden the
firm’s geographic reach. Finally, firms may alter their relationships with other
firms that supply them, buy from them, or compete with them. For instance,
they might merge to combine operations with a former rival, or outsource
some part of their operations to another firm.
Some of these changes may be quite visible to consumers. They may
change the names of companies with which consumers have become familiar.
They may even affect the types of products available in the market. Other
changes may be less visible.
At the same time, the overall composition of the economy is also undergoing
constant change. In particular, high-technology industries such as biotechnology and information technology have become a much more prominent
part of the economy than they were even a decade ago. Innovations are
central to the success of the firms that make up these industries. These innovations have brought us remarkably more powerful computers, more
effective drug therapies, and much else.
One might naturally ask what the Federal Government’s role in the
economy should be in light of these ongoing changes in the organization of
firms and the composition of the economy. The vast majority of firms face
healthy competition from other firms. A great virtue of this competition is
that it yields a number of benefits for consumers without the need for
government to intervene in the day-to-day decisions of firms. First, competition keeps prices low. Competition in its various forms discourages any one
firm from raising prices above what others would charge for similar goods or
services. Second, competition ensures that only those firms that can meet
consumer demands at the lowest possible cost will remain viable. Finally,
competition encourages innovation in products and services, as well as in
production and distribution methods, among other things.
Many of the organizational adjustments that firms undertake are necessary
responses to changing conditions, as competition motivates them to
99

constantly seek ways to lower their costs and improve their products. But in
some limited cases these changes in organization may have the effect of
reducing the vigor of competition. Recognizing this possibility, since the end
of the 19th century all three branches of the Federal Government have
contributed to the development of antitrust policy, a particularly important
component of competition policy.
Three laws passed by Congress form the statutory basis of antitrust policy
in the United States. Together, the Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton Act of
1914, and the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 set forth broad principles forbidding behavior or changes in the organization and relationships of
firms that may harm competition. The specific implications of these laws
have evolved as Federal courts have interpreted their broad principles in
deciding cases brought before them. Two Federal agencies, the Department
of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), actively enforce these
laws. Under the Sherman and Clayton Acts, private individuals and firms
may also bring suit against firms they believe are engaged in anticompetitive
practices. As the courts consider each new case, they are given an opportunity
to further refine their interpretation of these antitrust laws.
Competition policy seeks to prevent behavior and changes in the
organization and relationships of firms that may harm competition and
therefore consumers. But the fundamental challenge in developing competition policy is to ensure that government measures intended to accomplish
this goal do not inadvertently prevent the other, more beneficial behavior
and changes that firms undertake. To do so would handicap the ability of
firms to lower their costs, improve their products, and thereby benefit
consumers and society generally.
This chapter examines the various motivations for changes in the
organization of firms, and the resulting implications for competition policy.
It begins by focusing on what motivates a firm to combine its assets with
those of other firms or to take a financial interest in them. Taking as a
starting point the progress that has been made in policies relating to mergers,
the chapter then discusses how economic ideas and analysis have been and
can continue to be incorporated in the ongoing refinement of competition
policy. Next, in view of the increasingly global markets in which firms
compete, the chapter addresses how the international nature of competition
and of some firms’ operations can affect both the motivations for changes in
their organization and the impact of other nations’ competition policies on
our economy. Finally, the chapter addresses the implications for competition
policy of the increasingly prominent role of innovation-intensive industries
in the economy.
The longstanding core principles of U.S. competition policy remain
sound. But competition policy continues to evolve to recognize changes in
100 | Economic Report of the President

modern firm structures, market competition, dynamic forms of competition,
and advances in our knowledge of the effects of firm behavior. This evolution
is proceeding along several fronts. First, because firms today are engaging not
only in mergers, but also in hybrid organizational forms such as partial acquisitions and joint ventures, policy must be sensitive to the efficiency gains
these forms of organization create. Second, because firms’ activities, and
therefore national competition policies, more frequently cross international
borders than in the past, inefficient competition policies in any one nation
may impose costs on firms and consumers worldwide. The United States is
pursuing harmonization of these policies in a way that will spread bestpractice and efficient competition policy to all countries. Finally, industries
characterized by active innovation and dynamic competition are raising new
issues for competition policy, which must respond in ways that foster this
innovative activity and maximize the resulting benefits to society.

Motivations for Organizational Change
Firms may change their organization for any of a number of reasons. One
of the fundamental forces driving the behavior of firms is the desire to maximize their profits. This leads firms to strive constantly to minimize the costs
and maximize the value of the goods and services they produce.
Meanwhile developments in individual markets and in the broader
economy are constantly changing the costs associated with each of the
various ways that firms can choose to organize their operations. These developments may also alter the business opportunities they face, perhaps opening
new markets or affecting the competition they encounter. In the past two
decades, some of the most significant of these developments have been
improvements in the power and reductions in the costs of information technology; deregulation of certain industries; and the globalization of markets.
These or other developments may make it profitable for firms to alter their
organization or operations.
The work of Nobel Prize-winning economist Ronald Coase provides a
framework for understanding how and why firms might restructure their
organizations in response to developments such as these. Coase views a firm’s
operations, internal and external, as a set of transactions, whether it be
obtaining materials for production or arranging for the promotion of the
firm’s products. To maximize its profits, the firm will seek to minimize the
cost of each of these transactions. These costs are influenced in part by
whether the transaction is performed within the firm or with another party
on the open market. The relative costs of these two options will largely determine which one the firm will choose. When developments in its markets or
Chapter 3

| 101

in the broader economy change these relative costs, the firm will review these
options and may decide to change an internal transaction to an external one,
or vice versa. The result is a change in its organizational structure. For
instance, a firm may perceive an opportunity to outsource some of its inventory management to another firm that specializes in that task. But if this task
needs to be closely integrated with other operations in the firm, outsourcing
may become preferable only when communications costs fall below some
threshold. In this chapter we address the fact that firms today face more than
just two alternatives in choosing how to organize their operations. We highlight some of the alternatives that constitute particularly important
developments in the organization of firms and industries for the future.

The Role of Agency Costs in Organizational Change
Agency costs are an important component of costs that a firm can lower by
adjusting its organizational structure. They can arise whenever one person or
firm (the agent) contracts to perform certain tasks for another (the principal).
Differing incentives facing the two parties, coupled with the inability of the
principal to costlessly monitor the agent’s actions, cause the latter to perform
the contracted tasks in a way that does not best serve the principal’s interest.
Ultimately, a firm’s owners (in the case of a corporation, its shareholders) are
those most interested in maximizing its profits. Not only are they the residual
claimants on the firm’s profits, but the value of their shares is affected by
expectations of those profits today and in the future. Yet there are many
others, both within and outside the firm, whose actions affect the firm’s
profits but who do not benefit enough from an increase in those profits to
make maximizing them their only objective.
For example, the decisions of a firm’s chief executive officer (CEO) can
clearly have a significant effect on the firm’s profits. Although the CEO may
be interested in maximizing those profits, he or she may also have other,
conflicting objectives: perhaps the CEO would like to increase his or her
perquisites by purchasing a company jet, even though that would not be an
efficient allocation of the firm’s resources. Because the CEO runs the firm’s
day-to-day operations, the CEO is an agent of the firm’s shareholders, and
the cost associated with the CEO’s pursuit of interests aside from profit
maximization is an agency cost. This cost arises from the separation of
ownership of the firm from control of it.
Just as they may choose to outsource an operation in order to minimize
costs, so, too, may shareholders alter the organization of their firm in order to
reduce these agency costs. Certain internal institutional arrangements can
serve to better align owner and manager incentives. For publicly traded
corporations, a commonly used compensation package for CEOs and
other senior managers consists of “pay for performance”: executive pay is
102 | Economic Report of the President

determined in part by bonuses based on sales or profits, often coupled with
the grant of stock options. When managers own stock or stock options in the
company they manage, their interests become more aligned with the shareholders’ interests. One study found that, with the recent dramatic increases
in such forms of compensation, the average effect of a change in the value of
a firm on its CEO’s wealth grew by almost a factor of 10 between 1980 and
1998. Clearly, pay for performance has become an increasingly prominent
feature of corporate life, suggesting that it may prove a valuable way for
shareholders to reduce agency costs.
In addition to the CEO, many other individuals and entities influence a
firm’s profits, and so a comprehensive definition of agency costs must include
costs due to their actions as well. Therefore changes in the organization of
firms designed to reduce agency costs may extend well beyond arrangements
for compensating managers. For instance, if the actions of a particular
supplier can significantly affect a firm’s profits, the firm may seek to arrange
its relationship with that supplier in a way that aligns the supplier’s interests
more closely with those of the firm’s shareholders. Much as in the case of pay
for performance contracts, this may be achieved by having the supplier hold
stock in the firm.

Mergers
One of the most visible manifestations of changes in the organization of
firms is the growing number and value of mergers and acquisitions. During
the second half of the 1990s the United States witnessed a remarkable
surge in merger activity (Chart 3-1). Indeed, even with the economic slowdown, merger activity in 2001 was well above average levels during the past
three decades.
In a significant share of mergers today, one or both parties are firms with
operations in more than one country, and many mergers even involve firms
with headquarters in different countries. These are often referred to as crossborder mergers. In 2001, 29 percent of all announced mergers and acquisitions
in which a U.S.-headquartered firm was a party also involved either a foreign
buyer or a foreign seller. This was a markedly higher percentage than was
common during much of the 1970s and 1980s (Chart 3-2).
Although general economic theory and empirical research provide a broad
framework within which to understand organizational changes across firm
boundaries, such as mergers, a substantial body of research has developed
that specifically examines the motivations for mergers. The motivations
behind each merger are, of course, unique. But some mergers may share
certain motivations, and motivations may generally differ across the three
broad types of mergers: horizontal, vertical, and conglomerate. Horizontal
mergers involve a joining of firms that compete in the same market; vertical
Chapter 3

| 103

104 | Economic Report of the President

mergers occur when a customer buys a supplier, or vice versa; and conglomerate
mergers join firms in different businesses. The international nature of
cross-border mergers adds another set of potential motivations.
One motivation for mergers is efficiency gains. Two firms may consummate
a merger because they expect that the assets of the two firms can be used
more efficiently in combination than separately. This might be achieved if
merging allows them to lower their costs, improve their products, or expand
their operations more effectively than they could as separate entities.
In some cases these efficiencies can be realized through cost savings arising
from the increased size of the merged entity, often referred to as economies of
scale or scope. This may result from consolidating and spreading certain fixed
overhead costs across the combined operations. For instance, economies of
scale appeared to be a factor motivating mergers and acquisitions in the food
retailing industry during the late 1990s. When two supermarket chains
merge, distribution centers made redundant by the merger can be eliminated, and the costs of the remaining distribution centers can be spread over
a larger number of supermarkets.
In a horizontal merger, efficiencies might also come from combining the
best elements of each firm’s operations. One motivation for vertical mergers
may be that certain transactions between a supplier and a customer are
particularly difficult to arrange between independent firms and can be more
efficiently arranged if both parties are part of the same firm. Vertical mergers
may also be an efficient method of removing pricing distortions that arise
when firms transact with one another in the chain of production, each
adding its margin along the way. Elimination of these so-called double
margins leads to lower final product prices.
Reduction of agency costs, discussed above, can be another significant
source of efficiencies. If a corporation’s executives are unwilling to make or
incapable of making decisions to increase shareholders’ profits, they may be
replaced in a merger or acquisition. Or if the firm has assets that a new set of
managers could put to higher value use, the firm may be acquired and new,
better managers introduced. In some cases, the existing management team
may be underperforming because the incentives it faces may be inadequate
for it to act in the shareholders’ interest, or may even promote behavior that
runs counter to their interest. The acquisition or merger of such a firm
provides a valuable opportunity for new owners not only to replace management, but also to change the firm’s governance structure in order to fix these
inadequate or perverse incentives.
Although merger and acquisition activity may sometimes be a response to
agency problems, in some settings it may actually be a manifestation of such
problems. Some acquisitions may be motivated by a manager’s ambition
to increase the size of the firm under his or her control, even though the
Chapter 3

| 105

acquisition is likely to reduce the shareholders’ profits. But research also
suggests that such poor acquisitions can increase the likelihood that the
acquirer itself will become a target for acquisition.
Cross-border mergers can enjoy efficiencies similar to those described
above, but the international nature of these transactions introduces another
set of potential efficiency gains as well. Just as the opening of world markets
to international trade raises productivity, so, too, might a cross-border
merger create benefits that no purely domestic reorganization could achieve.
These might result, for example, from overcoming barriers to trade that
hinder a firm from exporting to another country but not from acquiring
production facilities and producing the same goods there. Other efficiency
gains from cross-border mergers might come from gaining a better understanding of customers in a foreign market, or from a company with good
products acquiring a company with good foreign distribution channels.
Alternatively, efficiencies may arise from differences in wages between countries that make it more profitable for firms to locate their labor-intensive
operations in countries with abundant unskilled labor, while locating other
operations, such as research and management, in countries where skilled
labor is relatively plentiful.
Of course, some of these gains may not require mergers, but can be realized
simply by establishing new operations overseas. But in some cases, merging
with an established firm may be more efficient. Two advantages that mergers
can provide are quicker entry into new markets and access to existing proprietary resources and capabilities, such as established brands. A further benefit
that a merger or joint venture may provide is the transfer of managerial or
technological know-how across national and firm boundaries. The transfer of
innovative manufacturing systems may be best achieved through some form
of integration. This is discussed in greater depth later in the chapter in the
context of the General Motors-Toyota joint venture.
As described above, firms constantly look for potential efficiencies from
possible mergers in order to enhance their profitability in a competitive
market. Mergers with these motivations have the potential to provide
consumers with less expensive and better products or services. But some
mergers may reduce competition. This can happen if a merger of competitors
allows the merged firm or a collection of remaining firms to raise the prices
of the goods or services they sell, or lower the prices they pay for the goods or
services they buy from suppliers. In the case of a vertical merger, a firm may
be able to reduce the competition it faces by gaining control of either an
important supplier to its industry or a significant customer. As in virtually all
transactions that come under antitrust scrutiny, this potential to reduce
competition may be either a deliberate motivation for, or an inadvertent
consequence of, the merger.
106 | Economic Report of the President

Higher prices to consumers as a result of reduced competition are due to
what economists call monopoly power, that is, the power of a single seller to
affect the market price. Lower prices to input suppliers as a result of reduced
competition are due to what economists call monopsony power, that is, the
power of a single buyer to affect the market price. Both effects are exercises of
market power, and thus a concern of competition policy. Government has a
role in preventing those mergers whose adverse effects on competition exceed
any benefit from accompanying efficiency gains. The evolving way in which
the Federal Government performs this role through its competition policy
will be described in more depth later in the chapter.

Other Organizational Forms:
Joint Ventures and Partial Equity Stakes
The various possible sources of increased efficiency from mergers,
including those that reduce agency costs, can also motivate other forms of
organizational change that do not involve complete transfer of both ownership and control. The distribution of ownership and control across parties to
an organizational structure affects the parties’ incentives and opportunities,
their ensuing decisions, and therefore the creation of social value.

Joint Ventures
A joint venture is a business entity created and jointly controlled by two or
more separate firms, each of which makes a substantial contribution to the
enterprise. Firms may seek to enter a joint venture for any of a number of
reasons. Joint ventures may allow firms to combine their complementary
skills or assets in a way that improves their ability to accomplish a project.
Such a venture may also allow the participants to expand the scale of a
project to a size necessary to realize certain cost savings. By avoiding additional costs associated with a full merger, a joint venture may best accomplish
the firms’ objectives.
One specific type of joint venture, the research joint venture, has its own
particular advantages. A joint venture to undertake scientific, technical, or
other research may appropriately reward innovation and spread development
costs in a setting where the resulting new knowledge, if created by a single
firm, would spill over to benefit others. Since in that case no single firm
would reap all the benefits of its research, a joint venture may be the most
efficient avenue for undertaking it.
But joint ventures might also raise concerns. For example, a production
joint venture between horizontal competitors might reduce their ability or
incentive to compete independently. Conceivably the participants could

Chapter 3

| 107

contribute all their manufacturing assets to the joint venture, and their
financial stakes in the joint venture could then lead to a reduction in output
by the two firms comparable to that in an anticompetitive merger. Even if
the joint venture participants retain independent production assets, the joint
venture may create the environment for the exchange of competitively sensitive information on prices and costs. This might facilitate an attempt by the
firms to raise prices in an anticompetitive manner.

Partial Equity Stakes
A merger or complete acquisition occurs when the ownership of the assets
of two firms is combined, for example through one firm’s acquisition of 100
percent of the shares of the other, or when two firms exchange all of their
shares for those of a new, successor corporation. In contrast, a partial acquisition occurs when one firm takes a partial equity stake in another firm,
which remains legally independent.
Partial equity acquisitions, like merger transactions, must be reported to
the Department of Justice and the FTC under the 1976 Hart-Scott-Rodino
Act if the transaction meets certain conditions. In fiscal 2000, 23 percent of
all transactions reported to the two agencies resulted in the acquirer
having less than a 50 percent share of the target firm’s equity. Although these
may be supplemented by later purchases, it suggests that partial purchases are
not uncommon.
Partial acquisitions create a form of corporate governance that raises some
basic questions about the “ownership” and “control” of one party over
another. Partial equity investments by one firm in another can grant the
investing firm substantial influence over the other firm. A majority shareholder can be presumed to exercise control, although under some constraints
imposed by the duty toward minority shareholders. But research suggests
that even ownership of far less than a majority of a company’s shares may
allow the exercise of control, if the remaining shares are widely dispersed.
PepsiCo, Inc.’s investment in the Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc., is an example
of a partial equity stake that involves some control. The Pepsi Bottling
Group is the world’s largest manufacturer, seller, and distributor of PepsiCola beverages. It has the exclusive right to manufacture, sell, and distribute
these beverages in much of the United States and Canada, as well as in Spain,
Greece, and Russia. PepsiCo holds the licenses for Pepsi-Cola beverages and
is a minority shareholder, although also the largest shareholder, in the Pepsi
Bottling Group. There is close coordination between the two businesses, but
each remains a legally independent entity whose interests are not legally
presumed to align with the other’s.
At the other extreme, an individual who buys a few shares in a public
company may do so as an investment for retirement or for other purposes.
108 | Economic Report of the President

These small purchases best exemplify so-called passive investments, in that
the shareholder has no current plans to gain influence over the firm’s conduct
or to access certain information about its operations, and there is no good
reason to expect such plans to emerge in the future. Likewise, one firm may
purchase a small equity stake in another firm without such plans or any
realistic potential for such plans to emerge.
A partial acquisition can affect the firms’ subsequent decisions through
three distinct channels: by altering incentives, altering information, or altering
control. Through these channels, an acquisition could have anticompetitive
or pro-competitive effects. The potential anticompetitive effects are considered first, because without those effects there is no concern for antitrust policy.
Even if a firm has only a passive investment in another firm, this might,
through altering incentives, affect the former’s production and pricing decisions. For example, if firm A owns a 5 percent stake in firm B, it will make
production and pricing decisions to maximize its own profits plus 5 percent
of firm B’s profits. The acquirer of a partial equity stake will consequently
internalize some of the spillover effects of its actions on the target’s profits.
This is true whether or not the acquirer can exercise control over the target.
Such a passive investment could have an anticompetitive effect in an
imperfectly competitive market if the two firms are direct competitors. If
firm A raises its price, for example, the 5 percent stake in firm B could reduce
the effect of any loss of customers on firm A’s profits because some of the lost
customers would begin purchasing from firm B. Firm A would capture part
of firm B’s increased profits, reducing its overall losses from raising prices.
This diminishes firm A’s incentives to keep prices at a competitive level.
Nonetheless, this concern should not arise if other firms in the market are
able to expand their output and win most of the customers that firm A loses
when it raises its prices. Thus competition guards against the rise in prices.
The information effect arises from closer unilateral or bilateral communication between the partial acquirer and the target about business operations.
For example, if the partial acquirer receives a seat on the target’s board of
directors, that may become an avenue for improved communication between
the firms. This improved communication could facilitate anticompetitive
conduct, for example if two competitors attempted to coordinate a rise in prices.
Finally, a partial acquirer may be able to influence the target’s business
decisions through the control effect. This could have anticompetitive consequences if the two firms are competitors. For example, the acquirer might
raise its price and exert its influence so that the target responds by increasing
its own price. But these effects can also be prevented if other firms in the
market expand their output in response to higher prices.
Partial acquisitions may have socially desirable consequences, operating
through these same channels. In particular, partial equity stakes may be
Chapter 3

| 109

undertaken as part of a larger business relationship, such as a marketing or
supply agreement. Such partial equity stakes may align incentives, internalizing spillovers in ways that are socially beneficial. These business
relationships may also be cemented by the information and control benefits
facilitated by a partial equity stake.
One study examined 402 partial ownership stakes established between
1980 and 1991 in which a nonfinancial corporation held a minimum of
5 percent of the outstanding shares of another firm. Thirty-seven percent of
the target firms had explicit business relationships with the corporation
holding their shares.
More recent, although preliminary, data suggest that about 5 percent of
Fortune 500 nonfinancial companies in 2001 had a corporate blockholder
of 5 percent or more of their shares in that year. (This sample examines
the Fortune 500 companies, excluding those in finance, insurance, real
estate, or retail trade. Companies in which there was a majority shareholder
were also excluded.) In this preliminary research, corporate blockholders
appear to be more prevalent in certain industries than others. In the rapidly
evolving telecommunications sector, for example, about a third of major U.S.
corporations had at least one corporate blockholder in 2001.
An example of how partial equity stakes may align the incentives
between parties in a business relationship is the 1997 co-production agreement between Walt Disney Company and Pixar. At the time of their
co-production agreement, Disney acquired about a 5 percent stake in Pixar.
This example is described in Box 3-1.
The potential for a partial equity stake to encourage efficiency gains in the
long-term relationship between a supplier and a customer highlights an
advantage of this form of organization. In a long-term supply relationship,
both customer and supplier may make relationship-specific investments,
such as fabricating machine tools to produce a part according to the buyer’s
specifications. If the buyer’s input needs change unexpectedly, it may want
rapid delivery of a modified input from its supplier. If the supplier has
an equity stake in the customer, and hence a claim to some of the customer’s
profits, the supplier may have a stronger incentive to meet the customer’s
request, even if it must incur overtime costs to adjust its machine tools. If the
partial equity stake allows one firm to exercise some control over the other firm,
the coordination between their operations is likely to be further strengthened.

110 | Economic Report of the President

Box 3-1. A Co-Production Agreement and a Partial Equity Stake:
Pixar and Disney
Pixar was formed in 1986. Its first fully computer-animated feature
film, “Toy Story, was released in 1995, also the year of the company’s
”
initial public offering of shares. “Toy Story” was distributed by the Walt
Disney Company, under a contract in which Disney also bore all the
budgeted production costs. In return, it received a standard distribution
fee from Pixar and the vast majority of the film’s revenue, including
about 95 percent of box office receipts during the year after its release.
In 1997 Disney and Pixar entered into a co-production agreement to
produce and distribute five new computer-animated feature films.
Under the agreement, Pixar would produce the films, on an exclusive
basis, for distribution by Disney. Disney and Pixar would split production costs and all related receipts in excess of the amount necessary to
cover Disney’s distribution costs and an associated distribution fee. The
films would also be co-branded.
This agreement was cemented by Disney’s acquisition of a partial
equity stake in Pixar. Disney initially acquired 1 million of Pixar’s shares
and received warrants to purchase up to an additional 1.5 million
shares. At the time, exercising all these warrants would have given
Disney about a 5 percent stake in Pixar.
The Pixar-Disney co-production arrangement brought “A Bug’s Life”
to the big screen in 1998, and “Monsters, Inc. in 2001. The alliance
”
benefits both companies and exploits a logical division of labor
between the firms. As Pixar’s 2000 10-K filing states, “This agreement
allows [Pixar] to focus on the production and creative development of
the films while utilizing Disney’s marketing expertise and substantial
distribution infrastructure to market and distribute our co-branded
feature films and related products.
”
An interesting wrinkle is that Disney is not only a partner with Pixar
but also a competitor. Pixar notes in its 2000 10-K filing that, under the
agreement, Disney directly shares in the profits from their co-branded
films, and therefore Pixar believes “that Disney desires such films to be
successful. But the filing also points out that, “Nonetheless, during
”
its long history, Disney has been a very successful producer and
distributor of its own animated feature films.
”
Thus, although the profit-sharing terms of the agreement give
Disney powerful incentives to use its marketing and distribution
acumen to further the success of the co-branded films, the partial
equity stake plays a complementary role. Through this investment,
Disney shares directly in Pixar’s success, and so has additional reasons
to foster the collaboration.

Incorporating Economic Insights into
Competition Policy
Economists have long studied the implications of changes in the structure
and conduct of firms, creating a body of knowledge that encompasses the
insights described above. Developments in this body of knowledge provide
an important basis for improving the effectiveness of competition policy.
The evolution of U.S. policy relating to horizontal mergers—those
between companies that compete for customers in the same market—
provides one example of how economic thought has substantially enhanced
competition policy in the past two decades. As explained above, a merger
between such companies can bring about benefits through reductions in the
cost and improvements in the quality of the merging firms’ products. But
some such mergers have the potential to harm competition. In determining
whether to challenge a particular merger, the Department of Justice or the
FTC must assess whether the merger threatens to harm competition, and
whether the potential benefits of increased efficiencies outweigh any adverse
effect the merger could have on competition. To do so, the agencies have
developed an analytical framework that allows them to move from a set of
observable characteristics of the merging firms and the markets in which they
compete to an assessment of the likely competitive effect of the transaction,
balanced against any efficiency benefits.
The analytical framework used is important in that it influences the types
of characteristics considered in evaluating mergers and related acquisitions,
whether the enforcement agencies challenge them, and how they are ultimately viewed by the courts. This framework provides a focus for arguments
about the merits of or problems associated with a merger. Finally, an analytical framework that is consistently adhered to increases firms’ ability to assess
whether a merger they are considering will be challenged, before they embark
on the costly process of initiating it.
It is in contributing to the improvement of this analytical framework that
developments in economic thought have significantly affected merger policy.
This effect is visible in the evolution of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines, a
description of this framework that was first established by the Department of
Justice in 1968 and periodically revised since then by both the Justice
Department and the FTC. Although the need for flexibility in enforcing
antitrust law causes these guidelines to be somewhat general in nature, the
trend toward an increasing incorporation of a rigorous economic framework
is nonetheless still apparent in the periodic revisions to the guidelines.
Because the ability to gain the favorable ruling of a judge in an antitrust case
affects these agencies’ ability to successfully challenge mergers, changes in the

112 | Economic Report of the President

guidelines also to some extent reflect accompanying changes in the judicial
interpretation of antitrust law.
Of the various revisions made during the past two decades, the 1982
guidelines and the revisions made to them in 1984 together marked the most
dramatic departure from prior guidelines in their incorporation of contemporary economic thought. One significant advance in these revisions was a
shift away from a singular focus on market concentration in assessing the
effect of a merger. Market concentration is a measure of the extent to which
the supply of products and services in a particular market is concentrated
among few providers. The earlier focus was consistent with economic
thinking, developed in the middle decades of the twentieth century,
according to which increases in the concentration of markets harmed
competition. As a result, in the 1960s, mergers that raised concentration
by increasing a firm’s market share to even as little as 5 percent were at risk
of being challenged.
The 1982 and 1984 revisions reflected an evolving economic perspective
on the effect of concentration on competition in a market. This perspective
had been increasingly gaining judicial recognition by the mid-1970s.
Theoretical and empirical work had begun to call into question the idea that
there is a simple link between a market’s concentration and the intensity of
competition in that market. By 1982, judicial decisions and enforcement
policies had already begun to incorporate the conclusion from economic
research that, although high concentration could contribute to reduced
competition, by itself it was not sufficient to bring about that outcome. Thus
the 1982 and 1984 revisions codified the increasingly accepted view that
examining market concentration provides only a useful first step in considering whether a merger raises competitive concerns, and that other factors
needed to be present to validate this concern. In line with this view, the revisions described quantitative levels of market concentration and changes
therein that would likely cause the Justice Department and the FTC to go on
to examine the full set of factors and possibly challenge a merger. The 1984
guidelines also clearly established a level of market concentration below
which, “except in extraordinary circumstances,” mergers would not be challenged. This “safe harbor” level of market concentration is important in that
it reduces the uncertainty that firms considering a merger may have about
how the government will respond. Such a clear safe harbor was absent in the
1968 guidelines.
One of the additional factors that the 1980s revisions incorporated as an
important consideration in evaluating the intensity of competition in a
market was the ease with which new firms could enter that market. Although
existing firms in a market are the most visible source of competition for
each other, they are not the only source. In considering whether it would be
Chapter 3

| 113

profitable to raise prices above existing levels, a firm or group of firms must
not only consider the response of firms already in the market. They must also
consider the possibility that higher prices will encourage other firms to enter
the market, adding to competition. Thus, in some cases, even if there are few
firms in a market today, the threat of new firms entering tomorrow can
provide a strong incentive for incumbent firms to keep prices competitive. In
an improvement on the earlier merger guidelines, the 1980s guidelines recognized that a merger could only harm competition if there were reasons to
believe that other firms would not or could not enter the market to the
extent necessary to keep the merging firms from maintaining prices above
premerger levels.
Another substantial advance in the 1984 guidelines, and improved upon
since then, was a greater recognition of potential efficiency gains from
mergers. Today it is widely accepted among economists that mergers should
be evaluated in terms of a tradeoff between any potential adverse impact on
competition and their potential enhancement of competition by improving
the merging firms’ operations. The 1968 guidelines had focused attention
almost exclusively on whether a merger could harm competition, with little
consideration given to the potential benefits, because these were considered
hard to evaluate and often realizable by other means. In contrast, the 1984
guidelines recognized that mergers that might otherwise be challenged may
nonetheless be “reasonably necessary to achieve significant net efficiencies.”
The guidelines set forth a number of types of efficiency improvements that
could be considered in assessing the impact of a merger, such as economies of
scale. Moreover, the tradeoff often presented by mergers was explicitly recognized in the 1984 guidelines, which state that “a greater level of expected net
efficiencies [is needed] the more significant are the competitive risks identified.” Improvements in the consideration of these efficiencies, and in other
elements of the analytical framework applied to evaluating mergers,
continued in later revisions.

Competition Policy, Corporate Governance, and the
Mergers of the 1980s and 1990s
In the years leading up to 1982, some elements of the new thinking that
would later appear in the revisions to the Horizontal Merger Guidelines had
already begun to be incorporated in the Justice Department’s and the FTC’s
enforcement practices, and in the interpretation of antitrust laws by the
courts. Nonetheless, the revisions were important in codifying this dramatic
adjustment in antitrust policy, which allowed firms greater flexibility during
the substantial restructuring of the economy that occurred in the 1980s. In
contrast, during the 1960s and much of the 1970s, in line with the 1968

114 | Economic Report of the President

guidelines, Federal policy and judicial decisions relating to horizontal and
vertical mergers had been quite restrictive.
During the 1980s the total value of merger activity picked up considerably.
In 1988 the total dollar value of mergers and acquisitions was, in real terms,
more than four times greater than it had been a decade earlier. Two types of
reorganization were prevalent during this period, both of which might have
faced greater opposition under the 1968 guidelines. The first involved the
merging of two large firms in the same industry, and the second involved the
breakup of a conglomerate, in which individual business lines were often sold
to firms competing in the same market as the business line they were
acquiring. Although such mergers and acquisitions might still be opposed
under the revised guidelines if they presented significant concerns about the
effects on competition, the improved economic understanding of competition
in markets that was reflected in the revisions caused antitrust enforcement
policy to be less restrictive toward such mergers. The trend whereby mergers
increasingly involved two firms in the same industry continued in the 1990s.
In the 1980s and 1990s, mergers were clustered in particular industries,
although the industries in which they were clustered varied over time. This
suggests that mergers may have provided an important means for companies
to respond to industry-wide shocks such as deregulation, technological innovations, or supply shocks. Between 1988 and 1997, on average, nearly half of
annual merger deal volume was in industries adjusting to changing conditions brought about by deregulation. One study of Massachusetts hospitals
shows the effect of technological innovation on merger activity. The study
found that new drug therapies and improvements in medical procedures
were partly responsible for a significant decline in the number of inpatient
days from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s. This reduction in the need for
hospital beds contributed to a significant consolidation among hospitals
during this period, much of which was facilitated by mergers.
Evidence of stock market reactions to merger announcements during the
1980s and 1990s suggests that, on the whole, they created value for the
shareholders of the combined firms. Moreover, studies have found that, in
the aggregate, the operating performance of merging firms has improved
following the merger. But these aggregate results present evidence of only
modest gains, the source of which is unclear.
Yet this is to be expected, because mergers have numerous motivations,
and, as with all business decisions in a competitive market, not all will yield
the success that is hoped for. As a result, more narrow studies of particular
industries, particular types of mergers, and even specific mergers can yield a
richer understanding of the sources and extent of gains. For instance, detailed
examinations of bank mergers during the 1990s found cases of postmerger
performance improvements that likely came from a variety of sources,
Chapter 3

| 115

including opportunities afforded by the merger to expand service offerings
and the efforts of a vigorous management team acquiring a laggard bank.
Perhaps indicative of larger trends, however, along with uncovering successes,
these examinations also revealed some bank mergers with disappointing results.
The important point for competition policy is that, although the overall
efficiency consequences of the mergers of the 1980s and 1990s may be
debated, there is little evidence that they harmed competition. Thus it
appears that thoughtful and adaptive antitrust policy has afforded businesses
greater flexibility to respond to changing economic conditions while
preventing such responses from significantly harming competition.
The agencies’ improved understanding of the sources of possible competitive
harm also helped firms structure or restructure their proposed transactions so
as to achieve the efficiencies they sought without raising competitive
concerns. For example, a 1998 transaction sought to combine two of the
Nation’s largest grain distribution and trading businesses. The combination
had the potential to lower operating and capital costs but might also have
depressed the prices farmers received in certain locations for their grain. The
parties agreed to divest certain facilities at certain locations, settling the
Department of Justice’s challenge to the transaction and allowing the acquisition to proceed. Cases such as this one can be seen as a manifestation of an
increasingly thoughtful and adaptive competition policy.

The Role of Corporate Governance Changes
For many of the mergers and takeovers of the 1980s that appeared to
create social value, changes in corporate governance and ensuing reductions
in agency costs often played an important role. In some cases, takeovers led
to the breakup of large conglomerates, forcing apart business units that were
presumably more valuable on their own or in other companies’ hands. Many
incumbent managers resisted these restructurings until forced to accept them
through the market for corporate control, as takeovers or the threat thereof
often led to changes in the organization of firms.
Although many types of mergers and acquisitions may have led to changes
in corporate governance, some of the most dramatic changes therein came
about as a result of leveraged buyouts (LBOs). Moreover, evidence suggests
that LBOs during the 1980s led to significant improvements in the productivity of firms. In an LBO or a management buyout, corporations become
closely held companies as their public stock is bought by a group of investors
using borrowed money. Consequently, ownership becomes much more
concentrated and more tightly connected to control. This new ownership
and capital structure creates significantly greater incentives for managers to
increase profits as much as possible. One study showed that CEOs of firms
involved in LBOs during the 1980s saw their ownership stake rise by more
116 | Economic Report of the President

than a factor of four, thereby making them more interested in increasing the
firm’s profits. Moreover, the need to service debt issued to finance the buyout
provided a disciplining force on management.
Taken together, it was likely that these incentives influenced decisions by
some firms to sell off assets that had higher value outside the firm than inside
it. Many LBOs did not raise antitrust issues because the initial transaction
simply involved changing the ownership of an existing firm, rather than a
combination with a competitor. However, some selloffs of business units that
followed certain LBOs were to firms in the unit’s industry. Therefore, where
these selloffs could improve the performance of the firms without affecting
competition, the increased flexibility afforded by adjustments to antitrust
policy may have been important.
Once the firm’s operations were restructured and a new governance structure
was put in place, many LBO firms were successfully taken public again.
Although LBO activity dwindled in the 1990s, the expansion of pay for
performance suggests that mechanisms to align managerial with shareholder
interests remain an important, enduring element of corporate governance.
The restructurings of the 1980s provide an example of the importance of
adapting competition policy in response to improvements in the understanding of the conditions within industries that may harm or benefit
consumers. The ongoing incorporation of these insights into the analytical
framework used to guide competition policy has strengthened the effectiveness of antitrust enforcement, while reducing the likelihood that antitrust
enforcement will hinder reorganizations whose economic benefits to society
would outweigh any potential harm from reduced competition.

Policy Lessons for
Promoting Organizational Efficiencies
As noted earlier, organizational change in today’s economy takes place not
only through mergers but also through other organizational forms such as
joint ventures and partial acquisitions. The challenge for antitrust scholarship
and public policy is to provide an integrated framework for all these organizational innovations that properly accounts for both competitive and
efficiency effects. These types of transactions evoke intertwined issues in
corporate governance and competition policy, and so an integrated framework supports sound policymaking. For example, how a given partial equity
acquisition is likely to affect the acquirer’s relationship with the target
depends on more than just the size of the partial equity interest acquired and
the nature of any accompanying shareholder agreement, which may, for
example, confer the right to appoint representatives to the firm’s board of
Chapter 3

| 117

directors. It also depends on the acquirer’s current and likely future plans,
and those of other blockholders and the firm’s incumbent managers. Even
ascertaining that the acquirer will gain control need not imply that the transaction would be anticompetitive; as in merger policy, that depends upon the
market environment and on the efficiencies that the transaction would create.

Policy Lessons from Joint Ventures
Joint ventures can lower the costs of producing goods and services and
widen consumer choice. But partners in a joint venture may also be actual or
potential competitors in the product market. In 1983, for example, General
Motors (GM) Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. agreed to establish a joint
venture to produce a subcompact car at a former GM plant in Fremont,
California. This venture was later formalized as New United Motor
Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). Both partners expected to benefit from the
undertaking: GM by adding to its capabilities in producing smaller cars,
Toyota from the opportunity to test its production methods in an American
environment. It was an unprecedented initiative and generated an extensive,
15-month FTC investigation, which resulted in its approval.
A new organizational innovation, by definition, will not have an established
track record for an antitrust agency to review. But such an organization may
create genuine, important efficiencies even if those efficiencies are difficult to
document at the time of the transaction. For example, a key issue before the
FTC was whether the joint venture would enable Toyota to learn how its
“lean” production and assembly system would function in an American
factory, and enable GM to learn details of the Toyota system that could be
applied to raise productivity at its other plants.
If Toyota’s manufacturing success was completely embodied in a superior
piece of equipment, then merely licensing that equipment to U.S.
automakers might have been sufficient to transfer that success to American
soil. That type of efficiency gain also would have been relatively easy to document contemporaneously. Yet, as subsequent scholarship has confirmed,
Toyota’s lean production system is an interrelated set of practices, affecting
factory and job design, labor-management relations, relationships with
suppliers, and management of inventories. As the FTC majority opinion
concluded, “in depth, daily accumulation of knowledge regarding seemingly
minor details is a more important source for increased efficiency than a broad
but shallow understanding of Japanese methods. Such in depth knowledge
appears to be achieved only through the kind of close relationship the [joint]
venture will allow.”
Experience shows that the joint venture did lead to productivity improvements.
One study indicated that, within a few years, each automobile produced at
the NUMMI plant required 19 assembly hours of labor, versus 31 hours at
118 | Economic Report of the President

one of GM’s mass production plants in the United States, and 16 hours at
one of Toyota’s plants in Japan. The productivity of the NUMMI plant was
close to that of Toyota’s Japanese plant even though NUMMI workers were
relatively early in the learning process about lean production, suggesting that
this system could indeed be transplanted successfully. Several other welcome
developments followed in the wake of the joint venture’s early success. Toyota
expanded its own production and assembly plant operations in the United
States. GM and other U.S. automakers adopted elements of lean production,
improving their productivity. And NUMMI expanded. By 1997 the joint
venture had produced its 3-millionth vehicle, and in 2001 the Fremont
facility was producing three vehicle models.
The broader policy lesson is that joint ventures and other organizational
hybrids may create efficiencies in ways that are difficult to prove at the time
of the transaction. In evaluating transactions that might also raise anticompetitive concerns, antitrust authorities face the uncertain prospect of
improved efficiency as a factor in evaluating the joint venture’s likely effect. A
new, potentially efficiency-enhancing organization can benefit society in two
ways. Society gains direct benefits from the organization. Society also receives
the demonstration of the types of efficiencies that such an organization
could create. This provides evidence to other firms, and to the antitrust
enforcement agencies, about the private and social gains of such organizations. If the new organization proves efficient, other firms may adopt that
form. If it does not prove efficient, market forces will motivate the firms to
abandon it. In either case, the antitrust agencies will have a broader track
record to rely upon when evaluating similar transactions that might raise
competitive questions.
The guidelines describing how U.S. enforcement agencies assess mergers
or collaborations such as joint ventures indicate that efficiencies arising from
them will be considered if they are verifiable and cannot be practically
achieved through other means, making them transaction specific.
“Verifiable” here means that the parties must substantiate efficiency claims so
that the agencies can verify, by reasonable means, their likelihood and magnitude. In these guidelines, certain efficiency claims are viewed as less likely to
meet these criteria than are others. For instance, the agencies view improvements attributed to management as less likely to meet the criteria necessary
for consideration. But efficiency gains from mergers or joint ventures may be
closely tied with managerial improvements, such as combining Toyota
management with unionized American workers in NUMMI. Managerial
and organizational improvements may indeed be difficult to verify, but given
their potential social value, expending the resources necessary to investigate
those claims thoroughly is justified. This policy lesson applies to mergers as
well as joint ventures.
Chapter 3

Legislation indeed exists to encourage efficient joint ventures. In 1984 the
National Cooperative Research Act (NCRA) became law, to be followed
9 years later by the National Cooperative Research and Production Act.
These two acts encourage research and production joint ventures by codifying antitrust treatment of such ventures. They lowered the maximum
penalty that could be assessed in a successful private antitrust lawsuit against
any venture that notified the Justice Department at the time of its formation.
For all joint ventures, the act also ensured that, in any antitrust challenge, the
courts would consider efficiencies arising from the joint venture. This clarified that defendants could exonerate themselves by establishing the benefits
of their joint ventures. Since the passage of the NCRA more than 900
research or production ventures have registered with the Justice Department.
Successful research joint ventures may foster innovation and thus bring
benefits to society. This and other ways in which economic organization and
competition policy promote innovation are elaborated in the section on
dynamic competition later in this chapter.

Shaping Policies to Address Partial Equity Stakes
As we have seen, firms make partial equity investments under a variety of
conditions, to achieve a variety of ends. The overall effect can be to promote
efficiency or reduce competition, depending on the nature of the acquisition
and the conditions under which it is made. Partial acquisitions most dramatically confer control, or influence, over the target company when a majority
of its outstanding equity is acquired. Acquirers obtain substantial influence
in some instances with much smaller stakes, however. Partial acquisitions also
give the acquirer a stake in the target firm’s future profits. This gives the
acquirer an incentive to take those profits into account when making its own
business decisions. Finally, a partial acquisition can make it easier for the
acquirer to obtain access to the management of the target firm. All these
elements can have substantial effects on the relationship between the target
and the acquiring firm. Because strong product market competition can
depend on the independence of firm actions, all of these aspects of partial
acquisitions can raise serious antitrust enforcement concerns. The challenge
in shaping policies to address partial equity ownership by corporations lies in
distinguishing cases that pose serious threats to product market competition
from those that promote efficient cooperation between suppliers. Although
some of these issues are fairly new, the challenge is similar to that posed by
the analysis of mergers and, of course, joint ventures.
With the emergence of partial acquisitions among major U.S. corporations,
the Justice Department and the FTC have created an enforcement record
that publicly illustrates some of the concerns these acquisitions can raise. For
example, Primestar was formed in 1990 as a joint venture involving five of
120 | Economic Report of the President

the Nation’s largest cable television providers and a satellite provider. In 1997
Primestar announced its intention to acquire satellite assets from two other
companies. These assets could be used for direct broadcast satellite (DBS)
service, which transmits video programming directly from satellites to
subscribers’ homes and competes for customers with cable television. The
cable companies involved in the original joint venture would have maintained a substantial ownership and control stake in the entity resulting from
the proposed acquisition. Since the assets in question were the last available
that other independent providers of DBS could use or expand into,
Primestar’s ownership structure raised concerns at the Justice Department
during its review of the acquisition. Concerned that the cable companies
would exert their influence in Primestar to limit how the acquired assets
would be used in competing with cable, the Justice Department challenged
the acquisition, which was subsequently abandoned. The determination that
this acquisition would have caused competitive harm hinged upon an
assessment of how the new entity’s governance structure would affect its
behavior (Box 3-2).
As the Primestar case illustrates, the government’s evaluation of how partial
acquisitions are likely to affect competition requires the examination of
conditions under which the parties to the transaction compete, as would be
the case in the evaluation of a full merger. Only to the extent that competition between cable and DBS benefits consumers, or society generally, would
the Primestar acquisition have been likely to have a serious adverse effect on
competition. The partial nature of the cable companies’ stake in Primestar
thus raised questions in addition to, rather than apart from, those that arise
in the traditional evaluation of mergers. Also, as in the evaluation of mergers
and joint ventures, the Justice Department and the FTC typically consider
the evidence on whether each partial acquisition may promote efficiency.
Some of the tools that economists use to analyze efficiency gains derived
from vertical relationships generally may prove useful in the analysis of
partial acquisitions between suppliers of complementary products. For
example, the influence or control that the acquirer may exercise over the
target raises the acquirer’s incentive to make certain relationship-specific
investments. Relationship-specific investments are those that, once made, are
much more valuable inside a particular business relationship than outside it,
such as fabrication equipment that is specialized to a particular customer’s
design. The acquirer’s control rights make it less likely that the target will
later “hold up” the acquirer, and deprive it of its appropriate return on its
investment. These control rights are important because it is costly to go to
court to try to enforce a written agreement. If one party effectively controls
the other party, disputes over the business arrangement may be resolved at
lower cost internally. Although the costs of dispute resolution may be
Chapter 3

Box 3-2.The Primestar Acquisition
A basic assumption in assessing the competitive implications of a
merger is that the merged firms will act in such a way as to maximize
the new entity’s profits. A firm’s owners, however, may also have other
objectives. Usually these other objectives are not significant enough to
alter the basic assumption. But when a firm’s owners clearly have
other interests, such as financial stakes in other ventures, these could
influence their decisions regarding the firm’s actions. In such cases,
those assessing a merger must consider how strong those influences
might be on an owner and that owner’s ability to affect firm decisions
in ways that may harm competition.
Primestar was formed in 1990 as a joint venture involving five of the
largest cable television providers and a satellite provider. Given that
the five cable providers would control almost 98 percent of the voting
shares in Primestar after the proposed acquisition, there were concerns
about how this would affect its use of the acquired assets. If Primestar
used these new assets to compete vigorously with cable for
subscribers in order to maximize its profits, under certain assumptions
the effect of lost customers on the profits of some owners’ cable businesses might outweigh their share of the gains from Primestar
improving its subscriber base. As a result, one might suspect that
these owners would seek to influence Primestar’s actions to reduce its
competition with cable.
On the other hand, Primestar’s managers and board of directors
would have had legal obligations to serve the interests of minority
shareholders that would benefit financially from Primestar competing
vigorously with cable television, and the board included independent
outside directors. Moreover, it appeared that not all the cable providers
would have had an incentive to prevent such competition. Thus the
composition of Primestar’s ownership and governance structure
suggested that there might be opposing forces that would seek
different outcomes of decisions affecting competition in the consumer
market that DBS serves.
The Justice Department analyzed the totality of incentive and governance effects in this case and concluded, on balance, that the
transaction would harm competition and consumers. It filed suit to
block the acquisition, leading to its abandonment. This case demonstrates that an assessment of a merger or acquisition’s competitive
implications can require an understanding of how the governance
structure of a company allows those with a share in its control, or a
financial stake in its operations, to influence decisions affecting the
firm’s actions.

122 | Economic Report of the President

lowered through a partial or complete equity interest of one party in the
other, there are other costs to this integration, such as “influence costs” as
agents seek to lobby decisionmakers within the organization. But market forces
will lead firms to choose the arrangement that minimizes their total costs.
Another example derives from the lesson from scholarship that, if one firm
acquires another outright, the acquirer’s specific investment incentives are
strengthened, but the target’s specific investment incentives are weakened. In
the context of a corporate acquisition, this means that stakeholders in the
target company care much less how that company’s assets are deployed after
selling their stakes. Therefore, if a project can best succeed through such
investment by both parties, an optimal ownership arrangement may be one
in which one party holds a partial equity stake in, rather than completely
owning, the other. This raises the investment incentives of the partial owner
while not unduly undermining those of the target.
An important challenge in the development of competition policy toward
these new corporate governance practices will be to make effective use of
these tools in light of the evidence that has emerged on the antitrust concerns
that those practices can raise, and the beneficial effects that can result from
them. Some progress will arise through the identification of factors that
enforcement authorities will increasingly consider in evaluating partial acquisitions, and that parties will increasingly consider when deciding whether to
propose them. Other progress will emerge from a clearer understanding of
how these practices affect product markets and economic efficiency more
generally. With a clearer sense of the general consequences of these transactions, and of the specific factors that can lead those consequences to vary
from case to case, we can expect further advances in the development of tools
to evaluate these new governance practices.

Policy Toward Vertical Relations
Some tools for the analysis of these governance practices may derive from
a well-developed economics literature on vertical relations between independent firms, a subject in which important issues in firm organization and
competition policy arise. Firm activities and market transactions often
involve a vertical production and distribution chain, such as a relationship
between a manufacturer (called in this situation the upstream firm) and a
distributor (the downstream firm).
Antitrust law and its enforcement have a long history of influence over
these organizational decisions, such as whether a firm owns the retail outlets
for its goods or services. For example, the owner of a business format and
brand name for a fast-food restaurant concept may also own individual
restaurants, or it may enter into a franchise agreement. A franchise agreement
is one between two legally independent firms, the franchisor (the owner of
Chapter 3

| 123

the business format) and the franchisee (in this example the owner of the
individual restaurant). The agreement might specify that the franchisee may
operate a restaurant at the given location according to the specified format, in
exchange for a franchising fee and a royalty rate on the restaurant’s sales.
This organizational choice is, in part, a response to various agency costs. In
particular, since a franchisee owns the individual restaurant, he or she has
incentives to exert certain types of effort to build up the value of that store.
Under company ownership, the manager of the restaurant is an employee
and, even if paid a bonus wage based on sales, does not have as strong an
incentive as a storeowner to invest effort to raise the value of that store. But
franchising may exacerbate other agency costs. For example, the owneroperator of the only restaurant on a busy interstate highway may expect to
have many one-time customers, and therefore might charge prices that are
too high—a decision that may be profitable for that owner but tarnishes the
brand name and lowers its nationwide value. In a company-owned
restaurant, the manager has less incentive or ability to act in this manner.
The fact that both franchise stores and company-owned stores successfully
coexist in our economy reflects differences in agency costs in various
industries and settings.
These organizational choices can also be influenced by competition policy,
which affects the costs of various possible terms of an agreement between
independent upstream and downstream firms, such as a franchise agreement.
For example, the upstream firm might wish to specify a maximum retail or
“resale” price, which would prevent an individual store from taking advantage of its local market position and potentially harming the reputation of
the brand name. As the Supreme Court acknowledged in its 1997 State Oil
v. Khan decision, there are pro-competitive rationales for such vertical
restraints, which is why such a pricing provision is now evaluated for its
competitive consequences on a case-by-case basis. Before the Supreme
Court’s decision, however, an attempt to set a maximum resale price in an
agreement between legally independent upstream and downstream firms
would have been illegal per se. As a result, owners of a business format who
were concerned about the possibility of franchisees pricing too high may
have instead chosen to own those restaurants or stores outright. That choice
would have addressed the pricing issue but increased other agency costs
related to effort by restaurant managers. This example shows one way in
which competition policy with regard to vertical restraints nowadays takes
into account the social benefits that may be created by having transactions organized between two separate firms rather than through common
ownership or vertical integration.

124 | Economic Report of the President

Cross-Border Organizational Changes
Competition policy continues to respond to other changes in the organization
of economic activity. The GM-Toyota joint venture, for example, presaged
something that has become much more prominent since the venture’s establishment: changes in firm organization, including mergers, that occur across
national boundaries. This section describes some of the challenges that the
international nature of these changes presents for antitrust policy, and how
the United States is responding.

Multijurisdictional Review
Merger proposals involving or creating multinational enterprises can result
in reviews by the antitrust authorities of many nations, often referred to as
multijurisdictional review. The United States has managed the issues posed
by multijurisdictional review through both bilateral cooperative relationships
and multilateral arrangements. This has produced an impressive degree of
analytical convergence among the U.S. and other antitrust agencies, resulting
in a long line of compatible decisions in transnational mergers. However,
some differences remain, and these can have significant consequences. A
striking recent example came with the proposed acquisition by General
Electric Company (GE) of Honeywell International Inc. Both GE and
Honeywell are U.S.-headquartered corporations, but because these multinational enterprises also have significant European sales, the deal was subject to
review by antitrust authorities of the European Union.
GE and Honeywell agreed on their merger in October 2000. Although
each operates in a number of product lines, a key focus of the case was the
complementary goods they produce for the commercial aviation industry.
GE is one of three independent global manufacturers of large commercial
aircraft engines, and Honeywell makes a number of systems essential
for aircraft operation, ranging from landing gear to communications and
navigation systems.
After agreeing to some changes to their transaction, including the divestiture
of Honeywell’s helicopter engine division, the parties received conditional
clearance from the Justice Department in May 2001 to proceed with their
merger. But the merger could not be consummated until it received clearance
from the European Commission and other authorities. The Commission
sought additional changes and conditions that were unacceptable to the
parties. In July 2001 the Commission rejected the deal, and so the proposed
merger did not take place.

Chapter 3

| 125

The Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust issued this statement after
that decision:
Having conducted an extensive investigation of the GE/Honeywell
acquisition, the Antitrust Division reached a firm conclusion that the
merger, as modified by the remedies we insisted upon, would have been
procompetitive and beneficial to consumers. Our conclusion was based
on findings, confirmed by customers worldwide, that the combined
firm could offer better products and services at more attractive prices
than either firm could offer individually. That, in our view, is the essence
of competition.
The EU, however, apparently concluded that a more diversified, and
thus more competitive, GE could somehow disadvantage other market
participants. Consequently, we appear to have reached different results
from similar assessments of competitive conditions in the affected markets.
Clear and longstanding U.S. antitrust policy holds that the antitrust
laws protect competition, not competitors. Today’s EU decision reflects a
significant point of divergence.
For years, U.S. and EU competition authorities have enjoyed close
and cooperative relations. In fact, there were extensive consultations in
this matter throughout the entire process. This matter points to the
continuing need for consultation to move toward greater policy convergence.
The European Union’s objection to the merger centered around advantages that the combination would yield for the merged firm over its
competitors in the markets for aircraft engines, avionics, and other aircraft
systems. The Commission found that, among other factors, GE’s vertical
integration into aircraft leasing through its GECAS subsidiary, along with
GE’s deep financial resources, would lead inexorably to the merged firm’s
dominance in markets for certain aircraft systems. In addition, the
Commission found that the merger would give the combined
GE-Honeywell the ability and the incentive to offer complementary
products on more attractive terms than could competitors with narrower
product lines. This last category of objections has been termed “range” or
“portfolio” effects.
The Commission found that these mechanisms would have the effect of
driving the premerger competitors of both GE and Honeywell out of effective participation in their respective markets, presumably leading to higher
prices in the long run as the merged firm became unconstrained by competitive pressures. U.S. antitrust authorities, in contrast, found that most of the
alleged harms under the Commission’s theory flowed from what are normally
considered benefits of a merger—efficiencies that lead to lower prices. They
126 | Economic Report of the President

found little evidence that competitors would be unable to respond to any
lower prices generated by the merger and thus be driven from the market.
Finding more efficient combinations of productive resources that lead to
lower costs and lower prices is, as the Assistant Attorney General said, the
essence of competition. Blocking mergers that generate such efficiencies risks
serious economic harm to consumers and to markets generally.

Elements of International Policy Convergence
Halting efficient multinational mergers destroys value precisely because an
integrated, multinational firm can create specific efficiencies. As noted earlier,
these may include exploiting economies of scale and scope, and combining
central managerial guidance and appropriate pay for performance with the
local knowledge of managers in various overseas markets. The European
Commission might have been more likely to clear the GE-Honeywell merger
if GE had agreed to divest its aircraft leasing subsidiary GECAS. But such a
divestiture might have sacrificed efficiencies.
As the GE-Honeywell example indicates, there are some important
differences in competition policy between the United States and other
nations. But cases that produce such conflicting results have been rare and
are likely to remain the exception. Moreover, steps toward appropriate
convergence have already taken place, and this Administration is committed
to seeking further convergence to promote the spread of sound antitrust
policy. The United States should not seek convergence for its own sake, of
course, but rather in order to establish certain core principles of sound
competition policy across all jurisdictions.

Core Principles of Competition Policy
Competition policy should operate according to explicit guidelines, based
on clear economic principles. Economic analysis should be central, because
competition policy shapes fundamental economic decisions, such as production, pricing, and the organization of firms. These guidelines should reduce
uncertainty by providing an indication to firms as to what kinds of conduct
and transactions may bring scrutiny from competition authorities.
Competition policy should be concerned with protecting competition, not
competitors, as a means of promoting efficient resource allocation and
consumer welfare. There might be rare exceptions, such as certain monopolization cases, in which consumer harm is hard to measure, and then harm to
competitors may be examined as an indicator of consumer harm. Indeed,
harm to competitors does not play a central role in U.S. merger policy,
although it does motivate private antitrust litigation. Since such competitor
complaints are often at variance with consumer interests, antitrust
Chapter 3

| 127

enforcement agencies and courts should view them skeptically. In the
European Union the more significant and involved role of competitors in
the merger review process has created a perception by some that the
Commission’s analysis is driven more by effects on competitors than is
the case in the United States.
As the International Competition Policy Advisory Committee noted in its
final report to the Attorney General in 2000, “Nations should recognize that
the interests of the competitors to the merging parties are not necessarily
aligned with consumer interests.” Indeed, a merger may be opposed by
competitors precisely because it would create a more efficient firm, one
that will aggressively serve customers better than the existing industry configuration. Blocking such acquisitions deprives the world of an avenue to
increased productivity.
The United States and the European Union have already achieved
considerable cooperation and substantive convergence. U.S. and EU
antitrust authorities have come to similar conclusions about a large number
of transatlantic mergers. More work is required, however. The United States
has undertaken several steps in bilateral and multilateral forums to facilitate
convergence of competition policy to serve efficiency ends.

Bilateral Enforcement Agreements
The United States has entered into bilateral cooperation agreements with
several important trading partners—Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany,
Israel, Japan, Mexico, and the European Communities—to facilitate
antitrust enforcement. These agreements are implemented by the Justice
Department and the FTC, working in cooperation with their counterpart
agencies in the other countries.
These agreements typically provide for, among other things, sharing of
nonconfidential information, coordination of parallel investigations, and
positive comity. Under positive comity one country can request that another
investigate possibly anticompetitive practices in its jurisdiction that adversely
affect important interests of the country making the request. Such a request
does not require the country receiving the request to act, nor does it preclude
the country making the request from undertaking its own enforcement. The
United States has also entered into one agreement, with Australia, under the
International Antitrust Enforcement Assistance Act, which among other things
allows the enforcement agencies to share confidential information.
The United States and the European Union have also created a working
group to identify and pursue areas of possible further convergence in merger
enforcement. Having completed a successful project on remedies in merger cases,
the working group has established new task forces to examine conglomerate
merger issues and other important substantive and procedural topics.
128 | Economic Report of the President

The International Competition Network
In October 2001 the Department of Justice and the FTC joined with top
foreign antitrust officials to launch the International Competition Network
(ICN). The ICN will provide a venue for senior antitrust officials from
around the world to work on reaching consensus on appropriate procedural
and substantive convergence in competition policy enforcement. The ICN
will initially focus on multijurisdictional merger review (procedures, substantive analysis, and investigative techniques) and the advocacy role of antitrust
authorities in favoring pro-competitive government policies. To facilitate the
diffusion of best practices, the ICN will develop nonbinding recommendations for consideration by individual enforcement agencies. The ICN’s
interim steering group consists of representatives from a cross section of
developing and developed countries, including the United States. It will hold
its first conference in the early fall of 2002.

The World Trade Organization
The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international institution in
which the United States negotiates agreements with 143 other members to
reduce barriers to trade. At the fourth WTO Ministerial Conference in
Doha, Qatar, in 2001, members adopted a ministerial declaration. That
declaration included a statement that the Working Group on the Interaction
between Trade and Competition Policy will focus on the clarification of core
principles, modalities for voluntary cooperation, and support for progressive
reinforcement of competition institutions in developing countries. The role
of the WTO and other international institutions in promoting economic
well-being is detailed in Chapter 7.

Benefits of Appropriate Convergence
In some cases, the lack of antitrust harmonization may yield benefits. For
example, in an unsettled policy area, in the absence of harmonization,
nations might experiment with different competition policies. The world
could then learn from these experiences what constitutes best practice in
antitrust enforcement in the area in question. The bilateral and multilateral
forums into which the United States has entered address this concern by
sharing information to promote best practices. This consultation will
enable the results of successful policy experiments to be disseminated.
Moreover, the United States remains committed to appropriate convergence,
in which efficient competition policies are spread worldwide, rather than
seeking harmonization for its own sake and potentially promoting less than
sound policies.

Dynamic Competition and Antitrust Policy
Through its influence on the development of competition policy over the
years, economic analysis has brought a dramatic improvement in the ability
of government agencies and the courts to accurately judge the strength of
competition in a market. This has enhanced their capacity to distinguish
those cases that properly raise concerns about anticompetitive effects from
those that might have raised concerns in the past, but should no longer, in
light of a better understanding of competitive forces. These changes
in antitrust policy are important in that they afford firms greater flexibility
to lower costs and improve their products through adjustments to their
operations and organization.
But many of these improvements in policy have largely focused on better
understanding markets in which firms compete with one another through
incremental changes in the prices, quality, and quantity of relatively similar
products or services. In some increasingly prominent industries, such as the
information technology and pharmaceuticals industries, another important
form of competition is taking place. It arises where there is a constant threat
of innovations leading to a new or improved product being introduced that
is far superior to existing products in a market. This type of competition is
sometimes called competition for the market, or dynamic competition.
The increasingly important role of innovations in our economy can be
seen in a number of indicators of innovative activity. After remaining nearly
unchanged during the 1970s, industry’s funding of research and development, measured as a share of GDP, grew two-thirds during the following two
decades, reaching 1.8 percent of GDP in 2000. The number of patents
granted each year by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office provides some
indication of the rate at which patentable innovations are being developed.
Since the mid-1980s, the number of patents issued for inventions each year
has grown dramatically (Chart 3-3). Although such a change could result
from a number of other factors, such as increased incentives to file for a
patent based on adjustments to the legal environment, evidence suggests that
a burst in innovation is a driving factor behind this rise. Whereas some of the
most visible innovations contributing to dynamic competition are technological in nature, such as improvements in the performance of computers,
others may involve changes in management or business practices.
The importance of substantial innovations to the economy, as well as the
unique form of competition they bring about, was recognized in 1942 by the
economist Joseph Schumpeter. He noted that a significant part of the longterm growth of many industries resulted from what he called the “perennial
gale of creative destruction.” At the heart of this creative destruction is the
introduction of new products or services, technologies, or organizational
130 | Economic Report of the President

forms that lead to dramatic changes in an industry’s structure or costs, or in
the quality of its products or services. In Schumpeter’s view, it was periods of
creative destruction that brought “power production from the overshot water
wheel to the modern power plant… [and] transportation from the mailcoach
to the airplane.” Indeed, as he stated, the kind of competition resulting from
firms bringing forth these changes or innovations is one that “commands a
decisive cost or quality advantage and which strikes not at the margins of the
profits… of the existing firms but at their foundations and their very lives.”
Because of his early insights, dynamic competition involving the introduction of markedly improved goods or services is often referred to as
Schumpeterian competition.
The significance of innovation—and hence of dynamic competition—will
vary from market to market: it will be negligible in some and a pervasive
force in others. Product improvements are commonly made in virtually all
markets. But in markets experiencing the kinds of substantial innovation that
Schumpeter addressed, these innovations can be so dramatic or disruptive as
to make the products that they improve upon significantly inferior in
comparison. The benefits of these innovations to society can be found all
around us. Computer processors produced today are, by one measure, more

Chapter 3

| 131

than 250 times more powerful than those produced in 1980, and more than
twice as powerful as those produced in 1999. New drugs have vastly
improved our ability to treat various illnesses. Other examples abound.
It has long been recognized that particular incentives are necessary to foster
these market-transforming innovations. These innovations are often the
result of substantial research and development investments on the part of
companies or individuals. Since these investments must be made before it is
clear that any profitable innovations will come of them, they are fundamentally risky. Encouraging innovation rests upon an interrelated set of internal
and external rewards. The external rewards are those provided in the marketplace to the successful innovating organization. The internal rewards are
those provided by the firm, joint venture, or other governance structure.
Both economic organization and public policy therefore play significant
roles in encouraging innovation.

Sources of Incentives for Innovation
The external risks and rewards facing firms in innovation-intensive
industries are highlighted by a preliminary study of firms in the computer
software industry between 1990 and 1998, which found that success, as
measured by sales growth over this period, was by no means certain. But,
compensating for this risk, some firms that did end up being successful were
extremely so. At least 10 percent of firms saw sales fall to zero, and at least
half experienced negative sales growth over the period. Only 25 percent of
firms experienced real annualized sales growth of at least 7 percent during the
period. But about 1 percent experienced real annualized growth of greater
than 130 percent. This pattern of success highlights the risk involved in
investments in these innovation-intensive industries. Therefore firms must
have reason to expect that, taking into account the likelihood of failure, the
profits from any successful innovations that do result from their efforts will
be enough to justify the initial investment.

Intellectual Property Protection
Not only is investing in efforts to develop innovations risky and often
expensive, but the innovations that result often produce beneficial knowledge
or insights that others can copy at relatively low cost. Furthermore, in the
absence of laws to the contrary, knowledge embodied in an innovation can
be hard to keep others from using.
For instance, the research and development costs incurred by a firm in
determining the correct chemical composition and treatment regime for a
particular drug therapy may be substantial. But it may be difficult to keep
much of this information out of the hands of competitors that have not

132 | Economic Report of the President

borne any of these costs, yet could use that information to produce the new
drug themselves. As a result, competition between the innovator and imitators could keep the price of the drug at the cost of manufacturing it. In such
a competitive environment, a firm’s profits from its innovation would not
suffice to cover its original research and development costs or justify its decision to risk undertaking expensive research efforts that may bear no fruit.
Foreseeing this potential outcome, the innovator would have little incentive
to embark on the research and development in the first place.
Even if a firm did not face competition from other firms benefiting from
the knowledge produced by its innovation, firms or individuals may use
aspects of the innovation for other purposes. Given how difficult it can be to
keep them from doing this, in the absence of laws to prevent it, the innovator
may receive little compensation from those that benefit from its innovation.
As a result, the rewards that a firm enjoys from its innovation could fall far
short of the benefits that the innovation produces for society. Consequently,
in many cases, firms or individuals might not embark on developing an
innovation because, although the social benefit from it may be large enough
to justify its development costs, the firm or individual could not expect to
reap enough of that benefit to justify those costs.
The consequences of this problem were recognized in the U.S.
Constitution, which empowered Congress to develop a body of intellectual
property laws, including those establishing patents. A patent for an invention
confers on an individual or firm (the patentholder) limited rights to exclude
others from making, selling, or using the invention without the patentholder’s consent. Patents generally are granted for 20 years, and as the rights
they provide imply, the patentholder can license to other individuals or firms
the right to use its innovation. Patents give a firm the legal power to keep
others from using its innovation to create competing products without
bearing the cost of the innovation. Licensing provides a means whereby the
innovator can receive compensation, in the form of licensing fees, from
others that find a beneficial use for the innovation. Thus policy has long
recognized that, to encourage innovation, firms must expect that successful
innovations will yield a market position that allows them to earn profits
adequate to compensate for the risk and cost of their efforts.
Indeed, intellectual property protection often plays an important role in
dynamically competitive markets. But it is not the only mechanism that may
allow a firm to gain an adequate return on risky investments in developing
innovations. Intellectual property laws cannot always provide inventors
complete protection against competitors using the knowledge embodied in
their inventions without compensation. First, even if they are valuable, not
all innovations can be protected by intellectual property law. Second, firms
can often “invent around” a patent to create a competing product that,
Chapter 3

| 133

although similar in value to consumers, is different enough in its composition
or features so as not to violate the patent. Although this entails some development costs, these may be substantially reduced by the knowledge gained
from studying the original innovator’s efforts. On the other hand, some
innovations may be difficult enough to imitate that, even without intellectual
property protection, the innovator can enjoy a substantial cost or quality
advantage over its competitors for some period. In either case, other characteristics of some dynamically competitive industries are important in making
it likely that a successful innovation will yield a firm the leading position in a
market, and profits that are essential to encourage such innovations.

Economies of Scale
Many industries that may experience dynamic competition are characterized
by substantial economies of scale. In such industries, creating a new product
entails high fixed costs, such as the costs of research and development and of
setting up production and distribution facilities. But once these costs have
been incurred, the incremental cost of making each unit of the product is
small, indeed sometimes close to zero, and it is often easy to expand production to high levels. In markets with these characteristics, an innovator may be
able to introduce its new product and keep production levels high enough to
gain substantial market share before others can offer products of competing
quality. As a result, economies of scale may allow the innovator to keep its
average costs well below that of new entrants offering similar products that
have smaller initial market shares. In some cases this advantage may be
enough to keep other firms from providing significant competition unless
they can offer a product that is notably superior.

Network Effects
Network effects are another mechanism that can help an innovator
maintain a market-leading position in many dynamically competitive industries. A product or service is subject to network effects if its value to a
consumer increases the more it is used by others. For instance, over the past
decade, the number of people using e-mail has grown dramatically, making it
a much more valuable means of communication for any individual user
today than it was a decade ago. Network effects can also influence the value
of some computer software. The more people who use a particular software
application, or at least software compatible with it, the more valuable that
software is to any individual who wants to share or exchange files with others
who use that software. One study of prices of spreadsheet software between
1986 and 1991 found that consumers were willing to pay a significant
premium for software that was compatible with Lotus 1-2-3, which was the
dominant spreadsheet program during this period.
134 | Economic Report of the President

As more people use a particular good, its value to consumers can also
increase because this wider use encourages the production of complementary
goods. For instance, as more offices use a particular type of photocopier,
businesses offering repair services and spare parts for that copier may become
more common, making the copier even more attractive to offices.
As a result of these network effects, the value that consumers attach to a
product that is already widely used may be substantially greater than the
value they place on a relatively similar product that is used by fewer people.
For instance, a manufacturer may introduce a new copier that offers performance largely similar to that of the market leader. But if the new copier is
built in such a way that users cannot draw from the same service and spare
parts network, it may be less valuable than the incumbent product. Thus, if
a firm can quickly gain market share after introducing a new innovation,
network effects can play an important role in helping the firm maintain that
market leadership in the face of competition from new entrants offering
similar products. This, in turn, increases its ability to reap the profits that are
necessary for it to earn an adequate return on its risky investment.
Many have expressed concern that network effects can give such substantial
advantages to incumbent products that new firms with potentially superior
products are unable to compete. In theory, this could happen, but it does not
happen necessarily. If a new product is clearly superior to the leading
product, whether network effects are large enough to keep the new product
from successfully competing will depend on the value of those effects
compared with the net advantages it offers after taking into account the cost
of switching to it. But, of course, measuring either of these—the value of the
network effects or that of the new product’s superior features—is difficult.
Although there have been cases where a new product took over a marketleading position from one that presumably enjoyed network effects,
conclusive evidence that network effects have prevented the widespread
adoption of a markedly superior product has not yet been found. For
example, one common case put forward to argue that network effects can
hinder the entry of superior products is that of the QWERTY keyboard, the
familiar, century-old keyboard arrangement that virtually all typewriters used
and that most computer terminals use today. In the 1980s a study suggested
that a keyboard arrangement called the Dvorak keyboard, introduced in the
1930s by August Dvorak, was superior to QWERTY but had failed to gain
market share because of the network effects that the already-established
QWERTY enjoyed. Yet a more recent study raises significant doubts about
claims that the Dvorak keyboard was superior. For instance, the most
dramatic claims of its superiority are traceable to research by Dvorak himself,
who stood to gain financially from the patented keyboard’s success.
Examination of his research revealed that experiments comparing keyboards
Chapter 3

| 135

often failed to account for differences in the ability and experience of
participating typists. The best-documented experiments, as well as recent
ergonomic studies, suggest little or no advantage for the Dvorak keyboard.
This highlights that generalizations cannot be made about the significance of
network effects in deterring the entry of superior products into a market.
Their impact must be judged on a case-by-case basis.

Fostering Innovation Through
Organizational Structure
Although the prospect of gaining a market-leading position can encourage
firms to innovate, firms can reap the benefits of innovation through other
means as well. As was mentioned above, the benefits of innovation are often
shared by many. Licensing agreements offer one means by which a firm can
capture some of these spillovers. But such arrangements are an imperfect
way of ensuring that innovators benefit from the spillover effects of their
innovations while also encouraging additional beneficial uses of the innovation by others. As noted earlier, addressing this spillover problem is one
motivation for a research joint venture among firms that expect to mutually
gain from an innovation. Moreover, firms that develop new innovations
subject to network effects will benefit from the production of complementary products that enhance those network effects. Partial equity stakes
may provide a useful mechanism to foster the development of these
complementary products.
Even when conducted within a single firm, successful research requires
appropriate effort from multiple parties. This includes not only the work of
research scientists and engineers, but also efforts by managers to craft an
organizational structure that attracts and rewards such personnel appropriately. Thus, successful innovating firms must address various agency costs in
product discovery and development, to align the interests of these various
participants with the interests of the firm.
For example, one study indicates that research programs in pharmaceutical
companies that encourage publication by their scientists experience higher
rates of drug discovery. Whereas stock options are often the focus of discussions about means of resolving agency costs, this example makes clear that
incentives must be carefully tailored to the desired objective. In this case,
keeping a firm’s researchers closely connected to leading-edge developments
in fundamental science may provide a critical advantage in developing
commercially valuable drugs. Thus, just as firms can use stock options as an
incentive for managers to pursue shareholders’ interests, so, too, they can
create incentives for researchers to be connected to developments at the
leading edge of their science, by making a researcher’s standing in the greater
136 | Economic Report of the President

scientific community a significant factor in promotion decisions. A further
study suggests that these firms provide a balanced system of incentives: those
firms that use a scientist’s publication record as a positive factor in promotion
are also more aggressive in rewarding research teams that produce important
patents. This reward structure helps direct scientists’ efforts to engage in both
basic and applied research, culminating in successful drug discoveries.
Decisionmaking at all levels of a firm can play an important role in
determining its success in introducing substantial new innovations. A study
of the computer hard disk drive industry found that established firms often
had the technological know-how to develop what would turn out to be the
next disruptive technology in their market, such as the 3.5-inch disk drive. In
fact, they were sometimes among the first to develop them. But new entrants
were always the leaders in commercializing the disruptive technologies
examined in this study.
In this industry, the failure of incumbents to lead in commercializing
disruptive innovations was often traced to decisionmaking that focused on
the needs of their established market, failing to promote new technologies
whose initial applications fell outside that market. Yet it would be these technologies that would eventually develop to become the leader in the
established market. Thus the organizational structure and incentives faced by
managers of established firms played a more important role than technological know-how in their failure to lead the commercialization of disruptive
innovations. Of course, innovation benefits society whether it arises from
established or from entrant firms, but in either case, successful innovation
requires good organization.

Dynamic Competition as Repeated Innovations
All the factors we have examined—the market-transforming nature of
some innovations, the presence of intellectual property protection, the potential for economies of scale, and the presence of network effects—provide
explanations for why a firm can gain a market-leading position and earn high
profits after introducing an innovation. But what makes a market subject to
dynamic competition is the fact that the very same factors can allow another
firm, with an even greater innovation, to take much or all of the market away
from the leading firm. Indeed, as Joseph Schumpeter commented, the
competition provided by new innovations “acts not only when in being but
also when it is merely an ever-present threat. It disciplines before it attacks.
The businessman feels himself to be in a competitive situation even if he is
alone in his field.”
One example of a market where dynamic competition prevails today is
that for personal digital assistants (PDAs). Apple Computer, Inc., made
substantial investments to develop the Newton, the first handheld PDA,
Chapter 3

| 137

which it introduced in 1993. This product did not succeed, but by 1996 at least
six firms had operating systems for handheld PDAs either in development or
already available to consumers. The Palm Operating System soon emerged as
the preferred PDA, with a 73 percent market share in 1998. Although the
innovations embodied in its products have made Palm a leader in this
market, it is losing market share to new PDAs.
This example demonstrates a number of the elements often found in
markets undergoing rapid innovation. First, firms that make substantial
upfront investments in product development do not always experience the
success necessary to gain an adequate return on those investments. Second,
significant innovations can make a product the clear leader in a market at a
particular point in time. Finally, even these innovative market leaders face
challenges from later innovations by other firms that have the potential to
make the leader’s product obsolete. Therefore a potential innovator must
believe that, if it gains a market-leading position through innovation, the
resulting profits will be adequate to justify the development costs, given not
only the possibility of failure but also the likelihood that future innovations
will make any market leadership short-lived. Box 3-3 describes another
market in which dynamic competition has been particularly intense.

Implications of Dynamic Competition for
Competition Policy
Competition policy also has a role to play in markets characterized by
dynamic competition. Markets experiencing rapid or substantial innovation
can still be subject to conditions or behavior by firms that hinder competition. For instance, price fixing among firms will harm competition even in
industries undergoing dramatic innovation. Other behavior may have more
ambiguous implications for competition, dynamic or otherwise. Therefore
the antitrust agencies will continue to scrutinize behavior by firms in these
markets. Since the lawfulness of certain actions by a firm depends, in part, on
the degree of competition in the firm’s market, the ability to properly assess
all types of competition is essential. Consequently, the analytical framework
used to assess competition must encompass its potentially dynamic dimension. This involves recognizing the shortcomings of traditional methods for
assessing competition when applied to markets undergoing rapid innovation,
and developing new methods for determining how significant dynamic
competition is in a particular market.
Highlighting the importance of developing and applying such methods is
the fact that markets characterized by significant dynamic competition may
not appear competitive through the lens of some common tools of traditional competition policy. Thus continuing adjustments in competition

138 | Economic Report of the President

Box 3-3. Dynamic Competition in the Market for Prescription
Anti-Ulcer Drugs
The dramatic nature of innovations in the drug industry can give
a firm that introduces a new drug significant market share. But
subsequent, equally dramatic innovations by competitors can make
this market leadership short-lived. Such leapfrog leadership is one
characteristic of markets subject to dynamic competition.
As an example, in 1977 SmithKline introduced the first anti-ulcer
prescription drug, Tagamet. Just 6 years later, however, Glaxo plc introduced a competing drug called Zantac. Compared with Tagamet,
Zantac had fewer adverse interactions with other drugs and needed to
be taken only twice rather than four times a day. Within a year, on a
revenue basis, Zantac had gained more than a quarter of the market for
prescription anti-ulcer drugs, and by 1989 that share had risen to more
than half while Tagamet’s had fallen to about a quarter (Chart 3-4).
In 1989 Merck & Co., Inc., introduced a drug developed by Astra AB
called Prilosec, the first of a new class of anti-ulcer drugs called proton
pump inhibitors. The new drug had to be taken only once a day. Also,
studies have shown that it heals a greater percentage of patients than
Zantac does in a 4-week period. By 1998 Prilosec accounted for about
half of total sales revenue for prescription anti-ulcer drugs, while
Zantac’s share of sales revenue had fallen to about 5 percent. (In the
wake of mergers and other developments, the names of the firms that
sell all three drugs have changed.)
This example demonstrates the rapid rate of innovation in the drug
industry and how it can quickly render obsolete even highly innovative
drugs that companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing. In such a competitive environment, patents play an essential
role in encouraging firms to spend the huge resources needed to
develop ideas and products that competitors could easily copy in the
absence of legal protection.
This example also shows that, even with a patent, a firm can see its
market share taken away by another firm that develops an even better
drug for the same illness or condition. In this example, Prilosec was
introduced into the market well before Zantac’s patent expired. Given
the substantial upfront investments in drug research and development,
companies will be motivated to develop drugs only if successful drugs
can achieve high profits and capture a leading market share in the relatively short time before new innovations emerge. In the drug industry,
substantial market share can easily be lost in just a few years.

Chapter 3

| 139

policy are needed to avoid incorrect conclusions. Likewise, continuing
adjustments are needed to correctly identify markets in which high profits
and market leadership cannot be explained by the ongoing nature or pace of
innovation, suggesting that the market may indeed not be competitive.
As noted in the discussion of merger policy above, a market’s degree of
concentration is typically used as a screening mechanism to evaluate competition in that market. Although finding that a market is highly concentrated
does not by itself suffice to conclude that competition is limited, finding that
it is not highly concentrated usually does suffice to allay any such concern.
Thus measures of concentration provide a useful screen, because many
markets may not be concentrated enough to warrant further investigation.
However, given the significant role of innovation in markets characterized
by dynamic competition, it is common to see one leading firm that, through
innovation, has for the time being created a superior product. Although such
a market would be highly concentrated, there may in fact be substantial
dynamic competition in the market, with new innovations emerging to
threaten the leading firm’s position. Consequently, because many markets
undergoing rapid innovation will have a high measured concentration, such
measurements may not be as useful a screening device if dynamic competition is the primary form of competition in that industry. In light of this

140 | Economic Report of the President

shortcoming, the development of effective screening mechanisms to evaluate
dynamic competition may be a useful supplement to concentration
measures. Such screening mechanisms could allow businesses in innovative
industries to better predict the responses of antitrust agencies to their actions,
just as the safe harbor provisions relating to concentration measures did in
the 1980s.
In assessing competition in a market, antitrust agencies and the courts also
examine whether the threat of entry by a firm into that market would be
both likely to occur and sufficient to counteract any ability of existing firms
to exercise significant market power. However, for it to be adequate to
assuage concerns, entry in response to such behavior must generally be able
to take place within a period of 2 years, essentially ensuring that the incumbent firm or firms’ ability to profitably raise prices is only that durable. As the
length of patents indicates, firms may need substantially more than 2 years
for profits to provide an adequate return on their research and development
investments. Moreover, in a typical assessment of the impact of a merger on
competition, the threat of entry can be viewed as adequate to counteract
anticompetitive price increases if it would prevent the merging firms from
keeping prices significantly above premerger levels. But as Schumpeter
pointed out, even if they may take longer than a few years to emerge, innovations in dynamically competitive markets may not only reduce
incumbents’ profits that are above competitive levels, but indeed threaten the
very viability of incumbent companies. Such competition surely threatens
the durability of a firm’s market power.
Some common tools of antitrust policy may thus be less complete and
informative in dynamically competitive markets than in other situations. But
just as the antitrust agencies improved on simple concentration measures in
assessing competition during the late 1970s and early 1980s, so, too, the
existing toolkit can be further augmented to deal with dynamic competition.
The central role of innovation in these markets suggests the kind of
information that is useful in assessing this type of competition.
In general, antitrust enforcement must continue the effort to understand
the patterns, nature, and pace of innovation in a given market. In established
industries, the antitrust agencies and the courts can examine firm and
industry history to assess the significance of innovative activities. These activities would include research and development expenditures and
complementary investments in production or distribution that would have
much less value if the product they support lost its market to a competitor’s
innovation. The risky investments associated with developing innovations go
well beyond research and development to include all investments that future
innovations could render obsolete.

Chapter 3

| 141

An industry’s history can also provide indications of the fragility of market
leadership to substantial innovations in that industry. For instance, the
history of innovations in the market for prescription anti-ulcer drugs,
reviewed in Box 3-3, suggests that the threat of future innovations will
remain an important competitive force. Where such threats are important,
one might conclude that the industry is dynamically competitive.
Brand-new industries, of course, lack such a history. Nonetheless, antitrust
officials should still endeavor to assess the importance of innovative activity
in these markets, and thus the potential significance of dynamic competition.
For both new and old markets, the potential for competition from developments in other rapidly innovating fields should also be considered—even if
the technologies of the respective fields are fundamentally different—as long
as the application of those technologies is converging. For instance, vascular
grafts are used today to repair and replace diseased or damaged blood vessels.
But any assessment of competition in that market must take into account the
potential for substantial innovations in other invasive procedures or in drug
therapies that could either reduce the incidence of diseased or damaged
blood vessels or provide alternative treatments. In both new and established
industries, we must encourage dynamic competition and the benefits of
innovation it secures, by updating competition policy appropriately.
Such updating has already taken place with respect to the scope of
intellectual property protection and the effect it might have on other firms’
abilities to innovate. Although intellectual property protection is important
to encourage firms to innovate, it can also be used in ways that hinder the
development of future, and potentially competing, innovations by other
firms. The FTC and the Justice Department have addressed this possibility in
guidelines that recognize the interaction between intellectual property law
and antitrust law. These guidelines encourage the development of new technologies and the improvement of existing ones, while seeking to preserve the
desired incentives underlying the creation of intellectual property.

Conclusion
Antitrust policy has contributed greatly to the economy by fostering
competition and allowing the efficient adaptation of markets to new opportunities. This chapter has showcased some recent changes in the organization
of economic activity and market competition and outlined the adjustments
that competition policy is making in response.
First, corporate governance and structure continue to evolve, as the
rapid pace of merger activity proceeds and hybrid organizational forms
such as joint ventures and partial equity stakes continue to be established.
142 | Economic Report of the President

Competition policy should be sensitive to the efficiencies that new
structures have brought and can continue to bring to society. Since a large
source of these efficiencies may be rooted in managerial and organizational
improvements, it is worthwhile for the enforcement agencies to investigate
such factors thoroughly.
Second, the growth of multinational enterprises and cross-border mergers
will continue to make more goods and services available to consumers at
lower cost. But possible anticompetitive concerns arising out of such mergers
can now result in reviews by antitrust authorities from many nations. The
application of inefficient competition policies worldwide could harm U.S.
interests. The United States is working to narrow divergences in countries’
competition law and policy through cooperation with other national
antitrust authorities, under a number of bilateral cooperation agreements.
Through the creation of the International Competition Network, the
United States has joined with other nations to facilitate procedural and
substantive convergence.
Finally, competition policy in the United States and abroad must address
the greater prominence of markets characterized by dynamic competition.
Competition policy should take into account that characteristics, such as
high profits and substantial market share, that might warrant concern about
competition in some markets may mask vigorous dynamic competition
among firms in innovation-intensive markets.

Promoting Health Care
Quality and Access

H

ealth care is one of the largest sectors of the American economy, and
one of the most vibrant. Biomedical research has led to dramatic
advances in our understanding of the human genome, basic biology, and
mechanisms of disease, and in our ability to diagnose and treat illness. More
researchers from the United States have been awarded Nobel prizes in medicine in the past 40 years than from all other countries combined. Innovative
diagnostic and imaging tools have improved our understanding of diseases
and our ability to identify illnesses quickly, accurately, and painlessly. Novel
drugs, devices, and techniques have dramatically improved the treatment of
a wide range of illnesses. New information systems, including those relying
on the Internet, allow health care providers to work more effectively with
their patients to manage illnesses and avoid complications. These advances
testify to the success of our health care system in encouraging discovery and
innovation. Coupled with a strong tradition of dedicated, professional care,
they hold great potential for further improvements in the health of Americans.
Evidence from biomedical, epidemiological, and economic studies
confirms that these technological advances have made Americans far better
off. An American born in 1990 can expect to live 7 years longer than an
American born in 1950. The mortality rate from coronary heart disease, the
Nation’s leading killer, has declined by 40 percent since 1980, both because
of reductions in the incidence of serious heart events like heart attacks and
because of better outcomes when those events occur. Among seniors, rates of
disability have declined by more than 20 percent in the past two decades.
Many complex factors have undoubtedly contributed to these improvements. For example, better scientific understanding of diseases has enabled
Americans to make lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, to reduce
their risk, and improvements in economic conditions and public health have
enabled more people to avoid environmental health risks. But a growing
body of research indicates that medical technology played a starring role in
these dramatic improvements.
Thanks to these innovations, the number, scope, and quality of available
medical treatments have risen dramatically. These improvements in medical
treatment, rather than rising prices or other causes, have been the single most
important contributor to growth in medical expenditure. In large part as a
result of the expanding capabilities of medical care, the United States now
spends 13.4 percent of its GDP on health care, and this figure is predicted to
145

rise to 15.9 percent by 2010. There is growing evidence that, on average, the
health improvements resulting from newer, better, and more intensive treatments have been well worth the added cost. But there is also growing
evidence that substantial opportunities remain both to reduce costs and to
achieve greater health improvements through more effective use of medical
services—that is, to improve the value, or output per dollar spent, of our
health care system. Even though the American health care system provides
high-quality care overall, too often Americans receive neither the best care
nor the best care for the money. Whether lower value care results from the
underuse of basic preventive services, the overuse of medical procedures in
patients unlikely to benefit from them, or the misuse of treatments resulting
in preventable complications, there is tremendous potential to improve the
value of health care in the United States.
With rising health care costs have come rising concerns about the affordability of health care. Many health care expenses are unpredictable, and
serious illnesses have the potential to place households in financial peril.
Insurance is a standard solution: in a well-functioning insurance market,
individuals pool their risks, trading unpredictable and potentially large
expenses for much smaller, more certain expenses in the form of insurance
premiums and copayments. Yet about one in six Americans lacks any kind of
health insurance, and many more Americans are concerned about the value
of available health insurance plans. Providing high-value health insurance is
not easy. Generous, first-dollar insurance does provide protection against the
high costs of medical treatment, but by eliminating incentives to weigh the
costs of medical care against its expected benefits, it also contributes to the
overuse and the misuse of medical care.
Health care also differs from many other goods and services in that
Americans generally believe that basic health care should be available to all
members of society, even those with little or no ability to pay. Public support
in the form of assistance with health insurance and health care costs helps
achieve this goal and accounts for well over $400 billion annually in Federal
expenditure and forgone tax revenue. In the past, advocates for expanding
government health insurance programs such as Medicare and Medicaid to
address the problem of uninsurance have maintained that “guarantees” of
coverage, plus government regulation of prices for covered services, could
provide high-value health care services. But government health care plans
have faced enormous difficulties in keeping up with innovations in medical
practice and in providing high-quality, innovative care. Medicare still does
not cover prescription drugs, and Medicare beneficiaries must increasingly
rely on supplemental private insurance to provide acceptable coverage. Many
Medicaid plans, facing rapid cost increases and very low provider participation
rates under the traditional approach of regulated fee-for-service insurance,
146 | Economic Report of the President

are adopting alternative strategies to provide coverage. Other major
industrialized nations with larger public health insurance programs, such as
France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, are also
experiencing rapid growth in expenditure and problems with the provision of
high-quality care.
Private health insurance also has faced difficulties in supporting high-value
health care. In the early 1990s, advocates of managed care believed that plans
combining insurance with new financial and other incentives for health care
providers to control costs could result in higher value care. But although
managed care did contribute to a slowdown in medical cost growth in the
mid-1990s, public uncertainty about the quality of care in managed care
plans has increased, and this uncertainty has been accompanied by a return
of rapid cost increases in private insurance. Many Americans are not satisfied
with the cost and quality of the public and private health care coverage
options now available to them.
Another important obstacle to high-value care is the quality of information
available in markets for medical care. In most market settings, consumers’
purchase decisions are based on good information on the value of the products they buy. But in health care the lack of good information on the success
of different treatments—in terms of the best outcome per dollar—means
that individuals and families have difficulty making informed decisions, and
insurance companies are not rewarded for altering their coverage to
encourage high-value care. Thus strategies to improve the value of care
include supporting the development of better information for patients and
providers on high-quality, high-value treatments.
In the face of these various problems, many have concluded that American
health care policy is again at a crossroads, with fresh policy approaches
needed to support innovative health care in the future. New policy directions
are being proposed, a consistent theme of which is the encouragement of
patient-centered care—care that puts the needs and values of the patient
foremost and makes the patient the primary clinical and economic decisionmaker, in partnership with dedicated health care professionals.
Patient-centered care requires more flexibility and innovation in health care
coverage; it also places more responsibility on the patient—and less reliance
on third-party payers and government regulators—to avoid wasteful costs. To
encourage the development and use of such innovative coverage options,
competitive choices among health insurance plans and among health care
providers are more important than ever. In turn, effective competition to help
all Americans get the care that best meets their needs requires innovative,
market-oriented health care policies.

Chapter 4

| 147

To achieve more patient-centered health care by encouraging innovations
in the financing and delivery of services in this dynamic sector of the
economy, the Administration is pursuing three broad objectives:
• Develop flexible, market-based approaches to providing health care coverage
for all Americans. Markets respond more rapidly than bureaucracies to
the changing technology and new innovations in products and services
that characterize the American health care system. Market flexibility
and competition are essential if medical treatment decisions are to
reflect patients’ individual needs and personal preferences and are to be
based on the best available evidence on benefits and costs. Important
obstacles to innovation in health care coverage must be addressed, such
as the potential for competing plans to reduce costs by designing benefits to attract healthier enrollees rather than by providing more efficient
care for all persons regardless of their health risks. But these obstacles
must be addressed through health care policies that increase rather than
reduce insurance coverage rates. Competition need not threaten the
quality of care received by those with the least ability to pay; rather,
government support and oversight can be better directed to ensure that
all Americans are able to participate effectively in a competitive health
care system.
• Support efforts by health care providers and patients to improve the quality
and efficiency of care. The incentives provided by a truly competitive
system of health insurance coverage choices are an essential foundation
for a high-quality, efficient health care system for the 21st century. But
other policy changes are also needed to create an environment for
medical practice that encourages high-quality, efficient care.
Government and private health care purchasers can also help patients
and providers develop and use better information on the quality of
care, improving the ability of patients to identify high-quality providers
and plans and helping providers deliver better care. Improving the environment for medical practice also includes reforming the litigation
systems dealing with medical liability and reducing regulatory barriers
to innovations in health care delivery.
• Provide better support for biomedical research. Outstanding basic research
and path-breaking biomedical innovations have already had enormous
payoffs, generating long-term public benefits. Because of the high
returns on these investments, Federal support for biomedical and other
scientific research should be enhanced. At the same time, the Federal
Government can expand and improve the knowledge base for medical
practice, by supporting projects that analyze which treatments work
best for whom, how they can be delivered safely, and which health care
providers are doing the best job for their patients.
148 | Economic Report of the President

The remainder of this chapter explores each of these critical issues for
improving the quality and value of health care in more detail. As treatment
options continue to multiply and costs continue to increase, improvements
in the value of health care would make Americans more willing to purchase
coverage for themselves and to pay the taxes required to subsidize it for those
who need additional assistance.

Encouraging Flexible, Innovative, and Broadly
Available Health Care Coverage
Recent Trends in Health Care Costs and Coverage
Health care spending grew rapidly during the past decade, from $916.5
billion in 1990 to $1,311.1 billion in 2000, or more than 3.6 percent a year
on average (2.6 percent a year in per capita terms; Chart 4-1). Home health
care expenses and drugs were the fastest growing categories of this expenditure (Chart 4-2). The real, constant-dollar cost of private health insurance
increased by 4.9 percent a year between 1984 and 1999. Since the 1980s,
health care benefits have also increased substantially as a share of total
compensation for workers. Growth in health care costs is projected to
accelerate, with total expenditure predicted to account for 16 percent of
GDP by 2010. Over the longer term, forecasts predict that health care
spending will become even more predominant in the economy, continuing a
60-year economic trend and reaching as much as 38 percent of GDP under
conservative assumptions.
Rising costs of private health insurance in the 1980s and early 1990s led to
the emergence of managed care in private health insurance plans. Managed
care seemed to offer a solution to a fundamental health care dilemma. Its
small copayments and low out-of-pocket limits protected individuals from
substantial out-of-pocket health care costs. At the same time, its cost control
mechanisms—including capitated payments, preferred provider networks,
preapproval and utilization review requirements, and restricted formularies
discouraged the use of some discretionary medical services whose benefits
were likely to be low relative to their cost. In traditional fee-for-service health
insurance, in contrast, third-party insurance made patients and providers less
sensitive to the value of medical services per dollar spent.
In the mid-1990s, managed care succeeded temporarily in limiting cost
increases, largely by negotiating lower payments to providers for specific
services, and by discouraging utilization of some medical services and
avoiding some costly complications of inappropriate treatment. Thus, for a
Chapter 4

while, managed care by and large achieved its primary goal: bringing the rise
in insurance premiums under control without compromising quality of care.
Today, however, with the perception that managed care has often focused
more on reducing costs than improving quality, many of the managed care
approaches to controlling cost increases may be reaching their limits:
providers are negotiating more effectively with health plans, patients are
pressing for greater choice of providers, restrictions on treatment choices are
being challenged in courts and legislatures, and few additional easy targets for
reducing costs remain (Box 4-1). As a result, premiums for private health
insurance are again rising rapidly.
Public health care spending has grown rapidly as well, so that governmentsponsored health insurance plans are facing cost increases that seem difficult
for taxpayers to sustain. Federal, State, and local governments have long been
involved in the financing, provision, and regulation of health care services.
The Federal Government directly spends over $200 billion annually for the
Medicare program, which provides health insurance for nearly all elderly and
disabled Americans, and over $100 billion annually for Medicaid, the joint
Federal-State program that provides health insurance for low-income and
medically needy populations. Federal Medicaid funds are matched by almost

Box 4-1. Managed Care: Good, Bad, or Somewhere in Between?
The managed care option is an important one for many Americans.
The vast majority of nonelderly Americans with private insurance are
now enrolled in some form of managed care, representing a sea
change in health insurance coverage over the past decade. The reputation of managed care organizations has suffered in recent years,
however, and the widespread perception, based largely on anecdotal
cases, is that care is worse. To what extent does research on the performance of managed care plans bear out this perception? Not
surprisingly, the picture is mixed.
A large number of studies that have looked at quality of care have
found no significant differences between health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and fee-for-service plans. Along some dimensions,
such as the routine management of chronic illnesses and the provision
of preventive care, HMOs tend to perform better. Many managed care
programs are better able to implement systematic monitoring of
quality of care, particularly for chronic and preventive care. In one
study, for example, only 35 percent of women in fee-for-service plans
received scheduled mammograms, whereas 55 percent in managed
care plans did. In addition, because they have been able to negotiate

lower prices from their network providers and for their formulary
drugs, many HMOs have been able to offer more comprehensive benefits, such as lower copayments on prescriptions. In turn, this may
contribute to better adherence to recommended drug therapies and
other treatments among patients in HMOs.
However, certain studies have found better performance in fee-forservice plans in particular instances, especially those involving more
costly management of patients with complex illnesses. Although they
do not make a compelling general case against HMOs, these studies
provide some cautionary evidence that particular attention should be
directed toward ensuring that plans have good incentives to care for
patients with predictably costly diseases. This can be accomplished
through public policies that discourage risk selection and that provide
good information on quality of care for people to use in choosing plans.
Private insurance markets have already responded to such concerns.
For example, HMOs with closed networks are not the most popular or
the fastest-growing form of managed care coverage today. Over the
past 5 years, employee enrollment in preferred provider and point-ofservice plans has increased from 42 percent to 70 percent, while
enrollment in traditional HMOs has decreased from 31 percent to less
than 23 percent. Overall, the vast majority of enrollees are in some
form of coordinated care. The major exception to this trend is the
Medicare program, which has a low rate of HMO enrollment (because
of significant payment and regulatory problems) and has had considerable difficulty making preferred provider organizations, point-of-service
plans, and other nonnetwork managed care plans available.

$80 billion in State and local contributions. The Federal Government also
provides approximately $100 billion a year in tax exclusions to support private
health insurance for workers who receive coverage through their employers.
Historically, the Medicare and Medicaid programs have been governmentrun, fee-for-service insurance plans. They have controlled growth in costs
through tight price controls and restricted coverage. For example, Medicare’s
government-run plan does not cover prescription drugs or widely used
disease management programs that assist beneficiaries with chronic illnesses.
This is in part because the introduction of new benefits in government-run
programs tends to require either extensive rulemaking or new legislation, and
in part because of policy concerns about the potential costs of these benefits.
Access to treatment may also be restricted when physicians refuse to

152 | Economic Report of the President

participate in a program, because of either administrative complexities or (in
the case of Medicaid) low fee-for-service reimbursement rates in many States.
The combination of tight price controls and restrictions on access to treatment is likely to make it even more difficult for government-run health
insurance plans to keep up with treatment innovations in the future.
Despite these efforts to control costs, annual Federal Medicare expenditure
(in constant 2000 dollars) increased from almost $141 billion to $215 billion
between 1990 and 2000, and combined Federal and State Medicaid
spending almost tripled, rising from $95 billion to $202 billion. The faster
growth in Medicaid spending resulted from expansions of eligible populations, including new coverage through the State Children’s Health Insurance
Program (SCHIP), and from more rapid growth for certain benefits,
including outpatient prescription drug coverage for some recipients and
long-term care services—benefits not included in Medicare. Both Medicare
and Medicaid are expected to continue to grow rapidly relative to Federal
budget resources. Over just the next 10 years, Medicare spending is expected
to double, as is Medicaid and SCHIP spending. Medicare has dedicated
payroll tax financing for its hospital insurance (Medicare Part A) benefits, but
the 2001 Medicare trustees’ report projects that by 2016 the system will
begin to spend more than its tax revenues bring in, and that by 2029 the
program will become insolvent, unable to pay these benefits. Furthermore,
these hospital insurance benefits account for only a portion of Medicare
expenditure. Supplemental medical insurance (Medicare Part B) expenditure
is financed primarily by general revenue. Without program changes, by
2030 Medicare is projected to account for 4.1 percent of GDP and 21.9
percent of Federal revenue, and Federal Medicaid payments are projected to
equal 2.4 percent of GDP and absorb 12.8 percent of Federal revenue.
Medicaid and SCHIP are also creating growing budgetary pressures for
States: already the programs account for around 20 percent of aggregate State
spending.
Although still high, the proportion of the population covered by health
insurance has generally been falling as health care costs have been rising. This
rise in the uninsured population has occurred despite the substantial eligibility expansions for Medicaid and SCHIP and despite the growing share of
Americans eligible for Medicare. In the absence of new policy directions, a
further decline in the number of Americans with access to health insurance is
a serious risk, as a result of loss of jobs or reductions in benefits, even if
further expansions of eligibility for government programs occur. These
trends, considered in more detail below, provide important lessons for
encouraging competitive innovations in health care coverage, whether in
private insurance markets or in public programs.

Chapter 4

Addressing Barriers to Effective Competition in
Health Insurance
In most sectors of our economy, competitive private markets coupled
with good information work well to improve the welfare of Americans.
Tight government regulation and extensive direct government financing are
not needed. The health care market has traditionally been regarded as
different, however, for several reasons. Among these are potential inefficiencies resulting from adverse selection and moral hazard; an insufficiency of
information available to patients, health providers, and insurers; and societal
concerns about access barriers for lower income or disadvantaged Americans.
Some have argued that these problems create fundamental obstacles to
competitive approaches to health care delivery, requiring extensive Federal
involvement in regulation and financing.
Tighter regulation and increased Federal oversight, however, are likely to
lead to the same kinds of inefficiencies and stagnation seen in other highly
regulated industries. Even Medicare, which has primarily consisted of
government-provided fee-for-service insurance for elderly and disabled
Americans, has long included some competitive private health plan options.
To preserve and improve health insurance options for all Americans, the
Federal Government can encourage policy reforms that improve the functioning of health care markets, building on steps already being taken by
public and private payers.
A crucial obstacle to the effective functioning of competitive markets for
health insurance is the problem of adverse selection. Adverse selection occurs
when people who expect to incur significant health expenses sign up
for more generous, less restrictive health plans in greater numbers than do
healthier people. Because these more generous plans attract patients with
higher medical costs, premiums for those plans are driven even higher, making
the plan even less attractive to healthy individuals, in a classic “death spiral.”
Careful policy design, however, can help prevent problems associated with
adverse selection. Many large employers, including many States and the
Federal Government, have adopted a variety of competitive systems that
offer choices to the populations they cover. The following steps can reduce
selection problems:
• Introduce benefit standards. In the absence of any benefit standards,
insurance plans could attract a healthier mix of enrollees by reducing
benefits and insurance premiums, potentially undermining the
insurance protection offered and driving up the costs of competing
plans that have less healthy enrollees. By contrast, broad, flexible
standards—such as requiring catastrophic protection and some
coverage for all common health problems—have encouraged stable
competition among a variety of types of plans in the Federal employees’
154 | Economic Report of the President

system and other successful competitive choice systems used by large
private employers. However, specific coverage mandates—such as
inflexible restrictions on copayments or required coverage for particular
types of medical services—may not only exacerbate adverse selection,
by causing more individuals to drop coverage entirely, but also unduly
inhibit innovations in coverage.
Adjust premiums for risk. Some purchasers implicitly or explicitly
require additional contributions for the plan choices of higher cost
enrollees. For example, plan payments might be adjusted based on age,
sex, and certain health characteristics (Box 4-2). Medicare is currently
expanding its risk adjustment factors to include a range of chronic
health conditions.
Limit enrollment periods. Employer plan choice systems generally allow
plan changes only during a once-a-year “open enrollment” period,
except in special circumstances. The limited lock-in period reduces the
likelihood that people will enroll in an inexpensive plan with limited
benefits and then switch to a more generous plan just when treatment
is needed for a health problem.
Provide limited additional subsidies for higher cost plans. In some
competitive choice systems, employer contributions are set equal to a
flat amount. In contrast, in the Federal employees’ program and many
other employer purchasing groups, employer contributions increase
with the health plan’s cost over some range of plan choices, reducing
adverse selection pressures. Recent proposals for improving competition in Medicare and for providing assistance for purchasing private
coverage in the form of refundable tax credits would provide partial
subsidies for additional expenses, up to a cap.
Introduce health care accounts. Dedicated accounts that provide a taxfavored “buffer” in the event of significant health expenses can make
plans with nontrivial out-of-pocket payments more attractive to
workers who perceive themselves as having a higher risk of significant
expenses. This may reduce the extent to which high-risk individuals
tend to choose more generous plans, and at the same time give individuals
more control over their care.

There is now considerable evidence that the savings from efficiency gains
due to the adoption of competitive systems in large purchasing groups are
generally more than adequate to support even costly steps to control adverse
selection. Such steps can include providing some limited or partial subsidies
to help sustain the higher cost plans that some of the covered populations prefer.
For insurance markets involving small firms and individuals without access
to group coverage, adverse selection problems can be more severe. To varying
degrees, States permit providers in the market for individual insurance to rate
Chapter 4

| 155

Box 4-2.The Need for Good Risk Adjustment
Price competition in insurance markets can be a powerful force for
efficiency, but it must be used carefully if it is to result in better care for
patients. Consider, for example, a large firm that offers its workers a
menu of insurance plans. If the firm pays the insurer a flat, or “capitated, fee for each enrollee, insurers offering these plans will have an
”
opportunity to increase their profits by enrolling only the healthiest
patients, since they will tend to have the lowest medical spending. In
this situation the financial incentive for the insurer is not to provide
high-quality, high-value care, but simply to identify and enroll healthy
patients. The same issue arises in Medicare or Medicaid, when
enrollees choose a managed care plan and the plan receives a capitated
payment from the government for providing care.
Public or private plan sponsors can correct this incentive through
risk adjustment, that is, adjusting their payments to the insurers on the
basis of risk. Insurers need to be paid more to cover enrollees with
higher expected medical spending, to remove the incentive for “cream
skimming. Instead, plans will have an incentive to improve the quality
”
of care so as to attract all patients.
The best practices for risk adjustment continue to evolve. Although it
is very difficult to predict an individual’s future medical spending,
researchers are developing more effective techniques for doing so.
Moreover, there is growing evidence that many medical expenses are
not predictable and that, in the vast majority of cases, very high expenditures, when they occur, do not persist for many years. Some types of
predictable expenses do not reliably or uniformly influence health plan
or provider choices.
Medicare and Medicaid have played an important role in the
development of effective risk adjustment techniques. For example,
Medicare is developing a system of risk adjustment that relies on
detailed diagnostic information collected from both inpatient and
outpatient sources. As risk adjustment techniques continue to improve,
health plans will increasingly have to compete for enrollees on the
basis of the quality of care they provide.

each individual on the basis of his or her medical risks and past medical
expenditure. The practice of underwriting is not controversial for many lines
of insurance, such as automobile and home coverage, where differences in
claims are largely the result of voluntary individual behaviors such as driving
habits. In health care, however, a significant part of an individual’s disease
risk is outside his or her control. To reduce the extent to which high-risk
individuals face higher premiums, and to improve the availability of certain
156 | Economic Report of the President

health insurance benefits, States and the Federal Government have imposed
a range of restrictions on insurance underwriting practices as well as coverage
mandates on nongroup (and in many cases on group) health insurance
plans. The 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
imposes some Federal requirements on insurance offered by private insurers,
so that individuals who change jobs but wish to continue their health
coverage face only limited underwriting restrictions in doing so. Some States
impose more significant restrictions on insurance underwriting practices, in
the form of guaranteed issue and community rating requirements.
Such restrictions tend to reduce insurance premiums for high-risk
individuals but increase them for lower risk individuals; they may also
encourage individuals to wait until they have a significant health problem
before enrolling. The result may be less insurance coverage and only limited
reductions in premiums for chronically ill individuals, as healthier individuals choose to forgo coverage entirely rather than pay higher premiums. Thus
it is an empirical question to what extent the benefits of making coverage
more available for high-risk individuals outweigh the costs of higher average
premiums and insurance rates. Stringent underwriting restrictions in individual insurance markets, such as guaranteed issue and community rating,
may severely limit the availability of individual insurance and lead to very
high premiums. Thus coverage mandates and underwriting restrictions
should be undertaken only after careful analysis of their impact on health
insurance premiums and coverage rates. Although limited restrictions on
underwriting practices and coverage mandates may incrementally increase
the availability of more generous coverage, even these policies are likely to
increase the average cost of health insurance, and thus to have some adverse
effects on health insurance coverage rates.
An alternative to tighter regulation is to take steps to lower health insurance
costs and thus encourage broader participation. Voluntary purchasing groups
and association health plans, which allow individuals or small groups to band
together to purchase insurance, are a promising approach. Supported by
standards to ensure financial solvency and group membership based on
factors other than health, these purchasing groups have the potential to
achieve economies of scale in negotiating lower rates with participating
insurers, and may be able to set up a competitive choice system that would
otherwise be very difficult for individuals and small groups to manage. In
addition, they may be able to reduce the relatively high fixed costs associated
with enrolling a group. (Many of the administrative costs of health plans are
largely independent of group size, whereas some costs, such as underwriting,
are higher for smaller groups or for individuals.) Each purchasing group can
also adopt strategies used by large employers to encourage competition and
manage adverse selection.
Chapter 4

| 157

Some local regions as well as some States such as California have set up
and then privatized insurance purchasing cooperatives for small businesses.
Many experts have suggested that States, which have considerable experience
with competitive purchasing groups for their employees and (in a growing
number of cases) for their Medicaid and SCHIP plans, would also be effective sponsors of individual purchasing groups. In addition, some private
companies have set up voluntary programs for small agricultural groups, and
many “affinity group” insurance plans are available for individuals: for
example, many professional associations and college alumni associations offer
insurance programs. The early experience of such groups in generating lower
premiums through competition and economies of scale, and their effect on
risk segmentation in health insurance markets, have been mixed. Some
purchasing groups have been unable to obtain health insurance premiums
that were significantly better than those available from independent insurance brokers. However, many group purchasing arrangements and
association plans have attracted large enrollments and have been able to keep
premiums stable and competitive without selectively excluding high-risk
participants. Steps to encourage the development of purchasing groups, such
as providing them the same exemptions from complex and variable State
coverage mandates available to large employers while creating clear mechanisms
to ensure solvency, are likely to make these options more widely available.
The market for individual health insurance would also be improved if the
same kinds of subsidies that have worked well in employer group markets
were available. As described in more detail below, subsidies such as a refundable tax credit would significantly lower premiums, thereby reducing adverse
selection because a larger number of healthy individuals would take up
coverage. In addition, 29 States have significantly improved the functioning
of their individual and small-group markets by setting up high-risk pools.
These pools provide the opportunity for hard-to-insure individuals to
purchase subsidized coverage in a special purchasing group. Typically, the
pools are funded by broad-based fees, for example an add-on to health insurance premiums or fees. The eligibility, subsidies, and funding mechanisms
vary from State to State, contributing to differences in the stability of the
pools, in their effect on health insurance costs for chronically ill people, and
in their ability to address adverse selection problems in the State’s individual
health insurance market.
Alternatively, innovative approaches by independent insurance brokers
aimed at reducing the loading or transactions costs for individuals and small
groups seeking insurance may also lower costs and expand participation. For
example, online insurance “clearinghouses” allow small firms and individuals
to obtain competitive rate quotes quickly from a large number of insurers.
This improves price competition and can help reduce signup costs (for
example, through a standardized online application procedure).
158 | Economic Report of the President

A further concern about competition in the health care system involves
poor information. In addition to the problems of adverse selection already
discussed, patients, providers, public policymakers, and taxpayers often have
to make major decisions about medical treatments, regulations, and
financing choices with only limited information. The obvious solution is to
develop better information on treatments and on health system performance.
Helping patients to understand their choices not only empowers them to
choose the care they want but also leads to better decisions and, in some
cases, reduced costs.
Finally, health care financing and regulation can and should reflect and
reinforce the foundation of professional norms and ethics underlying the
American health care system. Physicians, nurses, and other health professionals have a long tradition of caring deeply for patients and of working
closely with them to provide the care that is in their best interests. Too often,
however, these health professionals must work in a regulatory and economic
environment that fails to encourage high-quality, efficient care. As these
barriers are overcome, leading to fewer errors and more effective treatments,
more Americans will find participation in health plans worthwhile. This
important issue is addressed in the next section.

Increasing Health Insurance Coverage
Clearly, innovative approaches are needed now more than ever to help
keep up-to-date health insurance available to workers and temporarily unemployed Americans and their families, and beyond that, to increase rates of
health insurance coverage. To encourage such innovations, public policies
should encourage a broad range of coverage options. Some of the most
promising approaches to increasing coverage provide support for purchasing
health insurance and health care services while easily adapting to changing
circumstances and patient needs. Policy studies indicate that several
principles are important:
• Recognize existing support. Tax exemptions for employer contributions
to private health insurance are an important contributor to the stability
of employer-sponsored health insurance plans. Although a concern is
that unlimited tax exemptions may create an incentive to purchase very
costly health care coverage, this form of subsidization does make health
insurance more affordable for employees and contributes to very low
rates of uninsurance—around 5 percent—for workers who are offered
employer-sponsored coverage.
• Focus new Federal support on those most likely to be uninsured. Some
groups currently receive little or no assistance with their health insurance costs. Most notably, workers who must purchase individual
coverage because their employer does not offer health insurance
Chapter 4

| 159

generally receive no tax subsidies for health insurance at all. Many small
employers and employers of low-wage workers do not offer health
insurance. This lack of subsidization is a major reason why individuals
in families with incomes less than twice the poverty line have very high
uninsurance rates, around 25 percent, and account for a majority of the
uninsured. Researchers have found that unemployed workers are three
times more likely than employed workers to be uninsured. Often these
workers are eligible to continue their former employer’s coverage
temporarily through COBRA (or are covered under “mini-COBRA”
laws in 38 States that expand COBRA to smaller employers), but
usually they must pay the full cost of their insurance. (COBRA refers
to provisions under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1986.) Those ineligible for COBRA, and those whose former
firm no longer exists or no longer offers health insurance, also receive
no tax subsidies. Unemployed workers are likely to regain coverage on
finding a new job and generally are not without insurance for long
periods. Hence, temporary assistance for involuntarily unemployed
workers would also be relatively likely to reduce uninsurance rates. In
contrast, because insurance coverage rates are already high among the
many workers with employer-based coverage, any new or expanded
Federal assistance to them beyond existing tax subsidies would be more
likely to crowd out existing private contributions. That is, such assistance might encourage workers who would otherwise have kept their
private coverage to obtain coverage under the new Federal program
instead, and thus save money even if the coverage is not as good. Such
assistance might also decrease the incentive for employers to offer
health benefits in the first place. New support would thus improve the
incomes of the affected workers but would have a relatively modest
effect on health insurance coverage.
• Design any new assistance to maximize takeup by those without coverage.
Many uninsured Americans have little income tax liability and are
likely to work in firms with other workers without substantial tax
liability. Thus tax incentives that are valuable only to individuals and
families with substantial income tax liabilities (such as income tax
deductions) do little to encourage coverage. In contrast, refundable tax
credits would provide valuable assistance. In addition, because many
uninsured households have few liquid assets such as personal savings
with which to pay health care bills, tax credits must generally be available at the time health insurance is actually purchased (that is, they
should be “advanceable”). For the same reason, credits should not be
subject to a significant risk of additional “reconciliation” payments at
the end of the year.
160 | Economic Report of the President

• Encourage a broad range of coverage options. Minimum standards for
coverage, such as protection against catastrophic health care expenses,
are important both to ensure that the policy chosen actually covers the
significant financial risks and to discourage inappropriate health plan
strategies for risk selection. But the fact that many new approaches to
delivering care are under development and becoming more widespread
now means that specific mandates and restrictions on sources of
coverage are especially likely to foreclose valuable innovations in health
insurance, limit the attractiveness of available coverage options, and
increase uninsurance.
As important as the goal of expanded health insurance coverage is, it is also
important to remember that increasing health insurance coverage is a means
to an end: effective medical treatment of all Americans, where the definition
of “effective” depends importantly on the preferences and unique circumstances of each patient. As the next two sections describe in more detail, both
public programs and private health insurance plans have considerable room
for improvement in meeting this goal. Public policies should seek not only to
increase health insurance coverage rates, but also to increase the value of
health insurance that is provided, by promoting opportunities for individual
choice and responsibility.

Innovative Tax Incentives for Increasing Private Health
Insurance Coverage
A wide range of proposals focus on refundable, advanceable, nonreconcilable tax credits to reduce uninsurance rates. Refundable credits have the same
dollar value regardless of taxable income. Advanceability means that the
credit is available when eligible individuals are actually purchasing insurance;
they need not wait for a refund until the following year when they file their
tax return. Nonreconcilability means that, when the advance credit is
awarded, eligible individuals need not worry about retroactively losing benefits at the end of the year, for example if their income turns out to be higher
than expected.
Under the Administration’s proposed health insurance tax credit, which
phases out with income, an individual’s income in the previous tax year
would be used to determine eligibility for the advanceable credit. Those who
qualify would receive certificates that could be used like cash to purchase
coverage, so that the eligible individual need only pay the difference between
the plan premium and the tax credit. Because the previous year’s income is
already known, no eligible individual would be afraid to use the credit for
fear of turning out to be ineligible because of too-high income at the end of
the year. The refundability of the tax credit would augment the ability of
lower and moderate-income individuals to purchase private health insurance,
Chapter 4

| 161

giving them improved access to competing plans. The resulting broader
participation in private health insurance markets would reduce pressures for
adverse selection.
The Administration’s tax credit would be available to people purchasing
private health insurance coverage outside of plans offered by their employer
or their spouse’s employer. That is, working and unemployed people who do
not already have tax-subsidized, employer-provided insurance would be
eligible. Similar Congressional proposals would also make assistance available
for purchasing COBRA coverage. These groups currently have the lowest
takeup of available private coverage, because they are not currently subsidized. As a result, these proposals should achieve large net increases in
coverage per dollar of program costs.
The generosity of the credit would also influence the cost-effectiveness of
the expansion of coverage. A very generous credit would obviously induce
more people to take up coverage but, depending on its design, might also
draw more workers away from current employer coverage. The result would
be a relatively expensive incentive with relatively less net effect on coverage.
Recent studies of insurance markets and worker decisions about taking up
coverage suggest that a capped credit of around $1,000 for individuals and
$2,000 for families strikes a reasonable balance. A credit in that range would
cover half or more of the cost of a reasonably comprehensive health insurance
plan—one that provides preventive coverage and major-medical protection—for most of the uninsured, yet would not be so generous as to
substantially crowd out employer-sponsored health insurance. Although
many studies indicate that such a credit would provide enough of a subsidy
to have a major impact on coverage, particularly for younger, healthier individuals, a potential problem is that it would cover a much lower percentage
of the premium for individuals over 50 and those with chronic illnesses, for
whom rates in the individual market are considerably higher. However, the
additional policy steps described previously, such as additional subsidies
through risk adjustment and high-risk pools, or expanded availability of
voluntary purchasing groups, would help markets for non-employersponsored health insurance function better for these groups.
Some health policy experts and Members of Congress have proposed a
broader based refundable tax credit—one that would also provide significant
new subsidies to all workers with employer-provided coverage. Because so
many workers have employer coverage already, however, a tax credit for
employer coverage would have a far greater budgetary impact, and a much
larger share of its costs would go toward existing rather than new health
insurance coverage. To limit the additional budgetary costs, many experts
have proposed a gradual transition from the current tax exemption to a
system of tax subsidies for employer coverage that relies more on credits.
162 | Economic Report of the President

Although such a transition would probably encourage lower cost employer
coverage and increase the takeup of employer coverage by lower income
workers, it could have a significant impact on current employer plans, union
negotiations, and other issues affecting worker compensation.
Clearly, the proposed tax credits would not cover the full costs of very
generous, “first dollar” health insurance plans. Yet there are many reasons
why such expensive coverage may not make good economic sense in any
case. First, minimal copayments lead to moral hazard in health care
spending: because the marginal cost to the patient of health care services is so
low under such plans, a disconnect emerges between cost and value in health
care decisions, contributing to rising health care costs and patient frustration.
In the future, assuming that health care costs continue to rise rapidly, such
policies will be even less sustainable. Second, reliance on minimal copayments in both private managed care and government health insurance plans
has led to significant regulatory intrusions and price controls, which
adversely affect doctor-patient decisionmaking. However well intentioned as
an approach to limiting cost increases, such intrusions may make it more
difficult for patients to get appropriate treatment.
On the other hand, many families do not have sufficient liquid assets to
absorb even a few thousand dollars in health costs without sudden, major
disruptions in their other household spending. To encourage saving for such
contingencies, some innovative proposals have been developed. Some of
these would help families set aside a “buffer” account to absorb such costs,
for example by relaxing the carryover limitation on flexible spending
accounts or the restrictions on medical savings accounts. Currently, many
employers allow employees to set aside predetermined dollar amounts on a
tax-free basis in such accounts to be used for health care or child care
expenses. However, employees in these arrangements must spend all of their
allocated dollars annually, and so cannot accumulate assets to be used in the
event of a serious illness in the following year. This use-it-or-lose-it requirement contributes to unnecessary year-end medical spending. If at least some
of the account balances could be rolled over to future years, workers could
build up a rainy-day health account by making relatively painless, regular,
tax-deferred contributions to interest-bearing accounts.
Such permanent flexible saving accounts would be similar to 401(k)
retirement accounts, which have quite high rates of enrollment even among
the lowest income eligible groups. The combination of flexible accounts with
a tax credit or existing tax subsidies would make a reasonably priced health
insurance policy very attractive—the premium would be relatively low, and
the potential for some out-of-pocket spending would not be a deterrent to
choosing such a plan. In fact, combinations of individual health accounts
with insurance plans that provide protection against substantial expenses as
Chapter 4

| 163

well as freedom from traditional restrictions on managed care coverage are
now being offered by some employers, including the members of the Pacific
Business Group on Health. But the absence of needed tax incentives may
limit the attractiveness of these forms of insurance. For example, employee
out-of-pocket spending in these innovative plans is not tax-deductible, and
tax-favored contributions to flexible savings accounts cannot be rolled over
from year to year. Expanding the availability of health accounts by addressing
these concerns would reduce financial barriers to access while encouraging
promising innovations in private health insurance.

Increasing Coverage in Public Health Insurance Programs:
Medicaid and SCHIP
Public health insurance programs can also benefit from innovative
approaches to expanding coverage. For example, even though SCHIP has
encouraged most States to provide coverage for children in lower income
families (those with incomes up to or approaching 200 percent of the
poverty level), one-fifth of such children remain uninsured, compared with
only 7 percent of children in families with incomes over 200 percent of the
poverty line. Innovative expansions of public health insurance coverage for
lower income households thus remain a high priority. Particularly needed are
expansions that would make private health plans used by higher income
families more affordable to the growing number of working families covered
through these programs. In addition, employer-provided private health
insurance coverage is much less widespread among lower income than
among higher income households; therefore expansions of public health
insurance coverage are less likely to crowd out existing coverage, leading to
greater net reductions in the number of uninsured as spending in the government health insurance programs rises. (See Chapter 5 for further discussion
of the crowding out of private programs.)
Many States have exercised options available under current law as well as
implemented specific Medicaid and SCHIP “waivers” to cover the parents of
eligible low-income children, because some evidence suggests that parents
are more likely to take up coverage for their entire family than to enroll in
children-only coverage. Some States have also implemented waivers to extend
coverage to childless adults with low incomes, in the expectation that broader
coverage for all low-income persons will strengthen the State’s health care
infrastructure. However, efforts to expand coverage are impeded by the
complex structure of Medicaid and SCHIP, which require States to deal with
multiple funding streams and administrative requirements even to provide
coverage for a single low-income family. In addition, Medicaid’s detailed and
outdated statutory requirements mean that virtually all States must
frequently go through the Federal waiver process to update their program.
164 | Economic Report of the President

Although dramatic progress has been made in clearing a backlog of plan
amendments and waiver applications, resulting in eligibility being extended
to 1.4 million additional individuals and coverage expanded for 4.1 million,
a more promising approach would emphasize the flexibility of program
design that has proved effective in SCHIP. This could be coupled with
heightened but reasonable accountability requirements, to permit objective
evaluations based on better evidence of whether State program changes that
are intended to increase coverage and improve quality of care for program
beneficiaries actually achieve their goals.
Finally, many States are now providing coverage under Medicaid and
SCHIP through competing private insurance plans, suggesting that the
combination of public funding and competitive private provision of health
insurance coverage is an effective strategy for encouraging innovation in
health care delivery for low-income populations while controlling costs. This
topic is covered in more detail in Chapter 5.

A Coordinated Safety Net for the Uninsured:
Funding for Community Health Centers
Even with expanded subsidies for private and public insurance, most
research predicts that a substantial share of currently uninsured Americans
would remain uninsured. For this reason, and because proposals to expand
health insurance coverage will take some time to implement, the
Administration has also developed initiatives to improve the availability and
coordination of medical services for those without coverage. This has been
done by increasing the flexibility of State and local governments to provide
access for low-income residents through integrated community health center
(CHC) programs. The mission of CHCs is to provide care to underserved
populations, including populations that have proved difficult to reach
through private or public insurance. To accomplish this, local CHCs
have developed innovative approaches that build on unique community
features and resources, and have collaborated with other public, private, and
academic programs.
For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (the agency
formerly known as the Health Care Financing Administration) have
partnered with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (a nonprofit
organization) and with specific CHCs around the Nation to improve health
care for low-income individuals with chronic illnesses such as diabetes,
asthma, and cardiovascular disease. The Clinica Campesina Family Health
Centers in Lafayette, Colorado, the Lawndale Christian Health Center in
Chicago, and CareSouth Carolina have developed programs adapted to their
populations and have achieved measurable improvements in diabetes care—
including the patient self-management efforts so central to successful
treatment of chronic illnesses.
Chapter 4

| 165

CHCs have also developed innovative approaches through community
partnerships and collaborative funding strategies. For example, Grace Hill
Neighborhood Health Centers in St. Louis provide services in two public
housing projects and to the homeless in 16 sites through a combination of
Federal funding as a CHC, special Federal expansion funds, and contracts
with the city, the county, and other CHCs. Grace Hill has also developed
vital information management systems, including registries of individuals
with chronic illnesses, relevant tracking reports to providers, and automatic
reminders to patients of needed preventive and follow-up tests. Because of
their community roots and their ability to focus on the distinctive needs
of their patient population, CHCs can provide a quality of care that rises well
above what might be implied by the term “safety net.”

Making Medicare Coverage More Flexible
and Efficient
One of the most obvious examples of the difficulty of keeping up to date
with innovations in health care delivery is the Medicare program’s lack of a
prescription drug benefit. More than one-quarter of Medicare beneficiaries
have no prescription drug insurance at all, despite the fact that diseases are
increasingly being treated with drugs rather than through hospital or clinic
care. This lack of prescription drug benefits among Medicare enrollees has
had adverse health consequences. In one study the use of cholesterollowering drugs, an essential component of care for many individuals with
coronary heart disease, was 27 percent for appropriate elderly Medicare
enrollees with supplemental, employer-provided plans providing drug
coverage, but only 4 percent for those with no drug coverage at all.
Innovative drug use for the treatment of ulcers costs $500 per patient but can
save as much as $28,000 by avoiding the need for a prolonged hospitalization.
Lack of prescription drug coverage is only one element of the undesirable
economic effects of Medicare’s outdated coverage. As health care capabilities
have risen over time, the benefits and the costs of changes in treatment have
been particularly great for seniors and persons with disabilities. But because
Medicare benefits have not kept pace, Medicare beneficiaries spend on
average over $3,100 a year out of pocket on major medical care, and this
spending is rising much faster than inflation. Medicare beneficiaries also face
a significantly higher risk than other insured groups of very high out-ofpocket expenses.
Because beneficiaries have inadequate options for making this spending
more predictable, they can find it very difficult to budget their often-fixed
retirement income effectively. Much of the private prescription drug coverage
available to seniors today includes spending caps, and many seniors do not

166 | Economic Report of the President

have the opportunity to purchase prescription drug coverage that protects
them from high drug expenses at a reasonable premium. Moreover, seniors
without good drug coverage are much more likely to pay full retail prices for
medications, in contrast to the significantly lower prices available from
manufacturer rebates and pharmacy discounts to virtually all other
Americans with modern health insurance. Even for covered benefits, supplemental private “Medigap” insurance that fills in substantial copayments and
coverage limits is virtually essential, because Medicare includes no stop-loss
protection, and the copayments are large. For example, the copayment
required for a hospital episode is over $800, and that for many major outpatient procedures is almost $100. Physician services generally have
copayments of 20 percent. Fewer than half of all seniors obtain coverage
through Medicaid or a supplemental insurance policy offered by a past
employer as a retirement benefit. Because of these coverage gaps, one-quarter
of beneficiaries purchase individual Medigap plans, which must conform to
standards developed over a decade ago that require first-dollar coverage in
order to get reasonably complete protection against high expenses.
Consequently, premiums for individual Medigap policies are substantial,
accounting for a significantly larger share of the out-of-pocket expenses of
the average Medicare beneficiary than prescription drugs, and they have been
increasing rapidly: premiums for the most popular standardized Medigap
plans rose more than 20 percent between 1997 and 2000. In addition to
being costly for seniors, such first-dollar coverage results in billions of dollars
of additional utilization in the Medicare program each year.
The coverage gaps in Medicare’s required benefit package, and the rising
cost of the supplemental coverage that is essential to fill those gaps, are
among the reasons why many Medicare beneficiaries prefer private insurance
plans. Such plans, which can compete for beneficiaries through the
Medicare+Choice program, typically have been able to offer more comprehensive coverage, including prescription drugs, for far less than the combined
Medicare plus Medigap premiums that beneficiaries must pay in the
traditional, government-run Medicare plan. (These premiums now exceed
$150 a month and are often much higher.) However, after several years of
rapid growth, enrollment in private plans has begun to drop significantly. An
important contributing factor is the “minimum update” for private health
plan payments imposed by the Balanced Budget Act beginning in 1998 for
most areas in the country with high private plan enrollment. Because the
payment updates are now limited to 2 percent a year at a time when private
health insurance and Medicare costs are growing much more rapidly,
Medicare’s contributions to private plan premiums in these areas are
diverging from the costs of providing coverage. Poor prospects for reimbursement, coupled with the Medicare+Choice program’s substantial

Chapter 4

| 167

regulatory burdens and the requirement that the private plans provide
coverage that actuarially meets or exceeds Medicare’s unique and uneven
benefit structure, have led a number of private plans to pull out of the
program. Those that remain have instituted substantial increases in
premiums and copayments. Meanwhile the options that have proved most
popular with nonelderly Americans—preferred provider plans and point-ofservice plans, which provide a balance between the savings possible in tight
managed care networks and the flexibility of treatment options in broader
indemnity plans—are virtually nonexistent in Medicare. As a result,
Medicare beneficiaries are headed toward having few options beyond a single
outdated benefit package, at a time when the Medicare program desperately
needs innovation in coverage to improve quality and reduce costs.
By contrast, employees of many private firms and of the Federal and State
governments, as well as many Medicaid and SCHIP beneficiaries, are able to
choose from a variety of health plans that offer a range of options in terms of
breadth of coverage networks and out-of-pocket payments. In turn, competitive choice provides incentives for health plans to reduce costs and adopt
innovations in benefits or in health care delivery that beneficiaries find
worthwhile. For example, the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB)
program has long offered a range of reliable choices to all Federal employees
in the country, a work force with diverse health needs and circumstances that
has participants in virtually every urban and rural zip code nationwide (Box
4-3). FEHB has accomplished this by providing a level of support for
premiums that is tied to the average cost of the plans chosen by employees.
Employees can reduce their health care costs if they choose a less expensive
plan, because a portion of the plan’s cost savings is passed on in the form of
lower premiums. Conversely, much of the additional cost of more expensive
plans is also passed on, so that employees who choose a more costly plan face
correspondingly higher premiums. All participating plans must meet the
FEHB benefit standards and must provide information to beneficiaries about
coverage networks and performance on a growing set of quality measures.
Analogous proposals have been developed in recent years for improving
Medicare’s coverage options, building on the proposals considered by the
National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare in 1999, the
criticisms of those proposals, and subsequent ideas from members of both
political parties. One key concept in these recent proposals is that of
preserving Medicare’s promise of a defined set of benefits while encouraging
competition between the traditional Medicare plan and private health plans
in how those benefits are provided. As in the FEHB system, beneficiaries
would pay more for plans that used a more costly approach to provide
Medicare’s required benefits, and would pay less for plans that adopted a less
costly approach.
168 | Economic Report of the President

Box 4-3. Federal Employee Health Insurance Plans
The Federal Employees Health Benefits program covers 9 million
Federal civilian employees and their dependents. The program allows
employees to choose from a menu of plans, including 11 fee-for-service
plans that are available to Federal employees in any part of the country.
Employees in most areas also have the option of enrolling in a
managed care plan such as a health maintenance organization or a
point-of-service plan. For example, Federal workers in the Washington,
D.C., area have a menu of 7 different managed care plans from which
to choose in addition to the 11 nationally available fee-for-service plans.
Plans are required to offer a package of minimum benefits but may
differ with respect to the generosity of copayments, deductibles, and
other benefits. The government pays about two-thirds of the average
cost of coverage, with workers contributing the rest. Since 1999 the
government’s share has been calculated using a “fair share” formula
that maintains a consistent contribution from the government regardless of the plan chosen, so that the employee bears the marginal cost
of choosing a more generous plan. Workers who prefer generous benefits are free to choose them, while workers who choose more
cost-conscious plans benefit from their lower cost.
The FEHB program provides a wide variety of coverage choices to
accommodate the preferences of a large work force that is diverse both
geographically and in terms of its health care needs. At the same time,
FEHB plans as a whole have experienced stable premium growth that
ensures that the program will remain on a sound financial footing. The
experience of the FEHB program shows how empowering consumers
to make insurance choices can result in coverage that is both secure
and flexible.

Some critics of the commission’s proposal have argued that any such
reforms would force seniors into private plans, because the cost of the traditional Medicare plan would be higher. But that is not necessarily true. For
example, the so-called Breaux-Frist II proposal could not lead to higher
premiums than under current law in the traditional Medicare plan. This is
because the traditional plan premium would continue to be determined as it
is now, but beneficiaries would face lower premiums if they chose a private
plan with lower costs than the traditional plan, and would face higher
premiums if they chose a private plan with higher costs.
Obviously, the Breaux-Frist II approach would work best in areas where
the traditional plan is the dominant plan. In areas where a large share of

Chapter 4

| 169

beneficiaries have enrolled in private plans, and where performance measures
indicate that these beneficiaries are receiving at least as good care as those in
traditional Medicare, using the traditional plan or any particular nonrepresentative plan as the reference point for Medicare’s support for beneficiary
premiums would be both inappropriate and potentially costly for the government or for beneficiaries. Instead, the FEHB approach of tying the
government’s support for health insurance costs to the average cost of the
plans that beneficiaries actually choose is a better way of ensuring that
savings from providing Medicare’s defined set of benefits accrue to both
beneficiaries and taxpayers.
Last year the President proposed a framework that would provide
Medicare beneficiaries with better health insurance options, similar to those
available to Federal employees. Under this proposal, plans would be allowed
to bid to provide Medicare’s required benefits at a competitive price.
Beneficiaries who elect a less costly option would be able to keep most of the
savings, so that some beneficiaries might pay no premium at all. Moreover,
the President proposed using the savings from greater efficiency in providing
Medicare’s current benefits to support further benefit improvements,
including better coverage for preventive care and stop-loss protection. The
President proposed to implement these benefit improvements while retaining
the option for current and near-retirees to stay in the current Medicare
system with no changes in benefits if they prefer it.
In addition to providing reliable, modern health plan options and better
benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, the Administration has proposed a subsidized prescription drug benefit in the context of Medicare modernization, to
help protect seniors from high drug expenses and to give those with limited
means additional assistance to pay for needed medications. Both Democrats
and Republicans generally agree that any new drug benefit in the traditional
plan should not adopt the traditional approach to delivering care, that is,
direct fee-for-service government provision with complex coverage rules and
price controls. There is broad agreement that such a bureaucratic approach
would significantly reduce the availability of innovative drug therapy
for seniors. Instead the drug benefit should give all seniors the opportunity to
choose among plans that use some or all of the tools widely utilized in
private pharmacy plans to lower drug costs and improve the quality
of care—tools that include competitive formularies to generate lower manufacturer prices, pharmacy counseling, prescription monitoring, and disease
management programs.
The Administration has also proposed a Medicare-endorsed prescription
drug card plan that would provide immediate assistance to beneficiaries
without drug coverage. The drug card plan would not be a drug benefit, nor
would it be intended as a substitute for one. Instead it would provide access
170 | Economic Report of the President

to pharmacy programs that use private sector tools like those just mentioned
to reduce drug costs and to improve the quality of the pharmacy services
available to beneficiaries. The drug discount card would be a step toward an
effective, competitive prescription drug benefit under Medicare by giving
both beneficiaries and the Medicare program some much-needed direct
experience with the private sector tools that are widely used in prescription
drug benefit plans today. It would also provide immediate assistance to
beneficiaries in obtaining lower cost prescriptions until the drug benefit is
implemented.

Better Support for High-Quality,
Efficient Care
Our current system of financing and regulating health care providers is not
geared toward recognizing and rewarding high-quality, efficient care. For
example, when poor surgical protocols result in infection, readmissions, and
additional surgical work, Medicare pays more, not less, to the hospital and
health care providers responsible. In contrast, some private payers have
begun to pay higher quality providers more, and one can envision further
reforms in this direction, while still using risk adjustment and the other tools
described in the previous section to reward appropriate care for patients with
more complex health problems.
This section highlights some of the clear opportunities to improve the
quality of health care, as well as the promising public and private initiatives
that have begun to do so. Recent private sector initiatives have encouraged
hospitals to improve patient safety through the use of computerized recordkeeping and other measures, efforts that should be reinforced at the Federal
level. Government support for research and provision of information to
health care providers about the quality of their care, and about pathways to
improving care, is another element in improving the health care system.
Reforming the legal system so that it encourages rather than discourages
collaboration and sharing of information among health providers is also a
key building block in improving the quality of clinical care.

Shortfalls in the Quality of Care
Two influential reports from the Institute of Medicine have called attention
to the serious problem of medical errors. The Institute estimated that as
many as 50,000 to 100,000 deaths each year may be attributable to medical
errors; even if these estimates are too high, as some analysts have suggested,
many avoidable deaths do occur. However, improving quality is more than
Chapter 4

| 171

the reduction of errors, or misuse of treatments. In the terminology of the
Institute of Medicine reports, the sources of poor quality include both
the underuse of procedures or treatments whose effectiveness has been
demonstrated, and the overuse of treatments with unclear or harmful effects.
Many procedures or diagnoses are widely understood to provide benefits
to nearly every person who receives them, yet are underused in practice.
Examples include screening for breast and colorectal cancer in high-risk
populations, annual blood tests for people with diabetes, and the use of
aspirin and, when appropriate, beta blocker drugs for patients with recent
heart attacks. One study of Medicare recipients, in 1997, found that fewer
than two-thirds of patients who had experienced a heart attack and had no
contraindications to beta blockers were taking them on discharge from the
hospital. In some States that rate of use was as low as 30 percent. A similar
study indicated that many Americans who could benefit from the newly
developed cholesterol-lowering drugs do not receive them. Indeed, failure to
use effective treatments has been estimated to result in 18,000 avoidable early
deaths among heart attack patients in a year.
Whereas some procedures are underused, others are overused. One-fifth of
all antibiotics prescribed in 1992 (12 million prescriptions) were used to treat
common colds and other viral respiratory tract infections, despite the
ineffectiveness (and potential long-run harm) of antibiotics for such illnesses.
A study of coronary angioplasty concluded that the procedure was clearly
medically appropriate in fewer than one-third of cases; the remainder were
either of uncertain benefit (54 percent) or inappropriate (14 percent).
Despite important technological advances in imaging methods for the
detection of appendicitis (such as computerized tomography and ultrasonography), one recent study showed no improvement in rates of
unnecessary surgery.
Reducing overuse of procedures is clearly beneficial for taxpayers, who save
money, and for patients, who avoid unnecessary interventions and their
resulting side effects. The potential savings from this reform are substantial.
One estimate suggests that as much as 20 percent of the Medicare budget
could be saved by reducing the overuse of care, particularly among patients
with long-term chronic illnesses. Although such savings might be offset by
increased use of valuable, underutilized interventions, the net effect of these
improvements in care would be much better value for the health care dollar.
Health care costs are also increased by the misuse of treatments. For
example, a patient undergoing surgery may receive the wrong medication,
and as a result experience complications that result in longer illness,
permanent disability, or death. One study estimated that as many as
27,000 avoidable deaths each year are due to the misuse of medications. Such
errors are probably most common among seniors, who take many more
prescription drugs than other insured Americans but are less likely to have
172 | Economic Report of the President

prescription drug coverage that assists them with medication management.
Even technological advances can be undone by low-technology failures
related to poorly coordinated care, inadequate follow-up, and resulting
incomplete recovery. Investing in methods to reduce medical errors would
reduce suffering, disability, and death—and the associated costs.

Disparities in the Health Care System
Not everyone with a given disease receives the same level of care. The
quality problems discussed above may be greater for low-income and
minority populations. For example, among women covered by Medicare,
74 percent of white women living in high-income areas received influenza
immunizations, whereas only 51 percent of African American women living
in low-income areas did. Rates of surgery for heart attacks are lower among
African Americans than among whites, although there is substantial controversy about the causes of such differences. Indeed, one recent study showed
that overuse of this surgery—that is, its inappropriate use in cases where the
risks outweigh the potential benefits—was actually higher among whites than
African Americans.
These differences in utilization and quality across large geographic areas
have been documented in other cases as well. A recent study showed a
remarkable degree of variation across States—from 44 to 80 percent—in the
appropriate use of an effective pharmaceutical treatment (beta blockers) for
patients who have had heart attacks. There are also wide differences across
regions with regard to overall spending and utilization (Box 4-4). It is
intriguing that areas with the highest levels of health care expenditure per
capita are not necessarily those with the best measured quality of care. In
other words, improving quality does not necessarily result in higher Medicare
expenditure. Many cities in the United States experience relatively high
quality and low costs.
The prescription for reducing disparities is clear in the case of overuse and
underuse of health care. Better quality care means encouraging much more
utilization of services that are often not used in patients for whom they are
clearly beneficial—and this holds true for all races, both sexes, and all
regions. Better quality care also means moving toward zero utilization rates
for inappropriate, procedures that have no documented benefits for any race
or either sex. Where there are a range of reasonable treatment options,
patient preferences are particularly important; for example, in the treatment
of prostate cancer in men or breast cancer in women, the “right” level of care
should depend heavily on those preferences. The reforms in health care
coverage described in the previous section would help create an environment
that rewards valuable innovations in communicating the benefits, risks, and
costs of treatment options to patients to help guide their decisions.
Chapter 4

| 173

Box 4-4.The Puzzle of Geographic Variations in
Medicare Expenditure
Despite the Federal nature of the Medicare program, there are
remarkable geographic differences in the level of Medicare expenditure per capita. The Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare, using Medicare
claims data under an agreement with the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services, has documented net spending per capita in 1996
among Medicare enrollees in 306 separate areas of the United States.
Even after correcting for differences in age, sex, and racial composition, spending per capita differs widely, ranging from $7,800 in Miami
to only $3,700 in Minneapolis. Only a small part of these differences
can be explained by variations in underlying illness levels.
The map below, reprinted from the atlas, shows the corrected patterns
of geographical variation in spending. The darkest areas are those where
spending per capita ranges from $5,698 to $8,862, and the lightest areas
those where the range is from $3,117 to $4,178. (Some areas are inhabited by too few seniors to allow spending to be measured accurately.)
The disparities in health care utilization highlighted here translate
into large disparities in Medicare benefits across regions and States.
One study showed that average lifetime Medicare expenditure for a
typical 65-year-old may differ by as much as $50,000 depending on the
State of residence. At the same time, quality of care appears to be
similar in low- and high-utilization regions. These differences suggest
that better information on the effectiveness of different styles of
medical practice, possibly coupled with better incentives to encourage
efficient care, could result in substantial cost savings for Medicare
without any adverse consequences for patient health.

Empowering Providers to Improve Quality of Care
Improving quality saves lives and can save money. No one disagrees with
the objective of improved quality; the problem is creating an environment
for medical practice that gets results. A variety of new and innovative
approaches developed at both the local and the Federal level hold the
promise of improving how care is delivered. (Many of these are described in
the recent Institute of Medicine reports on quality of care.)
A number of private sector quality initiatives have involved aspects of
health care where success can be measured objectively. For example, a collaborative quality improvement program for the intensive care unit at LDS
Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah, improved outcomes for its patients while
also lowering costs by almost 30 percent. Similarly, the Northern New
England Cardiovascular Disease Study Group developed a working group
that enabled cardiac surgeons to reduce the complications of surgery at each
stage of the procedure and to reduce postoperative mortality by 24 percent.
Each of these successful programs set the goal of studying well-defined
interventions in specific populations, using clear, objective measures of
success. Initiatives are currently under way to develop evidence on the overall
benefits of implementing quality improvement measures across an entire
hospital system.
All of these efforts, and many others around the country, have gotten off
the ground as a result of provider initiatives in the face of many institutional,
regulatory, and financial obstacles. An enormous amount of research,
including the series of studies by the Institute of Medicine, has concluded
that high-quality care can best be achieved in an environment that emphasizes and rewards continuous quality improvement. The complexity of health
care delivery means that there are generally tremendous opportunities to
improve the coordination of care, reduce communication problems, and
eliminate many avoidable mistakes and complications that occur despite the
best of provider and patient intentions. Most of these quality improvement
opportunities are “low-tech”: problems that are not so hard to solve technically, if health care providers can openly discuss and work together to
respond to the root causes of errors, near-misses, and concerns expressed by
patients and colleagues. Applying the lessons learned from many other highly
complex technical systems, such as nuclear reactors, is a promising direction
for reducing health care errors.
The growing evidence on quality improvements indicates that hospitals
and doctors would undoubtedly benefit from such local, collaborative efforts
to improve quality. But there are many obstacles to success today. Under the
current system of medical liability, this type of open discussion is widely
viewed as carrying substantial financial risks of malpractice exposure.
Leading analysts of quality improvement have called for modifications in
Chapter 4

| 175

medical liability laws so that the collection and sharing of information to
avoid errors and improve quality are not impeded. Another obstacle is financial: under fee-for-service systems like those used in Medicare and many State
Medicaid programs, providers that improve quality receive less reimbursement, because follow-up visits and admissions for complications are fewer.
As noted previously, research on how medical treatments can be used more
safely and effectively in a wide variety of actual medical practice settings is an
important element of the Federal Government’s biomedical research portfolio. In addition, many Federal programs, activities, and laws can support
providers who want to work together to improve care. Today the Medicare
quality improvement organizations (QIOs, formerly known as peer review
organizations) provide some important but limited support for efforts by
local groups of hospitals, physicians, and some other providers to identify,
assess, and improve certain aspects of health care quality. QIOs provide some
protection from malpractice liability for their quality improvement activities.
But liability protections should be broadened to include new information
generated beyond the standard medical and administrative records, through
quality and safety improvement activities, whether or not they are actively
sponsored by QIOs.
The Administration is also developing regulatory standards for health care
information systems, to implement legislation on administrative, clinical,
and privacy standards enacted by Congress in the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act. These standards have the potential to
improve health care quality, because consistent and up-to-date information
standards, coupled with privacy rules that inspire patient confidence, will
lead to more effective use of health care information. Health care providers
will incur significant costs to come into compliance with the regulations.
However, well-designed and timely standards can provide the lead time and
guidance required to minimize compliance costs. Indeed, many health care
providers have for years faced disincentives to upgrade their information
systems until the content of the regulations becomes clear.

Empowering Patients to Make Informed
Health Care Choices
As noted above, encouraging high-quality, efficient care requires
meaningful and reliable choices of health plans and providers for wellinformed patients. Within health plans, information about alternatives is
increasingly important for helping patients work with their providers to
make the best possible choices about specific illnesses such as heart disease,
breast cancer, back pain, and prostate cancer. Researchers are beginning to
understand the central role that patient preferences and choices can play in
improved and cost-effective care of chronic illnesses, including late life care
176 | Economic Report of the President

decisions. Research is also leading to better and more reliable measures of the
quality of health plans and providers, in terms of both clinical processes and
outcomes of care as well as overall satisfaction.

Informed Decisionmaking: Better Choices, Higher Value Care
Many diseases have no single “best” cure or treatment. Instead there are a
variety of ways to treat the disease, each with associated risks, benefits, and
costs. For example, women with breast cancer often face the choice of
mastectomy or a combination of breast-sparing surgery followed by radiation
therapy. Both options carry similar implications for survival for many
patients. But each has quite different implications for the patient in terms of
physical impact and the duration of treatment required, and many patients
have strong preferences about how they want to be treated.
Prostate cancer provides another example. There are tradeoffs regarding
screening for prostate cancer using the current prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) tests. Because the cancer grows so slowly, with as much as a 10-year lag
between detection and clinical importance, the use of PSA tests among older
men, who are likely to die of a different cause, should depend on the patient’s
preferences, weighing his concern about the unpredictable course of the
cancer against the unfortunate side effects of treatment, such as incontinence
and impotence. These are decisions that the physician cannot make alone.
Many health care providers are implementing changes to enhance the
ability of patients to participate in clinical decisions. At the Spine Center of
the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire,
patients with lower back pain fill out computerized evaluation forms
regarding their goals and preferences when they arrive, so that the staff is
prepared to address their concerns regarding treatment for their spine-related
illness. The risks and benefits of treatment options, including surgery, are
explained using a video featuring summaries of the clinical evidence as well as
balanced discussions by patients who have experienced each of the different
options. Following the implementation of this informed decisionmaking
approach, surgical rates for herniated discs fell by 30 percent, whereas those
for spinal stenosis (the squeezing of nerves emanating from the spinal cord)
rose by 10 percent. These changes in surgical rates move in the direction
indicated in the medical literature, which suggests that the former procedure
is overused and the latter underused. Thus the program appears to have
provided patients with quality information to assist them in making
educated decisions, thereby improving their well-being while reducing
overall costs.
This patient-centered approach to evaluating health care outcomes also
provides a valuable framework for judging differences in treatment rates by
race or sex for specific “preference sensitive” diseases. The important message
is not that treatment choices should be the same across all subgroups of the
Chapter 4

| 177

population. Rather, when several alternative treatments are available, patient
preferences (rather than race or geography) should govern choices. For
example, preferences for elective hip and knee surgery vary by sex, even
among patients for whom the treatment is deemed medically appropriate.
Less is known about differences in preferences by racial identity, although
differences in preferences between whites and African Americans regarding
end-of-life care have been noted.

Better Public Information on the Performance of
Health Care Providers
A growing number of private health care purchasers are supporting
informed decisionmaking by their employees by making measures of quality
available on their health plan choices and, in some cases, on particular health
care providers. These include clinical measures of plan performance such as
those now widely used by the National Commission on Quality Assurance
(for example, rates of appropriate treatment for diabetes and immunization
rates) as well as patient-focused measures such as those developed by the
Foundation for Accountability (FACCT). The Federal Government also has
a particularly important role to play through supporting the development of
appropriate information to help patients and providers identify and reward
high-quality care. The Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal employee insurance
systems hold information on literally millions of health care subscribers who
are among the heaviest users of the health care system. With appropriate
privacy protections, clinical studies using the data systems of these very large
health insurance programs could augment data from private payers, allowing
the construction of more comprehensive and accurate measures of plan
quality, and potentially of provider quality as well. Indeed, the Federal
Government has collaborated with private organizations in the development
and use of patient satisfaction measures (Consumer Assessment of Health
Plans, or CAHPS, measures). It is also a key player in the National Quality
Forum, a public-private approach to endorsing reportable quality measures
that are supported by experts, consumers, and other major stakeholders.
The process of identifying appropriate measures for public reporting is a
difficult yet important one, because the measures endorsed must be valid
indicators of quality if they are to encourage better health care decisions.
Because patients are not allocated randomly to health plans or providers,
measures are potentially biased by differences in case mix and may thus
require adjustment for risk, so that they truly reflect differences in performance rather than differences in the health of the patient groups treated. In
addition, medical information systems are imperfect, and some quality
measures may not be captured adequately. Finally, because many important
medical outcomes (including death following surgery) are relatively rare
178 | Economic Report of the President

events, some measures may incorrectly attribute bad luck to poor quality
care. (For a more detailed discussion of performance measurement issues, see
Chapter 5.) Quality measures that are themselves of poor quality may be
worse than no measures, if they discourage providers from taking difficult
cases or if they can be manipulated to improve measured performance. Thus,
many quality and safety measures are better used on a confidential basis, as
part of the internal quality improvement programs described in the previous
section. As measurement methods and data systems have improved, however,
a growing number of quality measures have been developed and are
becoming widely used for public reporting by employers, States, and the
Federal Government.
In addition, as mentioned above, some private purchasers now reward
better measured performance with higher reimbursement, at least to a
limited extent. Some insurers and purchasers include an incentive payment
for achieving high scores on certain validated quality measures. Others have
begun to use quality measures to influence their selective contracting with
providers. For example, the Leapfrog Group, a consortium of more than 80
Fortune 500 corporations and other large institutions, has developed guidelines for contracting with hospitals by establishing a growing set of specific
performance standards. The initial recommended measures for contracting
include high numbers of certain surgical procedures (because hospitals that
perform a higher volume of many complex procedures achieve better results),
the use of computerized recordkeeping (because computerization helps
reduce medical errors and misuse of care), and the direction of intensive care
units by physicians specializing in intensive care.

Fulfilling the Promise of Medical Research
Developing an economic and institutional environment that encourages
continued technological advances is a critical goal for the coming decades. As
part of this environment, direct Federal support for an increasingly broad
range of biomedical and related research is essential. The value of this
research is evident in the medical progress witnessed over the past several
decades. In large part because of active support by the National Institutes of
Health and other Federal agencies, biomedical knowledge has grown rapidly,
encompassing dramatic advances in understanding basic biological processes,
identifying the pathology of specific diseases, and developing effective treatments. The decoding of human genome through public and private support
is but one recent example of pioneering research that will lead to innovative
prevention and treatment approaches.

The Benefits of Biomedical Research
The past several decades have seen remarkable gains in longevity and
reductions in disability. One of the most striking examples of technological
progress in the treatment of illness is that for coronary heart disease (CHD).
Since 1970, mortality from CHD has been declining between 2 and
4 percentage points a year on average, with overall rates falling by about
40 percent since 1980 (Chart 4-3). Although primary prevention has been
an important contributor, most advances in cardiovascular health care are
due either to innovations in mechanical treatments to improve blood flow to
the heart (such as bypass surgery, newer and less invasive angioplasty procedures, and special wire stents to help hold diseased vessels open) or to
pharmacological treatments (such as beta blockers and antihypertensive
drugs to reduce the heart’s work load, and thrombolytic “clot busters” to
open up blocked vessels during a heart attack).
These improvements have not come without cost, which raises the critical
question, in light of generally rising expenditure on medical care, of whether
the increased costs are worth it. The answer, at least in the case of heart
attacks, appears to be yes. One recent study concluded that the improvements in survival after a heart attack more than compensated for the
increased financial costs. In this case, the money was well spent. Even though
annual expenditure on cholesterol-lowering drugs is well into the billions of
dollars, they have been proved to be highly cost-effective for many patients
and have contributed to the improved life expectancy and better functioning
of Americans today.
Such examples are not limited to heart disease. Chart 4-4 displays the
rapid improvement in 3-year survival rates following the onset of an opportunistic infection signaling AIDS infection. Even though the new treatments
developed to prevent AIDS complications are quite costly and have many
side effects, these survival improvements suggest they are well worth the cost.
As another example, new medications for depression have similar efficacy
with fewer side effects, resulting in better adherence to treatment, better realworld effectiveness, and a reduction in the net cost of a remission. In
addition, the availability and ease of use of these medications have
contributed to a doubling in the rate of treatment of depression, increasing
the economic benefits. Medical advances are doing more than just keeping
increasingly frail elderly people alive: a recent study suggests that rates of
disability among the elderly population have actually declined in recent
years, probably because of avoided complications and better supportive care
for chronic illnesses. We should remain aware of the distinction between long
life and long, healthy life, but for the present, advances in medical
technology seem to be accomplishing both.

180 | Economic Report of the President

Chapter 4

| 181

These studies are part of a growing body of evidence that, for a wide range
of diseases, the additional money spent on treatment is more than offset by
savings in direct and indirect costs of the illnesses themselves. Indirect costs
include lost productivity and, especially, poor health, which people are clearly
willing to pay to avoid. Stated differently, because the quality-adjusted
cost of treating many diseases has fallen, health care has become more
productive over time, even as absolute costs are rising with greater use of
more intensive treatments.

Many Unanswered Questions About Existing
Medical Treatments
Although these gains are impressive, there is still much to learn.
Cardiovascular disease is the success story of modern medicine: a plethora of
articles have demonstrated the value of different treatments compared either
in isolation (drug treatment versus invasive cardiac surgery, for example) or
in combination. Thus conclusions about rising productivity for cardiovascular care are the best documented, with literally thousands of clinical trials
and epidemiological studies. Yet even in this area, substantial opportunities
for further productivity improvements appear to exist. For example, in one
recent study a large share of the treatments for coronary artery disease
performed were judged to be of uncertain value based on medical expert
reviews. Other examples of opportunities to improve the quality of cardiovascular care were discussed in the previous section. The situation is even
cloudier in the treatment of other chronic diseases, where the evidence-based
science is much sparser; here physicians have a less extensive knowledge base
to draw upon. For example, on chronic lower back pain—an extremely
common condition—no evidence is yet available from large randomized
trials on the benefits of surgery versus medical management and supportive
care, although one trial is currently under way. It is also more difficult to
determine the effectiveness of many screening and preventive treatments.
Better diagnostic methods often result in the identification of earlier or less
severe illness that would have been overlooked before. Thus when previously
“subclinical” cases with relatively good outcomes are added to the population
diagnosed with the illness, survival rates may appear to improve, even if treatment methods have not (Box 4-5). In addition, clinical trials of preventive
treatments are often prohibitively expensive, because they require very
large enrolled populations and take many years for effects to be detected
with confidence.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of specific treatments often varies
substantially across population subgroups. For example, it is just now being
understood that the effectiveness of cholesterol-lowering drugs depends
significantly on the characteristics of the patient. As we develop a clearer
182 | Economic Report of the President

Box 4-5. Survival Rates and Mortality Rates
Survival rates for breast cancer have risen dramatically. Whereas in
1950-54 the 5-year survival rate was only 60 percent, by 1989-95 it had
risen to 86 percent. This improvement is in part the result of important
technological innovations in the treatment of breast cancer; nonetheless, these 5-year survival rates probably overstate the actual gains.
The reason is that the detection of breast cancer has also improved
dramatically: current technology is able to detect much smaller nodes
than could be identified before, which may or may not develop into
cancerous sites. Thus, improved 5-year survival rates reflect several
phenomena. First, more women are being diagnosed, some of whom
might not have developed clinically significant cancer during their lifetime. Second, more diagnoses are occurring at an earlier stage of the
disease; this means a higher likelihood of surviving 5 years after the
initial diagnosis, independent of improved treatment. Third, treatment
is actually producing better outcomes. Unfortunately, most of the
measured gain in survival has occurred because more women have
been diagnosed at an earlier stage of the disease.
The story for prostate cancer is similar. Older men are increasingly
aware of the risk of prostate cancer, and the use of PSA tests to detect
the disease has expanded rapidly. This has led to a 190 percent increase
in the rate (per thousand men in the population) diagnosed with
prostate disease, and survival rates have improved from 43 percent in
1950-54 to 93 percent in 1989-95. Unfortunately, the number of deaths
due to prostate cancer per 100,000 men in the population (that is, the
mortality rate) during this same period actually rose. Again, the
improvement in survival rates primarily reflects earlier diagnosis rather
than significant improvements in treatment.
Because of this discrepancy between 5-year survival rates and
mortality rates, there is controversy among clinicians and medical
researchers about the benefits of universal screening for prostate
cancer, particularly for older men. The reason is that prostate cancer
typically grows quite slowly; the median time between detection of
prostate cancer through the PSA test and the ability to detect it clinically is about 10 years. Men may have prostate cancer, be entirely
unaware of it, and die of something entirely different. Both prostate
cancer and breast cancer hold promise for substantial technological
breakthroughs that would reduce mortality rates, just as they have for
coronary heart disease. Until that time, management of the disease can
benefit from a better understanding of the treatment options available
to patients.

Chapter 4

understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of diseases,
treatments are likely to become even more tailored to individual circumstances. All of these examples suggest that better scientific knowledge,
including more information from both randomized clinical trials and largepopulation studies of actual practices, can lead to substantial productivity
improvements through more efficient use of the many medical treatments
available today. These improvements in productivity can be facilitated by
developing systems to disseminate information about the value of different
interventions—their benefits, risks, and costs—and by developing better
electronic health records with effective privacy protections. Providing
patients with better information about the true value of different treatments,
coupled with stronger incentives for patients and providers to use approaches
of demonstrated value, will help ensure value and productivity in health care
in future years.

The Role of the Federal Government in
Supporting Research
The impressive improvements in the health of Americans over the past
several decades have not occurred in a vacuum, but arose because of work—
much of it collaborative—by government, private, and charitable
organizations in support of basic research, clinical testing, and product development. The health care system of the future will need to preserve and
encourage this product development, through direct support for research
with potentially broad applications, and through the protection of patent
rights, to help turn promising new research insights into treatments approved
for clinical use. The government can also provide critical support for
improving our knowledge of how to use existing medical treatments even
more effectively. Follow-up clinical trials often find that medical treatments
that are beneficial for the average patient in a population may have no
beneficial effects for some subgroups and may even cause them harm. There
may be insufficient private incentives to explore which of the many types of
patients—younger, older, sicker, healthier—with a given clinical problem
actually benefit from a treatment, yet this understanding may have
important implications for the best treatment decisions for individual
patients and for the costs of public and private health insurance programs.
In addition, research on the underuse, overuse, and misuse of treatments
has benefits that extend across all who pay for health care, and as a result,
individual payers may underinvest in research to improve health care quality
and safety. Thus the Federal Government should provide support for research
using population data on health system performance and public health. This
should include support for medical information and privacy standards that
allow clinical data to be pooled for research and public health purposes.
184 | Economic Report of the President

Conclusion: Fulfilling the Potential
of 21st-Century Health Care
The American health care system stands at a critical juncture. The gains in
medical productivity of the last 40 years have been tremendous; the next
40 years have the potential to bring even more valuable advances. Promoting
flexible, market-oriented care that responds to the diverse needs of patients is
increasingly crucial to improving the well-being of all Americans. But health
care costs are also rising rapidly, and enormous opportunities exist to increase
the value of health care and improve health insurance coverage. Addressing
these fundamental problems and fulfilling the potential of our health care
system will require innovative Federal policies to help Americans get the care
that best meets their needs, and to create an environment that rewards highquality, efficient care. To meet this challenge, Federal policy must rely on
market mechanisms to encourage our health care system to identify and
reward high-value treatments, while reducing wasteful spending on treatments of little value. It must harness the benefits of competition for the
well-being of all Americans.
Flexibility to respond to rapid changes in medical treatments and the
changing needs of patients is crucial. A bureaucratic system that fails to
respond to patient needs or that is slow to embrace new technological developments is not the appropriate foundation for the future of American health
care. Nor is a health care system that creates perverse incentives, rewarding
the underuse of effective treatments and the overuse of ineffective ones while
penalizing providers who seek to practice cost-effective care. Instead the
Federal Government should improve coverage options in public programs
like Medicaid and Medicare. It should ensure that Americans with limited
means or high health care needs have the opportunity to participate in
mainstream health plans, through refundable tax credits and strategies to
increase participation in health insurance markets. It should support both
biomedical research and health services research, to improve our understanding of disease, develop new treatments, and improve the quality and
value of health services. It should encourage the development of better information on the quality and outcomes of care. And it should support an
environment for medical practice that encourages high-quality, efficient care
that meets patient needs. The need to empower patient choice and enhance
market-oriented incentives calls for government policies that move away
from detailed top-down regulation and one-size-fits-all government-run
programs, and toward ensuring that all Americans have innovative health
care options.

Chapter 4

| 185

These changes in our current system are likely to affect both patients and
providers. As the health care sector continues to grow, it becomes increasingly important to encourage new medical options that are worth the cost to
consumers. Economic theory suggests that those critical decisions should
generally be made by those with the best information and the most direct
stake in using that information appropriately: the patient and his or her
medical providers, not government or insurance plan bureaucrats. But
economic theory also suggests that the ability to make these decisions should
be paired with responsibility for their consequences, both for health and for
medical costs.
Decisions about health care and health care systems, for both providers
and consumers, require not only good information but also financial responsibility. Medical providers have a responsibility, as well, to assist patients by
examining their own practices through the unflinching analysis of errors
when they occur, and by reexamining long-held beliefs about the standard of
care in light of new evidence about treatment effectiveness and costs. Already,
case studies of both private payers and public plans around the country
indicate what these efforts can achieve. Public policy should encourage these
promising trends.
Finally, the Administration’s overall economic policy is a critical factor in
improving our ability to provide high-quality care. Rapid economic growth
in the mid- to late 1990s helped keep the rise in health care costs roughly in
line with growth in Americans’ earnings. Uninsurance rates declined in 1999
and 2000, in large part because of the increased takeup of private, employerprovided health insurance, which, thanks to productivity increases, was
becoming relatively less expensive as a share of compensation. Encouraging
rapid economic growth not only will help keep private health insurance more
affordable; it will also provide a growing revenue base for Medicare and other
Federal programs.
Economic growth is not enough, however. A growing body of research,
confirmed by many examples from the public and the private sectors,
suggests that we can do a much better job of allocating medical care resources
both efficiently and equitably. Providing competitive choices for all
Americans, and meaningful individual participation in those choices, is the
best way to encourage needed innovations in health care coverage and health
care delivery. Improving the information available to guide choices, taking
steps to help individual patients and providers use that information effectively to provide patient-centered care, and making a range of additional
policy changes that create an environment of medical practice that encourages innovation and high-quality care will help ensure that health care
remains one of the most dynamic and productive sectors of our economy.

Redesigning Federalism
for the 21st Century

T

he Nation’s federal system is one of the great strengths of the American
economy. Federalism gives States and localities the freedom to provide
services that best meet the needs of their diverse populations. It puts citizens
closer to their government, and thus in a better position to monitor and
control how their tax dollars are spent, and it creates competition between
jurisdictions, which drives innovation.
The Federal Government plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of this
system. It is important for the Federal Government to seek a framework for
competition and accountability that avoids burdensome rules and regulations, which undermine the competitive advantages of State and local
governments. Rigid dictates from Washington about how public goods and
services are provided preclude innovation and dull competition. Creating a
flexible institutional structure that will allow the efficient provision of public
goods, by focusing on achieving goals and freeing up innovation, is an
important goal of this Administration. In this way the Federal Government
can improve the quality and efficiency of public programs and increase their
responsiveness to public needs.
The advantages of this results-oriented, flexible approach are evident in
many programs and at all levels of government. First, when the focus is on
results, such as student achievement, rather than on process, such as how
schools spend money, States, localities, and private organizations are empowered to choose, from a wider menu, the most effective means to these ends in
their area and for their population. Second, flexibility allows more institutions to become involved in providing these services. As long as all are
evaluated on the basis of results, governments, nonprofit organizations, faithbased organizations, and others can compete on an equal footing, while
using different methods. The resulting laboratory of methods allows more
effective ideas and organizations to win out over less effective ones, creating
the potential for more and better services for a given amount of spending.
This chapter examines both the promise and the challenges of federalism,
focusing on three specific areas of program design in systems of flexible
accountability: education, welfare, and health insurance for those with low
incomes. In education, this Administration believes that the competition
provided by choice is the best tool available to improve quality, with public,
private, and charter schools vying with each other to provide the best education most efficiently. When the right institutions are in place, parents can
187

hold school systems accountable for results. Similarly, taxpayers must be able
to hold the providers of safety net programs, like welfare and Medicaid,
accountable for the quality of services they provide and the resources they use
to provide them. By tying payments to social service providers to the results
that they achieve, and by allowing private nonprofit providers to compete on
an equal footing with government providers, the same market discipline that
drives innovation and efficiency in the private sector can be brought to bear
on these programs as well.

Institutional Design in a Federal System
The preeminent means for providing goods and services in the U.S.
economy is private markets. The fundamental strength of the market system
is that consumers are able to evaluate the quality and price of a variety of
goods and services that they might purchase, and are free to make decisions
about which vendors to patronize. Competition among providers promotes
efficiency, which means goods and services of the highest quality at the
lowest cost.
In those circumstances where markets do not work efficiently, there may
be an avenue for governments to improve overall economic performance. An
example is the provision of public goods. Public goods are those goods and
services that, in contrast to conventional private goods, provide benefits for
society beyond those enjoyed by any individual consumer. For example,
there is no single “consumer” of a cleaner environment; as discussed in
Chapter 6, environmental protection is therefore a public good. Similarly,
each member of the population gets the benefits of safer streets, or a better
informed electorate, or a public park. Here the collective nature of the benefits flowing from the good or service makes it difficult or impossible for
private providers to make any single consumer pay for it. To ensure the availability of these public goods, the government may arrange for their
production, provision, and financing.
The long federalist tradition in the United States is a tremendous resource
for governments seeking to meet this challenge. A neighborhood park, for
example, is a local public good, shared by the citizens of a local area, not the
Nation as a whole. Getting the “right” amount of these local public goods in
every locality would be an insurmountable task for a central government.
Instead, State, county, city, and town officials, who are closer than their
Washington counterparts to the needs and desires of their electorates, are
better positioned to be responsible for these goods. Moreover, there is a
natural check on their actions: residents voting at the ballot box—or with
their feet, by moving elsewhere—force local governments to compete. Just as
188 | Economic Report of the President

private firms compete in markets for private goods, so, too, governments can
compete in terms of the quality, price, and quantity of the services they
provide, and this fosters innovation and efficiency. This marketplace for
government services constitutes a more efficient means by which to provide
these services in our society.
Although there might be a clear role for governments in providing local
public goods, it is not immediately obvious that it is efficient for the public
sector to produce a particular public good or service. Instead the government
could choose how much to provide but rely on the private sector to undertake actual production. If minimizing costs is the only objective, complete
reliance on competitive private sector production will likely be efficient. In
other circumstances, however, competition could foster an excessive focus on
cost reduction to the detriment of achieving results of the desired quality.
(This is especially likely when it is difficult to write contracts that comprehensively specify the level of quality to be achieved.) Strictly public provision,
on the other hand, might promote a focus on high-quality results without
due consideration of the efficient use of public resources. Which is the better
method of production depends on how difficult it is to observe the quality of
the services provided, the degree to which cost reductions affect the level of
quality, and the potential for innovation in producing the services.
Thus, although competition between jurisdictions generally promotes the
efficient provision of public goods and services that are tailored to the diverse
needs of their citizens, it is neither always necessary nor desirable that those
jurisdictions themselves produce those goods and services. The focus of
public spending should be on efficiency: on the quality of results achieved for
every dollar spent.
One way to produce public goods more efficiently is to let private firms
compete for public contracts. Some municipalities contract out services such
as trash collection to private vendors through competitive bidding. There is
no reason, however, that such competition should be restricted to the forprofit sector. Indeed, government agencies can promote competition through
outside contracts for staffing, limited reliance on exclusive grants and
contracts, and opening competition for grants and contracts to faith- and
community-based organizations. In each of these cases, it falls to the government responsible for providing the service to monitor the quality of services
provided and to ensure, through whatever contracting means are available,
that services being purchased with public funds live up to public expectations
and requirements. Competition between governments can then lead to the
right public goods and services being provided with the greatest efficiency.
In practice, several complex issues arise in a federalist approach. First, by its
nature, competition among governments offers no guarantee of equal
outcomes: competing jurisdictions may differ greatly in the resources at
Chapter 5

| 189

their disposal to finance government services, and thus in the amounts and
the variety of services that they can offer. Although these differences may
reflect differences in the tastes of households across jurisdictions—and thus
show that the government marketplace is working—they may run counter to
a desire for greater equality. In these and other circumstances, the Federal
Government may choose to provide funds to State and local governments in
a way that makes outcomes more equal. That is, it may seek to alter the result
of the federalist system. This may be desirable in itself, but often the Federal
Government has chosen to dictate the use of these funds. Such mandates are
at odds with the goal of encouraging State and local governments to respond
flexibly to the desires of their constituents.
The history of federalism is to a large extent a history of the struggle to
achieve an optimal balance between allowing flexibility for State and local
governments and maintaining accountability for the use of Federal funds.
The New Deal of the 1930s and the Great Society of the 1960s consolidated
in the Federal Government much authority for the programs they created,
and Federal spending increased from 3.4 percent to 19.3 percent of GDP
between 1930 and 1970. Then, in the mid-1970s, the “New Federalism”
sought to increase efficiency in the federalist system and to devolve program
control to States and localities, while introducing such innovations as
Community Development Block Grants and general revenue sharing. In the
late 1970s, the Federal Government sought to expand its authority over these
block grants. Ninety-two new categorical grant programs were instituted
from 1975 to 1980. (Categorical grants are those that must be spent on a
designated population, and they may involve Federal matching of State
funds.) In the 1980s, the tide once again turned toward decentralization: 77
programs were consolidated into 9 block grants. Much like the 1970s decentralization, this movement was thereafter partially reversed as more
constraints were placed on the block grants, and previously scaled-back regulations again became more cumbersome. The major federalist initiative of the
1990s was the partial decentralization of welfare. These swings highlight the
tension between the desire for assurances that Federal funds will be spent
productively to advance program objectives, and the desire to take advantage
of the efficiencies generated when local agencies have the resources and the
freedom to innovate and to cater programs to local populations.
These two goals need not be at odds. Federal micromanaging of resources
and processes achieves neither. By focusing instead on setting standards for
results—not dictating actions—and rewarding providers for achieving goals,
the Federal Government can give local governments more control over the
use of funds without sacrificing progress toward national goals. This focus on
outputs is a key piece of the infrastructure for an efficient federalist system,
one that centers attention on what is delivered to the final consumer and
puts in place incentives to identify and measure desired results. This
190 | Economic Report of the President

Administration has signaled its commitment to such systems through its
vision for Federal, State, local, and private partnerships across all areas of
public spending.

Fostering Partnerships,
Competition, and Accountability
Organizations, be they public or private, that accept Federal funds in
return for providing a service must agree to provide that service in a manner
that meets Federal standards and goals. It is desirable, however, that they do
so with the minimum interference possible. In activities where measuring
results is difficult, it is harder to hold providers accountable. In some cases
the data currently available are insufficient for this task. However, it is important to recognize that the existence of good data on program outcomes is in
large part determined by the measures used to evaluate the programs.
Developing a system of accountability based on well-measured output will
promote the collection and analysis of this important information. This
Administration seeks to create an institutional framework that will encourage
the development of measurable standards to which all providers of public
services—Federal and local, public and private—can be held accountable,
and then to allow these providers themselves to find the best way to meet
those standards.
Leveling the playing field for governments, nonprofit providers, and forprofit providers, and thereby encouraging the free entry of all providers,
promotes market efficiency just as in the private sector. This is a desirable
goal, and not an entirely new phenomenon. Market forces already bear on
for-profits, but they do on nonprofits as well, when they compete for private
donations. In a 1998 survey, 75 percent of respondents said that whether or
not a charity used their time and money efficiently affected their choice of
charities. Allowing private providers to compete with public agencies to
provide services in areas such as welfare, and evaluating all providers based on
achieving program goals, are ways of expanding this market discipline to
public providers. However, several institutional and logistical barriers
currently inhibit this kind of competition. For example, although the
Charitable Choice provision of the 1996 welfare reform legislation was
intended to allow faith-based organizations to compete on an equal footing
with other organizations to provide welfare services, preexisting laws and
regulations in many States still prevent them from participating. This
Administration is committed to eliminating these barriers.
Despite these impediments, many State governments are already forging
new partnerships with private organizations for the provision of high-quality
Chapter 5

| 191

public services through performance contracting in social services.
Performance contracts usually include output targets and may make the size
of payments contingent on meeting those targets. States have long used
performance standards in their budgeting processes. For example, under
Texas’s approach to performance measurement, agencies are required to
include 6-year strategic plans in their budget requests. Each plan must
specify the agency’s goals, objectives, outcome measures, strategies, and efficiency measures. Pennsylvania has included performance measurement in its
program budgeting for over 25 years. As of 1997, 31 States had legislated
some form of performance-based budgeting requirements, and 16 had
implemented such measures through guidelines and instructions.
Although such provisions have long been standard in municipal service
contracts such as those for garbage disposal, they are relatively new in social
service contracting. In the municipal services sector, results may be more
easily defined and codified in contracts: for example, where and how often
trash will be collected. However, the quantities and the quality of social
services desired can be much harder to specify and to observe, making
contracts more difficult to write. Recipients may not have the expertise to
evaluate the quality of the services they are receiving, and they may not have
the option of changing service providers if dissatisfied. In such circumstances, the contracting agency must provide oversight to ensure that
adequate services are provided. Creative solutions have been devised for
some of these problems; for example, providers can be required to meet a
professional or industry standard, potentially simplifying contracts. The
Federal Government could make performance contracting easier for States by
developing generic contracts for commonly used social services, which interested
States could then adapt to their particular needs.
These public-private partnerships illustrate some of the advantages and
some of the difficulties of designing programs with flexibility and accountability in a federal system. These issues are explored below in the realms of
education, welfare, and Medicaid.

Elementary and Secondary Education
Unlike many other publicly financed services, primary and secondary
education has historically been under the control of local governments, with
educators accountable to local taxpayers. Taken at face value, this suggests
that the forces of competition should already be at work to promote highquality, efficient provision of public education. To some extent, taxpayers
have the ability to control the quantity, quality, and price of education by
“voting with their feet”: if the local school district fails to perform adequately,
they can move elsewhere. In some jurisdictions, citizens vote directly on
192 | Economic Report of the President

property taxes, or even on school budgets. Parents may also remove their
children from the public school system altogether by placing them in private
schools or home schooling them.
These mechanisms are more effective, however, when parents can accurately
evaluate the quality of local schools. When they cannot, or when local alternatives to poor-quality schools do not exist and moving is prohibitively
expensive, effective competition is limited. Also, given the broader social
benefits of a well-educated work force, some redistribution may be necessary
to ensure that all children have access to an adequate education. Thus, even
though State and local governments retain the primary responsibility for
educating the Nation’s children, and face competitive pressures in doing so,
the Federal Government can still serve a vital role in further lowering barriers
to local competition.
This Administration seeks to create and strengthen the institutions that
allow local education markets to work, that let school districts cater to the
diverse needs of their populations, that empower parents to choose what is
best for their children, and that ensure that no child is left behind. An efficient and effective market for education, much like any other market,
requires freely available information and incentives for good performance.
Tests are a key component of this framework. This Administration believes
that once this information and these incentives are in place, competition
among schools is the best way for parents to make sure their children receive
the best education possible. School choice empowers them to do so. To
ensure that adequate options are available for all children, the Federal
Government can provide supplemental resources for the education of lowincome children and children with special needs. However, these subsidies
must be designed so that they do not interfere with the incentives for schools
and school districts to spend efficiently.
The No Child Left Behind Act, proposed by the President, passed by
Congress, and signed into law on January 8, 2002, addresses each of these
goals. It is a major step toward improving the quality and efficiency of the
schooling available to America’s children. The rest of this section discusses in
detail the principles that underlie this legislation.

Setting Standards and Measuring Progress
In the provision of education, accountability hinges on the development of
adequate measures of results. In the long run, important measures of the
success of education are the well-being, self-sufficiency, and productivity in
adult life of today’s schoolchildren. As a practical matter, however, it is
difficult to evaluate schools based on their pupils’ accomplishments 10 or 20 years
later. For this reason, tests are a fundamental building block for school
accountability. This Administration believes that well-designed tests are
Chapter 5

| 193

among the most valuable tools for evaluating school performance, giving
early feedback about the success or failure of programs, educational reforms,
teachers, and students alike. They augment the other information parents
need to evaluate their children’s schools. The No Child Left Behind Act
makes available school-by-school report cards, which include data on test
results, to help parents make the best decisions for their children.
Although the Federal Government provides substantial funding to States
for education, State and local governments themselves contribute the lion’s
share—over 90 percent—of the funds for public elementary and secondary
schools. Consistent with its focus on results, this Administration believes
that States should have the freedom to design tests that provide parents with
the tools they need to evaluate local school systems, and the No Child Left
Behind Act specifies that each State be evaluated based on the test of its
choice. At the same time, however, a key aspect of good testing is comparability: the ability to compare schools within districts, and districts within a
State. The tests that States choose must be consistent enough so that parents
can use them to evaluate their children’s education and make well-informed
choices. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a nationally representative test designed to evaluate America’s students and schools, is
also a useful tool for evaluating student progress at the national and the State
level. The Federal Government has provided funds through the No Child
Left Behind Act for some of every State’s fourth and eighth grade students to
participate in the NAEP.
Designing good tests is only the first step in strengthening school
accountability and enhancing competitive efficiencies in education. Tests
serve two goals: to create incentives for students, teachers, and schools to
excel, and to trigger appropriate consequences for failure. When schools fail,
parents should have the choice to move their children to better schools. To
this end, the No Child Left Behind Act makes Federal education funding
conditional upon local school districts and States taking defined steps to
improve schools that fail to make adequate yearly progress, as determined
by testing.

Expanding Options
Once clear, measurable results have been defined, competition can be a
strong motivating force for improving schools. This competition can come
from several sources, including other public schools, charter schools, and
private (including parochial) schools. School charters and the contracts of
educational management organizations (EMOs are private enterprises that
run charter schools and contract with school districts to operate individual
public schools) can be reviewed before renewal, and if measures of their
results are publicized, parents and school districts alike will be able to
194 | Economic Report of the President

evaluate their performance. The No Child Left Behind Act supports school
competition (through the creation of charter schools, for example), which
can improve school quality and increase the choices available to parents.
There are currently some 2,400 charter schools operating in 37 States
and the District of Columbia, and the number is growing rapidly. The
performance-based competition for students that charter schools exert puts
pressure on all schools to excel. Indeed, research shows that competition
from charter schools forces traditional public schools to respond and
improve. Many school districts are also experimenting with outsourcing
education to EMOs, which brings the benefits of market competition to
public education. Some studies of EMOs suggest that they perform well relative to their public school counterparts. Competition from private schools
can have a similar effect: one study found that such competition significantly
increased the performance of public schools in the same area. Another study
found that competition among public schools seems to both increase
achievement and lower costs.
The No Child Left Behind Act also ensures that parents in school districts
receiving funds under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act (ESEA) will have the option of moving their child to another public
school in their district if the child’s school has failed to make adequate yearly
progress (as defined by the State) for 2 or more consecutive years, except
where that option is prohibited by State law. Students in schools that fail for
3 straight years can receive funds to obtain supplemental educational
services, such as tutoring, after-school services, and summer school programs.
These options would benefit students in thousands of schools that have
already been identified as failing under current law. Finally, if a school fails to
make adequate yearly progress for 5 consecutive years, it will face restructuring as a condition for the State in which it is located to continue to receive
Title I funds. Such restructuring by the State or locality may take forms such
as conversion to a charter school, contracting with an EMO, or complete
reconstitution of the school. Furthermore, any school district receiving any
funds under ESEA must provide parents with the option of moving their
child to another public school if the child has been the victim of a violent
crime at school, or if the State determines that the school is unsafe. Giving
localities the ability to offer parents options other than relocation prompts
schools to perform well to keep their students, and it gives students in failing
schools additional options. At the same time, the financial consequences for
failure engender market-like discipline.
Vouchers could also increase the power of school competition. Vouchers
allow parents to use the money that would be spent in their public school
district to purchase education at another existing public or private school.
School vouchers of various forms are available to parents in 38 States and the
Chapter 5

| 195

District of Columbia. In some cases, however, these voucher programs are
thought to be too small to provide strong incentives for public schools to
improve, shifting too few educational dollars away from failing public
schools. Similarly, in some rural areas vouchers may be less effective if there
are not enough students to support multiple schools. Preliminary academic
evidence, however, suggests that vouchers can be effective. Evidence from
randomized field trials in Dayton, Ohio, New York City, and Washington,
D.C., found that African American students receiving vouchers achieved
moderately large gains in test scores after 2 years. Evidence from voucher
experiments in Milwaukee suggests that students realized gains in both
reading and math. Tax credits are an alternative vehicle that can deliver the
power of choice to families. What these initiatives have in common is that
they exploit the ability of markets to give parents the power to choose the
highest quality and most efficient education available for their children.
The ability to make those decisions depends crucially on the availability of
standardized and meaningful data, which testing can provide.

Providing for Vulnerable Populations:
Government Partnerships
There is a compelling public interest in ensuring adequate educational
opportunities for all children. Children who are well educated are likely to
become more productive members of the work force, are less likely to need
public assistance later in life, and tend to pass along their social and material
well-being to their own children. To the extent that local school districts do
not take these long-run effects into account, and given the difficulty of redistribution at the local level, subsidizing education for low-income children
and children with special needs is a valuable State and Federal function. This
Administration has made it a priority that no child be left behind.

Educational Resources for Low-Income Populations
The Federal and State governments have taken different approaches to
ensuring adequate educational resources for low-income school districts.
Most States have experimented with some form of school finance equalization (SFE) in the past 30 years to redistribute funds to low-income districts.
SFE programs mainly seek to redistribute funds from districts with high
property values per pupil to districts with lower property values per pupil. In
practice, however, many SFE programs actually redistribute funds based on
per-pupil education spending, not property values, and property values
themselves may be affected by tax rates.
State SFEs, if not carefully crafted, not only may fail to increase the
resources available to low-income students, but indeed may decrease the

196 | Economic Report of the President

resources available to all students. This can happen for any of several reasons.
When redistribution of funds to poorer districts is based on district spending
levels, it becomes, in effect, a tax on education spending by the high-spending
districts, which may respond by reducing spending. Thus equalizations that
rely on this approach may have the unintended consequence of “leveling
down,” achieving greater equality only by lowering average spending per
pupil; this could even result, perversely, in lower per-pupil spending in poor
districts. SFEs that subsidize local education spending through matching
may be able to “level up” through infusions of State funds.
The Federal Government, under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act, targets funds to low-income students through their school
districts. Providing grants to high-poverty districts out of general revenue has
the potential to be much more effective and less distortionary than State-level
SFEs. Federal Title I aid may be particularly valuable to high-poverty districts
in States with limited fiscal resources available to fund equalization programs.
In fiscal 2001 the Federal Government allocated almost $9 billion to Title I,
to reach approximately 12.5 million students in both public and private
schools. In fiscal 2002 the Federal Government will spend more than
$10 billion, and the President’s 2003 budget requests an increase of roughly
10 percent. Federal education funds are more narrowly targeted to highpoverty school districts than State and local funds. The poorest quartile of
school districts received 43 percent of Federal funds, but only 23 percent of
State and local funds, in 1994-95. Title I, Part A, funds are generally targeted
to students deemed most at risk of failure, but if half or more of a school’s
students are living in poverty, the funds may be used for school-wide
programs. To discourage States and localities from shifting their funding
responsibilities to the Federal Government, Title I conditions Federal
funding on local and State resources being comparably allocated to Title I
and non-Title I schools. Beyond these two conditions, schools have a great
deal of flexibility in the use of Title I funds, and this flexibility should allow
districts to use funds to meet their most pressing needs.
To promote quality in education, since 1994 the Federal Government has
been using access to Title I funds to encourage districts to establish resultsoriented infrastructures. States’ Title I funding was made dependent upon
their implementing final assessment systems and providing the Department
of Education with evidence that such systems met Title I requirements by the
2000-01 school year. In addition, through Title VI the Federal Government
provides grants to assist local education reform efforts that are in keeping
with statewide reforms, and to support other promising local reforms. These
programs are two examples of how the Federal Government can encourage
the creation of desired institutional infrastructures while maintaining
flexibility at the State level.
Chapter 5

| 197

Special Education Funding
Although education of children with special needs is primarily a local
responsibility, State and Federal resources also support this important work.
The courts have determined that States and localities are constitutionally
required to educate students with disabilities, and when Congress passed the
Education for all Handicapped Children Act (now the Individuals with
Disabilities Act, or IDEA) in 1975, States were given Federal dollars in
exchange for providing free, appropriate education to all such students. One
study estimates that Federal, State, and local governments bore, respectively,
8 percent, 47 percent, and 45 percent of the cost of public special education
provision in 1998-99. The President’s 2002 budget requests a 13 percent
increase in IDEA grants to States. This spending can have significant payoffs
for children with special needs: research shows that special education
programs improve the math and reading test scores of special education
students and do not undermine the achievement of other students.
The conflicting interests described in the earlier discussion of public-private
partnerships can also be seen in intergovernmental partnerships. Special
education is a prime example, demonstrating the issues that arise when those
who provide services do not fully bear either the cost of those services or
accountability for their results. In the past, the extra resources that categorical
State and Federal funding made available for special education students may
have created incentives for school systems and parents to expand the population identified as having special needs. Indeed, there has been a steady rise
since the late 1970s in the percentage of students so classified, with the
greatest increase in those categories, such as learning disabilities (as opposed
to physical disabilities), where the identification of need is most subjective
(Chart 5-1). African American and Native American students make up a
disproportionate share of those referred into special education. Furthermore,
school districts are often able to exclude special education students’ test scores
from State assessments; this may give them an incentive to refer students to
special education inappropriately.
To address these undesirable incentives, the 1997 IDEA reauthorization
changed the way in which Federal special education funds are allocated to
States, but these funds account for less than 10 percent of all special education funds, and many undesirable incentives persist at the local and the
individual levels. The subjectivity of such hard-to-observe classifications
makes well-designed systems and incentives essential. On October 2, 2001,
the President signed Executive Order 13227 to establish the President’s
Commission on Excellence in Special Education. This commission will
examine these and other issues to prepare the Administration and Congress
for the upcoming IDEA reauthorization.

198 | Economic Report of the President

Summing Up: Getting Incentives Right
Education is one area of public spending that has traditionally been
subject to competition among localities, and between public and private
providers. Research suggests that this competition has led to measurable
gains in student achievement, but there is also an important role for the
Federal and State governments to play in redistribution and social insurance.
In designing systems that provide these valuable services while maximizing
local flexibility, it is imperative to account for the influence of incentives on
governments, schools, teachers, parents, and students alike. By rewarding
good performance at all levels, programs can align individual incentives with
public goals to promote efficiency and excellence. Indeed, these lessons
pertain beyond the realm of education.

Welfare
Safety net programs such as welfare and Medicaid pose some of the
greatest challenges—and the greatest opportunities—for more efficient
provision of services in a Federal system. The ability of taxpayers to vote with
their feet is more constrained in this setting than in education, because, as

Chapter 5

| 199

discussed below, social insurance is harder to achieve at a local level. This
does not mean that competitive forces cannot be harnessed to foster greater
efficiency in providing support for low-income families. Rather, it is in these
areas in particular that flexibility of method and careful accountability for
results are likely to achieve the greatest gains, and where it is most important
that the results to be evaluated be chosen and measured well.
The 1996 enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work
Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) replaced Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC), the primary Federal welfare program, with
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). PRWORA increased
State discretion over the use of welfare funds by converting federally matched
grants to block grants, thereby affording States greater flexibility. PRWORA
also set time limits on benefit eligibility for recipients and created a framework for innovation in welfare reform. PRWORA was introduced in the
wake of record highs in welfare participation and extensive program experimentation. Already before the passage of PRWORA, many States had been
granted waivers, and 27 States had obtained major waivers exempting them
from various aspects of AFDC’s eligibility and process requirements, allowing
them to experiment with alternative approaches. PRWORA widened this
flexibility to all States. Welfare caseloads declined dramatically following
PRWORA’s enactment. Between August 1996 and June 2001, the number
of TANF recipients was reduced by 56 percent nationwide. Although favorable economic conditions certainly played a role, research suggests that
roughly a third of the decline was due to welfare reform (Box 5-1); estimates
vary, however. PRWORA appropriated funds for TANF grants to States
through fiscal 2002. Hence this year Congress will determine appropriations
for fiscal 2003 and beyond. This provides an opportunity to review the
program, the principles on which reforms were undertaken, and those that
should guide the program in the future.

Focusing on Results
A prominent feature of PRWORA is its restrictions on benefits; these
include 5-year lifetime eligibility limits and the condition that beneficiaries
find work after receiving benefits for 2 years. Just as important, however,
PRWORA also mandated the devolution of program design to the States
(some States further devolved welfare provision to the counties) and
increased flexibility and opportunity for innovation in welfare provision.
When TANF replaced AFDC, the Nation moved from a welfare system in
which the Federal Government prescribed the process of service provision to
one in which it defines goals and creates incentives, leaving the process to be
determined largely by each State. Under the former centralized, processbased approach, the Federal Government determined how funds were
200 | Economic Report of the President

Box 5-1. Why Have Welfare Caseloads Declined?
There is no question that strong economic performance and the
resulting tight labor market of the late 1990s account for a portion of
the recent decreases in welfare caseloads. However, the decline would
not have been nearly as sharp were it not for the structural changes in
the safety net programs that support working families.
In 1999 the Council of Economic Advisers found that only 8 to 10 percent
of the decline in welfare caseloads between 1996 and 1998 could be
attributed to changes in the unemployment rate; research also
suggests that welfare reform was responsible for roughly one-third of
the reduction. The lifetime time limits imposed under PRWORA create
incentives for welfare recipients to find jobs (even before they reach
the limit), and researchers have found that the imposition of time limits
alone was responsible for over 10 percent of the decline in welfare
caseloads between 1993 and 1999. In addition to encouraging selfsufficiency through time limits, PRWORA explicitly conditions benefits
on welfare recipients engaging in work-related activities, and since its
passage there has been a dramatic increase in the work participation
rates of welfare recipients. This employment experience continues to
help former recipients over their lifetimes by building their human
capital and thus improving their future employment prospects.
Increases in other forms of support for working families also made
work more appealing, by making it more lucrative relative to welfare
receipt. After the passage of PRWORA, people could leave welfare
without fear of losing valuable Medicaid coverage (as long as their
income remained below eligibility limits, or for up to a year after it rose
above those limits). They could also continue to receive child care
subsidies, and many were eligible for an expanded Earned Income Tax
Credit. These expansions were also likely responsible for part of the
decline in caseloads. For example, one study found that in 1986 a
single mother with two children, who left welfare to work full time at
the minimum wage, would have increased her family income by only
$2,000 (and would still have been living on income of only 80 percent
of the poverty line); she also would have lost her eligibility for
Medicaid. The same woman in 1997 would have increased her family
income, upon leaving welfare, by $7,000 in constant dollars (almost
doubling her income and raising her above the poverty line) and would
have likely retained her family’s Medicaid coverage for up to a year.

Chapter 5

| 201

allocated as well as many other details of the program. Under PRWORA’s
outcomes-based approach, in contrast, funds are appropriated to decentralized providers for the pursuit of defined objectives, and these providers are
then given discretion over how the funds are used. Although process and
design are important features of any program, emphasizing ends rather than
means can be a more effective way to reach goals.
Participation in some other assistance programs, for example, is conditioned
on participation in job training. Although the goal of such requirements is
noble—to enable recipients to become self-sufficient members of the work
force—uniform training requirements may not be the answer for all workers.
Some might benefit more from relocation assistance, or from income support
to allow a longer job search. For some workers a greater obstacle to employment may be lack of child care or transportation. Thus, although training is
one route to productive employment, it is neither the only route nor the best
route for all. Assuming that the objective of these programs is to foster selfsufficiency, it is reasonable to judge the success of a program by the number
of people it moves into lasting employment, rather than by the number of
hours of training it provides.

The Importance of Measurement
When public policy objectives are broken down into measurable
outcomes, providers can be paid and contracts awarded according to how
well they achieve those outcomes. This encourages agencies and organizations to excel. By rewarding those programs that are succeeding, government
can foster innovation, efficiency, and personalized solutions to the problems
facing providers and their clients.
The first step toward reaching these goals is to turn public policy objectives
into quantifiable measures and to set targets for those measures. When
possible, such measures should accurately reflect broad policy objectives, not
narrow intermediate steps. They should also strive to distinguish subpar
performance due to labor market fluctuations and other anomalies from
genuine program shortcomings. Providers can then have maximum flexibility and a minimum of restrictions, and be free from adverse incentives
(such as the incentive to maximize training, when training is neither right for
everyone nor the ultimate goal of the program).
Creating such measures is not always easy. Indeed, it is especially difficult
when people and localities differ in their needs; such differences can affect
both the appropriate goal of programs and the feasible outcomes. For
example, getting welfare recipients into the work force is one measure of the
success of welfare reform. Under PRWORA, Federal funding is conditioned
on States meeting targets for the fraction of welfare recipients who are
employed. Among the conditions are that 50 percent of recipient families
202 | Economic Report of the President

(and 90 percent of two-parent recipient families) be employed by fiscal
2002. States may reduce the target employment rate on which their funding
is conditioned by 1 percentage point for each percentage point that welfare
rolls are reduced from their fiscal 1995 levels. The dramatic decline in welfare
caseloads actually observed since 1995 has meant that the overall participation requirement has been binding on very few States. Focusing solely on the
size of welfare caseloads, however, could have created incentives to make
recipients ineligible for welfare rather than make them self-sufficient.
A broader goal of PRWORA is ending needy parents’ dependence on government benefits, by promoting job preparation and work, while providing
temporary income support for those who fall on hard times.
When measuring success by results, basing measures on the right
outcomes is essential. These measures should ascertain the extent to which
State programs are meeting the ultimate goals of PRWORA while still
affording flexibility in program design. The Federal Government can help
ensure that Federal, State, and local agencies have the tools they need to evaluate service providers. Although not all data may be collected currently,
basing payments on progress toward those outcomes would encourage the
collection of such data in the future.

The Value of Incentives
The second step in achieving the goal of innovative and effective provision
is to create incentives for public and private service providers to succeed.
Rewards for excellence can be paired with consequences for failure to meet
minimum standards; this is especially useful when dealing with government
agencies that cannot be replaced by more efficient entrants from the private
sector if they fail. If a State fails to meet the work participation rate targets
established in the TANF program, its block grant is reduced by an amount
determined by the Department of Health and Human Services’ evaluation
of the duration and degree of its noncompliance. States can avoid these
consequences if their performance improves in the following year under a
corrective action plan. The Federal Government also has discretion in penalizing States and may choose to waive or substantially lower penalties in
extenuating circumstances, such as regional recession, natural disaster, or a
substantial increase in caseloads.
Flexibility is crucial to encouraging experimentation, because all
experimentation entails risk. Despite a State’s best intentions and efforts,
reforms that appeared promising may not succeed. By giving the Federal
Government discretion in penalizing failing States and using corrective
action plans, TANF seeks to prevent such penalties from discouraging the
very innovation it intends to foster. This furthers the ultimate goal of creating
a system that encourages the development of effective and efficient programs.
Chapter 5

The Benefits of Flexible Approaches
This Administration believes that welfare goals and targets should be
flexible enough to accommodate local differences, encourage innovation, and
foster excellence, and that such flexibility must be accompanied by accountability, careful monitoring, and rewards for progress toward meeting goals.
Providing these rewards based on comprehensive outcome measures allows
States, localities, and organizations facing different economic and demographic circumstances to design programs that work best for them. People on
welfare face different obstacles to self-sufficiency and will therefore benefit
from different services. Similarly, regional demographic and geographic
differences shape the types of assistance that are appropriate, and State
programs, capacities, and opportunities differ as well. The idiosyncrasies of
local labor markets mean that the types of education and job training
programs that are beneficial may vary widely across communities and over
time. States have been using the flexibility granted under TANF to tailor
programs to the needs of the populations they serve. As a consequence,
between 1996 and 2000 the composition of welfare spending by type of
assistance changed dramatically (Chart 5-2).
One example is subsidies for transportation. Lack of transportation can
impede welfare recipients from getting training and holding a job. In an
urban area with a well-developed transportation system, providing transportation subsidies to welfare recipients may make sense. Rural areas,
however, may lack public transportation, and even some urban areas may
have inadequate public transportation between the neighborhoods where
many welfare recipients live and those where employment is available. States
are using TANF funds to address these difficulties in a variety of ways.
Governments in some States, such as Michigan and New York, are working
with the providers of public transportation systems to expand access and
service provision. Others are establishing programs to assist welfare recipients
in purchasing or leasing their own automobiles, and some State agencies are
providing transportation themselves.
Child care assistance is another area in which States are using their greater
flexibility to increase funding, despite the disappearance of a mandate to
provide this service. TANF released States from AFDC’s conditions that they
guarantee child care to all recipients who need it to work or go to school. Yet
more stringent work participation requirements have likely increased recipients’ need for child care services. In response, States have used the flexibility
in TANF to increase child care funding: in fiscal 1999, Child Care
Development Fund transfers and TANF funds directly spent on child care
totaled $4.4 billion, more than double the amount spent in fiscal 1998.
Many States have experimented with child care vouchers, which have

204 | Economic Report of the President

reduced the paperwork required of them and made it easier for parents to
take advantage of child care subsidies. States have clearly tapped into an
important need among their populations and generated innovations in
service provision.
These examples reflect broad shifts taking place in State welfare programs
in the wake of PRWORA. Overall, between 1996 and 2000 State welfare
spending shifted away from cash assistance toward providing social services.
Beyond targeting services to communities, many States are using their
newfound freedom to experiment with the structure of their welfare
programs, recognizing that incentives matter for individuals, organizations,
and governments alike. In 2000, 34 States offered “diversion payments” or
services to families applying for TANF benefits. Most of these States
provided lump-sum payments in lieu of monthly benefits. It is hoped that
these payments, sometimes termed welfare avoidance grants, will enable
families to weather a temporary emergency while avoiding attachment to the
welfare system. Another structural innovation aimed at preventing welfare
dependence is an intermittent time limit. Thirteen States are currently experimenting with such limits, which deny or reduce benefits for a period of time
after a family has received assistance for a given number of months.

Chapter 5

| 205

Some States are further devolving welfare to counties and local
governments. California, Colorado, New York, North Carolina, and Ohio
give counties block grants with which to provide welfare services. Like the
Federal Government, these State governments are seeking to balance the desire
to give local governments freedom to innovate, and to tailor programs to
local needs, with the need to maintain standards. Most States that have ceded
partial control of programs to localities, however, maintain some control over
the criteria for eligibility, benefit levels, work requirements, and time limits.
One of the great advantages of flexibility in the laboratories of State
programs is that each can learn from the experience of others. Even States
that are succeeding in meeting specified outcome targets can benefit from
information regarding other States’ experiences. The Department of Health
and Human Services, the National Governors Association, and other groups
are already facilitating such information sharing. Because the Federal
Government gathers and analyzes a great deal of State welfare program data
in its monitoring of TANF compliance, it can play a vital role in helping
States target their efforts, by disseminating information on the programs that
have proved most successful.

Encouraging Broad Participation
In addition to affording States greater flexibility, PRWORA enlarged the
pool of providers with whom States may contract. Under the Charitable
Choice provision of PRWORA, States may administer and provide TANF
services through contracts with charitable, religious, or other private organizations. Any State that chooses to involve nongovernment entities in social
service delivery may not exclude providers because of their religious nature.
This provision does not, however, amount to giving preference to religiously
affiliated organizations. As the President stated in his executive order
establishing the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community
Initiatives, “This delivery of services must be results oriented and should
value the bedrock principles of pluralism, nondiscrimination, evenhandedness,
and neutrality.”
Religious organizations have long been involved in poverty relief in the
United States, and government partnerships with such groups have a long
history. In 1999 Catholic Charities and Lutheran Social Services both
received over half of their funding from the government. The Charitable
Choice legislation prohibits agencies receiving government funds from
discriminating against clients of different faiths, but it does not require religious organizations’ beliefs to be strictly segregated from the services being
provided. Federal funding is also conditioned on the government making
an alternate service provider available if a client is uncomfortable receiving
assistance from a religious provider.
206 | Economic Report of the President

The inclusion of nonsecular service providers in welfare programs is very
much a work in progress. Changing agency policies and State laws that had
made religiously oriented service providers ineligible for government funds is
a time-consuming process. As of 2000, fewer than half the States had
removed legal and policy barriers to religious organizations’ participation in
government-funded welfare provision, but at least 23 States had new cooperative relationships with newly eligible faith-based providers. The language
of Charitable Choice extends beyond TANF to food stamps and Medicaid as
well, but it has not been implemented in these programs because current law
requires that a public official, not a private citizen, evaluate recipients’ eligibility. Even in States and programs where legal barriers have been removed,
small organizations often struggle to compete with agencies that have
received government grants and contracts in the past and already have the
necessary infrastructure to comply with government regulations. Federal
grants and contracts typically require formal recordkeeping, monitoring,
and substantial infrastructure, yet many religious congregations have
outreach budgets of less than $5,000, and few have more than one staff
member assigned to such activities. Although smaller contracts might
promote the incorporation of such agencies into the welfare provision
network, they are not always cost-effective. Any gains from including small
providers must be weighed against the costs of coordination and other
increased costs associated with working with a greater number of providers.
Thus, in addition to affording States greater flexibility in the types of
services they offer, PRWORA allows them to choose from a larger pool
of service providers. Local organizations have a great deal to offer and can be
a source of valuable innovation. They often have an established presence in
the communities they serve, greater credibility than a government agency
with local populations, and access to valuable volunteer labor.
Unfortunately, in the past, Charitable Choice language has not ensured
that Federal administrators will require State and local governments to comply
with new rules for involving faith-based providers. Faith- and communitybased groups remain an underutilized resource, and this Administration will
continue to work to eliminate barriers to their participation.

Medicaid and SCHIP
Maintaining a healthy citizenry is a compelling public interest, arising
from the risk of the spread of disease, the loss of productivity from illness,
and the altruistic motivation to provide for those who are ill but cannot
afford health care. This can lead to inefficiencies in the health care system if
only emergency room care is provided. For example, people without health
Chapter 5

| 207

insurance are more likely to forgo cost-effective early or preventive care, to
wait until very ill to seek health care, and when they do, to use the expensive
option of emergency room care. The cost of this uncompensated emergency
room care may then be passed on to the public in the form of higher medical
fees or higher taxes. This compromises both the health of individuals and the
public finances and suggests a role for government in subsidizing more
efficient health care for low-income populations.
At present, the primary mechanism for such assistance is Medicaid, a
Federal- and State-financed public health insurance program for low-income
individuals who are aged, blind, disabled, or members of families with
dependent children. In certain circumstances, Medicaid also provides
medical care to those with high medical expenses but incomes modestly over
the Medicaid threshold and to pregnant women. (States have discretion over the
eligibility of both groups, and they are covered in 35 States and the District
of Columbia.) The Federal Government matches each State’s Medicaid
spending at a rate inversely related to the State’s income per capita; rates
range from 50 to 76 percent in 2002. As discussed below, however, States are
beginning to use their new flexibility to explore alternative ways to provide
high-quality and high-value health care to their low-income populations.
States may seek waivers to use Medicaid funds to provide otherwise
uncovered services and to experiment with Medicaid program design, and
almost all States are now experimenting with different approaches, especially
for populations whose Medicaid eligibility is not mandated. The State
Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP; Box 5-2) provides health
insurance for low-income children who do not qualify for Medicaid, under
rules that provide more flexibility, and with a higher Federal match rate.
These systems provide access to valuable health care for many low-income
Americans and have improved the well-being of many.
Medicaid and SCHIP resources, however, could be allocated more
efficiently than they are now, to provide greater benefits at lower cost, by
using market mechanisms to promote access to private health insurance
rather than relying on public production. Along with States’ flexibility to
experiment must come more consistent accountability for results. As in the
education and welfare programs discussed above, this Administration
believes that a Federal focus on ultimate goals and outcomes, rather than
micromanagement of processes, is needed to promote innovation and efficiency.

Limitations and Shortcomings of the Current System
Medicaid enrollment grew by almost 60 percent between 1980 and 1993,
from 19.6 million person-years to 31.2 million. Much of the enrollment
growth since 1987 was driven by federally mandated eligibility expansions,
which increased the pool of eligible individuals well beyond those eligible for
208 | Economic Report of the President

Box 5-2.The State Children’s Health Insurance Program
The State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) is a joint
Federal-State program, driven by Federal incentives to improve the
health care of low-income children while still affording States a great
degree of flexibility in reaching this goal. SCHIP was established in the
1997 Balanced Budget Act, under Title XXI of the Social Security Act,
and provides health insurance coverage to Medicaid-ineligible lowincome children. Every State currently has a federally approved SCHIP
program, but the design and scope of programs vary widely. Fifteen
States and the District of Columbia provide SCHIP insurance through
existing Medicaid programs, 16 States have separate programs, and 19
States use a combined approach. States are experimenting with
providing health insurance to entire families and with using sliding
copayment scales.
Like Medicaid, SCHIP is funded through Federal matching of State
expenditure, with poorer States eligible for higher match rates. In fiscal
2002 the Federal Government reimbursed individual States for
between 65 and 84 percent of the cost of providing health insurance
under the program. In addition to providing a substantial portion of the
funding, in fiscal 2002 the Federal Government will use awards, based
on the participation of former TANF recipients in Medicaid and SCHIP
,
as incentives for States to insure low-income children.

AFDC by raising income limits. Although those receiving TANF continue to
be eligible for Medicaid, PRWORA severed the link between cash assistance
and Medicaid enrollment. Since 1993, Medicaid enrollment has grown at a
much slower rate, reaching 36.9 million in fiscal 2001, and is projected to
grow by an average of only 1.9 percent a year over the next 5 years. Federal
Medicaid expenditure, on the other hand, is projected to grow at an annual
average rate of almost 9 percent, from $159 billion in fiscal 2003 to $206
billion in fiscal 2007.
These expansions to families with higher and higher incomes appear to
have had diminishing effectiveness, both in improving health and in
reducing the number of uninsured. One unfortunate side effect of the
current system of publicly provided and publicly produced health insurance
is the crowding out of private insurance: the existence of public insurance
provides a disincentive for private employers to offer insurance to those
eligible for the public program. Research shows that many of those to whom
Medicaid eligibility was extended during the broad expansions of the late
1980s and early 1990s already had access to private insurance. Researchers
Chapter 5

| 209

estimate that only 27 percent of the children made newly eligible for
Medicaid between 1987 and 1992 were uninsured in 1987, and that almost
half of those newly eligible may have lost private coverage. In fact, as the fraction of children eligible for the program rose from 15.2 percent in 1987 to
21.8 percent in 1996, the fraction of children who were uninsured not only
failed to decline but rather increased, from 12.9 percent to 14.8 percent. This
experience illustrates the potential pitfalls of expanding public programs
without considering potentially offsetting responses in private markets.
There is other evidence that mandated expansions of this form are not the
most efficient way to improve the health of low-income families. A more
diverse population of patients is likely to have differing needs, making it
more difficult for a one-size public insurance package to fit all. One
symptom of the inefficiency of the current system is the failure to enroll all
eligible children: nearly a quarter of uninsured children are eligible for
Medicaid, and many more are eligible through SCHIP. Although Federal
laws explicitly guarantee continued Medicaid coverage for many of those
leaving welfare, researchers found that 49 percent of women and 29 percent
of children lack health insurance 1 year or more after leaving welfare.
Confusion about eligibility, the effort required to reapply for Medicaid after
leaving welfare, and stigma may contribute to this lack of health insurance
among former welfare recipients.

Fostering Market-Based Health Insurance
Greater flexibility is allowing States to address these shortcomings in varied
and innovative, market-based ways. By increasing the access of low-income
families to private insurance markets rather than trying to provide the same
public health insurance to all, the Federal Government can promote the
health of all citizens without a monolithic, slow-acting, and inefficient
bureaucracy. States have requested waivers and demonstration projects to
experiment with other means of provision and have highlighted the potential
gains to such approaches, empowering patients and providers to choose the
best health insurance options at the best price through unfettered markets.
The process of applying for waivers used to be quite cumbersome for State
agencies, as was the oversight of waiver programs for their Federal counterparts. The goal of the 2001 Health Insurance Flexibility and Accountability
(HIFA) Demonstration Initiative is to increase State access to Section 1115
Medicaid and SCHIP waivers, simplify the waiver process, and create
renewed interest in working with private insurance markets to provide health
insurance to low-income individuals. The HIFA initiative encourages States
to use available Medicaid and SCHIP funding to develop comprehensive
health insurance coverage approaches. This offers States greater flexibility in
designing benefit packages and cost sharing in exchange for increasing
210 | Economic Report of the President

coverage, particularly in support of private health insurance. Even without
HIFA, the Administration has already approved over 1,400 waivers and
State plan amendments through other programs. These waivers and amendments have already made an additional 1.4 million Americans eligible for
health insurance and expanded coverage for over 4 million more, and the
Department of Health and Human Services has cleared application backlogs
for State plan amendments dating to the mid-1980s.
This use of Medicaid waivers parallels that of AFDC waivers before TANF.
Since 1981 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS, the
agency formerly known as the Health Care Financing Administration) has
granted over 250 home and community-based services waivers, which cover
budget-neutral but previously uncovered services for Medicaid-eligible
individuals who would otherwise be institutionalized. In 2001, 15 States
were running statewide health care reform demonstrations under Section
1115 waivers. These waivers allow States to change provisions of their
Medicaid and SCHIP programs in order to experiment with program
improvements, provide coverage to groups not eligible under current law, or
investigate an issue of interest to the CMS.
States are using these waivers to experiment with different methods of
health care delivery. The waivers offer the most flexibility when used to
extend coverage to “optional populations.” These are groups that States may
use Federal Medicaid funds to insure, but whose coverage is not a condition
of Federal funding. Because they often have higher incomes than other
Medicaid recipients, these recipients are more likely to be employed and
therefore to have access to employer-sponsored health insurance. Enabling
them to purchase coverage through their employers is less likely to crowd out
private provision than is public Medicaid insurance. States may choose to
offer this insurance under their existing Medicaid plans, under group plans,
or through other sources of the States’ choosing, as long as the coverage
meets Federal cost and quality guidelines.
States have long had the option of using Medicaid and SCHIP funds to
help eligible individuals purchase private health insurance through their
employers. However, in part because of administrative and operational
complexities, very few States were able to take advantage of this option.
Massachusetts helps employees pay private insurance premiums through its
own premium assistance program. Kansas provides small businesses with a
$35 health insurance tax credit for every employee to whom they provide
coverage. The Administration’s HIFA model waiver initiative is designed to
give States program flexibility to support approaches that increase private
health insurance coverage options. HIFA quickly generated State interest in
exploring other ways to use employer-sponsored insurance to provide
coverage to Medicaid-eligible populations. The Department of Health and
Human Services has already approved one such waiver for Arizona.
Chapter 5

| 211

States are also using market mechanisms to expand access to health
insurance through other Federal laws, such as the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and through high-risk health
insurance pools. Both are discussed in Chapter 4. Each uses market
mechanisms to set prices and expand access, while empowering individuals
to choose the plans that suit them best.
State flexibility can also promote cost containment without sacrificing
quality. Medicaid expenditure grew dramatically between 1988 and 1994,
primarily because of cost increases and issues of program integrity, but partly
from the eligibility expansions and enrollment increases discussed above. In
an effort to control costs, States have enrolled an increasing fraction of
Medicaid recipients in private health insurance programs. Fifty-four percent
of Medicaid recipients were enrolled in some form of managed care in 1998.
Other States are experimenting with directly providing care through public
clinics and community health centers (Box 5-3). Although these measures
have helped States (and the Federal Government) contain costs, continued
innovation in cost containment is still greatly needed, as is flexibility
to experiment.
Federal officials have expressed concerns about State financing practices
that increase Federal Medicaid spending without increasing health insurance
coverage. Recent studies by the Inspector General of the Department of
Health and Human Services and by the Congressional Budget Office have
identified provider payment policies that have allowed billions of dollars in
Federal Medicaid funds to be used for purposes other than those intended,
including nonhealth expenditure. The Administration has taken steps to
increase State accountability while also increasing State flexibility.
Although the provision of health care poses challenges not seen in other
safety net programs, the lessons drawn can inform a wide range of policies.
By setting goals based on outcomes, promoting innovation, and rewarding
achievement, the Federal Government can create a lasting institutional structure that adapts to the rapidly changing health care environment without
saddling States and providers with cumbersome and quickly outdated
conditions and regulations.

212 | Economic Report of the President

Box 5-3. Community Health Centers
The Community Health Center (CHC) program is a Federal grant
program that offers funding to local communities for the provision of
family-oriented primary and preventive health care services. In fiscal
2001 the program funded services to 10.5 million people living in
medically underserved rural and urban areas throughout the country.
In the last decade there has been a significant increase in the number
of access points, primary care providers, and people served, as well as
in appropriations; more than 3,300 CHC sites are now in operation,
providing essential services that improve the health status of these
underserved populations. To ensure that more communities benefit
from the care provided by these centers, the Federal Government will
expand the program to 1,200 more sites over the next 5 years, serving
millions of additional patients. CHCs are discussed in more detail in
Chapter 4.

Conclusion
Creating efficient, high-quality public programs requires balancing
freedom against responsibility, and local needs against national interests. By
tying Federal funds to meeting program goals, but not tying the hands of
willing and able providers, Federal dollars can be stretched further and the
quality of services provided can be higher. Rewarding innovation and
requiring success can bring out the best in public and private providers alike.
The United States’ federal system provides unique advantages for getting
the most out of public spending. Competition among States and localities
and public and private providers encourages the efficient use of public funds.
Accountability for results can be achieved without rigid and burdensome
Federal dictates. This Administration believes that it is the role of the Federal
Government to create the infrastructure—including high-quality data, a
level playing field, and incentives that promote the efficient use of taxpayers’
money—that makes such competition and accountability possible.

Building Institutions
for a Better Environment

T

he United States has achieved dramatic improvements in environmental
quality over the past 30 years. Toxic releases have been reduced since
they were first widely reported in 1987, waters safe for fishing and swimming
have doubled, and air quality has improved markedly. This trend toward a
cleaner, healthier environment, repeated in many of the world’s other developed countries, is reflected in various indicators of environmental quality,
including measures of sulfur dioxide, lead, and carbon monoxide emissions.
Box 6-1 shows how emissions of these and other air pollutants have fallen
significantly in the United States, with similar gains in a host of other countries.
These improvements are the result of policies that sought to address some
of the most obvious risks to human health posed by air and water pollution,
leakage from hazardous waste sites, and unnecessarily damaging mining and
other extractive practices. In these early initiatives, the benefits often far
outweighed the costs. Now that most of the largest and most glaring environmental problems have been tackled, however, the gains to be expected
from further measures have become less obvious and more contentious.
Meanwhile competition for resources and for the attention of policymakers
and concerned citizens is as keen as ever. Medical research, national security,
education, capital investment, and consumption all make valid claims on
both government and private resources. As the environmental issues we
address become ever more complex, research and careful analysis of both
benefits and costs are required to formulate responsible policies that will
improve Americans’ well-being and are cost-effective.
Put another way, the task now before us is to build the right institutions to
address these increasingly thorny environmental issues. For example, there is
evidence that further improvements in air quality would improve health and
reduce mortality, but these improvements might be extremely expensive.
Similar tradeoffs are associated with reductions in certain toxic substances,
such as arsenic in drinking water and mercury from the burning of coal.
Although the health benefits from further reductions in these pollutants are
surely desirable, the associated expense might be better directed toward alleviating other problems with the potential for even larger reductions in health
risks. Ongoing efforts to protect endangered species, maintain biodiversity,
and preserve ecosystems—all of which can influence long-term land use decisions and short-term economic activity—could pose tradeoffs between the
welfare interests of current and future generations. Finally, concern over
215

Box 6-1.Trends in National and International
Environmental Quality
Some of the most dramatic improvements in environmental quality
have occurred in the air we breathe (Chart 6-1). The 1970 Clean Air Act
Amendments identified six common, nationwide air pollutants for
which emission limits were needed in order to achieve certain ambient
concentration levels based on health criteria. Since the law was
passed, emissions of most of these “criteria air pollutants” have
declined significantly. Perhaps the most impressive achievement is the
near elimination of lead emissions, which by 1998 were only 2 percent
of their 1970 level.
One criteria air pollutant whose emissions have not fallen is nitrogen
oxides, and one might be tempted to conclude that environmental
quality with respect to this pollutant has gotten worse. But in fact the
story of nitrogen oxides regulation highlights the importance of using
the appropriate metrics in judging environmental quality: although
emissions of a pollutant are often reported, it is ambient concentrations
in the air we breathe that affect us directly and are the target of most
environmental regulation. In the case of nitrogen oxides, and indeed
for all criteria air pollutants, average national concentrations have
fallen in the past 20 years (Chart 6-2).
In addition to these reductions in criteria air pollutants, regulations
and voluntary actions on the part of companies have resulted in
substantial reductions in 188 toxic air pollutants that are either known
or suspected to cause cancer or have other serious health effects.
Nationwide emissions of these pollutants in 1996 were 23 percent
below levels measured earlier in the decade. Concentrations of some
of these toxic air pollutants have been reduced even more dramatically.
For many pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, trends in the United
States mirror those in other industrialized countries (Chart 6-3). The
downward trend in such emissions is particularly impressive given the
substantial growth in national income over the same period. Although
it is sometimes assumed that economic growth leads to environmental
degradation, studies show that environmental improvements usually
accompany national income growth at higher levels of income, an
observation that the chart supports.

potential climate change poses perhaps the greatest challenge. Sound climate
change policy requires striking a balance not only between the well-being of
current and future generations, but across countries as well. Choices must be
made in the face of considerable scientific uncertainty and alongside
competing concerns about energy security and diversity of fuels.
In many of these issues, the debate is frequently cast in terms of a tradeoff
between environmental protection and economic growth. Yet the two are not
necessarily mutually exclusive. As a society becomes more affluent, it is likely
to demand a cleaner and safer environment. Prosperity also allows us to
commit ever-increasing resources to environmental protection and to the
development of science and technology that will lead to both future growth
and a better environment. Indeed, empirical evidence suggests that growth
eventually goes hand in hand with environmental improvements.
The design of appropriate institutions plays an important role in
improving environmental quality; in particular, flexible approaches to environmental regulation can increase the benefits and lower the costs relative to
alternative schemes. Such approaches often allow businesses to pursue established environmental performance goals or emission limits in the ways that

218 | Economic Report of the President

they find most effective, rather than following specific, detailed government
mandates. This flexibility encourages innovation and the development of
cleaner technologies. Over time, flexible approaches and other programs that
promote technological innovation offer the promise of less pollution at even
lower costs. The President’s National Energy Plan, for example, builds on
these ideas by encouraging both increased flexibility in regulation and the
development of clean technologies.
Flexible programs also often involve a smaller, less costly regulatory and
compliance apparatus. In place of lengthy wrangling and resorting to legal
action between business and government over the interpretation and applicability of particular rules, requirements, and regulations, flexible approaches
allow markets, financial incentives, and business-to-business transactions to
efficiently allocate resources with minimal government supervision.
By institutions we mean not only the formal rules, regulations, markets,
monitoring, and administrative features developed for environmental protection, but also the informal knowledge, experience, and norms that are
essential for effective outcomes. Institutions of this kind that embody the
flexible approaches described above do not appear overnight. Part of the challenge for environmental protection is designing and building the best
institutions for the various problems we confront today, but another part is
carefully constructing those institutions so that they can evolve to deal with
emerging problems tomorrow. In exploring ways we can build institutions
for a better environment, this chapter considers the pros and cons of alternative flexible mechanisms such as tradable permits, tradable performance
standards, and emission charges. Several case studies of alternative schemes
then illustrate these mechanisms in practice. Finally, we consider how this
experience can be applied to the pressing environmental concern over
the potential threat of climate change. We begin by briefly examining
the motivation behind government involvement in environmental protection.

The Government’s Role
in Environmental Protection
At a basic level, environmental amenities have characteristics that
frequently make them more of a public than a private responsibility. First,
many environmental resources—notably the atmosphere, the oceans, and
underground aquifers—are shared without becoming the exclusive property
of anyone. Second, how one individual or business chooses to use air, water,
and land resources influences the value of those common resources for
many others. For example, marine fisheries are an important food source, but

Chapter 6

| 219

excessive commercial fishing reduces the ability of a fish population to
reproduce and provide more fish next season. Coal combustion provides an
inexpensive and reliable source of energy, but the resulting emissions of sulfur
dioxide (SO2) increase the acid content of lakes and forest soils. Lead in gasoline is a convenient catalyst for boosting automobile performance, but it has
adverse effects on children exposed to the consequent emissions from vehicles.
Economists refer to these environmental resources—healthy fisheries,
healthy lakes and forests, and clean air—as public goods, and to the unintended, adverse effects resulting from the use of those resources as
externalities. More broadly, externalities are the uncompensated effects of the
activities of one individual or group on another: because these effects have no
financial consequences for the individual or group undertaking the activity,
they are external to the market. For example, until the government intervened, those who overfished a fishery did not bear the cost of that depletion
to other fishermen and consumers; the power plants that emitted SO2 had
no financial incentive to reduce those emissions; and the refiners and users of
gasoline faced no constraints on their use of lead as a catalyst. All these consequences were external to the market transactions that caused them and in
some cases were not even appreciated at first. Even when they are identified
and understood, however, such externalities by themselves are not necessarily
a cause for government intervention. So long as the externality is identified,
the individuals affected can, in theory, negotiate a solution. In our examples,
some fishermen could have paid others not to overfish, the users of acidifying
lakes and forests could have paid power plants to reduce SO2 emissions, and
communities could have negotiated with refineries to reduce the lead in gasoline.
The improbability of such solutions in the real world, however, highlights
the fact that the corresponding problems, and environmental issues more
generally, all involve public goods to some degree. This complicates arriving
at a privately negotiated solution, because it is difficult to exclude those
unwilling to pay to help solve these problems from enjoying the benefits of
the improved resource. The productiveness of the fish stock, the recreational
and commercial value of lakes and forests, and the health improvements
from reduced lead emissions are all benefits that many if not all people can
enjoy simultaneously and that are difficult to exclude people from enjoying.
Under these circumstances, no single individual has the private incentive to
negotiate a socially beneficial solution, because most of the benefits go to
others. Nor is it easy for groups of individuals to band together informally to
pursue a solution, because each has an incentive to “free ride,” allowing
others to take care of—and pay for—the problem. Here the government
can play an important role by representing the interests of a large group of
individuals and compelling all those interested to share in the cost.

220 | Economic Report of the President

Measuring the Benefits and
Costs of Environmental Protection
Rectifying an environmental problem—pollution in a river, for example,
or depletion of a fishery—requires choosing both the appropriate level of
control or use and the institution best suited to implement the controls. The
level of control for many pollution problems has traditionally been set with
an eye toward benefits. A prime example is air quality, where the Supreme
Court recently upheld a decision that national air standards must be set to
protect the public health without regard to costs, as set forth in the 1970
Clean Air Act Amendments. At the time this and other early statutes were
passed, it may have appeared that the benefits were desirable at any cost, or
that the costs were low, removing the need to consider them. However, as
production technologies have become increasingly clean, the further reduction of pollution has become more difficult, and costs have risen. As a result,
concern over costs has entered the regulatory process: levels of control on
hazardous air pollutants are based not only on health concerns, but also on
what control technologies are available. This means that consideration is
given to whether the level chosen is feasible and cost-effective enough that
someone has already developed technology for it. Costs also play a role in
some fishery management policies, where the permitted annual harvest is set
to maximize the sustainable catch.
Comparing the benefits and the costs of environmental policies is
important because of the many competing needs for public and private
expenditures. The optimal level of environmental protection is that where
the benefit associated with one more unit of the resource equals the cost of
providing it, with both benefits and costs appropriately added up across all
individuals and over time. What should we include in our cost and benefit
measures? On the cost side, most expenses associated with environmental
protection arise from the use of marketed goods and services, making calculations relatively straightforward. For example, it is estimated that the recent
decision by the Environmental Protection Agency to lower the acceptable
level of arsenic in drinking water from 50 to 10 parts per billion will impose
a total annual cost of more than $200 million. This $200 million will then
be unavailable for other private and public activities—including other health
and environmental programs. This therefore represents the cost of the
program, which can then be compared with the benefits. Note that in the
arsenic case—as well as in two of the case studies later in this chapter—
concern over the distribution of costs and benefits was a particularly thorny
issue, even though in theory it should be possible to make everyone better off
when the overall benefits outweigh the costs.

Chapter 6

| 221

The choice of policies and institutions to be used in achieving the
environmental objective also plays an important role in determining
costs. For example, cost estimates associated with implementing the
Kyoto Protocol vary by orders of magnitude, depending on assumptions
about the effectiveness of trading institutions. These trading institutions
allow countries with higher abatement costs to seek out reductions in
other countries with lower abatement costs. Because certain institutions—
specifically, those that provide flexibility—offer the opportunity to achieve
environmental goals at lower cost, it is important to understand the
differences among the major types of environmental regulation, to which
we return below.
On the benefits side, gains from environmental protection are often
divided into two categories: use value and nonuse value. Use value refers to
benefits that occur when individuals come into direct contact with the
protected environment. These benefits may be associated with marketed
goods and services, such as admission or transportation fees, or nonmarketed
activities such as hiking, swimming, camping, or just looking at a beautiful
natural landscape. They also include the health consequences of breathing
cleaner air and drinking cleaner water. Nonuse value, which often involves
nonmarketed goods and services, refers to the less tangible benefits that arise
from individual preferences with respect to environmental amenities, as
distinct from their direct use. This includes the value derived from knowing
that a resource has been maintained and will be available to future
generations, or to oneself if one should ever decide to use it.
Use values associated with marketed goods and services can often be
estimated from observed behavior. For example, the willingness of people to
pay to use a national park—as measured by the entrance fees they actually
pay, or their travel expenditure to get there—can be used to estimate the
value they associate with the park. Wage studies measuring the pay difference
between low-risk and high-risk jobs can be used to infer the value associated
with prolonged life, which can then be used to evaluate health-enhancing
environmental proposals. Expenditures on water filters or bottled water can
be used to value a reduction in water pollution. Nonuse values, as well as use
values that are not associated with market activities, are more difficult to estimate accurately. Typically, individuals are surveyed and asked to place a
dollar value on hypothetical levels of environmental quality, such as better
visibility in scenic areas or enhanced protection of wilderness, ecosystems,
and biodiversity. This approach is still a subject of scholarly research.

222 | Economic Report of the President

Types of Environmental Regulation
The policies and institutions used to achieve an environmental goal often
have significant consequences for the associated cost. As environmental regulation has evolved, businesspeople and policymakers have worked together to
find more flexible approaches that achieve the same goal at significant
savings. These approaches range from standard tradable permit and fee
programs, to more complex tradable performance standards and hybrid
permit/fee programs, to more informal, flexible regulatory arrangements.

Command-and-Control Approaches
Traditional regulations for environmental protection, such as those
legislated under the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments, focused on developing specific technology and performance standards for pollution sources to
meet. Technology standards mandate specific equipment that sources must
use to control emissions, whereas performance standards mandate a limit on
emissions allowed by each source. Because technology standards typically
require the same technologies for all sources, and performance requirements
require the same level of emission reductions or emission rates at all sources,
both these approaches fail to take advantage of differences in the circumstances of each source. In particular, they fail to encourage more reductions
where the cost of such reductions is low, and fewer reductions where the cost
is high. Over the years, numerous studies have documented the added
expense of limiting this kind of flexibility, with cost estimates of traditional
regulation ranging from as little as 7 percent to as much as 2,200 percent
(that is, 22 times) more expensive than an efficient, flexible program.

Standard Market-Based Approaches:
Permit Trading and Fees
In the cases of marine fisheries, SO2 emissions, and leaded gasoline noted
earlier, market-based policies have been used to provide greater flexibility in
meeting particular environmental goals. Fishermen, power plants, and
gasoline refiners were required to hold a volume of permits (also referred to
as allowances or quotas) equal, respectively, to the volume of fish caught,
emissions created, or lead blended into gasoline. These permits were distributed on the basis of either past or current production. Unlike the earlier,
command-and-control approaches, however, these permits could be freely
traded, creating highly efficient markets in which firms holding more
permits than needed could sell them to others or, in some cases, hold onto
them for future use.

Chapter 6

| 223

These permit markets have many advantages. They ensure that the most
valuable uses of the affected resources are encouraged, they maximize
economic activity and growth consistent with a given level of pollution
reduction, and they encourage innovation in solving the environmental
problem at hand. In addition, the market price of the permits provides a
clear signal about the economic value of the environmental resource, which
can then be used for both business planning and policy evaluation. Finally,
although the permits in these programs were predominantly distributed
freely to predetermined stakeholders, the government could choose in future
programs to sell the permits, generating revenue that could be used to reduce
taxes on capital and labor, thus improving the efficiency of the tax system.
Emission fees, where businesses pay a fee for each unit of emissions rather
than buy and sell permits, share many of the advantages of tradable permits.
They provide an incentive to engage in only the most valuable uses of the
environmental resource, send a clear signal about its economic value, and
generate revenue that can be used to reduce other taxes. Emission fees,
however, provide greater certainty to businesses because the price associated
with emissions (the charge rate) is fixed. In contrast, because tradable permits
are in fixed supply, their price can fluctuate to reflect changes in demand—
sometimes substantially. As an example, a market for nitrogen oxides (NOx)
emission permits was established in 1994 in the area around Los Angeles. At
the end of 1999, permits for use in 2000 traded for around $2 a pound, but
by August 2000, during California’s emerging electric power crisis, they sold
for as much as $50 a pound. Of course, the greater price certainty associated
with emission fees comes at a cost: under an emission fee the actual level of
emissions can fluctuate. Thus emission fees make it trickier for regulators to
achieve a targeted level of emissions. Tradable permits also allow an administratively easier redistribution of the value associated with emission rights.
Revenue from a permit fee can be rebated and redistributed, but this requires
the government to distribute money after collecting fees, thus involving the
government in myriad financial transactions. Under a tradable permit
system, permits can be distributed in advance of the actual program, and
financial transactions need occur only among private firms and individuals.
Perhaps because of this, emission fees have received little attention in the
United States, despite their considerable popularity in other countries
(Box 6-2).
An intriguing possibility is the coupling of a tradable permit system with a
fee-based “safety valve.” In this hybrid scheme, a regulatory agency operating
an ordinary tradable permit program would create and sell extra permits on
request at a fixed fee. If the fee were set above the typical trading price—for
example, above the $2 a pound price that prevailed before 2000 in the Los
Angeles NOx permit market—it would ordinarily not interfere with the
permit market. However, in the event of an unusual demand spike like that

Box 6-2. Environmental Fees in Other Countries
Whereas the United States has tended to use tradable permits to
encourage cost-effective reductions of pollutants, market-based environmental regulation in other developed countries has more
commonly relied on fees, with particular focus on the transportation
sector. For instance, in 1995 about 90 percent of the revenue from
pollution control-related fees in 20 industrial countries came from fees
on gasoline, diesel fuel, and motor vehicles. In the last decade,
however, some European countries have developed fees specifically
designed to reduce particular industrial pollutants.
In 1992 Sweden introduced a charge on NOx emissions from large
combustion power plants. This fee of 40 Swedish krona per kilogram of
NOx emissions, equivalent to about $4 at the current exchange rate,
was extended to smaller power plant boilers in 1996. Revenue from
this fee is returned to the group of power plants that pay them in
proportion to each plant’s share of total energy production. This refund
reduces the total financial burden on power plants from the fee. But the
fee still provides an incentive to reduce NOx emissions whenever the
cost for each unit reduced is less than the fee. The Swedish government estimated that in 1995, as a result of the fee, NOx emissions from
power plants declined by 20 percent.
A Danish experiment with fees highlights one problem common to
many existing environmental fees. In 1992 Denmark introduced a fee
on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by households, which was followed
in 1993 by a similar fee on CO2 emissions by industry. As a result of
concern about the effect of these fees on Danish industrial competitiveness, the fees were altered in 1995 so that certain energy-intensive
industries paid lower fees on CO2 emissions than did less energyintensive industries. Although this change had the desired effect of
reducing the burden on the more energy-intensive industries, it also
reduced the cost-effectiveness of the emission reduction scheme overall.
Firms facing CO2 fees will reduce emissions up to the point where
the cost of reducing another unit of emissions (that is, the marginal
cost) equals the fee. Beyond that level it is cheaper to simply pay
the fee than to further reduce emissions. Because different firms
face different fees in Denmark, they should end up with differing
marginal costs as well. This implies that the present arrangement is
inefficient, because the total cost of the prevailing level of emission
reduction could be reduced. Shifting some responsibility for emission
reduction from firms facing high marginal costs to those facing lower
marginal costs would lower the overall burden.

Box 6-2.—continued
The Danish experience is not unique, however: throughout the
industrialized world, environmental fees have frequently been accompanied by exemptions for particular products or industrial sectors. The
goal of some of these exemptions, to reduce the burden of these fees
on particular activities or sectors, can be achieved through other
means that do not reduce the overall cost-effectiveness of the fee
program: the revenue can be redistributed or rebated to program participants. The administrative and practical difficulties with such a
redistribution point to an advantage associated with tradable permits:
their initial allocations can be conducted in a way that alleviates
burdens where desired.

resulting from the California energy crisis, the fee would provide additional
flexibility and price stability, protecting both industry and the economy. In
point of fact, California enacted something like this—whereby a reserve of
NOx permits would be available at $7.50 a pound—after last year’s permit
shortage. Features like this have been used in the SO2 trading program and
in regulations for heavy-duty engines, both discussed below.

Other Flexible Approaches:
Informal Markets and Tradable Performance Standards
In some cases it may be impractical to implement either an emission fee or
a permit trading program. For example, monitoring actual emissions may be
too expensive to make either viable. Emission fees also face opposition
because they impose on regulated firms the burden of fee payments in addition to pollution control costs. At the same time, tradable permits may be
impractical because the transactions costs associated with trading are too
high, because there are too few potential buyers or sellers, or because
different levels of sophistication among potential market participants are
likely to lead to inefficiencies.
In these situations, alternative institutions can arise that approximate the
efficiency of true market approaches by providing flexibility, but trade off
some of the potential economic gains in the face of these practical
constraints. One approach, discussed later in the Tar-Pamlico case study, is a
less formal trading market. Another is a tradable performance standard.
The regulation of nitrogen oxides, particulate, and hydrocarbon emissions
from various types of combustion engines provides multiple examples of

226 | Economic Report of the President

how a tradable performance standard can work. Since 1991, heavy-duty,
on-highway engine manufacturers (who produce the engines used in trucks
and buses) have been able to comply with some of these emission standards
on new engines through a combination of averaging, banking, and trading—
or ABT. This approach has been extended to emission standards for many
other types of engines, including outboard boat engines, automobile and light
truck engines, locomotives, and small nonroad engines such as lawn mowers.
A typical ABT program begins with a schedule of emission standards. For
example, the NOx standard for heavy-duty, on-highway diesel engines
started at 6 grams per brake horsepower-hour for engines made in 1990,
falling to 5 grams in 1991 and 4 grams in 1998. After 2004, even stricter
standards will be applied. These are performance standards in the sense that
they specify emissions (grams of NOx) in relation to other outputs—in this
case useful mechanical energy output measured in brake horsepower-hours.
Engine manufacturers who lower their engines’ emissions beyond the standard generate credits. The number of credits is related to how much lower
the emissions are, over the life of the engine, than those for an engine that
exactly meets the standard. With some restrictions, manufacturers that earn
credits can use them to offset excess emissions from current-year engines that
do not meet the emission standard (averaging), reserve them for similar use
in future years (banking), or sell them to other manufacturers (trading).
Compared with a program that requires all engines to meet the same
standard, these ABT programs make it possible to achieve the same (or
lower) emissions at a lower cost. The banking element encourages manufacturers to overcomply in order to generate a stock of credits, providing
flexibility in the future. This overcompliance reduces emissions below the
standard in the current year. At the same time, the flexibility to produce
some engines that do not meet the standard and others that surpass it—while
achieving the standard on average—allows manufacturers to reduce emissions
more among those engines where control costs are lower.
The program for heavy-duty, on-highway engines contains an additional
flexibility mechanism called a nonconformance penalty. Manufacturers that
fail to meet the standard, and fail to obtain credits from other sources, can
choose to pay a penalty based on the degree to which their engines exceed the
standard. As an example, in 1991 a manufacturer producing a heavy-duty
diesel engine that was certified at 6 grams of NOx per brake horsepowerhour (when the standard was 5) could have paid a penalty of about $1,600
for each engine rather than seek out emission credits. The nonconformance
penalty limits the maximum costs that can be incurred by manufacturers
seeking to comply with the regulation, providing them an additional measure
of financial certainty. True, unlike the ABT mechanisms, which can lead to

Chapter 6

| 227

lower emissions than the required level, this kind of penalty (if used) allows
emissions to rise relative to a program requiring strict adherence to the
standard. However, this flexibility may actually allow the adoption of tighter
standards, suggesting that such a straightforward comparison is not valid.

Myths About Flexible Approaches
Despite the demonstrated benefits of flexible programs, popular concern
remains. Some of these concerns raise valid distributional and equity issues.
The economic and environmental benefits of flexible programs are not
always shared equally, and indeed, some stakeholders can end up worse off.
But other concerns derive from misperceptions about how flexible
approaches work. These misperceptions can be addressed by better information. Below we discuss some of the more common myths surrounding
flexible approaches to environmental regulation, and counter them with
rational economic explanations.

Myth #1: “It’s immoral to buy the right to pollute.”
A widely held belief is that it is somehow unethical or even immoral to
allow firms to buy and sell the right to pollute. For example, it has been
claimed that turning pollution into a commodity to be bought and sold
removes the moral stigma properly associated with it, and makes pollution
just another cost of doing business, like wages, benefits, and rent. Regarding
climate change, it has also been asserted that an emission trading program
may actually undermine the sense of shared responsibility that increased
global cooperation requires.
Although it is difficult to refute arguments of a moral nature, claims such
as these contain several flaws. Certainly it makes sense to maintain a moral
stigma on pollution when polluters are making a discrete choice whether to
pollute. However, in most cases the creation of some pollution is inevitable.
Thus the question is not whether we will pollute, but rather how much. In
this context it makes sense to evaluate pollution in terms of a tradeoff
between the harm it causes and the cost of abating it—and tradable permits
allow for this. Furthermore, arguments based on morality seem an
inappropriate framework for the debate in light of the past achievements of
tradable permits in reducing pollution. For example, it seems strange to
debate the morality or immorality of the use of a tradable permit system to
phase out leaded gasoline, given that such a system in the 1980s reduced
atmospheric concentrations of lead more rapidly than anyone had anticipated, and at a savings of $250 million a year. More generally, the premise

228 | Economic Report of the President

that environmental progress must be accompanied by sacrifice is not necessarily valid. Finally, the ability of a tradable permit program to make
pollution an internal cost of business is actually very effective, because it
forces polluters to incorporate the cost of their external environmental
damages into their operating costs.

Myth #2: “Permit markets for pollution are unfair.”
It has also been claimed that a market-based system for environmental
control is inherently unfair, allowing some participants (those for whom it is
less costly to buy permits than to reduce their own emissions) to evade their
obligations. For example, a proposal for an emission permit trading program
for NOx in the Netherlands met significant resistance in part because of policymakers’ concern that a free initial allocation of credits would benefit the
most-polluting companies, while penalizing those that had been more proactive in limiting emissions. But those who oppose pollution permit markets
on these grounds overlook the fact that trading usually makes all participants
in a regulatory program better off, compared with the same program without
trading. Consider the following hypothetical example: Suppose that
company A would have to spend $50 million annually to reduce its emissions as required by some new regulation, whereas company B could reduce
its emissions by the same amount at a cost of $5 million but is not required
to do so. Trade in emissions would make both companies better off. If
company A pays company B $30 million in exchange for company B’s
agreement to reduce its emissions in place of company A, company B would
be better off by $25 million, and company A would pay $30 million rather
than $50 million to reduce emissions. Indeed, because trade is optional, its
mere existence is evidence that trade is beneficial for both parties—if it were
not, one party would opt out.
Along the same lines, it is often mistakenly assumed that emission trading
somehow favors larger companies, allowing them to buy their way out of
pollution reductions whereas smaller companies cannot. But in fact, smaller
companies often benefit more from permit markets: because they may not
have as many internal options for pollution reduction, the potential to buy
emission permits gives them added flexibility. The mistaken assumption that
emission trading favors large companies also ignores the distinction between
the allocation of permits (and emission rights more generally) and their
subsequent trading.
The allocation of permits provides an opportunity to assign responsibility
for emission reductions in a way that addresses this concern. For example,
one could issue proportionally more permits to smaller companies to reduce
their burden. Or one could reward companies that have already reduced
emissions by providing them with extra permits. The smaller companies, or

Chapter 6

| 229

the ones receiving extra permits, would then be free either to use the permits
themselves—forcing other companies to reduce more—or to sell them if
they choose.
Moreover, almost no form of regulation (or, for that matter, of markets) is
“fair” under all possible definitions. For example, consider a hypothetical
industry in which some firms have invested in newer (more costly) equipment that is less polluting, whereas other firms still use older equipment that
is more polluting. Suppose that the government now introduces a regulation
requiring, explicitly or implicitly, that all firms in the industry use a third,
new technology that is less polluting than either of the first two. Both
companies will then have to spend money switching to the new technology.
But not only will the firms that originally invested in the intermediate technology receive no benefit from having polluted less in previous years; they
will in fact lose more money because they invested in this second-best technology that they now have to discard. Few would consider such a result
fair—certainly these firms would not.
To take a real-world example, consider the United States’ upcoming ban
on methyl bromide. Subsequent to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, participating developed and developing countries agreed to completely phase out
the use of this ozone-depleting chemical by 2005 and 2015, respectively.
Currently, California strawberry and Florida tomato production relies on
methyl bromide to control for pests and weeds. Substitutes for methyl
bromide are expected to be less effective and produce lower crop yields.
Meanwhile, competing strawberry and tomato growers in Mexico can
continue to use methyl bromide for an additional 10 years, thus allowing
them to increase their imports to the United States, at the expense of
U.S. production. Surely the U.S. farmers would not consider this form of
traditional regulation fair.
Finally, those who believe it is unfair for some firms to purchase permits
rather than reduce emissions or limit resource use sometimes overlook a
feature of a fully tradable permit system that they themselves can take
advantage of, to remove permits from the system. If they are unhappy that
firms are buying permits in order to comply, they can simply purchase
existing permits themselves and retire them, thereby reducing the number of
permits available to those firms. This method has been used, for example,
by people concerned about wetland preservation to buy water rights from
agricultural users in Nevada.
In thinking about fairness generally, society first needs to determine what
it believes is fair. Second, groups in society need to remember that those
adversely affected by a policy change can in principle be compensated if it is
felt that such compensation would make the policy more fair. Compensation
can occur under any form of regulatory tool, whether traditional or market based.

Myth #3: “Tradable permits and other flexible mechanisms will
never work in the real world.”
Flexible mechanisms do work, and we know this from real-world
experience: the successful results of many different pollution abatement and
resource management programs that have used them. These mechanisms
have been shown to be a highly effective (but certainly not the only) means
of controlling pollution and managing resources. The case studies below
document this experience for a variety of environmental concerns. Although
the setup and structure of these programs vary considerably, each has allowed
for flexible methods of compliance. As a result, many have achieved their
reduction and conservation goals at substantially lower cost than traditional
command-and-control approaches. For these programs to work well,
however, certain conditions must prevail; these are discussed in greater depth
in the section on lessons learned, at the end of the chapter.

Myth #4: “Traditional regulation encourages technological
innovation and adoption of new technologies more than do
market-based mechanisms.”
As discussed above, the circumstances of some environmental issues may
favor traditional regulatory approaches, including technological standards
mandating the use of a specific technology, and performance standards,
which require each firm to demonstrate a certain performance level,
expressed as an emission rate per unit of input or output. However, the
requirement to use a particular technology prevents firms from seeking out
cheaper alternatives. And because individual firms are usually in the best
position to find those cheap alternatives, it is likely that technological
mandates retard innovation. By specifying compliance in terms of a fixed
technology or performance level, both kinds of standards provide little
incentive for ongoing improvements in pollution control techniques. That is,
firms may get no benefit from improvements they might discover that would
allow more emission reductions for the same price. Lacking this incentive,
firms may not invest continuously in research and development to enhance
environmental quality. Barriers such as these have contributed to declining
private sector funding for environmental technology development once firms
have met the established standards.
Flexible mechanisms, in contrast, encourage firms to constantly seek out
the most cost-effective technology to reduce their pollution. Moreover, the
wider technological choice that results from such research creates greater
opportunities for still further innovation, which cannot be predicted or
captured in a government-controlled technological mandate. One example
demonstrating that flexible permit trading programs promote innovation is

Chapter 6

| 231

the success of the Title IV SO2 program established under the 1990 Clean
Air Act Amendments. This program is discussed in greater detail in the case
study below. Because the program did not impose a technological requirement, and consequently rewarded all emission reductions, firms began to
experiment with blending the high-sulfur coal that many of them had been
using with low-sulfur western coal. Blending worked far better than had been
thought possible, resulting in low-cost emission reductions.
Because the SO2 program also included a flexible banking mechanism,
firms had an incentive to use these low-cost opportunities to reduce emissions substantially below the required levels. Excess emission reductions such
as these are unlikely in programs that limit compliance to a fixed technology
or performance level, because they provide no incentive for overcompliance.
As a second example, research shows that stricter building codes have had
little effect on homebuilders’ choice of insulation technology. On the other
hand, higher energy prices and adoption subsidies (which pay homebuilders
directly to use more energy-efficient insulation) would have had a much
greater effect. In this case, flexible incentives would have led to the more
rapid adoption of new technologies, where traditional regulation failed to do so.
Finally, fisheries have long been subject to command-and-control regulation, which, for example, set limits on the time spent fishing. There is strong
evidence that, under this type of regulation, fishing operations built up
excess capital: too many ships were acquired, and too much equipment was
installed, in order to catch as many fish as possible in the short time allowed.
In the case of the Federal surf-clam fishery, in contrast, tradable permits
succeeded in reducing the number of ships and the amount of capital used,
and thus led to a more efficient use of existing technology than the various
size limits and time restrictions that they replaced. One of the case studies
below discusses fisheries in more detail.

Case Studies in Flexible
Environmental Protection
Recognizing that flexible approaches to environmental protection can
work solves only part of the puzzle. The other part is identifying the right
institutional arrangement for the environmental problem in question, and
the right development path along which to build those institutions. Perhaps
the best way to understand how flexible programs are put into place is to
consider several examples. Below we review three such programs that use
varying approaches to address different environmental problems.

232 | Economic Report of the President

The Sulfur Dioxide Permit Trading Program
History of Sulfur Dioxide Regulation
Sulfur dioxide, when released into the atmosphere, reacts with water,
oxygen, and other chemicals there to form an acidic deposition known as
acid rain. Acid rain has the potential to raise the acidity of lakes, resulting in
fish kills; to reduce the alkalinity of forest soils, harming various tree species;
and to degrade various other ecosystem functions. Studies have also linked
SO2 with degradation of visibility and with increases in fine particulate
matter in the atmosphere, which can cause respiratory problems in humans.
In North America, acid rain is a concern mainly in the northeastern United
States, particularly in the Adirondacks and New England, and in southeastern Canada. The majority of SO2 emissions come from industrial
activities, although natural sources—volcanoes and sea spray—also
contribute.
Historically, SO2 pollution control has focused on fossil fuel-burning
electric power generators, which are responsible for approximately two-thirds
of all SO2 emissions in the United States. The 1970 Clean Air Act
Amendments, the first significant Federal air pollution legislation, led to the
establishment of national air quality standards for permissible concentrations
of SO2 in the air. States were largely held responsible for meeting these standards in each local area through the development of a State Implementation
Plan (SIP), specifying actions to be taken to bring the State into compliance.
As part of their SIPs, States required some existing power plants and others
not yet built to have high smokestacks, so as to disperse emissions over a
wider area. However, because acid rain can sometimes fall hundreds of miles
downwind from its source, tall stacks may actually have increased SO2
concentrations at distant locations. The 1970 amendments also imposed
New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), which applied only to new
power plants. These standards set new coal-fired plants’ maximum allowed
emission rates significantly below the emission rates of existing plants.
In projecting States’ future air quality, it was assumed that existing plants
not meeting the NSPS would gradually be retired, following historical
patterns. However, this assumption failed to account for the strong incentives
that the rules themselves created to extend the lives of older plants, which
were expensive to replace with plants meeting the NSPS. By 1975 it had
become clear that, because older plants were continuing to operate longer
than expected, many States would not be able to comply with the air quality
standards within the mandated time period. As a result, the 1977 Clean Air
Act Amendments extended the deadline until 1982 and tightened the NSPS
in those areas unable to meet the original deadlines. These new NSPS rules

Chapter 6

| 233

required coal-fired plants built after 1978 to remove a specified percentage of
potential emissions. This, however, reduced the advantages of using lowsulfur coal as a means of compliance, because percentage reductions were still
required regardless of the type of coal used. Thus regulations may actually
have dirtied the air on balance, by encouraging utilities to burn high-sulfur
coal and by strengthening the incentives to extend the lives of old,
dirty plants. The NSPS requirements also raised fairness issues, as some
industries (such as high-sulfur coal producers) benefited while others (such as
low-sulfur coal producers) suffered losses. Also among the losers were those
States, mostly in the West, that were already using low-sulfur coal to generate
electricity and were growing rapidly.

The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments
Because current controls were not successful at achieving the SO2
emission reduction goals, a new acid rain program was launched under the
1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. Title IV of the amendments set a goal of
reducing annual SO2 emissions by 10 million tons from the 1980 level. To
achieve these ambitious reductions, the law required a two-phase tightening
of the restrictions placed on fossil fuel-fired power plants. Phase I, which
began in 1995, affected 263 units at 110 mostly coal-burning electric utility
plants located throughout 21 eastern and midwestern States. An additional
182 units opted into the program during the course of Phase I. Phase II,
which began in 2000, further tightened annual emission limits on the larger,
higher emitting Phase I plants and set emission restrictions on smaller,
cleaner plants, some of which were fired by oil or natural gas.
To achieve these goals, the 1990 amendments directed the Environmental
Protection Agency to design a trading program in SO2 emission allowances.
The program provides incentives for energy conservation and technology
innovation that both lower the cost of compliance and increase pollution
prevention. Under the program, units are allocated allowances based on their
historical fuel consumption and a specific emission rate. The large size
and relatively small number of plants made it easier for emissions to be
monitored continuously, increasing the credibility of emissions accounting
and simplifying verification of the achievement of emission reduction goals.
The majority of allowances are allocated by the agency without cost to the
recipient. However, every year a small fraction (about 3 percent) of
allowances are held back and sold in an auction administered by the Chicago
Board of Trade. The SO2 program also has a reserve of allowances that
provides firms with the opportunity to purchase additional allowances at a
fixed price of $1,500 (in 1990 dollars; this figure is adjusted each year for
inflation). Each allowance permits a unit to emit 1 ton of SO2 during or
after a specified year. Allowances may be bought, sold, or banked for future
234 | Economic Report of the President

use. If a plant’s annual emissions exceed the number of allowances held, the
owners must pay a penalty of $2,000 (in 1990 dollars, also adjusted for inflation) per excess ton of emissions. Violating units are also required to make
additional future emission reductions. Trading is not restricted to utility
plants; anyone may buy or sell allowances. For example, speculators have
acquired some allowances in hopes of future price increases, and environmental groups and some individuals have acquired allowances in order to
reduce emissions more than the law requires.

Results
Participation in the trading program has been strong. Through the end of
2000, over 11,600 transfers had taken place, involving 111 million
allowances. Approximately 59 percent of these (66 million) were transferred
within organizations, and the remainder between economically distinct organizations. Both the number of transfers and the associated number of
allowances have increased greatly since the program’s inception (Chart 6-4).
In the first year of trading (1994), 66 transactions took place, exchanging 0.9
million allowances between economically distinct organizations. In 2000,
2,889 transactions resulted in the transfer of 12.7 million allowances.
The trading program has lowered emissions substantially while yielding
considerable cost savings, especially compared with the previous, commandand-control regime. Emissions data indicate that in the program’s first target
year (1995), nationwide emissions by the units required to participate in
Phase I were reduced by almost 40 percent below their required level (Chart
6-5). This overachievement was encouraged by the provision allowing firms
to bank credits for future use when they reduce emissions in excess of current
requirements. The General Accounting Office projects that, compared with
the command-and-control approach, the allowance trading system could
save as much as $3 billion a year, or more than half the total cost of meeting
the standards. Some economists, however, believe this estimate overstates the
program’s cost reduction. As low-cost options for emission reduction
emerged that had not been foreseen in 1989, there has been over time a clear
downward trend in the predicted cost of the program. This primarily results
from the fact that, as it turned out, low-sulfur coal could be substituted for
high-sulfur coal much more easily than had been anticipated at the program’s
inception. On the other hand, this less costly method was likely adopted, in
part, precisely because of the flexibility allowed for in the SO2 trading
program. A command-and-control program, whether based on performance
standards or on technological requirements, might have afforded much less
opportunity to take advantage of this low-cost alternative. In this case,
flexibility allowed adoption of the optimal, most efficient solution available.

Tradable Quotas in the Alaskan Halibut
and Sablefish Fisheries
The preceding example focused on a national pollution problem, which
required a national solution. But flexible approaches have also been successfully applied to local and regional environmental problems, as the next two
case studies demonstrate.
Fish in the coastal waters and open seas are the private property of no one;
they are there to be caught by anyone with a boat, a fishing permit, and the
necessary equipment. This public access nature of saltwater fisheries results in
economic inefficiencies. If fish could be fenced in and counted like cattle,
property rights could be allocated for each fish, or for a school, or for an
entire fishery. Owners of such rights would have an incentive to limit their
catch, so that enough fish are left each year to ensure the sustainability of the
fish population, and thus of the owners’ profits, in future years. However,
because rights to individual fish or to fisheries cannot be established, and no
one private fishing operation can control the actions of others, it is often in
each fisherman’s best interest to catch as many fish as possible, as quickly as
possible, before the others do. As a result, many fisheries have suffered from
an excess of capital, participation, or effort given the amount of fish available.
This, in turn, has led not only to overfishing and depletion of the resource,
but also to increased conflict and hostility, undesirable price and market
effects, and increased physical danger to fishermen.
Regulation of U.S. fisheries was established in 1976 with the passage of the
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (later renamed the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act). Since then the act has
been amended more than a dozen times, marking significant changes in its
course and emphasis. The 1996 amendments emphasized the goal of biological conservation of fish stocks and protection of habitats, along with other
resource management objectives. For the first time, the amendments made
the prevention of overfishing an enforceable obligation on the part of the
Federal Government.
In some fisheries, authorities have sought to achieve these goals through
the use of a market-based output control mechanism called individual fishing
quotas (IFQs, sometimes also called individual transferable quotas). An IFQ
is defined as “a Federal permit under a limited access system to harvest a
quantity of fish, expressed by a unit or units representing a percentage of the
total allowable catch (TAC) of a fishery that may be received or held for
exclusive use by a person.” Ideally, regulators should set the TAC equal to the
socially optimal catch (that is, the maximum sustainable catch). To date,
IFQs have been adopted in a number of U.S. fisheries, such as those for surf
clams and ocean quahogs, South Atlantic wreckfish, and Alaskan halibut and
sablefish. Such mechanisms have also been used in other countries, including
Iceland and New Zealand.
Chapter 6 | 237

The experiences of the Alaskan halibut and sablefish fisheries are particularly
illustrative. When the IFQ program was launched in 1995, the estimated
coastwide biomass of halibut was above the 25-year average, but was
declining and expected to continue to drop in the future. As of 1999, sablefish biomass had been declining since 1986 and was 30 percent below the
recent average. Before the IFQ program, efforts to maintain fish stocks took
the form of traditional management: regulators set an annual TAC on
commercial fishing of halibut and then attempted to achieve the TAC
through a combination of area, season, and gear restrictions. These regulations resulted in a host of problems, such as gear conflicts, fish kills due
to gear lost at sea, discarded fish mortality, excess harvesting capacity, declines
in product quality, safety concerns, unmonitored catch of regulated species in
other fisheries, and economic instability within both the fishing industry and
fishing communities. Evidence of some of these problems can be seen in
the extremely short annual season for halibut fishing: from 1980 to 1994 the
season averaged only 2 to 3 days in the management areas responsible
for the majority of catches.

IFQ Design
Consideration of limits to entry began in 1977, but because of implementation
delays, IFQs for halibut and sablefish were not approved until the end of
1991 and were implemented only in 1995. A primary objective of the
program was to eliminate the fishing derby associated with the shortened
season and the limit on the catch. This frantic race for fish was not only
unsafe but inefficient as well. To increase their individual catch, some
fishermen brought in additional vessels, and this imposed higher costs both
on themselves and on others. These higher costs included increased
harvesting and processing costs and decreased product prices, as well as the
potential for higher debt service, additional unmonitored fish mortality, and
increased accidents.
The design and management of the IFQ programs for Alaskan halibut and
sablefish are largely the same. Landing data for halibut are collected by individual State governments and then forwarded to the International Pacific
Halibut Commission (IPHC). Catch data for sablefish are collected by the
individual States and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Both
programs require IFQ owners to be on board the vessel when the IFQ is
being fished. They also set limits on the accumulation and transfer of quota
shares. No person may own more than 0.5 percent of the total quota share
for halibut, or 1 percent of the share for sablefish, in particular areas.
Transferability is restricted across vessel size and across vessel categories.
IFQs were allocated to vessel owners and leaseholders who had verifiable
commercial landings of halibut or sablefish during any of the eligibility years
238 | Economic Report of the President

1988, 1989, and 1990. Specific allocations were based on the best 5 years
of landings during the qualifying years of 1984-90 for halibut and 1985-90
for sablefish.
The catch is monitored through a combination of real-time and
post-transaction auditing. Deliveries may be made only to registered buyers,
and notice must be given to the NMFS. Real-time auditing is through IFQ
landing cards and transaction terminals. Post-transaction auditing compares
the records submitted by registered buyers with the fishermen’s landing
records. Provisions also exist for over- and underharvests: limited amounts
of annual quota shares can be either deducted or credited to the next year’s
allocation. In part because of this extensive monitoring system,
administration of IFQ programs is somewhat costly. Nevertheless, it is
believed that the program’s economic benefits will far outweigh the increase
in management costs. In addition, as mandated by the new MagnusonStevens Act requirements, a cost recovery program to help defray
monitoring and enforcement costs was established in March 2000.

Results
Measured against the program’s stated goals, IFQs for halibut and sablefish
have been highly successful. Most notably, the race for fish was eliminated.
The season has increased from less than 5 days to 245 days a year for both
species, and landings are now broadly distributed throughout the season. As
a result, safety has improved. The program also reduced the frequency with
which the TAC was exceeded, in both fisheries. In addition, the IPHC estimates that discarding of halibut bycatch fell by about 80 percent between
1994 and 1995, as did halibut mortality from lost or abandoned gear
(although significant uncertainty surrounds both these estimates). There
does not, however, appear to be any difference in sablefish bycatch before and
after IFQ implementation. There is anecdotal evidence of highgrading
(discarding all but the most profitable fish), but comparisons of halibut sizecomposition data suggest that any highgrading that does occur is
insignificant. Underreporting of either halibut or sablefish catches does not
appear to be a problem.
Meanwhile the quota share markets have been active, with more than
3,800 permanent transfers of halibut quota shares to date and more
than 1,100 transfers of sablefish quota shares. Trading under the IFQ
program has also led to some consolidation: the number of quota holders
declined by 24 percent for halibut and 18 percent for sablefish between
January 1995 and August 1997. In both fisheries the bulk of this consolidation has taken place among those with smaller IFQ holdings. Although it
seems likely that the overall efficiency of the fisheries has increased, it remains
uncertain how costs and revenues have been affected.
Chapter 6

| 239

Despite these successes, some concerns remain. Most complaints center on
the allocation of IFQ permits, while the rest tend to reflect problems
common to any fishing restriction. The primary complaint concerning the
initial allocation relates to the delay between the qualifying years and the
implementation of the program. Some fishermen who have become active
since the qualifying years received no initial free allocations and had to
purchase all their quota rights. Conversely, some quota shares were awarded
to individuals who had been active during the qualifying years but inactive in
the years immediately preceding implementation. Crewmembers and processors also allege that the initial allocation rewarded vessel owners and
redistributed market power in favor of quota shareholders. In addition, there
is ongoing concern about community effects, adequacy of enforcement, the
potential for localized depletion, and the preemption of productive sportfishing grounds (which are not regulated) by commercial fishermen. Many of
these issues could plague any fishing regulation scheme.

Informal Permit Trading in the Tar-Pamlico River Basin
In 1983 local fishermen and citizens in the basin of the Tar and Pamlico
Rivers of eastern North Carolina noticed sores on fish, algal blooms (aquatic
algae consuming the water’s available oxygen), and fish kills in their local
rivers and estuaries. Because studies link many of these problems to increased
concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen in water systems, the North
Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC) designated the
region a Nutrient Sensitive Water in 1989.
Laying the groundwork for future regulation was somewhat complicated
by the fact that these nutrients came from different types of sources:
83 percent of nitrogen and 66 percent of phosphorus loads originated from
non-point sources, such as agricultural runoff and natural phenomena. The
remainder came from point sources such as water sewage treatment facilities
and local industry. Given the political and technological constraints on
detecting, monitoring, and enforcing non-point source nutrient reduction,
the proposed EMC regulation targeted point source discharges, setting strict
limits on new dischargers and the expansion of existing ones. The ultimate
goal of this command-and-control regulation was to reduce phosphorus and
nitrogen loading into the region’s waters by 200,000 kilograms a year by 1995.
Some of the publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) affected by
the regulation estimated that together they would have to spend between
$50 million and $100 million to achieve compliance with the State’s plan.

240 | Economic Report of the President

Concerned about these high capital costs, the POTWs, in conjunction with
a private firm, asked the North Carolina State government if a better solution
could be found. Working with the Environmental Defense Fund
(a private nonprofit group, now called Environmental Defense) and the
Pamlico-Tar River Foundation, a coalition of dischargers called the TarPamlico Basin Association proposed an alternative solution involving
collective nutrient trading.
Under the arrangement, which was approved in 1989, two types of trades
are allowed: collective trading among point sources and collective trading
between point sources and non-point sources. In the first case, members of
the association operate within a “bubble,” offsetting one another’s discharges
to achieve a specified overall limit. In the second case, the members collectively have the option to achieve all or part of the total nutrient reduction
goals by funding agricultural best management practices (BMPs) through the
State’s Agricultural Cost Share Program, which pays farmers to reduce nutrients and runoff. These offset funds are used to pay willing farmers 75 percent
of the cost of adopting nutrient-reducing BMPs on farms within the basin.
In this manner the Tar-Pamlico program establishes responsibility at the
group rather than the individual level, as no transactions occur between
individual point source and non-point source polluters.
So long as the association succeeded in reducing phosphorus and nitrogen
emissions by the originally targeted 200,000 kilograms a year, no specific
emission reduction requirements would be imposed. Given this flexibility,
the association estimated that it could meet this reduction for about $11.5
million, far less than the estimated cost of the proposed command-andcontrol regulation. The agreement between the association and the State also
required the association to fund a computer model simulating nutrients’ flow
and effects; to hire a consultant to evaluate existing wastewater treatment
plants, to determine the changes needed to ensure that they are operating at
maximum efficiency; to monitor each member’s weekly phosphorus and
nitrogen discharge; and to provide upfront funding for the Agricultural Cost
Share Program.
In all, 15 dischargers, contributing about 90 percent of all point source
flows to the basin, eventually joined the association. Some of those that
decided not to join cited the risk involved: there was no guarantee that the
association would achieve the required nutrient reduction by 1995. If it
failed, the investment and membership costs would be forfeited, and the
State’s original command-and-control plan would be implemented. Other
point source dischargers that had already planned or begun upgrades in plant
facilities could meet the State’s stricter limits without the need to trade.

Chapter 6

| 241

A tricky feature of this program is the arrangement for trading between
point and non-point sources. Whereas the amount of nutrient load entering
the water from a point source is easily measurable, that from a non-point
source is not. This is in part because the amount of nutrient loading resulting
from a given amount of fertilizer can vary considerably, depending on the
weather and other conditions outside anyone’s control. Because of this added
uncertainty, expected non-point source emissions are imperfect substitutes
for point source emissions: more than one unit of non-point source reductions is necessary to equal, in quality-adjusted terms, a unit of point source
reductions. It was recognized that, because of this, trades between these two
types should not occur at a one-to-one ratio. But it was also recognized that
the choice of the trading ratio between point and non-point sources would
be key to the program’s success: too high a ratio would discourage trading,
but too low a ratio might fail to achieve abatement goals. In the end, the
trading ratio was set at two to one for effluents from non-point sources
involving livestock (such as pastureland and poultry operations), and three to
one for cropland. That is, to acquire a one-unit credit, the association must
pay the State’s Agricultural Cost Share Program for the reduction of two (or
three) units of a non-point source’s nutrient emissions.
To date, compliance has been achieved entirely through trade among
point sources. It is uncertain whether this indicates that the trading ratio was
set too high, or that abatement costs at point sources are in fact the lowestcost alternative. But an important outcome is that, thus far, internal “trades”
have taken place rather informally. Instead of paying one another to undertake pollution control measures, association members reportedly have each
agreed to incorporate nutrient removal systems whenever they expand their
facilities. The association maintains that this approach is less costly:
economies of scope make it less expensive to expand a facility and upgrade
the control technology simultaneously, rather than on separate occasions as
trading might require.
The two largest emitters in the group, both POTWs, were among the first
to implement nutrient removal systems. Smaller members have since
followed suit. The association expects to achieve the reduction requirements
through internal trading for the next 4 or 5 years, after which members may
begin to take advantage of trading with non-point sources, or shift to a more
formal trading system within the organization, or both.
The results of this market-based program have been impressive (Chart 6-6).
Because of growth in nearby communities, dischargers have had to become
even more efficient with respect to their nutrient emissions. Even though the
association’s combined discharge flow increased approximately 20 to 35 percent
from 1991 to 1997, total nitrogen concentrations fell by 10 to 20 percent,
and total phosphorus concentrations by 20 to 40 percent, in the same period.
242 | Economic Report of the President

When Markets Don’t Work
The preceding case studies highlighted three examples where flexible,
market-based approaches have been used to achieve environmental goals at
substantial savings over less flexible alternatives. In each case the institutions
and their historical development differed substantially. An important lesson
is that these different settings required different approaches in order to succeed.
In other words, flexible approaches do not succeed simply by virtue of
their flexibility. Other elements are necessary as well. First, tradable permit
markets typically require a large number of participants to work well. As the
Tar-Pamlico case study suggests, one way around this dilemma of a small
number of participants may be to create a more informal trading association.
Second, it is important that trading not be inhibited by overly cumbersome
restrictions. For example, in 1981 the Wisconsin Tradable Discharge Permit
system was organized on the Fox River, allowing rights to biochemical
oxygen demand discharges (which decrease the oxygen available for fish and
other aquatic species) to be traded among point sources. By 1996, however,
only one trade had taken place. It is likely that trading was infrequent
because administrative impediments discouraged the transfer of permits.
Dischargers are not allowed to trade unless they can demonstrate need, and
Chapter 6

| 243

therefore they cannot trade solely for the purpose of reducing treatment
costs. Moreover, the traded rights are guaranteed for a maximum of 5 years,
with no assurance that rights will be renewed.
In addition to liquidity among participants at a given moment, liquidity
across time is necessary to smooth out temporary fluctuations in aggregate
permit demand. For example, the SO2 trading program allows firms to bank
unused permits for future use. By 1996, after just 2 years of operation, the
total volume of banked permits actually exceeded annual emission levels.
This bank provides an effective cushion against demand fluctuations, as the
banked permits can be increased or drawn down as needed. In contrast, the
Los Angeles area NOx program initially lacked a permit bank or other source
of aggregate flexibility. As a consequence, the permit price skyrocketed from
its historical level of around $2 a pound to nearly $50 a pound in the
summer of 2000, because of increased demand from fossil-fuel
electricity producers. Similarly, an innovative internal greenhouse gas emission trading program at a major energy company has seen fluctuations in
demand cause the price to jump to $99 per ton of carbon dioxide in less than
1 year from almost zero the year before, in the absence of a substantial bank.
These aggregate liquidity problems could be solved either by developing
a bank or, as suggested above, by empowering the regulatory agency to
provide a safety valve, selling additional permits when the price reaches a
specified threshold.
Finally, flexible programs work best when monitoring costs are low and
when financial incentives—fees or permit requirements—are easily associated with actual emissions or resource use. Automobile emissions, for
example, are poor candidates for a trading program: it is impractical to
require the drivers of the Nation’s more than 100 million registered automobiles to both monitor their individual emissions and acquire tradable permits
accordingly. Still, we see flexible approaches—in the form of tradable
performance standards described earlier—applied to these sources.

Lessons for Future Policy: Climate Change
One of the most controversial and complex environmental policy challenges facing the United States—and the world—is the long-term issue of
climate change. This potential problem spans both generations and countries, implicating simultaneously the environment, on the one hand, and the
world’s fundamental economic reliance on fossil fuels—a key source of
climate change risk—on the other. What do the lessons learned in this
chapter suggest about a reasonable approach to climate change?

244 | Economic Report of the President

Base Policy Action on Sound Science
In each of the case studies presented in this chapter, government policy
responded to an environmental problem in a manner designed to protect not
only the environment but also economic well-being. Sound science guided
those responses and must do so in our response to climate change, as articulated by the President in his speech in the Rose Garden on June 11, 2001.
Yet the risks arising from climate change are less clear than the risks identified
in the case studies, as is the appropriate response. We are uncertain about the
effect of natural fluctuations on global warming. We do not know how much
the climate could or will change in the future. We do not know how fast
climate change will occur, or even how some of our actions could affect it.
Finally, it is difficult to say with any certainty what constitutes a dangerous
level of warming that must be avoided.
Therefore an important element of a reasonable climate change approach
must be more research into both the science of climate change and mitigation technologies, in order to learn more about the risks and the appropriate
response. The President has committed the United States to do just that,
with research initiatives in both the science of understanding climate change
and the means of mitigating its effects. This includes the President’s Climate
Change Research Initiative and his National Climate Change Technology
Initiative, which will add to the more than $18 billion spent on climate
research since 1990.

Choose a Flexible, Gradual Approach
The President has also directed an effort to consider approaches to
reducing greenhouse gas emissions. All of the case studies in this chapter
demonstrate that flexible approaches consistently provide environmental
benefits at a lower economic cost than traditional methods. Flexibility is even
more important when balancing climate change and fossil energy use. An
effective program must include all greenhouse gases, all emission sources and
sinks, and, given the global nature of the problem, all countries. It should
provide for flexibility to shift emission reductions over time in response to
both short- and long-term opportunities. Flexibility is needed in the face of
changing economic conditions, scientific uncertainty, and the development
of affordable, advanced energy and sequestration technologies. Finally, an
effective program needs to consider non-greenhouse gas emissions that
contribute to climate change, such as tropospheric ozone and black soot.
Because all of these dimensions offer promising opportunities to address
climate change, each must be used in a way that maximizes the mitigation
benefit for every dollar spent.

Chapter 6

| 245

Ideally, this could be accomplished by creating the same incentives for
equivalent emission reductions in all these different dimensions: across gases,
across sources, across countries, and over time. These incentives would necessarily adjust in response to changing economic conditions and additional
knowledge concerning benefits and costs. Yet concepts such as a worldwide
tax on greenhouse gas emissions or a worldwide tradable permit system,
sometimes advertised as solutions, are at best useful theoretical benchmarks
against which to measure alternative, practical approaches. At worst, they can
be a distraction from meaningful, realistic steps forward.
Why are such proposals impractical? Because they fail to recognize the
enormous institutional and logistical obstacles to implementing any
sweeping international program. Institutionally, it is important to learn to
walk before trying to run. The United States implemented its successful SO2
trading program only after gaining experience in the 1970s and 1980s with
netting and banking programs, experimenting with control technologies for
more than 20 years, and recognizing the limitations of alternative commandand-control approaches. Most other countries have significantly less
experience with flexible approaches. A flexible international program would
be unprecedented.
As the case studies have also shown, flexible programs have been
remarkably successful—but sometimes they run into glitches. For that
reason, it would be dangerous to make any serious U.S. policy or commitment dependent on newly designed and untried international
institutions—a point highlighted by the President’s Cabinet-level climate
change working group in its initial findings. Moreover, the current uncertainty surrounding climate change implies that a realistic policy should
involve a gradual, measured response, not a risky, precipitous one.
What would constitute a practical policy? In addition to the science and
technology initiatives noted above, we could begin investigating reasonable
ways to set emission goals and to facilitate efforts by businesses and individuals to think about their own emissions and opportunities for reductions.
Internationally, we should continue to expand our cooperation with both
developed and developing countries. This will build experience along the
various dimensions required for a flexible response and will set the institutional
foundation for any further policies that might be necessary in the future.

Set Reasonable, Gradual Goals
A reasonable national goal for greenhouse gas emissions could serve as a
benchmark for our progress in terms of mitigation, and thus as an investment in one aspect of a climate change policy that encompasses science,
technology, cooperation, and mitigation. One of the problems with climate

246 | Economic Report of the President

policy over the past decade has been a focus on unreasonable, infeasible
targets. For example, reducing U.S. emissions to 7 percent less than their
1990 level (the Kyoto target) over the next 10 years could cost up to 4 percent
of GDP in 2010—a staggering sum when there is no scientific basis for
believing this target is preferable to one less costly. Worse yet, by imposing
such high economic costs and diverting limited resources, the Kyoto targets
could have reduced our capacity to find innovative ways out of the environmental consequences of global warming. But what defines a reasonable
emission goal in the absence of better science?
The uncertainty surrounding the science of climate change suggests that
some modesty is in order. We need to recognize that it makes sense to discuss
slowing emission growth before trying to stop and eventually reverse it.
There is an unfortunate tendency to treat greenhouse gases—especially
carbon dioxide (CO2)—in a manner analogous to SO2 and NOx, for which
strict quantitative limits have been imposed. SO2 and NOx can be controlled
by adding equipment to existing facilities. CO2, however, can only be
reduced by either reducing energy use or replacing fossil fuel facilities, equipment, and transportation fleets with ones that use fuels with lower or zero
emissions (that is, unless and until capture and sequestration of CO2 become
feasible). This is vastly more expensive than the end-of-pipe treatment appropriate for SO2 and NOx, and it raises concerns about fuel diversity, national
security, and the ability to sustain our economic strength and quality of life.
A modest, near-term goal to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions could be
described in many ways. A greenhouse gas emission target could be indexed
to economic output or other measures of economic activity. Or one could
express the goal in terms of greenhouse gas emission intensity, that is, the
amount of emissions per unit of economic activity. Both these ideas
describe targets that are flexible in the face of economic growth, encouraging
reductions without threatening the economy.
A reasonable, gradual goal specified in this way offers advantages over the
reductions set out in the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol focused on
rather dramatic short-term reductions with unclear environmental benefits.
Those reductions risked damaging economic consequences and, in turn,
jeopardized the ability to invest in long-run scientific and technological solutions. A reasonable goal offers insurance consistent with existing climate
science without putting the economy at risk. A gradual approach balances
the need for mitigation with the need for economic growth to power future
innovation. A gradual approach also allows us to adjust as we learn more
from the science and are able to take advantage of technologies as they
develop. Finally, a gradual goal provides time to develop stronger institutions
for a long-term, global solution.

Chapter 6

| 247

Provide Information and Encourage Reductions
In addition to setting a reasonable goal, we need to facilitate efforts by
firms and individuals to track their own behavior and to recognize costeffective mitigation opportunities. The government has a useful role here,
both in providing information and in acknowledging progress. No matter
how sensible the near-term national goal, firms and individuals need to
understand their role—and opportunities—in order to succeed.
One portion of an information program could be the development of
procedures and pilot programs to measure both project-based reductions and
carbon sequestration. Project-based measurement is important domestically
to the extent that offsets are eventually used in certain sectors or for certain
gases. It is important internationally if the United States wants to encourage
domestic firms to seek out meaningful reductions in developing countries
where fully market-based programs are unlikely to be implemented.
Sequestration of greenhouse gases in agricultural and forestry sinks offers
considerable opportunity, both domestically and internationally, to achieve
inexpensive near- and medium-term reductions—if an environmentally
sound accounting method can be devised. We can continue work aimed at
reducing the concerns and uncertainty associated with sink usage. In all
cases, research, rules, and pilot programs should be developed in consultation
with other countries pursuing alternative climate change programs, to ensure
both consistency and fair competition.
In addition to educating businesses and individuals about their own
greenhouse gas emissions and the opportunities to reduce them, we can
encourage them to reduce emissions in innovative ways. This might involve
incentives, voluntary challenges, or public recognition, again focusing on
flexible, gradual efforts.

Give Technology—and Institutions—Time
These first steps concerning reasonable goals, information, and accounting,
along with continued international cooperation, can serve as building
blocks toward long-term institutions. To get the institutions right and to
protect the economy, however, this movement must be gradual. Initial steps
should signal our intent and thereby encourage the development of new
technologies—technologies designed to eventually stabilize atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse gases at a level that does not dangerously interfere with the climate system. Such stabilization, in contrast to an arbitrary
short-term emission limit, remains the long-term goal recommended both
by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and by
the President.

248 | Economic Report of the President

These efforts and goals will require time in order to accomplish them
effectively. Science, markets, technology, and global participation must be
wound together in an effective policy response. To do so requires building
sound institutions for a better environment.

Supporting Global Economic Integration

T

he world economy has become increasingly integrated. Goods, services,
capital, and people flow across borders with greater frequency and in
ever-greater volumes. For some, cross-national interaction has become even
more a part of day-to-day activity than interactions within their own country.
Americans benefit tremendously from their interactions with other
countries, just as they do from their interactions with each other in different
States. Such interactions allow Louisianans to drink California wine,
Chicagoans to eat bananas and pineapples from Hawaii, and savers in Ohio
to provide financing to business startups in Florida. In the same way, international trade allows Americans to enjoy French wine and Colombian coffee
and to take advantage of investment opportunities in the United Kingdom.
Despite these benefits, many geographic, institutional, and historical
factors impede the free flow of goods, capital, and people across national
borders. Realizing the full benefits of international interactions requires
building into our economic system mechanisms that facilitate the removal of
such impediments. National compacts such as the interstate commerce
clause of the Constitution help to link the activities of different States. In the
same way, international institutions have developed to promote linkages
around the world. Such institutions seek to provide a stable framework for
international transactions, while respecting the sovereignty of each country
that chooses to participate, as well as serving a valuable coordinating role.
International financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) help to promote international monetary and financial cooperation.
All of these institutions also evolve in response to changes in the global
economy, just as the transactions themselves are likely to change in response
to institutional initiatives.
This chapter begins by describing the increasing integration of the world
economy and of the United States with the world economy. It then sets out
some of the benefits of this globalization and addresses some of the
concerns it has engendered. Finally, it discusses the role of institutions within
the international economy, covering both recent activities and some likely
areas for change.

251

The United States in the
International Economy
Trends and Patterns in U.S. and World Trade
Several factors have contributed to the increased integration of the U.S.
economy with the rest of the world. For one, the costs of communicating
between a producer in one country and a buyer in another have fallen
dramatically, thus reducing the total costs of dealing with a foreign trade or
financial partner. One measure of these falling costs is the cost of international telephone service: the average amount billed to end users for a minute
of international telephone service fell from $2.23 in 1975 to $0.45 in 2000
(in dollars unadjusted for inflation).
In 2000, of the 10 largest international telecommunications carriers in the
world as measured by minutes of outgoing traffic, three were U.S. companies, and they held first, second, and sixth place. International telephone
traffic worldwide continued to grow rapidly, by more than 20 percent in that
year. The flow of international telephone traffic to and from the United
States continues to exceed that for any other country in the world.
Worldwide satellite industry revenue also grew by 17 percent in 2000. These
numbers suggest the continuing significance of international and global
communications to U.S. and foreign business firms, who sell and purchase
products and services in all parts of the world, and to U.S. and foreign consumers.
The costs of transporting goods between countries have also fallen, and
this, too, stimulates international trade. Average nominal freight and insurance costs for U.S. imports fell by about 50 percent between 1975 and 2000,
and air cargo rates on long-distance routes declined substantially. Over the
same period, the share of U.S. imports that arrives by air increased from 9.2
percent to 25.4 percent. With this widespread use of speedier delivery times,
trade in perishable goods as well as in inputs used in just-in-time production
processes has grown. The United States now imports eggs from New Zealand
and electronic components from Malaysia. Exports from the United States,
such as the telecommunications equipment we send to Japan, are also available more quickly to consumers and producers in other countries.
In tandem with these falling communications and transport costs,
international efforts to reduce policy barriers to trade have helped to further
link the economies of different countries. Average tariffs on industrial
goods in developed countries have fallen from 40 percent 50 years ago to
around 4 percent today. Nontariff barriers to trade, such as quotas and some
regulatory barriers, have also been dramatically reduced.

252 | Economic Report of the President

All these changes in transactions costs have profoundly affected
international flows of goods, services, and capital. On a pure volume basis,
global merchandise trade has increased substantially in the last two and a half
decades, growing by 277 percent between 1975 and 2000 (Chart 7-1).
During this same period, U.S. exports grew by around 393 percent, from
$230 billion to $1.1 trillion (in 1996 dollars). The importance of international transactions in relation to overall U.S. economic activity has also
risen. In 1975 total trade (measured as exports plus imports) was equal to less
than 16 percent of GDP, but by 2000 that figure was over 26 percent (Chart
7-2). About 8 percent of the labor force is now engaged in producing goods
and services that will be sold in foreign markets.
The United States trades with many countries around the world. Canada
is our top-ranking trading partner, accounting for 20.3 percent of trade
in 2000 (again measured as exports and imports combined). Mexico
(12.4 percent) and Japan (10.6 percent) rank second and third, respectively.
The countries of the European Union together account for 19.3 percent of
U.S. trade. This concentration of U.S. trade in transactions with other
high-income countries follows a historical pattern. But trade with a broader

Chapter 7

| 253

range of countries already constitutes an important share of our international
transactions, as Mexico’s high ranking demonstrates. And this trade is
growing: trade with low- and middle-income economies grew from $78.5
billion in 1975 to $750.2 billion in 2000.
The reduction in impediments to international transactions has also been
accompanied by changes in the types of goods being traded. Manufactures
have become an increasingly important element of world trade in goods:
their share of world merchandise exports rose from 69.8 percent in 1975 to
74.8 percent in 2000. About 80 percent of both U.S. merchandise exports
and imports in 2000 were manufactured goods; as recently as 1980 only
55 percent of imports and 70 percent of exports consisted of manufactures.
Within manufacturing, certain industries are particularly trade-oriented.
Ranked on the basis of exports as a share of shipments, nonelectrical
machinery and computer and electronic equipment were the leaders. In each
of these industries, exports accounted for 30 percent or more of U.S. firms’
total shipments (Table 7-1).
This increasing importance of manufactures reflects in part another
important change in the nature of U.S. trade: more and more trade now
involves the exchange of intermediate inputs across borders. For example, a

firm may purchase one input to its production from one country, and
another from another country, and assemble the final good at home or even
in a third country. One way to measure such interactions is to look at the
amount of imported inputs used in goods that are in turn reexported. One
study found that, in 1990, such vertical specialization accounted for about
20 percent of all exports in a sample of 14 major trading economies,
including the Group of Seven (G-7) large industrial economies (Canada,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States).
Increases in such vertical trade have been found to account for more than 30
percent of the growth in the ratio of world exports to world GDP. Such trade
may help to enhance the efficiency of producers, since they now have access
to a wider range of input sources than are available domestically. (Box 7-1
discusses the importance of vertical trade in overall U.S. trade.)
Chapter 7

Box 7-1. Vertical Trade and Production Sharing
A large portion of U.S. trade, both imports and exports, is trade in
partially finished products, also called intermediate inputs. Examples
include the steel used in automobile manufacture, and the cloth and
other textiles from which finished apparel is made. This type of trade
goes by many names, such as vertical trade, vertical specialization, and
production sharing, although these terms have somewhat different
meanings. Vertical trade, the broadest category, includes any production process that is not confined to one country. Vertical specialization
is slightly narrower. It is defined as the use of imported inputs to
produce goods that are subsequently exported. Production sharing is
narrower still: imported inputs are used to produce goods that are then
exported to the country from which the inputs came.
Some of these production processes are organized by a single
(vertically integrated) firm, but in a growing number of cases separate
companies in different countries manage different stages of production. In the past, many companies felt that the only way to guarantee
the timely arrival, exact adherence to specifications, or quality of an
intermediate good was to own all the steps on the supply ladder
(hence the name “vertical integration”). For similar reasons, it may
sometimes have been difficult to locate plants overseas. However, the
past decade or so has seen large improvements in the technology
available to coordinate and monitor manufacturing in different parts of
the world. This includes everything from cheaper and better international telephone service to fax machines to Internet-linked
computer-aided design packages. These advances have allowed
companies and countries to specialize in those steps of the production
process that they are best at performing, leading to an increase in
vertical trade.
The extent of vertical trade can be gauged in a number of different
ways. One way is simply to measure the amounts of intermediate
goods that are imported or exported. However, it is sometimes difficult
to decide whether a good should be classified as intermediate, because
this depends on its intended use, which may not be known. Auto tires
are a good example of this. They can be used as an intermediate good
and put on cars to be sold as part of a final product, or they can be sold
in retail stores as a product themselves. The ideal would be to look at
how much of a traded good’s value is added in each of the countries
involved in its production. One measure of this is the imported input
share, that is, the share of the value of production that is attributable to
imported inputs. Another such measure would be the amount of

production sharing, which is defined as U.S. materials shipped abroad
for processing and then sent back to the United States. Note that
production sharing is a special case of vertical trade, since vertical
trade also covers inputs shipped to Mexico or Canada, finished there,
and exported to any country, not just the United States.
The U.S. Government has kept statistics on production sharing since
about 1963. These numbers are collected because products assembled
abroad from U.S. manufactured components qualify for different tariff
treatment: only the portion of the product’s value not accounted for by
U.S. inputs is subject to duties. The tariff provision that governs such
production sharing is number 9802. Two main categories of goods
covered under this provision are goods assembled of U.S.-made
components, and metals. Of course, the data collected do not capture
the entire extent of production sharing, as certain products are exempt
from duties under various agreements such as the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In fact, in the first table below, which
traces U.S. imports from selected economies in the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the total recorded in 2000 fell
from the previous year, possibly because of increased exemption of
goods. In the table, “customs value” is the total value of the goods
imported into the United States, and “U.S. content” is the percentage
of value that comes from U.S. inputs. Therefore, under provision 9802,
duties would only have to be paid on the difference between the
customs value and the value of U.S. components: the value added
abroad. For example, in 2000, the United States imported $1.38 billion
worth of goods from Korea for which a 9802 exemption was claimed.
The U.S. content of those goods totaled 54.6 percent, or $750 million,
and therefore the value added abroad was 45.4 percent, or about $630
million.
In addition to collecting statistics, the U.S. Government occasionally
publishes surveys of developments in production sharing. According
to a recent survey, major industries involved in vertical trade include
the automotive industry and various electronics industries. For
example, the United States imports motor vehicles from Canada
($45.7 billion, or 35 percent of the total), Japan ($34.5 billion, or
27 percent), and Mexico ($21 billion, or 16 percent). Exports of motor
vehicles from Japan, which is not covered by NAFTA, contained U.S.
components comprising 2.4 percent of the value of these imports.
Exports of motor vehicles from Canada and Mexico, however, have
historically contained U.S. components equal to one-quarter and

two-fifths of their value, respectively. (The last years for which such
data are available are 1988 for Canada and 1993 for Mexico. After that,
those countries were covered by free-trade agreements and no longer
recorded values for provision 9802.) And indeed, the United States
exported $17 billion worth of automotive parts to Canada in 2000, and
$7.3 billion to Mexico.
Another sector in which production sharing is prevalent is electronic
products. U.S. content in machinery and electronic products imported
from Mexico under the production sharing provision was $4.9 billion in
2000. As mentioned previously, however, not all production sharing is
captured by provision 9802, as there may be other programs under
which the goods in question get more favorable treatment. Luckily, we
can get a rough idea of the discrepancy through the following calculations. Mexico also collects statistics on U.S. products imported as

inputs to planned exports under its maquiladora and PITEX programs.
The measured value of imports of machinery and electronics
intermediate goods from the United States was $37.2 billion in 2000
(a much larger number than $4.9 billion). Overall, Mexico exports
92 percent of its maquiladora products to the United States, and so one
can estimate that the U.S. content of machinery and electronic
products under all production sharing arrangements was at least
$34.2 billion in 2000. This implies that the 9802 statistics capture only a
small portion of all production sharing between the United States and
Mexico. As an illustration, the second table in this box lists the top 20
production sharing commodities from Mexico. The U.S. content,
measured as a percentage of the final value, is typically quite high.

Interestingly, the often back-and-forth nature of vertical trade means that
a significant portion of the value of U.S. imports simply represents the value
of previous U.S. exports. Many domestically produced goods are shipped
abroad for further processing or assembly and then returned to the United
States, in another illustration of how international trade becomes part of the
overall production process. This is a particularly striking feature of U.S. trade
with Mexico. In 1998, for example, the United States imported $93 billion
worth of goods from Mexico, $27.2 billion of which entered the country
under a special “production sharing” provision of U.S. law that gives dutyfree treatment to the reimportation of goods produced with U.S.
components. Of this $27.2 billion, $14.5 billion (53 percent) represented
the U.S.-made content of these imports. That $14.5 billion also represents at
least 15 percent of all U.S. imports from Mexico.
Lower international transactions costs have facilitated trade in services as
well as in goods. Between 1986 and 2000, total U.S. trade in services grew by
over 200 percent. One reason is that falling communications costs have
allowed many products that were not traded in the past, such as financial
services, to become more readily available on the international market.
U.S. trade in financial services quadrupled between 1986 and 2000, from
$5.1 billion to $21.5 billion. Other categories of U.S. services trade, such as
travel, education, and royalties and license fees, have also greatly increased.

Trends and Composition of Capital Flows
Like trade and services flows, global capital flows have increased
enormously over the past 30 years. These flows represent funds channeled
from savers in one country to borrowers in another. From the end of World
War II through the early 1970s, capital controls in most countries heavily
regulated or even prohibited the international flow of capital. Only when
these controls were liberalized, especially in the late 1970s and early 1980s,
did cross-border financial transactions begin to surge.
Global capital movements can be analyzed in terms of both gross and net
flows. For example, suppose that early in December German residents
purchase $200 worth of U.S. securities from U.S. residents, and that later
that month they sell $50 worth to U.S. residents. Considering only these
transactions, capital flows into the United States from Germany amount to
$150 ($200 in purchases minus $50 in sales). Suppose further that, over the
same month, U.S. residents first purchase $100 worth of German securities
from German residents and then sell them $30 worth. Considering the latter
two transactions, capital flows into Germany from the United States amount
to $70 ($100 in purchases minus $30 in sales). From the perspective of the
United States, net capital inflows amount to $80 ($150 of inflows minus $70
of outflows). One measure of gross capital flows, used in the tables in this
260 | Economic Report of the President

chapter, would sum the capital flows into and out of the United States to
arrive at a total of $220. A broader measure, usually not available from official data sources, would sum all cross-border purchases and sales to arrive at
a total of $380. Regardless of which concept is used, gross capital flows will
be larger than net flows by definition.
Although it may appear that the gross basis overstates the importance of
capital flows, gross flows do measure the amount of international funds
flowing in and out of a country’s financial system. Especially for developing
economies, it is important to know if these flows are so large that they might
overwhelm the capacity of the domestic financial system to process them.
Unfortunately, data on gross capital flows come from different sources and
are often fragmentary. Since cross-border financial transactions are usually
not subject to tariffs or quotas, national authorities have lacked a strong
incentive to document their size. Nonetheless, the IMF estimates that, in the
30 years since 1970, gross capital flows as a percentage of GDP have risen
almost tenfold for the advanced economies and more than fivefold for
developing economies. Table 7-2 presents more recent measures of capital
flows. From 1990 through 2000, estimated capital flows on a gross basis in
advanced economies more than quadrupled.

Capital flows can also be categorized by the nature of the investment being
undertaken. Capital used by a firm in one country to establish a plant in
another is labeled foreign direct investment, as are large purchases of equities
that imply a lasting interest in an enterprise. Purchases of long-term bonds,
money market instruments, and small amounts of equities are labeled portfolio investment. Residual transactions such as loans fall into the category
labeled “other” in Table 7-2. Gross capital flows have shifted toward direct
and portfolio investment in the past decade.
The explosion in gross capital flows obscures the fact that, on a net basis,
capital flows have grown much less rapidly (Table 7-3). This difference in the
two measures means that larger amounts of funds are crossing borders, but
that the balance of inflows and outflows is remaining roughly constant.
These net flows also reflect the balance of domestic saving and investment in
a country. If a country saves more than it invests, the excess savings must go
abroad. Similarly, if a country invests more than what is available from
domestic saving, the extra funds must come from abroad.
These net capital flows are also just the mirror image of the country’s
current account balance, which, roughly speaking, consists of the balance in
its combined goods and services trade and the net flow of income generated
from cross-border investments. A country that sends savings abroad, on net,
is enabling the rest of the world to spend more on that country’s goods and
services than that country is spending on goods and services produced by the
rest of the world; such a country has a current account surplus. A country
that is attracting savings from abroad, on net, is able to spend more on goods
and services produced by the rest of the world than the rest of the world is
spending on goods and services that the country itself produces; that country
has a current account deficit.
Although net capital flows on a global basis have increased relatively little
in recent years, this is not the case for the United States, as Table 7-3 also
shows. The United States recorded large current account deficits over the past
decade, reflecting an increased desire on the part of foreigners to invest in the
United States. The United States also ran large current account deficits in the
1980s. An important source of financing for these deficits was foreign official
purchases of U.S. government debt securities. In the 1990s, however, the
bulk of foreign investment entering the United States consisted of purchases
of private assets. In particular, direct investments in the United States have
shown a very rapid rate of increase over the past several years. In short, rapid
rates of productivity growth and increases in economic activity over the past
decade have made private assets in the United States more attractive for
foreign investors.
Because the world’s developing economies have relatively little capital
compared with the developed economies, there is a presumption that capital

should flow from the latter to the former. Hence capital flows to and from
these developing economies receive much attention. Table 7-3 shows that
these flows have varied enormously over the past decade. In the early 1990s
some developing economies made enormous strides in structural economic
reform and removed restrictions on capital flows, leading to a renewed
interest on the part of international investors. Net flows skyrocketed,
reaching $233 billion in 1996. However, the financial crises that began in
East Asia in 1997 and then occurred in Russia and Brazil in 1998 and 1999
dampened investors’ appetites. Net flows fell to close to zero in 2000 but are
believed to have increased moderately in 2001. A swing in net banking flows
accounts for most of the decline since 1996. This was due to both a decrease
in international bank lending to developing economies and an increase in
deposit outflows from developing economies to international banks. (The
lower international bank lending reflects in part a move from cross-border
lending to more lending by subsidiaries within the countries.) However,
direct investment flows have remained fairly stable over the past 3 years, a
sign that investors are still willing to undertake long-term investments in the
developing economies.
Cumulating net capital flows for a given country and accounting for
changes in the prices of assets held across borders yields the net international
investment position for that country with the rest of the world. For example,
Chapter 7

| 263

suppose that a country begins international transactions with the rest of the
world and for 10 years enjoys net capital inflows of $1 billion a year (possibly
including reinvested earnings). At the end of these 10 years that country’s net
international investment position would show that the rest of the world has
accumulated a total of $10 billion in claims on that country, assuming that
the prices of these claims did not change over the 10-year period. These
claims could be in the form of portfolio investments (if, for example,
investors in the rest of the world bought bonds issued by the country’s corporations) or direct investments (if the rest of the world bought controlling
interests in the country’s corporations).
Table 7-4 indicates that, worldwide, these cross-border claims are quite
large in the aggregate, at over $21 trillion, equal to almost 70 percent of
world GDP. The claims are largely divided among bank loans, equities, and
bonds. Central bank reserves make up a fourth, relatively small category.
These holdings are now much smaller than those of private investors, having
grown at about half the rate of gross capital flows over the last 30 years.

Table 7-4 also indicates that the United States is a party (either a lender or
a borrower) in roughly 80 percent of global cross-border claims. As noted
above, foreign investors have found the U.S. economy very attractive and
have built up their holdings of U.S. assets. At the same time, U.S. citizens
have substantial holdings of foreign assets. Foreign-owned assets in the
United States total $9.4 trillion, and U.S. claims on the rest of the world total
$7.2 trillion, so that the United States is today in the position of a net debtor.
In most cases, transferring capital across borders requires a foreign
exchange transaction, in which the currency of one country is exchanged for
that of another. As capital flows have increased, so has turnover (the total
value of transactions) in the foreign exchange market. Data for foreign
exchange turnover correspond to the broadest measure of capital flows
discussed earlier. There is no attempt to net purchases and sales against each
other, either across trading days or across transactions that finance one
country’s purchases versus those that finance its sales. Since 1989 daily
nominal foreign exchange turnover has more than doubled; it now averages
$1.2 trillion. But turnover has actually fallen since 1998, for two reasons.
One is that the introduction of the euro as the common currency of the
European economic and monetary union means that many cross-border
transactions within Europe no longer require an exchange of currencies, and
the other is that consolidation has occurred in the international banking sector.
Given the annual capital flow data summarized in Table 7-2, the turnover
data suggest that gross flows for the year as a whole are the product of extraordinarily large flows on a daily basis within the year. This provides yet
another explanation for policymakers’ concern that in some cases the sheer
size of these flows could overwhelm the resources of a poorly supervised
financial system in the event of a sharp reversal. This issue is discussed
further later in the chapter.

The Benefits of Globalization
The various trends, described in the previous section, toward increased
interaction between people and firms in different countries—increases in
trade as well as increases in capital flows—are often collectively referred to as
globalization. Each of these forms of globalization, and others such as international migration, benefit the United States in a variety of ways, as this
section will show.

The Benefits of Trade
International trade, both exports and imports, benefits the economy in a
number of different ways. In a general sense, exports benefit the economy
Chapter 7

| 265

because American workers have another market—the global market—in
which they can sell the goods and services they produce. Over 12 million
American jobs are supported by exports. Opening foreign markets for U.S.
producers allows them to expand their output and hire more American
workers. Before the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) went
into effect in 1994, for example, U.S. shipments of assembled motor vehicles
to Mexico were severely hampered by Mexico’s high tariffs and other regulations designed to protect the local automotive industry. Under NAFTA,
Mexico was required to reduce these barriers: in 1998 Mexico eliminated its
tariffs on light trucks produced in the United States, and all remaining
Mexican tariffs on medium and heavy trucks and buses were eliminated on
January 1, 2002. Subsequently, U.S. exports of motor vehicles to Mexico rose
from $975 million in the 5 years preceding NAFTA to $6.6 billion in the
5 years after NAFTA. And this happened despite a major recession in Mexico
following that country’s financial crisis of 1994-95.
The health of many sectors of the American economy depends upon
trade. America’s farmers, for example, rely on sales to foreign markets.
Exports of U.S. agricultural products amounted to $53 billion in 2000, and
roughly 25 percent of cash sales by farmers and ranchers come from sales to
foreign consumers. U.S. agricultural exports support 740,000 American jobs.
Trade also benefits the economy in a number of more specific ways. First,
trade may reduce the prices of some of the goods that we consume. When a
country is closed to trade, domestic consumers are forced to buy only those
goods produced in their home market. Often, however, a producer in
another country is able to produce the same goods more efficiently, that is, at
a lower cost. When trade is open, consumers have the choice of buying the
imported good at the lower price. In addition, now that domestic producers
are competing with imports, they will have greater incentive to produce
using the lowest-cost methods possible. Thus international trade tends to
reduce the prices of some goods traded. Of course, if the United States is
already the lowest-cost producer of a good, domestic consumers will
continue to purchase it from domestic suppliers.
A second specific benefit of trade is that it gives a country’s consumers
access to the many different goods and services produced around the world.
For example, without trade, we would not be able to purchase coffee from
Costa Rica, or enjoy certain fresh tropical fruits year-round. We would not
have access to some products at all, or would be able to consume only the
domestic variety. Similarly, when a firm needs a specialized input for a
production process, trade often allows it to choose from many options available around the world, rather than only those produced at home. This
option allows the firm to produce more efficiently, and be more competitive
internationally, than without this choice.
266 | Economic Report of the President

As a third benefit of international integration, trade helps boost productivity
in the United States. Increased competition from trade provides incentives
for domestic firms to produce using the most efficient, lowest cost methods
possible. Firms that are successful in international competition are likely to
be more productive than those that sell only at home. In fact, recent evidence
shows that exporters tend to be relatively more efficient and to pay higher
wages than nonexporters. One study found that, in 1992, a worker at an
exporting plant earned wages that were 10 percent higher, and nonwage
benefits that were 11 percent higher, than a worker at a nonexporting plant.
Trade also allows the U.S. economy as a whole to specialize in the products
that it is comparatively best at producing. This is because trade between
nations is the international extension of the division of labor. The United
States exports some of the goods and services that it is relatively better at
producing, and receives in exchange goods and services that other countries
are relatively better at producing. For example, the United States exports
manufactured goods that require high levels of technical skill, such as
telecommunications equipment and professional scientific instruments.
Some of these industries, such as electronics and computer equipment, sell at
least a quarter of their merchandise overseas (Table 7-1). This reflects the
relative abundance of highly skilled labor in the United States. U.S. imports,
on the other hand, tend to be in areas such as consumer goods (Chart 7-3).
This specialization of economic activity based on comparative advantage

Chapter 7

| 267

allows the United States as a whole to use its resources most effectively, and it
allows Americans to purchase goods from the world’s best sources of those
goods. Thus both exports and imports are beneficial and help make the
United States a richer and more efficient economy.
Trade also increases productivity because it gives exporters access to a larger
total market. Because some goods, such as automobiles, are produced most
cheaply in large quantities, a larger market may allow exporters to reduce
their production costs through economies of scale. Finally, trade benefits the
economy through the access it provides to foreign technology and ideas. We
can import innovative products from abroad and use them to increase our
own efficiency, or to create even newer technologies, raising the rate of
economic growth.

The Benefits of Capital Flows
Just as trade flows result from individuals and countries seeking to maximize their well-being by exploiting their own comparative advantage, so, too,
are capital flows the result of individuals and countries seeking to make
themselves better off, in this case by moving accumulated assets to wherever
they are likely to be most productive. Increased capital flows benefit both the
lender and the borrower. From the lender’s perspective, cross-border capital
flows provide an opportunity to diversify an investment portfolio. To the
extent that returns on international assets do not move in lockstep with
returns on domestic assets, diversification through cross-border investments
both increases expected returns and lowers risk. These benefits lie behind the
large increases in capital flows documented earlier in the chapter. The
“home bias” to investment portfolios is falling: whereas in the late 1980s only
6 percent of U.S. residents’ equity holdings were in foreign assets, more
recent estimates put that share at more than 10 percent. Even that, however,
is below the percentage that most models of optimal portfolio selection
would predict.
For the borrower, cross-border capital flows allow for an expansion of
production possibilities. Lending from abroad allows more capital to be
combined with other inputs to increase the production of valuable goods and
services. Some of the increase in output will be used to pay back the lender,
but a substantial fraction should contribute to a rise in domestic standards of
living. This is particularly important for developing economies, where overseas capital effectively substitutes for or augments often-scarce domestic
sources of investment. Capital inflows can help keep domestic interest
rates low, making sure that government borrowing to finance programs for
education and health care does not crowd out private domestic investment.
Capital flows also boost efficiency in the borrowing country. New ideas
and techniques accompany capital flows across borders, allowing for a more
268 | Economic Report of the President

efficient allocation of resources within the country. Such knowledge transfers
boost productivity in the receiving country, allowing for more rapid technological economic progress there. This is most evident in the case of foreign
direct investment, where new plants and new management methods can lead
to sharp increases in output. Capital inflows also help expand and diversify
the financial system in the recipient country, and this, too, leads to a more
efficient allocation of capital and faster growth.
The increases in economic well-being associated with increased capital
flows require a supportive domestic environment. Without this support,
capital flows can reverse themselves sharply, imposing large adjustment costs
on the borrowing economy. The risks of a reversal are heightened if the
borrowing economy is pursuing unsound macroeconomic policies, or if
supervision of the financial system is inadequate.
Quantifying the positive relationship between increased capital flows and
faster growth is difficult, for several reasons. First, poor macroeconomic or
regulatory policies may render some countries unable to harness investment
capital in ways that promote sustainable growth. Second, causation between
capital flows and economic growth is likely to run both ways. An increase in
capital available to an economy will boost growth, but as an economy grows,
it is more likely to attract foreign capital. This confronts economists with a
chicken-and-egg question: which came first, the capital flows or the growth?
Recent empirical research has struggled with these problems but, on balance,
concludes that the increased capital flows brought about by capital liberalization spur economic growth. All else being equal, a country that opens up
to capital flows can expect to enjoy an increase in its growth rate per capita of
half a percentage point or more per year. For example, if an economy is
growing at an annual rate of 2 percent, opening up to capital flows would
allow its economy to double in size 7 years sooner than otherwise.
There is every reason to expect that in the long run international capital
flows will continue to increase in importance, as economies around the
world become more interlinked. Continued increases in trade volumes,
discussed earlier in the chapter, will require capital flows to finance them.
Investors will continue to obtain the benefits of diversification from
increasing their international exposures. And, as we have seen, the average
investor is still a long way from holding an optimally diversified international
portfolio. Finally, although world living standards are improving on average,
both the relative and the absolute gap in incomes per capita between rich and
poor countries continue to increase. This gap indicates that the rate of return
on capital in the world’s poor economies is likely to be several times that in
the rich economies, providing an enormous incentive for continued—and
indeed, augmented—flows. Of course, this will only be true to the extent that
productivity gains achieved in the developed economies can be transferred
across borders. And most important, it requires that the least developed
Chapter 7

| 269

economies have sound policies and educated work forces in place, to make
effective use of the capital coming in.

The Role of Migration
Migration is another important aspect of the internationalization of the
economy. Just as trade in goods, services, and capital allows resources to be
used most efficiently, so, too, the movement of people from country to
country around the world can enable them to make the best use of their skills
and abilities. Thus removal of barriers to immigration allows for more
efficient worldwide distribution of workers.
The United States has a long history of accepting people from other
countries, as witnessed by the numbers collected by the Bureau of the Census
on the foreign-born population. In 2000 foreign-born residents made up
10.4 percent of the U.S. population (although in 1900 they represented an
even greater 13.6 percent). Immigrants have been a key building block for
the U.S. economy. Our openness to immigration has allowed us to reap the
benefits of the presence of newcomers from many countries.
Immigrants benefit the economy in several ways. First, people are a
resource, similar to the other resources of our economy such as land or
minerals. Immigrants who come to the United States to work allow the
country to produce more. It has been estimated that if immigrants make up
10 percent of the population, the net overall gain from their presence is
somewhere between 0.01 and 0.14 percent of GDP per year. Given that, in
2000, U.S. GDP was $9.9 trillion, the overall gain is between $1 billion and
$14 billion.
The increase in the labor force from immigration also affects prices. The
goods and services that immigrants produce tend to become cheaper as more
immigrants enter, and all consumers benefit from this reduction in prices.
This price drop is an average price drop across all goods and services. Some
goods and services—in particular, those that use a lot of unskilled labor—
will see sharper drops in prices than others. Household services and services
to dwellings are examples. On the other hand, the prices of goods and
services that use less unskilled labor are likely to fall by less or stay the same,
and may even increase.
Legal immigrants who work may also contribute to government finances by
paying taxes on the wages they earn. Because they tend to be younger workers,
immigration also improves the current balance sheet of Social Security. Of
course, legal immigrants may receive welfare benefits, which impose a cost on
the government and taxpayers. Recent research provides some estimates on
the balance between taxes that immigrants pay and the benefits they receive.
These calculations indicate the ultimate effect on taxpayers of a given legal
immigrant now and into the future, taking account of the effects of that
270 | Economic Report of the President

specific immigrant on taxes and benefits, as well as the effects of his or her
children into the future. Overall, according to this research, the average
immigrant makes a net positive fiscal contribution of about $80,000.

Some Myths About Trade and Globalization
Although globalization, by increasing the movement of goods and services,
capital, and people across the Nation’s borders, has provided a variety of
benefits to the United States, many have expressed concerns about globalization’s effects, both in the United States and abroad. This section reviews some
of those concerns and explains why globalization is, in fact, unlikely to have
the adverse effects often feared.

Trade and the Environment
A variety of concerns have been raised about the impact of globalization
on the environment. One is that government action to implement domestic
environmental regulations may be interpreted in other countries as protectionism and, consequently, in violation of trade agreements that the United
States has entered into. Domestic environmental regulations may then be
challenged, and the case adjudicated by international dispute settlement
mechanisms. The concern is that the United States might be forced to
change or eliminate its own environmental standards.
In fact, environmental regulations do not normally raise issues of
consistency with international trade agreements, which are aimed at
preventing discrimination against foreign products, not at lowering environmental standards. There is generally no reason for environmental regulations
to lead to discrimination against or among foreign products. If a product is
judged to inflict environmental harm, its production and use are normally
regulated, or prohibited, without regard to its origin; if this is the case, such
regulations are unlikely to breach international trade obligations. Even if they
did, international trade agreements contain exceptions that allow a country
to take environmental measures against imported products that might
otherwise violate obligations under the agreement.
For example, Article XX of the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade—one of the agreements among members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO)—lists a number of general exceptions to members’
obligations. One of these confirms that a WTO member may adopt and
enforce measures “necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health”
or “relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources.” These
exceptions are subject to a number of conditions, among them that the
measures not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate among countries and
Chapter 7

| 271

that they not constitute a disguised restriction on international trade.
(NAFTA incorporates similar exceptions and conditions.) Thus, nothing in
these international agreements prevents the United States from establishing
and maintaining legitimate environmental measures, so long as it does so
in a way that does not unjustifiably discriminate against its trading partners
or create unnecessary barriers to trade. In fact, the General Accounting
Office concluded in 2000 that, “The WTO rulings to date against U.S.
environmental measures have not weakened U.S. environmental protections.”
Other concerns about globalization may stem from the fear that growth in
developing countries resulting from increased trade may lead to environmental degradation. But in fact, there is no clear relationship between
development and pollution levels. Indeed, some evidence shows that organic
water pollution intensity falls substantially as a country’s income per capita
rises from $500 to $20,000, with the decline beginning before the country
reaches high-income status (about $10,000 in annual income per capita).
Trade may also give countries access to cleaner technologies, allowing them
to build their industries in a more environmentally sound fashion.

Trade and Employment
Some argue that globalization leads to the loss of jobs for American
workers. It is true that some domestic firms will not be able to compete effectively with imports, and these firms may be forced to reduce their work force
or even cease operations. At the same time, however, the opportunity for
increased trade will lead other firms to expand their operations and increase
hiring, in order to serve the international market as exporters. These firms
tend to be the more productive ones in the economy. Exporters also tend to
pay higher wages than firms that do not export—in 1992, up to 18 percent
higher on a simple average basis, according to one study.
It is also true that the firms forced by import competition to eliminate jobs
may be in different sectors from the exporters who are increasing hiring. This
can make it difficult for those who lose their jobs to import competition to
find new jobs with exporting firms that use the skills they have acquired. But
such shifts in employment also reflect one of the benefits of trade for the
aggregate economy, namely, that it allows the economy to produce the goods
and services that it is comparatively best at producing, and to buy from other
countries those goods and services that it is relatively ill equipped to produce.
The expansion of trade that may precipitate such a shift of workers may, as a
result, lead to an increase in the average income of the American worker,
because wages in import-competing industries tend to be below the average,
whereas wages in exporting industries tend to be above the average. Workers
in export-competing industries such as aircraft and pharmaceuticals earned
about 22 to 60 percent more than the average wage in 2000. The reverse is
272 | Economic Report of the President

true for import-competing industries: wages in the apparel industry, for
example, were 36 percent lower than the average in manufacturing, those in
the leather industry were 29 percent lower, and those in the textile industry
35 percent lower.
The shifting of jobs across sectors may take time, and some workers may
face dislocation. However, the displacement of some workers by imports
should not be an excuse for discouraging trade, any more than the costs to
some workers of technological change should stop the development of innovations. It would have made little sense to discourage the diffusion of
personal computers just because it jeopardized the workers of typewriter
manufacturers. Imposing trade restrictions in an effort to save those jobs will
only destroy, or prevent the creation of, jobs in other sectors. If, for example,
government-imposed trade barriers were to hinder access to imported capital
goods, the domestic firms that purchase those inputs would be forced to
operate at higher costs of production. This would adversely affect their
competitive position relative to foreign rivals who have free access to such
capital goods. Domestic producers might lose sales, and this might force
them to downsize their work forces, or even to shift production to locations
abroad where the inputs are freely available.
Of course, finding a new job in another firm or another industry, after
losing one’s job to import competition, may be difficult. The Federal
Government recognizes this possibility and has put programs in place to
assist those who lose their jobs because of trade in finding new ones, and to
provide them with financial assistance while they make the transition. For
example, the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program provides training,
job search aid, and relocation allowances; these benefits are on top of unemployment insurance and other programs. In 1999 close to 130,000 workers
were estimated to be in groups certified as eligible for TAA. This
Administration is committed to reauthorizing and improving existing TAA
programs that are due to expire. The Administration worked during 2001 to
strengthen the performance of these programs, so that they are more effective
at easing the transition into new employment. In addition, for certain sensitive sectors such as textiles and agriculture, trade liberalization is designed to
proceed in gradual stages so that workers have more time to adjust.

Trade and Relative Wages
Over the last three decades, the returns to education, in the form of
higher wages, have increased dramatically, although the rise has flattened out
in more recent years. In 1979 a male with a college degree could command a
30 percent wage premium over a male with only a high school diploma. This
premium had risen to 60 percent by 1995 but has remained relatively
constant since then. Because workers with less education often work in
Chapter 7

| 273

industries that compete most closely with imports, particularly those from
developing countries, some have blamed increased trade for these changes in
wages. However, although the United States did increase its imports from
developing countries over this period, it also experienced a great deal of
technological change, which increased demand for workers with higher skill
levels. This tends to increase the relative wages of those with higher skill
levels. In fact, it appears that this increased demand for more educated
workers, and not increased trade with developing countries, has led to the
recent change in relative wages.

The Effects of Trade on Developing Nations
Some have suggested that international trade may harm workers in developing countries, because countries like the United States import goods
produced under poor working conditions or at very low wages. Those who
hold this position argue that the United States should use trade measures,
such as withholding access to our markets, as a weapon to force developing
countries to improve working standards or to increase wages.
The use of trade policy to force such changes, however, would have
perverse effects, actually hurting those it aims to help. For example, if the
United States and other countries refused to import from countries where
wages are below a certain standard, workers in those countries would be
denied the opportunity to work in an export-producing industry.
Unfortunately, jobs in other industries may not be readily available in that
country, or if they are, may pay even lower wages and impose even worse
working conditions.
In addition, to cut off imports from such countries may be to deny them
one of their best opportunities for economic growth. A number of recent
studies show that participation in an open trading system has a positive effect
on a country’s income per capita. One study finds that increasing the ratio of
trade to GDP by 1 percentage point raises income per capita by 1.5 to 2
percent, and an increase in average incomes is generally associated with
higher incomes for the poor. Several studies by the World Bank also point to
a linkage between trade liberalization and faster economic growth, as liberalization encourages higher rates of investment and more rapid technological
innovation. Thus, limiting trade with developing countries may only serve to
keep the poor in their poverty. Perhaps because of the negative effects of
linking trade and labor outcomes, many developing countries are strongly
opposed to including discussions on labor standards in international trade
negotiations.
Many countries, including the United States, do adhere to certain core
labor standards, such as the prohibition of exploitative child labor. Trade in
and of itself does not cause poor working conditions. Rather, they are more
274 | Economic Report of the President

likely to be the result of domestic policies and economic circumstances. In
fact, trade may help to improve working conditions, just as it may facilitate
an increase in incomes. Benjamin Franklin summarized it well: “No nation
was ever ruined by trade.”

International Policy Issues and the
Role of International Institutions
An important factor in the continued worldwide growth in trade and
capital flows has been the creation and development of international institutions dedicated to promoting that growth. The United States is a participant
in these institutions and has benefited from their important work. The
United States has also participated in recent efforts to reform some of
these institutions. The present section discusses some of the most important
of these organizations and recent proposals for their reform.

International Trade Institutions and the Benefits
of Trade
International trade institutions and agreements are designed to ensure that
all parties are able to enjoy the benefits of free and open trade. These institutions allow many countries to negotiate together to reduce barriers to trade in
ways that are acceptable to all. They also create a stable framework for international transactions. If progress is to continue toward the goal of increased
trade, it is crucial that the United States encourage its trading partners to
maintain the focus of trade negotiations on this main purpose, rather than
stray into areas, often very controversial, that could stall greater progress
toward free trade.
The international trade agreements in which the United States has
participated can be classified into several broad types. Those of the first type
are called multilateral agreements, in which a large number of countries
around the world agree to reduce barriers to trade among themselves. As a
rule, agreements of this type, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT), are structured such that each participating country agrees to
reduce trade impediments to all other participants. One of the foundations
of the GATT/WTO system is the most-favored-nation (MFN) principle,
which mandates that if a WTO member extends any benefit (such as a
reduction in tariffs) to a product of another WTO member, it must extend
the same benefit to like products of all other members.
A second type of trade agreement is the regional trade agreement,
examples of which include NAFTA and the trade agreements of the
Chapter 7

| 275

European Union. In such agreements, each participant agrees to reduce
trade barriers only with respect to the other participating countries in the
region. So, for example, in NAFTA, the United States reduced its barriers to
Mexican and Canadian exports but made no such changes for exports of
European or Asian countries. (Such favorable treatment of regional trade
might seem to violate the MFN principle for countries that are WTO
members; however, Article XXIV of the 1994 GATT explicitly allows for
such regional agreements under certain conditions.)
Although regional agreements generally make good progress toward free
trade among the participants, they may introduce some distortions in trade
patterns. A country may end up importing goods from a country in the
region that has high costs of production but is subject to a low tariff, rather
than from one outside the region (or a nonparticipant within the region) that
has a low cost of production but faces a high tariff. Such trade patterns
(called trade diversion) may hinder the most efficient use of global resources.
However, an advantage of regional trade agreements over multilateral
agreements is that a smaller group of countries may find it easier to come to
a consensus on trade liberalization. Also, if the agreement is among countries
that would naturally engage in a great deal of trade with each other in the
absence of artificial barriers to trade (for example, countries in close
geographical proximity to each other), the amount of trade diversion may
be very small.
The WTO has reported a massive proliferation of regional trade
agreements in recent years, with an average of one per month being notified
to the organization. A recent study by the WTO Secretariat identified a total
of 172 regional trade agreements currently in force (including some that have
not, or not yet, been notified to the WTO), and this number could well
grow to about 250 by 2005. On the basis of the 113 regional trade agreements notified to the WTO and deemed to be in force as of July 2000, it is
estimated that some 43 percent of world trade occurs within such agreements. This share would rise to 51 percent if all 68 or so of the regional trade
agreements currently under discussion and scheduled to be in force by 2005
were already in place.
Economists are divided as to whether regional agreements help or hinder
progress toward broader, multilateral agreements. On the one hand, negotiation
over regional proposals may divert negotiating resources from multilateral
talks, or a proliferation of different regulations under various regional agreements may raise transactions costs for trade. On the other hand, if all
countries engage in regional agreements, there will be competition to get the
best trade deals, and this competition can lead to bidding down barriers to
free trade. It may also be easier for a small country to get larger countries to
recognize and understand its needs in a regional than in a multilateral setting.
276 | Economic Report of the President

Finally, a third type of trade agreement is the bilateral trade agreement,
such as the recent agreement between the United States and Jordan. Others
include the agreement between the United States and Israel and that between
Canada and Chile. Such agreements have pros and cons similar to those of
regional agreements.
The United States benefits significantly from its participation in
international trade institutions, for a number of reasons. For one, because
U.S. tariffs on imports are already among the lowest in the world, any agreements to further liberalize trade will likely lower other countries’ tariffs more
than they lower U.S tariffs. U.S. tariffs average about 2.5 percent on comparable, trade-weighted terms (Chart 7-4), but U.S. producers face extremely
high tariffs in many developing countries. For example, average tariffs on
U.S.-produced goods are 13.7 percent in Brazil, roughly 17 percent in
Thailand, and up to 35 percent in India. (The numbers for Brazil and
Thailand are average applied rates; that is, they are averaged over all imports
from the United States. The rate for India is a ceiling rate, which means that
no tariff is supposed to be higher than 35 percent. However, because of
exceptions put in by the Indian government, the applied rate could be
higher.) Many of the United States’ trading partners, including the European
Union and Japan, maintain high barriers on a range of agricultural goods.

Chapter 7

| 277

Thus, multilateral agreements on tariff reduction often disproportionately
benefit U.S. exporters.
However, tariffs are not the only artificial barriers to trade. Other barriers
include quotas (quantitative limits on import volumes), technical regulations
and standards (such as for telecommunications equipment), rules for the
valuation of goods subject to tariffs (which affect how the tariffs are calculated), and rules regarding investment (for example, limiting the percentage
of foreign ownership of a domestic company). Unfortunately, whatever their
stated purpose, such rules are often in fact designed to protect domestic
industries from foreign competition. The United States faces discriminatory
regulations in many countries. Discriminatory foreign health and safety
regulations cost the United States over $5 billion in agricultural exports in
1996, according to the Department of Agriculture.
To circumvent this problem, most trade agreements establish the principle
of nondiscrimination, or national treatment. This means that all countries
that are parties to the agreement must treat the exports of other parties as if
they were domestically produced. Since many international agreements now
include provisions on regulatory barriers and government procurement
policy, this requirement allows U.S. exporters to avoid such impediments in
other countries. As tariffs fall, these kinds of negotiations become increasingly important to the opening of markets.
The United States has participated in a number of different trade
institutions and agreements over the years. For example, the United States
was a member of the GATT from its inception in 1948 until 1995, when the
WTO was formed. Until the WTO came into being, the GATT was both
the agreement (which is still in effect) and the international organization
formed on an ad hoc basis to support it. The United States benefited significantly from the outcome of the Uruguay Round, a recent major round of
multilateral negotiations under the auspices of the GATT. The reduction in
U.S. tariffs that emerged from that agreement had an effect on an average
American household of four similar to a tax cut of $310 a year, or the equivalent of a per-year income gain of more than $600.
The WTO is an international institution in which the United States
negotiates agreements with 143 other members to reduce barriers to trade. In
addition, the WTO maintains a forum for dispute settlement that enables its
members to resolve trade disputes arising under the WTO agreements. At
the fourth WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha, Qatar, in 2001, the
members of the WTO agreed to launch a work program that includes
further negotiations on trade liberalization. Negotiations will commence in a
number of areas, including agriculture, services, industrial market access, a
limited set of environmental issues, antidumping and subsidies, and WTO
dispute settlement rules; it will also include important work on trade-related
capacity building for developing countries. Members also committed
278 | Economic Report of the President

themselves to maintain their current practice of not imposing customs duties
on electronic transmissions at least until the Fifth Session of the Ministerial
Conference, which is likely to occur in 2003. Negotiations on certain issues,
such as investment and competition policy, are delayed until that conference.
Some of the issues slated for negotiation have proved particularly difficult
to deal with in the past, suggesting that gains from the new WTO agenda
could be large. The new work program will address market access barriers to
trade in agricultural products as well as government subsidies in this sector.
Some countries, such as those of the European Union, rely heavily on export
subsidies. The potential gains to the United States from these discussions are
indeed sizable, in part because the multilateral negotiations promise to
reduce barriers to U.S. trade around the entire world. One study finds that if
a new trade round reduced world barriers on agricultural and industrial
products and on trade in services by one-third, the gains to the United States
could amount to $177 billion, or about $2,500 for the average American
family of four.
The United States is also a founding member of the Participants to the
Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits, an
independent body within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD). The arrangement was established in 1978 to limit
the terms and conditions under which governments can finance their
exports, with the goal of opening export markets by eliminating official
financing subsidies. Financing subsidies close markets by eliminating competition on the basis of price, quality, and service and directing business to
those countries willing to spend budget resources to provide below-market
export financing. The arrangement is currently operated by 24 OECD
member governments and governs official export credits totaling $45 billion
in 2000, as well as aid financing of about $9 billion to $10 billion a year.
The WTO leaves much of the discipline for such indirect subsidization to
the OECD Arrangement, and therefore the U.S. antisubsidy efforts in the
OECD are complementary to its broader WTO work to eliminate subsidies.
The Treasury Department estimates that OECD disciplines over aid
financing subsidies alone have opened export markets worth $5 billion to $6
billion annually, leading to increased U.S. exports of about $1 billion each
year. The overall U.S. budget savings from all OECD disciplines on
financing subsidies amount to around $300 million a year.
NAFTA has been another important example of U.S. participation in
international trade institutions. From 1994, when NAFTA went into effect,
until 2000, total trade among the United States, Mexico, and Canada
increased from $297 billion to $676 billion, or 128 percent. The share of
worldwide U.S. goods exports that has gone to NAFTA partners more
than doubled over the same period, from 14 percent to 37 percent. Trade
restrictions imposed on U.S. exports by our NAFTA partners have fallen
Chapter 7

| 279

significantly. For example, in 1993 Mexico’s average tariffs on U.S. goods
were more than twice as high as U.S. tariffs on Mexican goods. Under
NAFTA, Mexico’s average tariff on U.S. exports has fallen below 2 percent,
and two-thirds of U.S. exports now enter Mexico duty-free. Nearly all of
the $406 billion in goods traded between the United States and Canada
enters duty-free.
The United States has benefited from this agreement, which when fully
implemented will, according to some estimates, yield an increase in U.S.
GDP of between 0.1 percent and 0.5 percent, or between $10 billion and
$50 billion relative to the size of the economy in 2000. For an average household of four, this translates into a per-year income gain of $140 to $720. The
NAFTA liberalization is also roughly equivalent to a tax cut of $210 for the
same family. U.S. producers of various commodities also benefit from
NAFTA. Exports of beef and processed tomatoes to Canada, as well as of
cattle, dairy products, apples, and pears to Mexico, are 15 percent higher
than they would have been had the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, and
later NAFTA, not reduced barriers to U.S. goods in those markets, according
to the Department of Agriculture.
The United States is currently involved in efforts to liberalize trade with a
larger number of our hemispheric neighbors. Discussions toward a Free
Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) began at the Summit of the Americas in
Miami in December 1994. Thirty-four countries agreed to construct a freetrade area in which barriers to trade and investment would be progressively
eliminated, and to complete negotiations toward the agreement by 2005.
The FTAA thus aims to establish free trade across the Western Hemisphere,
from Hudson Bay to Tierra del Fuego. The nine FTAA negotiating groups
cover a range of areas, including market access, agriculture, services, investment, intellectual property, government procurement, competition policy,
dispute settlement, and antidumping, countervailing duties, and subsidies.
The potential market that an FTAA would create is enormous: the
combined GDPs of Central and South America amount to $1.57 trillion.
(This figure leaves out Mexico, as it is already covered under NAFTA.) And
the obstacles currently faced by American exporters in Latin America
are formidable, particularly since other countries in the region already
have negotiated reductions in barriers with each other. For example, when
Chile and Canada recently concluded their bilateral free-trade agreement,
Chile’s across-the-board 8 percent tariff was eliminated on Canada’s
exports, but it remains in effect on U.S. exports. Under the MERCOSUR
trade arrangement—a customs area agreement signed in 1991 among
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay—imports and exports among
these four countries and Chile are largely duty-free; U.S. exporters to those
countries face average tariffs of almost 15 percent. The FTAA promises to
eliminate the discrimination against U.S. products in these markets.
280 | Economic Report of the President

The importance of breaking down barriers throughout the hemisphere is
epitomized by the experience of Caterpillar Inc. Caterpillar’s motor graders
made in the United States for export to Chile face nearly $15,000 in tariffs.
Yet when Caterpillar manufactures motor graders in Brazil for export to
Chile, the tariff is just $3,700. And if Caterpillar’s competitors were to
produce a similar product in Canada, it could be exported to Chile duty-free
under the Canada-Chile free-trade agreement. One result of these high trade
barriers against the United States may be to create incentives for U.S. firms to
locate factories abroad.
If an FTAA were to eliminate barriers to trade in agricultural and
industrial goods and in services among the countries in the hemisphere, the
United States could reap a gain of $53 billion, according to one study. An
FTAA would also promote greater economic integration and regional cooperation, bringing greater economic opportunity and political stability to the
region. Negotiations toward this agreement continue.
As this review has shown, past U.S. participation in international trade
institutions and agreements has benefited the United States significantly. Our
continued ability to exercise effective leadership in trade negotiations,
however, depends on restoration of the President’s Trade Promotion
Authority (TPA). TPA allows the President to submit a negotiated trade
agreement to Congress subject to an up-or-down vote, without amendments. Congress retains the final decision on whether or not the United
States signs any trade agreement, but TPA provides the President with more
negotiating leverage and gives the United States enhanced credibility in
negotiations with its trading partners.
TPA has a long history. In the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act,
Congress for the first time agreed to give its prior approval to any trade agreement reached by the executive, although it did require that the negotiating
authority be renewed every 3 years. Although the Trade Act of 1974 required
that Congress approve trade agreements after their negotiation, it also
provided a “fast-track” procedure in which Congress would vote in a timely
fashion and without amending the agreement. This fast-track procedure has
been used to pass legislation implementing the United States’ most recent
important international trade agreements, including NAFTA in 1993 and
the Uruguay Round of the GATT in 1994. These procedures, however,
lapsed in 1994 and have not been renewed.

Role and Reform of International
Financial Institutions
International financial institutions (IFIs) exist to help countries cope with
short-term balance of payments problems and address longer term development challenges. Capital flows have played an increasingly important role in
Chapter 7

| 281

both these areas, calling for policy responses from countries and from the
IFIs themselves.
As already noted, capital flows represent a transfer of resources across time,
as savers lend to borrowers today in exchange for repayment plus interest or
dividends tomorrow. Increased uncertainty about those repayments can
render unattractive an investment that was once attractive. In particular,
changes in economic policies or political developments can cause investors to
sharply reevaluate the prospects for future payments. Thus their very
forward-looking nature can make capital flows subject to abrupt reversals.
Sharp reversals of international capital flows have occurred many times in
history. The United States in the 1800s was a developing economy that
benefited from European capital inflows. Financial disruptions in the 1850s,
1870s, and 1890s were associated with sharp reversals in these flows. The
same situation played out in Latin America in the 1930s. As capital markets
collapsed with the onset of the worldwide depression, governments in the
region were hit particularly hard. By 1935 almost 70 percent of Latin
American national government bonds were in default.
More recently, the emerging market debt crisis in the 1980s was another
example of a sharp reversal in capital flows. Rising real interest rates associated with the effort to contain global inflationary pressures made investment
projects in developing economies look less attractive. This reversal of capital
flows led to a “lost decade” for the Latin American economies until expectations improved when new policies involving structural reform were put in
place. Most recently, the crises of the 1990s—in Mexico in 1994-95, East
Asia in 1997-98, and Russia and Brazil in 1998-99—again demonstrated
how investments based on forward-looking calculations of risk and expected
return can quickly reverse, especially when weaknesses in the recipient
country’s policy framework are exposed.
These abrupt reversals in capital flows are extremely costly. The withdrawal
of foreign investment drives up interest rates in the borrowing country,
retards domestic investment, and often leads to a sharp contraction in
economic activity and a shrinking of future production possibilities. The
balance sheets of domestic firms that depended on these flows are
considerably weakened, and there is often a wrenching reallocation of
domestic resources away from the nontradable goods sector to the tradable
sector, to accomplish the current account adjustment necessitated by the
drop in capital flows.
Finally, many of the world’s poorest economies, plagued by years of
economic mismanagement, have had little access to private capital flows
of any kind. Investors are unwilling to extend loans without some prospect of
repayment. But the possibility of repayment is bleak given an unstable
system of governance that cannot guarantee property rights, or establish the
necessary legal, financial, and physical infrastructure that would foster the
282 | Economic Report of the President

productivity of their citizens. Often, the result is a cruel paradox: the countries most in need of capital—and that might offer the highest potential rates
of return on that capital, were the proper policies in place—are precisely the
ones with the least access to international capital flows.

The Evolution of Today’s International Financial Institutions
Two of today’s principal IFIs were created as part of the post-World War II
international financial arrangements that came to be known as the Bretton
Woods system. Chief among the IFIs is the International Monetary Fund,
established in 1945. One of the original goals of the IMF was to provide
short-term loans to countries to help with balance of payments adjustment.
Under the system of pegged (but adjustable) exchange rates in place from the
late 1940s until 1971, it was expected that countries on occasion would
require help to manage a set of macroeconomic policies that was inconsistent
with the country’s fixed exchange rate. The usual manifestation of this inconsistency was a current account deficit that could not be offset by private
capital flows at the prevailing exchange rate. One alternative in such a situation would be to devalue the domestic currency in an effort to close the
current account deficit. However, following a series of such devaluations in
the 1930s in which countries essentially competed for trade advantage, the
IMF was created to provide short-term funding to countries in such distress.
This funding was meant to provide countries with the breathing room necessary to implement a more rational set of macroeconomic policies that would
allow them to avoid the devaluation option.
With the abandonment of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange
rates in the early 1970s, the IMF essentially lost its original role. Over the
past 25 years, the IMF’s mandate has broadened to include promoting international monetary cooperation and orderly exchange arrangements with the
aim of fostering economic growth. To carry out this mandate, the IMF
undertakes surveillance of the macroeconomic policies of its 183 member
economies and provides them financial and technical assistance. In this
sense, the IMF no longer functions merely as a crisis lender to economies
facing balance of payments adjustments. The IMF has also become involved
in supporting development programs, aiding the world’s most impoverished
countries through loans, help in devising a macroeconomic policy framework,
and technical assistance.
The IFIs also include what are known as the multilateral development
banks (MDBs), of which the World Bank Group is the largest. The World
Bank was established in 1945 and had its initial focus on the reconstruction
efforts following World War II. As Europe and Japan rebuilt, that focus
shifted toward development, targeting the poorest countries, which were
unable to obtain access to private international capital flows. The late 1950s
saw the creation of the Inter-American Development Bank, the first of four
Chapter 7

| 283

regional MDBs. Together the MDBs worked toward the goal of financing
the development of the world’s poorest economies. However, during the
crises of the 1980s and 1990s the scope of the MDBs’ mission was
broadened, and, often encouraged by governments in the developed
economies, they participated in the financial crisis lending packages organized primarily by the IMF. Thus the missions of the IMF and the MDBs
have sometimes overlapped, with the IMF providing some nonemergency
financing for developing economies and the MDBs contributing to crisis
financing packages.

Performance of the International Financial Institutions
in the 1990s
The turmoil in the international financial system in the second half of the
1990s indicated a shift in the nature of financial crises. The increase in the
size of capital flows during the 1990s, documented earlier in this chapter, led
to larger, more sudden crises when those flows reversed. These crises also
appeared harder to contain, and the result often was large-scale IMF lending.
The nature of these new crises focused attention on the role of the IFIs and
raised key questions for policymakers. First and foremost, were the resources
of the IFIs adequate to deal with these crises? Second, was the provision of
assistance itself encouraging further crises? And finally, were countries
becoming overly dependent on crisis financing provided by the IFIs?
From the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s, the IMF’s resources available
for crisis lending (also called its available liquidity) were adequate. However,
over the 6-year period beginning in 1995, the average size of IMF stand-by
arrangements (traditional lending programs), relative to the recipient
country’s IMF quota, more than tripled compared with the 6 years beginning
in 1989. This is not surprising given the increase in gross capital flows over
the 1990s. The new type of crisis was met with a larger official sector
response. As a result, it became clear that, in the second half of the 1990s,
IMF resources were shrinking relative to private financial flows. This was
especially apparent during the Asian financial crisis, when IMF available
liquidity fell to $56 billion in December 1997 from $83 billion the year
before. By December 1998, available liquidity had dwindled to $54 billion.
Over the mid- to late 1990s, as crises developed and the size of IMF assistance programs increased, policymakers began to revisit the concern that the
provision of official assistance was contributing to the development of new
crises. The logic in support of such a proposition emphasizes the expectations
of private investors. If investors come to expect that countries will automatically receive assistance in the event of a financial crisis, they are likely to
exercise less prudence when making loans. Countries that are pursuing
unsound policies may still get loans from private investors, since the investors
believe that any future problems are likely to be resolved by the provision of
284 | Economic Report of the President

funds by the IFIs. This is an example of moral hazard: an increase in risky
behavior (in this case on the part of the borrowing countries and their
lenders) when insurance or a guarantee is provided (in this case by the IMF).
Thus the concern is that IFI support can encourage risky activity on the part
of private lenders and borrowing countries, which often ends badly in further
rounds of crises.
The resolution of the crises of the late 1990s was also complicated by a
shift in the composition of capital flows away from syndicated bank loans
toward bond issuance. Such a shift protected the banking and payments
systems of the industrial countries from the worst consequences of international financial crises. However, it also complicated the task of crisis
resolution, because restructuring a country’s debt now required dealing with
a large number of bondholders spread around the world, rather than a small
group of bank creditors. When a country’s creditors are few in number, it
may prove possible to coordinate an orderly restructuring that does little to
interrupt economic activity (although this proved surprisingly difficult with
bank loans to Latin American governments in the 1980s). But when the
lenders are a large, diffuse group of bondholders, an orderly restructuring
may be next to impossible. In fact, the switch from bank finance in the
1980s to bond finance in the 1990s in part may have reflected efforts by
creditors to safeguard their positions by making such a restructuring more
difficult for borrowers. In addition, the shift from bank to bond finance is
part of a larger trend, seen not just internationally but in domestic capital
markets as well, away from financial intermediaries to direct finance.

Efforts to Reform the International Financial System
As early as 1995, following the Mexican crisis, it became clear to
international policymakers that the set of policies and institutions collectively
known as the international financial system might be in need of overhaul,
especially the IFIs themselves. Various official bodies commissioned reports
that examined ways in which the system could be improved. These reports
tended to focus on four key areas: transparency and accountability, strengthening national financial systems, management of crises, and debt relief. The
following sections deal with each in turn.
Transparency and Accountability. Market-based transactions work best
when parties are fully informed. Absence of important information on the
part of the lender or the borrower in a transaction can lead to less than efficient outcomes (a finding recognized in the work of the most recent Nobel
laureates in economics). Thus reform proposals have called for additional
transparency and accountability both on the part of countries receiving
capital flows and on the part of the IFIs themselves. In response, the IMF has
established the Special Data Dissemination Standard to facilitate the flow of
information from countries. In addition, the IMF has encouraged the publiChapter 7

| 285

cation of documents related to its surveillance (the annual Article IV consultations on each member’s economic policies) and of the supporting
documents submitted by the country and the IMF when a financial assistance program is put in place and reviewed. Over the last year, 45 percent of
the full Article IV consultation reports were made publicly available.
Strengthening National Financial Systems. Several of the crises of the 1990s
involved lax practices in the financial and corporate sectors of borrowing
economies (see the 1999 Economic Report of the President). As a result, calls
for the reform of the international financial system have included measures
to strengthen national financial systems through the implementation of best
practices in financial regulation. To meet these needs, the G-7 authorized the
creation of the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) as a way to coordinate the
activities of finance ministries, central banks, financial regulators from key
economies, the IFIs, and international standard-setting bodies such as the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Organization
of Securities Commissions. The FSF identified key standards and codes for
countries’ financial systems and has worked toward fostering their implementation. Beginning in May 1999, the IMF and the World Bank
introduced the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and a key
byproduct, the Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSCs), in order to assess countries’ implementation of these standards. As
of September 30, 2001, 57 countries had undergone review of their
standards and codes, and reports for 36 had been published. As of the same
date, 22 FSAPs had been completed, with 4 assessments published. The IMF
has identified 11 main standards and codes that will be addressed in the
ROSCs, including the Basel Committee’s Core Principles for Effective
Banking Supervision.
Management of Crises. As noted earlier, resolving the capital account crises
of the second half of the 1990s required much larger IMF programs and
caused a dwindling in available liquidity. One aspect of reform efforts was
therefore the decision to increase IMF resources in 1998. The IMF resolution required that new commitments by member countries to the IMF be
$89 billion. In February 1999 the United States increased its share by
$15 billion. For crises affecting the global financial system as a whole rather
than that of an individual country, additional funds are available to the IMF
through borrowing agreements with a number of IMF members and other
institutions. Provisions for a New Arrangement to Borrow (NAB) were
agreed to in 1998, to supplement the existing General Arrangement to
Borrow (GAB). At the end of 2001, total resources available to the IMF
stood at $125 billion, of which $43 billion was available under the GAB and
NAB facilities.
Steps were also taken to shorten the response time of IMF programs and
to restructure programs to ensure that countries do not become overly
286 | Economic Report of the President

dependent on IFI resources. In 1997 the Supplemental Reserve Facility
(SRF) was created, providing another type of loan arrangement for IMF
programs. Explicitly short-term in nature (loans are expected to be paid back
in 12 to 18 months and required to be paid back in 24 to 30 months) and
carrying a higher interest rate than the more traditional stand-by arrangement, the SRF was designed to create incentives that would favor its use only
by truly illiquid borrowers. Essentially solvent countries that have
temporarily lost liquidity could afford the higher interest rates and would be
able to repay any loan in a shorter period. Countries that have more fundamental problems would have recourse to programs with loans that would be
paid back over a longer period.
To shorten response times, the IMF in 1999 created the Contingent
Credit Line (CCL), a facility that allows countries with sound policies to
prequalify for a line of credit that would protect against contagion in a
systemic crisis. (Contagion refers to a sudden cutoff of private capital inflows
to one country in response to a crisis in another.) Despite subsequent modifications to the terms of the facility, to date no countries have chosen to
participate. This lack of interest appears to relate to the stigma that might
be associated with seeking a CCL. Countries may worry that their pursuit
of a CCL might be taken by market participants as a signal of problems in
the country.
The extent to which the private sector should be involved in any solution
to financial crises has been the most contentious issue in discussions of international financial system reform. Private sector involvement is generally
taken to mean some sort of burden sharing or participation on the part of
private creditors in the provision of financing to a country in crisis. Such
burden sharing could be a formal part of the official program to aid the
country. For example, IFI financing for the second program for the Republic
of Korea in 1997 included an agreement by commercial bank creditors to
extend the maturity of their loans to Korea. Burden sharing could also come
about through a reduction in the value of private sector claims against the
distressed country; a reduction in principal was part of Ecuador’s restructuring of its debt, for example (Box 7-2). Absent such commitments by
private creditors, policymakers worry that crisis financing provided to a
country by the official sector may only serve to reduce the losses that private
sector creditors would otherwise bear. This might encourage lenders to
behave less prudently in the future, raising the moral hazard concerns
discussed above.
In September 2000 the IMF released a framework for advancing the
discussion on private sector involvement. The framework encourages countries and private lenders to make every effort to forestall crises through a
variety of measures. Borrowers and lenders are to use information provided
under the transparency and accountability initiatives discussed above, as well
Chapter 7

Box 7-2. Crisis and Restructuring in Ecuador
Ecuador’s experience in 1999 and 2000 presents an interesting case,
in that during this time it became the first country to default on Brady
bond obligations. (Brady bonds were issued by 18 governments
between 1990 and 1997 under a plan proposed by the then-Secretary of
,
the Treasury. The Brady Plan offered a means for sovereign countries to
restructure past-due loans extended to them by commercial banks, by
converting the loans to bonds.) Ecuador’s decision to default was not
taken lightly and was explained by dire economic circumstances.
Output had stagnated in 1997 and had fallen sharply in 1998 because of
declining oil revenue and agricultural and coastal infrastructure
damage due to the El Niño effect. Many firms came under financial
pressure, compounding difficulties in the banking sector. Over the first
half of 1999, real GDP fell at an annual rate of 15.4 percent.
The decline in economic activity made it difficult for Ecuador to
service its external debt. Ecuador’s poor prospects, and financial
markets that were destabilized by the Russian default in 1998,
precluded new private lending. In late August 1999 Ecuador announced
it would defer a coupon payment on PDI (past-due interest) Brady
bonds, but in September Ecuador made payment on its discount
Brady bonds. Creditors disliked the idea that Ecuador had tried to limit
default to one type of Brady bond, and shortly thereafter bondholders
accelerated their claim for full payment of outstanding interest and
principal on all Brady bonds. As a result, Ecuador defaulted on its other
Brady bonds and its Eurobonds as well.
At the same time, the IMF announced it would approve a stand-by
arrangement if Ecuador would make certain recommended changes
to its economic policies and pursue good-faith efforts to reach a
collaborative agreement with its creditors. However, no agreement
was reached. To facilitate restructuring of the debt, Ecuador established
a consultative group consisting of representative institutional bondholders. The group was given economic and financial information,
which was simultaneously made public. No confidential economic
information was shared with the group, nor was any information about
the terms of the planned restructuring. Although there were many
one-on-one meetings between the Ecuadorian authorities and major
bondholders, in general there were no large-scale negotiations with
the bondholders. Unfortunately, this process failed to provide a meaningful forum. With the rapid turnover of finance ministers and a lack of
political consensus, it was hard for Ecuador to sustain a dialogue until
political stability was restored.

Box 7-2.—continued
Consultations continued over the next several months with no
progress. Private investors expressed concern that Ecuador had shown
little willingness to engage in open dialogue or negotiations, and about
the slow pace of progress. In January 2000 President Jamil Mahuad
announced that Ecuador would convert its monetary base from the
local currency, the sucre, to the U.S. dollar and adopt the dollar as the
country’s official currency (the sucre had depreciated more than 65
percent in 1999). Shortly thereafter, Vice President Gustavo Noboa
assumed the presidency after President Mahuad was deposed in a
popular uprising. President Noboa continued with dollarization, with

announced, which was funded by the IMF the World Bank, the Inter,

to resolve the banking crisis, and to strengthen the public finances.
In mid-May 2000 the Ecuadorian authorities held an open meeting
with bondholders to discuss the country’s economic prospects. IMF
staff also attended and presented key features of the new economic
program. Bondholders received the details with interest, and in
August, 98 percent of them accepted a debt exchange offer. A combination of exit consents and cash incentives provided the motivation to
accept the package. (Exit consents allow the majority of bondholders to
exercise their power to amend old debt just before these creditors
leave the old debt and accept the new debt. This provides an incentive
for all other holders to come along with them.) With the exchange,
Ecuador reduced the face value of its debt by roughly 40 percent, realizing
a projected cash flow savings of $1.5 billion over the succeeding 5 years.
Since the restructuring of its debt and the implementation of the IMF
program, Ecuador’s economy has recovered strongly. Real GDP growth
for the year ending in the third quarter of 2001 was 5.0 percent.
Dollarization pushed inflation down from 91 percent in 2000 to 22
percent at the end of 2001. Interest rates on 10-year bonds were
roughly 12 percentage points above those on U.S. Treasuries at the end
of 2001, down from 46 percentage points at the height of the crisis in
September 1999. Although the banking system has improved, there is
room for further reform, such as implementation of key Basel principles. Analysts point to restructuring nonperforming loans and
additional structural economic reforms as keys to further boosting
economic activity in Ecuador.

as to maintain continuing dialogues, perhaps through the establishment by
borrowing countries of investor relations offices. The IMF itself, in July
2000, formed the Capital Markets Consultative Group to enhance communication with the private sector. Lenders are also encouraged to promote the
inclusion of collective action clauses in future bond issues (discussed further
below), to allow for easier coordination of creditors in the event of a crisis.
The framework stresses that, should a crisis develop, voluntary solutions
between debtors and creditors are to be preferred over involuntary solutions
that involve unilateral actions. In most cases, it is hoped that policy adjustments and temporary official financing will suffice to restore an economy to
sustainability. In a minority of cases, however, the official sector is envisioned
as encouraging creditors to reach voluntary agreements to help overcome
their coordination problems.
In some such cases, the country may have no choice but to suspend
payments on its debt. The IMF has reaffirmed its policy of “lending into
arrears” in such cases, that is, providing lending to countries that are experiencing debt-service difficulties before those difficulties are fully resolved.
Lending into arrears is to be decided on a case-by-case basis and is to occur
only where prompt IMF support is considered essential for a successful
adjustment program, and the country is pursuing appropriate policies and is
making a good-faith effort to reach a collaborative agreement with its creditors. This policy came into play in the case of Ecuador’s 1999 default,
mentioned above.
Debt Relief. Finally, reform efforts have also included addressing the debt
burdens of the poorest countries. After some gradual efforts in the late 1980s
and early 1990s, the IMF and World Bank executive boards, at the request of
the G-7, agreed in 1996 to launch the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) initiative. This initiative marked the first time that multilateral, Paris
Club, and other official bilateral and commercial creditors joined in an
effort to reduce the external debt of the world’s poorest and most debtburdened countries. (The Paris Club is the voluntary gathering of
governments of creditor countries willing to treat in a coordinated way the
bilateral debt due them by developing-country borrowers.) The HIPC
initiative is funded by both bilateral and multilateral creditors. Originally,
41 countries were identified as candidates for the program, and so far 24 of
these have debt relief agreements in place. To qualify for assistance under the
HIPC initiative, a country must meet three conditions: it must have a low
enough income per capita to qualify for concessional lending from the IMF
and the World Bank; it must have an unsustainable debt burden even after
the exhaustion of available debt-relief mechanisms; and it must have demonstrated a commitment to economic reform and poverty reduction with a
track record of good performance and drawn up a Poverty Reduction
290 | Economic Report of the President

Strategy Paper (PRSP) showing how the country intends to use debt relief to
improve living standards for its poor.
The first 3 years of the initiative did not prove as productive as had been
hoped: only seven countries qualified during that time. In September 1999
the program was enhanced to provide deeper and faster debt reduction. The
HIPC initiative will allow 24 countries to reduce the net present value of
their debt by a total of $22 billion—roughly half of what they owe—and
when combined with traditional debt relief and additional bilateral debt
forgiveness, it will reduce their debt by almost two-thirds. The IMF and the
World Bank expect average social spending in the HIPCs to increase by
45 percent in 2001-02 from 1999 levels, with savings from HIPC debt relief
accounting for a sizable proportion of this increase. In 2001-02 these countries
are expected to spend three times more on social services than debt service.

Critiques of Reform Efforts
As the above discussion makes clear, many changes have been made to the
international financial system over the past 7 years in an effort to improve its
stability and performance. However, fundamental problems remain, and
new proposals have been put forward by both private sector and public sector
entities. Critiques of the efforts to date can be broken down into the same
four key areas discussed above: transparency and accountability, strengthening
national financial systems, management of crises, and debt relief.
Reform efforts appear to have made the most progress in enhancing
transparency and accountability and strengthening national financial
systems. Nevertheless, several complaints have been raised. With regard to
accountability, critics often raise objections to “mission creep” on the part of
the IFIs, which can lead to an overlap of efforts that hinders accountability.
Without a precise understanding of each IFI’s responsibilities, it is difficult to
judge the degree to which each IFI is accomplishing its objectives. The IMF
draws on its expertise to consult and provide helpful advice on such matters
as the appropriate stance of monetary and fiscal policy as well as the related
choice and operation of an exchange-rate regime. At the same time, the
MDBs have considerable expertise in development issues, both at the individual project level and in providing fundamental public goods such as
health and education. Most recently, the MDBs have contributed substantial
sums to programs for such middle-income economies in crisis as Argentina
and Turkey, which, until their crises broke, had benefited greatly from private
capital inflows. The MDBs should not be used as a source of immediate
emergency financing. Rather, their role in crisis countries is to provide
support to address longer term policies and institutional capacity building, to
help cushion the impact of crises on the poor.

Chapter 7

| 291

Thus almost all observers have argued for a clearer delineation of the IFIs’
responsibilities, allowing each institution to focus on its core mission and
expertise. Mission creep into other areas only serves to divert scarce expertise
away from its best use. The IFIs have responded to this criticism and have
taken steps to better coordinate their assistance, most noticeably through
joint participation in the preparation of ROSCs and FSAP reports.
Progress on transparency has also been uneven, both on the part of
borrowing countries and on the part of the IFIs. As mentioned earlier, the
IFIs have made great strides in making information available to the public;
nonetheless, market participants remain critical of what they regard as the
scant and untimely release of information from the official sector during
crisis resolution and negotiations. These criticisms have been directed toward
the IFIs and even more pointedly toward the Paris Club. Without sufficient
information and coordination, private creditors worry that their claims on a
borrowing country will be treated less favorably than the claims of government and other official creditors. The Paris Club has begun taking steps to
improve information flow, with the launch of a website disclosing the terms
of debt restructurings and other information. The Paris Club has also initiated a dialogue with private sector creditor organizations in an effort to
improve communication.
Efforts to strengthen national financial systems have focused on using
agreed standards and codes aimed at implementing best practice in financial
regulation. This effort has been judged quite promising, although implementation remains an area of concern. In particular, it may be expensive for
developing economies to find and develop the expertise necessary to observe
the standards and codes. For example, recruiting, training, and retaining
skilled bank examiners may be difficult. The standards also require certain
supporting institutions. In a country where the rule of law is weak, it may be
difficult for financial examiners to make a real difference in financial institutions’ practices. Finally, there has been some concern over the appropriate
body to judge an economy’s compliance with a standard. Local authorities
may be too prone to find their own country’s institutions in compliance, and
the same might be true for IFIs that happen to be lenders to the country.
There is no reason why private markets could not provide the necessary evaluation of compliance; indeed, this option has been advocated by many but
has not yet been fully realized.
Efforts to reform the management of financial crises have generated the
most criticism and the most additional proposals. The criticisms have
focused on essentially two areas: the structure of IFI programs, and mechanisms for facilitating private sector involvement. Much attention has been
paid to the conditions imposed on borrowing countries as part of IFI lending
programs, called “conditionality.” Some observers have argued that such
conditions have too often involved overly restrictive austerity policies, which
292 | Economic Report of the President

have deepened economic slumps and postponed recovery. IMF programs
during the East Asian crisis, which required fiscal austerity of economies, are
often cited in this context. Critics have also argued that IMF programs
should have allowed for more accommodative monetary policies, on grounds
that high interest rates made it harder for debtors to service their debt,
heightening investors’ concerns and worsening the economic downturn.
However, the IMF still argues that high interest rates, in relation to both
expected inflation and interest rates on U.S. dollar-denominated assets, were
necessary to stabilize currencies, whose depreciations also made it difficult for
debtors to service their foreign currency-denominated debt.
According to another view, IFI programs too often went beyond
macroeconomic (fiscal and monetary) conditions to impose unnecessary
structural economic reforms. This view claims that the problems of debtor
countries largely require macroeconomic solutions, and that therefore it is
reasonable for the IFIs to insist on macroeconomic performance criteria to be
met as a condition for loan disbursements. But in the late 1990s, some
observers feel, the IMF often overstepped these bounds—and its own expertise—by placing too much emphasis on micromanagement of the recipient
economies. An often-cited example is the Indonesian program, which
required the elimination of the Clove Marketing Board and changes in the
structure of the sugar, flour, and cement markets. Defenders of the existing
approach have responded that, without a change in structural conditions,
changes in macroeconomic policies are likely to have little effect. They also
note that involvement of the MDBs in crisis lending provides whatever
microeconomic and structural expertise is required. In any case, in response
to these criticisms, the IMF has recently sought to streamline the conditionality attached to its lending programs, and to focus that conditionality on
core macroeconomic and financial concerns.
Frustration with a lack of progress in some countries, as evidenced by
repeated IMF programs over a prolonged period, raises another issue
concerning the structure of these programs. For example, since 1980 the
Philippines has been under six IMF programs, with disbursements made in
17 of the past 21 years. This example raises the concern that more attention
should be paid to the nature of the crisis facing an economy. It may be necessary to tailor program lending differently for liquidity crises than for
insolvency crises. In a liquidity crisis, where an otherwise healthy borrower is
incapacitated by a cutoff in private financing, programs would appropriately
involve short-term lending at penalty interest rates, to encourage and facilitate the borrower’s quick return to private capital markets. In the case of an
insolvent borrower, in contrast, where private funds are cut off because of
poor economic prospects, the IFIs should not provide financing to avoid a
debt restructuring. However, in such cases the IMF may still have a role in
helping to support the country and facilitate the rebuilding of reserves, as
Chapter 7

| 293

happened in Ecuador (see Box 7-2). Although the IFIs have different types of
lending facilities for each of these two purposes, the repeated occurrence of
“crises” in some economies suggests that sufficient attention was not paid to
the possibility that recipients were insolvent rather than illiquid.
The issue of private sector involvement in the resolution of crises remains
the most contentious, as evidenced by a recent flurry of proposals and
analysis. Proposals to enhance private sector involvement range from the very
modest (limiting involvement to the voluntary modification of sovereign
bond contracts), to somewhat structured proposals involving standstills
(temporary suspension of debt service), to formal proposals calling for an
international recognition of standstills in a manner similar to an international
bankruptcy proceeding.
Many observers, including the IMF, continue to urge that new sovereign
bond issues include collective action clauses. One type of clause allows for a
majority or supermajority of creditors to make changes in the financial terms
of a bond’s contract; bonds issued under United Kingdom law typically
contain such provisions. These clauses attempt to foster an orderly negotiation process that would allow the debtor country to reach agreement with its
creditors on a restructuring that permits a return to a sustainable situation.
However, many sovereign bonds are issued under jurisdictions, including
that of New York, where collective action clauses are not customary. These
bonds often require the unanimous approval of creditors to modify the
payment terms. In this situation, a single holdout creditor, in hopes of
obtaining more favorable treatment than the other creditors, can block a
restructuring that is in the best interest of both the creditors and the debtor.
It remains a bit of an economic mystery why more recently issued bonds do
not include less restrictive collective action clauses; empirical work finds that
borrowers do not face a higher interest rate on instruments that have this
flexibility. One explanation may be simple inertia.
The modification of sovereign bond contracts in a sense represents an
attempt to facilitate restructuring of private debt by creating an appropriate
legal framework. Two other ideas have been advanced along the same lines.
One proposal calls for more widespread use of rollover clauses in lending
contracts, representing a precommitment by lenders that could be invoked
during a crisis. This proposal would make automatic the rollover of bank
loans like that negotiated in the case of Korea in 1997. Another recent
proposal would generate private sector involvement before a crisis, by taxing
the stock of cross-border claims to create a fund that could then be used for
lending in the event of a crisis. All cross-border investors would thus
contribute to the resolution of a country’s crisis.
A recent joint proposal from the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England
advocates the use of standstills by insolvent debtor economies. The proposal
calls for tight limits on IMF lending for all but exceptional cases, in an
294 | Economic Report of the President

attempt to force a distinction between insolvent and illiquid borrowers. A
borrower that could not meet its obligations through this limited IFI support
would declare a payment standstill and begin negotiations with its creditors
on a debt restructuring. This would put the borrower in violation of the
payment terms of its loan agreement, opening the door to legal action by
creditors that might disrupt the negotiations. However, the proposal argues
that fears of such disruption are overstated. Private creditors find it difficult
to execute judgments against a sovereign borrower, especially when the
borrower does not have readily identifiable assets, such as those of stateowned enterprises, outside its borders. Critics of the proposal counter that
the cloud of legal action could nevertheless weigh on negotiations during the
standstill, especially if cooperative creditors fear that any new payment
arrangements agreed to could be subject to attachment by holdout creditors.
The recent experience with the holdout creditor Elliott Associates in the case
of Peru is cited in this regard (Box 7-3).
At roughly the same time that the Bank of England/Bank of Canada
proposal was announced, the First Deputy Managing Director of the IMF
called for a framework that would create the analogue of bankruptcy at the
sovereign level, providing legal protection for a necessary restructuring. The
proposal cites specifically the troubling implications of the Peruvian case.
Legal protection from holdout creditors would be offered under two conditions: the country must be negotiating in good faith with its creditors to
restructure its debt burden, and it must agree to follow sound policies to
avoid similar problems in the future. The proposal also envisions that participating borrowing countries would likely impose temporary exchange
controls, to ensure that capital did not flee the country while negotiations
with creditors were under way. The protection from litigious creditors, in
effect a formal standstill, would be sanctioned by the IMF and would have
legal standing in national courts.
Implementation of the IMF proposal might take many years, because the
IMF’s Articles of Agreement would have to be amended, as might national
legal codes around the globe. Some criticism of the proposal has focused on
the impracticality of implementing these changes. Other critics argue that
because the IMF might well be one of the creditors in the case, an IMFsanctioned standstill would create a potential conflict of interest. (In
domestic bankruptcy cases, the judge who presides over the resolution may
not be one of the creditors of the troubled firm.) Other observers, however,
note that any internationally sanctioned proceeding would not be able to
remove the “management” of the debtor economy (that is, its government),
also unlike in domestic bankruptcy proceedings. In that case involvement of
an official creditor, such as the IMF, that can impose conditions on new
lending programs may make sense. In any event, the IMF proposal has
generated a great deal of interest and calls for further study.

Box 7-3. Elliott Associates versus Peru
In October 1995 Peru announced an arrangement under the Brady
Plan (see Box 7-2) to restructure loans extended to two Peruvian banks
that had been guaranteed by the government in 1983. The plan culminated in November 1996 with 180 creditors agreeing to exchange the
old debt for a combination of Brady bonds and cash. Under the agreement, coupon payments on the new Brady bond were to begin in
March 2000, with the second coupon to be paid in September 2000.
From January through March 1996, as details of the plan were being
negotiated, Elliott Associates, an investment fund specializing in the
purchase of securities of distressed debtors, bought Peruvian bank
loans with a face value of $20.7 million for $11.4 million. After sending
a formal notice of default on the bank loans, and shortly before the
Brady exchange, Elliott Associates filed suit in New York State’s
Supreme Court seeking payment. Elliott did not participate in the Brady
exchange, thus becoming a “holdout creditor. Elliott’s suit was
”
removed to Federal district court where, after a trial, the claim was
dismissed in August 1998.
In dismissing Elliott’s claim, the district court ruled that Elliott had
purchased the Peruvian bank debt with the intent and purpose of
bringing suit. This was found to be a violation of Section 489 of the
New York Judicial Law, which is based on the long-standing legal
concept of champerty. (Champerty is defined as maintaining a suit
primarily in return for a financial interest in the outcome.) However, in
October 1999 the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the
district court’s ruling. The case was remanded to the Federal district
court, which in June 2000 awarded Elliott a judgment of $55.7 million,
representing principal and past-due interest on the bank claims.
To enforce this judgment, Elliott sought to attach the September 7,
2000, coupon payment that was to be made to the creditors that had
participated in the Brady exchange. Elliott obtained a restraining order
to prevent the New York fiscal agent for the Brady bond from making
the coupon payment, and the firm tried to obtain a similar order
against the European fiscal agent. After arguing in the Belgian courts
without Peru’s attorneys present, Elliott was granted the restraining
order on appeal on October 5, 2000. By this time Peru was close to
defaulting on the Brady bond, as the 30-day grace period for the
coupon due on September 7 had almost expired. Rather than default,
Peru settled with Elliott by paying the firm $56.3 million (the judgment
amount of $55.7 million plus interest). Thus the case was not litigated
to a conclusion, leaving market participants uncertain about any precedents that the case might have set.
continued on next page...

296 | Economic Report of the President

Box 7-3.—continued
In issuing the restraining order, the Belgian court accepted the
argument that, by paying the Brady bondholders but not paying Elliott,
Peru would violate the pari passu clause in the bank loans held by
Elliott. (The Latin phrase pari passu means “with equal step” or “side
by side. ) The court interpreted the pari passu clause as meaning that if
”
a debtor does not have enough money to pay its creditors in full, they
all should be paid on a pro rata basis. This interpretation has proved
controversial, however, with some legal scholars arguing that the
clause relates only to the act of subordinating one class of creditors to
another and should not be interpreted so as to force pro rata
payments. These scholars base their arguments on the interpretation of
pari passu clauses in domestic corporate bankruptcies.
This case is economically important for the effects it might have both
on other developing economies’ attempts to restructure their debt and
on future capital flows to these economies. The incomplete resolution
of the case leaves open the possibility that other creditors might follow
the example of Elliott Associates in holding out on future debt restructurings by developing economies—and that they might succeed. In
particular, some argue that the Belgian court’s acceptance of Elliott’s
pari passu argument could complicate Argentina’s current effort to
restructure its debt. Creditors may hesitate to participate in any restructuring offers if they believe that holdout creditors might be able to
attach payments or even get paid in full. Most observers argue that
the relative balance of power between creditors and distressed sovereign borrowers would have been unchanged had the pari passu
argument failed.
With regard to future capital flows, the concern is that if Peru had
prevailed in the case on its champerty defense, it could have made it
easier for sovereign countries to default on their debt. In that event,
creditors might have contemplated curtailing lending to developing
economies, or charging a higher interest rate. The Second Circuit Court
of Appeals decision cited these concerns in overturning the district
court’s champerty finding. In any event, both market participants and
legal scholars agree that a final legal resolution of the issues raised in
this case would eliminate a source of uncertainty now complicating
transactions in the market for developing-country debt.

Chapter 7

| 297

Finally, with regard to debt relief, although the HIPC initiative has already
provided significant relief, it will not ensure a lasting exit from debt problems
unless the countries receiving relief sustain growth far in excess of their
historical averages. Real GDP growth in 22 eligible HIPCs averaged only
3.1 percent from 1990 through 1999, yet the IMF projects that they will
grow at an annual rate of 5.6 percent from 2000 through 2010. Skeptics find
little reason to be so optimistic, as many of these countries were already on
IMF programs and receiving disbursements to begin with. If growth falls
well short of the IMF’s projections, it could be difficult for these countries to
reduce their debt burden, even with HIPC debt relief. Most of the HIPCs
depend heavily on exports of a narrow base of primary commodities, such as
coffee or cotton, to service their external debt. Commodity prices can be
quite volatile, leaving these countries vulnerable to price shocks. What might
help this situation is if the industrial economies, which now spend $360
billion a year on subsidies to protect their own agricultural sectors, lowered
these barriers to trade, thereby allowing the HIPCs and other developing
countries to diversify their export base.

Advancing International Financial System Reform
The need for continued reform of the international financial system has
generated a rich debate. Clearly, the benefits of global economic integration
must be made available to all the world’s citizens, and the support of the official sector is key to ensuring the smooth operation of the global trading and
financial systems that underpin continued integration. At the same time, it
must be recognized that official sector resources are finite and do not come
out of thin air. Resources may be provided in the form of loans to developing
economies, but these resources still come from public funds. As such, they
are obtained from taxpayers across the globe and have an opportunity cost in
terms of other governmental priorities. Both of these considerations argue
for a careful assessment of costs and benefits when designing and using the
international financial system.
With these ideas in mind, a set of principles for the IFIs can be identified.
First, all of the above arguments and examples point to the need to differentiate between those countries that are temporarily illiquid and those that are
insolvent. Although this distinction can be difficult in practice, it is crucial
for good stewardship of official sector resources. Shortening the maturity of
official loans may help make this distinction. Some observers have claimed
that short maturities for official loans are too constraining, arguing that it is
hard to help an economy by extending a loan that must be repaid in 12 to 18
months. However, if it is clear that such a loan is unlikely to be repaid, then
it is more likely that the economy is insolvent rather than just illiquid. An
illiquid economy should be able to regain access to capital markets in this
298 | Economic Report of the President

period of time; an insolvent economy will not be able to. Insolvent
economies require more drastic treatment, such as a restructuring of debt
obligations coupled with limited and longer term official sector lending
once the restructuring is well under way.
Official funding can also be leveraged with private sector involvement.
Future design changes to the international financial system must continue to
focus on incentive mechanisms that encourage involvement of the private
sector. Financing that is dedicated to encouraging a voluntary restructuring is
one example of such a mechanism. Such financing can serve as a catalyst in
returning a troubled economy to a sustainable footing.
In the first half of the 1990s, a set of International Development Goals
were developed from agreements and resolutions adopted at world conferences hosted by the United Nations. The goals found a new expression in the
Millennium Declaration of the United Nations in September 2000. Most of
the world’s poorest countries, particularly those in Sub-Saharan Africa, are
falling well behind in achieving these International Development Goals in
basic education, health, and poverty reduction. The President has called for a
bolder move away from loans toward grants for the poorest countries. This
approach, coupled with the progress under the HIPC initiative, holds the
promise of higher living standards for the least fortunate, as it would facilitate
productivity-enhancing investments without adding to their debt burden. In
addition, grants to the poorest economies should be targeted toward those
basic needs, such as education and health, that are vital to a growing and
vibrant economy. In particular, grants can lead toward a redirection of
resources to combating scourges such as HIV/AIDS that tear at the very
fabric of society.
Consistent with the Administration’s efforts to shift the MDBs’ emphasis
toward grants for low-income countries is its continued efforts to make these
institutions more efficient and more focused on productivity growth in
developing countries as a core objective. Careful selection of programs and a
greater attention to results are the two key principles underpinning the U.S.
MDB reform exercise. This means that the MDBs must do a much better
job in sharpening the focus of their activities, concentrating on basic development work and working collaboratively among themselves and with other
donors to ensure a development framework that is consistent and efficient.
The United States has also accorded particular importance to a
comprehensive review of the pricing of MDB loans, to explore the possibility
of greater differentiation of lending terms. Price differentiation is crucial to
achieve greater lending selectivity based on differences in the development
impact of individual operations and in borrowers’ income per capita and
creditworthiness, with preferential treatment for priority core social investments.

Chapter 7

| 299

Finally, tying official support to efforts at creating trade can dramatically
leverage any financial assistance provided to illiquid economies. As this
chapter has made clear, trade is a powerful engine for economic growth and
improvements in living standards. If assistance packages allow an economy
both to regain access to capital flows and to invigorate trade flows, all of the
developing world will share in the improvement of world living standards.

Conclusion
International flows of resources, goods, and services have played an
increasingly important role in the world economy. The citizens of the United
States, living in one of the most open economies in the world, have seen their
well-being improve dramatically with this increased economic integration. So
have the citizens of many other countries that were willing to open their
borders to flows of goods, services, and capital. The gains from trade are the
result of an improved allocation of resources. A more efficient global allocation of productive inputs such as capital and labor translates into an increase
in global output and consumption.
To ensure that economic integration continues, constant attention must be
devoted to the institutional infrastructure that supports market-based
exchanges of goods, services, and capital. The past year has witnessed signs of
a slowing global economy, as well as violent threats to the freedom that is
essential to a well-functioning economic system. These dangers make it
more important than ever to ensure continued progress toward the free flow
of resources and output across national borders.
It is therefore critical that the United States remain an active leader in the
continued liberalization of trade in goods and services, both on a bilateral
and on a multilateral basis. At the same time, the United States must
continue to encourage efforts to strengthen the international financial system
that supports production-enhancing cross-border flows of capital. Strong
U.S. leadership on both these fronts will help safeguard and enhance both
our own economic prospects and those of the rest of the world.

Report to the President on the
Activities of the Council of Economic
Advisers During 2001
The Council of Economic Advisers was established by the Employment Act
of 1946 to provide the President with objective economic analysis and advice
on the development and implementation of a wide range of domestic and
international economic policy issues.

The Chairman of the Council
The membership of the Council of Economic Advisers changed in 2001,
following the inauguration of the new President. The President nominated
R. Glenn Hubbard to be Chairman of the Council on April 23, 2001. He was
confirmed by the Senate on May 10, 2001, and was appointed by the
President on May 11, 2001, as Chairman. He succeeds Martin N. Baily, who

Dr. Hubbard is on a leave of absence from Columbia University, where he

In addition to his responsibilities at Columbia and the National Bureau of

Dr. Hubbard is responsible for communicating the Council’s views on

informal meetings with the President. He also travels within the United States
and overseas to present the Administration’s views on the economy. Dr. Hubbard
is the Council’s chief public spokesperson. He directs the work of the Council
and exercises ultimate responsibility for the work of the professional staff.

The Members of the Council
Mark B. McClellan was nominated by the President on June 5, 2001,
confirmed by the Senate on July 19, 2001, and appointed by the President as

From 1999 to 2000, Dr. McClellan was Associate Professor of Economics at

policy development on a wide range of domestic policy issues.
Randall S. Kroszner was nominated by the President on November 5, 2001,
confirmed by the Senate on November 28, 2001, and appointed by the

306 | Economic Report of the President

The Chairman and the Members work as a team on most economic policy
issues. Dr. Hubbard was primarily responsible for the Administration’s
economic forecast, macroeconomic analysis, budget and taxation policy,
retirement security, and international financial issues. Dr. Kroszner’s portfolio
included international economic issues and certain microeconomic issues,
including those relating to the environment and costs of regulation. Dr.
McClellan was primarily responsible for policy analysis relating to labor, health
care, welfare reform, and child and family issues.

Macroeconomic Policies
As is its tradition, the Council devoted much time during 2001 to assisting
the President in formulating economic policy objectives and designing
programs to implement them. In this regard the Chairman kept the President
informed, on a continuing basis, of important macroeconomic developments
and other major policy issues through regular macroeconomic briefings. The
Council prepares for the President, the Vice President, and the White House
senior staff almost daily memoranda that report key economic data and
analyze current economic events. In addition, they prepare weekly discussion
and data memos for the Vice President and senior White House staff.
The Council, the Department of the Treasury, and the Office of Management
and Budget—the Administration’s economic “troika”—are responsible for
producing the economic forecasts that underlie the Administration’s budget
proposals. The Council, under the leadership of the Chairman and the
Members, initiates the forecasting process twice each year. In preparing these
forecasts, the Council consults with a variety of outside sources, including
leading private sector forecasters.
In 2001 the Council took part in discussions on a range of macroeconomic
issues, with particular focus on tax and budget policy. The Council engaged in
discussions with other agencies concerning taxation and its effects on the U.S.
economy. The Council works closely with the Office of Management and
Budget, the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the National Economic
Council, as well as other government agencies, in providing analyses to the
Administration on these topics of concern.
The Council continued its efforts to improve the public’s understanding of
economic issues and of the Administration’s economic agenda through regular
briefings with the economic and financial press, frequent discussions with
outside economists, and presentations to outside organizations. The Chairman
also regularly exchanged views on the macroeconomy with the Chairman of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

International Economic Policies
The Council was involved in a range of international trade issues, including
discussions about a new work program for the World Trade Organization,
steel trade issues, trade adjustment assistance, and negotiations for new freetrade areas. In addition, the Council participated in international finance
discussions involving Argentina, Brazil, Japan, and Turkey.
The Council is a leading participant in the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), the principal forum for economic
cooperation among the high-income industrial countries. The Chairman
heads the U.S. delegation to the semiannual meetings of the OECD’s
Economic Policy Committee (EPC) and serves as the EPC Chairman as well
as Chairman of the Ad Hoc Group on Sustainable Development. Dr.
McClellan led the U.S. delegation to the OECD’s Working Party 1, which
focused on a variety of microeconomic issues, such as lifetime learning. In
2001 Dr. Kroszner participated in the OECD’s Working Party 3 meetings on
macroeconomic policy and coordination. He also participated in the annual
review of U.S. economic policy. The Council was an active participant in these
committees, working on a variety of issues including economic policy, tax policy,
sustainable development, international financial markets, and labor issues, such
as the interaction between product and labor markets. The Council provided
both analytical support and policy guidance.
Council members regularly met with representatives of the Council’s
counterpart agencies in foreign countries, as well as with foreign trade ministers, other government officials, and members of the private sector. In 2001
Dr. Kroszner participated in the U.S.-Japan Economic Sub-Cabinet dialogue,
part of the U.S.-Japan Economic Partnership for Growth. During the year the
Council represented the United States at other international forums as well,
including meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

Microeconomic Policies
A wide variety of microeconomic issues received Council attention during
2001. The Council actively participated in the Cabinet-level National
Economic Council, dealing with such issues as problems in the agricultural
sector, climate change, unemployment insurance, health policy, energy policy,
and financial markets and institutions. Dr. McClellan was extensively involved
in formulating policy concerning Medicare reform, the Patients’ Bill of Rights,
tax credits for health insurance, and exploring ways to reduce the cost of
pharmaceuticals. Dr. Kroszner participated in a series of discussions on environmental policies and industry-specific issues. In the aftermath of the
terrorist attacks on September 11, Council members and staff analyzed the
effects on the airline and insurance industries, including the challenges of the
provision of terrorism reinsurance, as well as cost-effective measures to combat
bioterrorism.

General Notes
Detail in these tables may not add to totals because of rounding.
Because of the formula used for calculating real gross domestic product (GDP),
the chained (1996) dollar estimates for the detailed components do not add to the
chained-dollar value of GDP or to any intermediate aggregates. The Department
of Commerce (Bureau of Economic Analysis) no longer publishes chained-dollar
estimates prior to 1987, except for selected series.
Unless otherwise noted, all dollar figures are in current dollars.
Symbols used:
p Preliminary.
... Not available (also, not applicable).
Data in these tables reflect revisions made by the source agencies through January 2002. In particular, tables containing national income and product accounts
(NIPA) estimates reflect revisions released by the Department of Commerce in
July 2001.

1 Inventories at end of quarter. Quarter-to-quarter change calculated from this table is not the current-dollar change in private inventories
component of GDP. The former is the difference between two inventory stocks, each valued at its respective end-of-quarter prices. The latter
is the change in the physical volume of inventories valued at average prices of the quarter. In addition, changes calculated from this table
are at quarterly rates, whereas change in private inventories is stated at annual rates.
2 Inventories of construction, mining, and utilities establishments are included in ‘‘other’’ inventories through 1995.
3 Quarterly totals at monthly rates. Final sales of domestic business equals final sales of domestic product less gross product of households and institutions and of general government and includes a small amount of final sales by farm and by government enterprises.
Note.—The industry classification of inventories is on an establishment basis. Estimates through 1995 are based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). Beginning 1996, estimates are based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

5 Not strictly comparable with earlier data due to population adjustments as follows: Beginning 1953, introduction of 1950 census data
added about 600,000 to population and 350,000 to labor force, total employment, and agricultural employment. Beginning 1960, inclusion of
Alaska and Hawaii added about 500,000 to population, 300,000 to labor force, and 240,000 to nonagricultural employment. Beginning 1962,
introduction of 1960 census data reduced population by about 50,000 and labor force and employment by 200,000. Beginning 1972, introduction of 1970 census data added about 800,000 to civilian noninstitutional population and 333,000 to labor force and employment. A subsequent adjustment based on 1970 census in March 1973 added 60,000 to labor force and to employment. Beginning 1978, changes in sampling and estimation procedures introduced into the household survey added about 250,000 to labor force and to employment. Unemployment
levels and rates were not significantly affected. Beginning 1986, the introduction of revised population controls added about 400,000 to the
civilian population and labor force and 350,000 to civilian employment. Unemployment levels and rates were not significantly affected.
Beginning 1990, the introduction of 1990 census-based population controls, adjusted for the estimated undercount, added about 1.1 million to the civilian population and labor force, 880,000 to civilian employment, and 175,000 to unemployment. The overall unemployment rate
rose by about 0.1 percentage point.
Beginning 1994, data are not strictly comparable with earlier data because of the introduction of a major redesign of the Current Population Survey and collection methodology.
Beginning 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 data are not strictly comparable due to the introduction of revised population controls. See February
issues Employment and Earnings for details on the effects. Also, for 1998, data reflect the introduction of a new composite estimation procedure for the Current Population Survey.
Beginning 2001, data reflect minor revisions to population controls. See The Employment Situation release of February 2, 2001.

Note.—Labor force data in Tables B-35 through B-44 are based on household interviews and relate to the calendar week including the
12th of the month. For definitions of terms, area samples used, historical comparability of the data, comparability with other series, etc., see
‘‘Employment and Earnings.’’

1 CPI-U-X1 is a rental equivalence approach to homeowners’ costs for the CPI-U for years prior to 1983, the first year for which the official
index incorporates such a measure. CPI-U-X1 is rebased to the December 1982 value of the CPI-U (1982-84=100) and is identical with CPI-U
data from December 1982 forward. Data prior to 1967 estimated by moving the series at the same rate as the CPI-U for each year.
2 CPI research series using current methods (CPI-U-RS) introduced in June 1999. Data for 2001 are preliminary. All data are subject to revision annually.

6 Since July 19, 1975, the daily effective rate is an average of the rates on a given day weighted by the volume of transactions at these
rates. Prior to that date, the daily effective rate was the rate considered most representative of the day’s transactions, usually the one at
which most transactions occurred.
7 From October 30, 1942, to April 24, 1946, a preferential rate of 0.50 percent was in effect for advances secured by Government securities maturing in 1 year or less.

1 In the old series, ‘‘income taxes’’ refers to Federal income taxes only, as State and local income taxes had already been deducted. In the
new series, no income taxes have been deducted.
2 Annual data are average equity for the year (using four end-of-quarter figures).
3 Beginning 1988, profits before and after income taxes reflect inclusion of minority stockholders’ interest in net income before and after
income taxes.
4 Data for 1992 (most significantly 1992:I) reflect the early adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 106 (Employer’s
Accounting for Post-Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions) by a large number of companies during the fourth quarter of 1992. Data for
1993:I also reflect adoption of Statement 106. Corporations must show the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first
quarter of the year in which the change is adopted.
Note.—Data are not necessarily comparable from one period to another due to changes in accounting principles, industry classifications,
sampling procedures, etc. For explanatory notes concerning compilation of the series, see ‘‘Quarterly Financial Report for Manufacturing,
Mining, and Trade Corporations,’’ Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census.

1 Farm population as defined by Department of Agriculture and Department of Commerce, i.e., civilian population living on farms in rural
areas, regardless of occupation. See also footnote 8. Series discontinued in 1992.
2 Total population of United States including Armed Forces overseas, as of July 1.
3 Includes persons doing farmwork on all farms. These data, published by the Department of Agriculture, differ from those on agricultural
employment by the Department of Labor (see Table B-35) because of differences in the method of approach, in concepts of employment, and
in time of month for which the data are collected.
4 Prior to 1982 this category was termed ‘‘family workers’’ and did not include nonfamily unpaid workers.
5 Acreage harvested plus acreages in fruits, tree nuts, and vegetables and minor crops.
6 Fertilizer, lime, and pesticides.
7 Includes purchases of broiler- and egg-type chicks and turkey poults and livestock imports for purposes other than immediate slaughter.
8 Based on new definition of a farm. Under old definition of a farm, farm population (in thousands and as percent of total population) for
1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1983 is 7,806 and 3.6; 8,005 and 3.6; 7,553 and 3.4; 7,241 and 3.2; 7,014 and 3.1; 6,880 and 3.0;
7,029 and 3.0, respectively.
9 Basis for farm employment series was discontinued for 1981 through 1984. Employment is estimated for these years.

Note.—Population includes Alaska and Hawaii beginning 1960.
Sources: Department of Agriculture (Economic Research Service) and Department of Commerce (Bureau of the Census).

1 End-use

categories beginning 1978 are not strictly comparable with data for earlier periods. See Survey of Current Business, June 1988.

Note.—Data are on an international transactions basis and exclude military.
In June 1990, end-use categories for goods exports were redefined to include reexports; beginning with data for 1978, reexports (exports of
foreign goods) are assigned to detailed end-use categories in the same manner as exports of domestic goods.
Data beginning 1989 reflect end-use commodity reclassifications. See Survey of Current Business, July 2001.

1 Department of Defense shipments of grant-aid military supplies and equipment under the Military Assistance Program are excluded from
total exports through 1985 and included beginning 1986.
2 F.a.s. (free alongside ship) value basis at U.S. port of exportation for exports and at foreign port of exportation for imports.
3 Beginning 1989, exports have been adjusted for undocumented exports to Canada and are included in the appropriate end-use categories.
For prior years, only total exports include this adjustment.
4 Total includes ‘‘other’’ exports or imports, not shown separately.
5 Total arrivals of imported goods other than intransit shipments.
6 Total includes revisions not reflected in detail.
7 Total exports are on a revised statistical month basis; end-use categories are on a statistical month basis.
Note.—Goods on a Census basis are adjusted to a BOP basis by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, in line with concepts and definitions
used to prepare international and national accounts. The adjustments are necessary to supplement coverage of Census data, to eliminate
duplication of transactions recorded elsewhere in international accounts, and to value transactions according to a standard definition.
Data include trade of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Foreign Trade Zones.

1 Prior

to 1991 data are for West Germany only.
2 Civilian unemployment rates, approximating U.S. concepts. Quarterly data for France and Germany should be viewed as less precise indicators of unemployment under U.S. concepts than the annual data.
3 There are breaks in the series for Canada (1990), Germany (1983 and 1991), France (1992), Italy (1986, 1991, and 1993), and United
States (1990 and 1994). Also, for Italy, data reflect new estimation procedures and updated population data introduced in July 1999. For details on break in series in 1990 and 1994 for United States, see footnote 5, Table B-35. For details on break in series for other countries, see
Comparative Civilian Labor Force Statistics, Ten Countries, U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, March 2001.
4 Hourly compensation in manufacturing, U.S. dollar basis. Data relate to all employed persons (wage and salary earners and the selfemployed) in the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, and United Kingdom, and to all employees (wage and salary earners) in
Italy. For Canada, France and United Kingdom, compensation adjusted to include changes in employment taxes that are not compensation to
employees, but are labor costs to employers.
